  "text": "Here’s the latest.China, Canada and Mexico responded angrily on Tuesday to steep new tariffs imposed by President Trump, setting off a day of retaliatory actions, stern warnings and falling stock prices as the potential ramifications of an escalating trade war began to sink in.Stung by the tariffs — an additional 10 percent on imports from China and 25 percent on almost all imports from Canada and Mexico — prompted Canada and China to quickly announce retaliatory actions, including measures that could bar some American products from their markets entirely and hit U.S. farmers particularly hard. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, labeled Mr. Trump’s move “very dumb” in comments addressed directly to the president, and Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said that her government would announce its own countermeasures on Sunday.Stock markets in the United States and Europe fell amid the uncertainty, reflecting mounting investor concerns. Worries about a nascent global trade war have been compounded by the Trump administration’s decision to suspend military aid to Ukraine.Analysts and experts around the world, including a top Federal Reserve official, shared warnings about higher prices, supply-chain interruptions and slower growth, and some Republicans in Congress expressed hope that the tariffs were only temporary. Mr. Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, even suggested in an afternoon television interview that the tariffs might be rolled back as soon as Wednesday.The president, however, showed no signs of retreat.After Mr. Trudeau harshly condemned the tariffs in a televised address and said that Canada would “relentlessly fight” to protect its economy, Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media in which he threatened to answer any new Canadian tariffs with even higher U.S. measures.“Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada,” Mr. Trump wrote, employing his frequently used jab at the prime minister, “that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!” China responded with official action: 15 percent tariffs on imports of chicken, wheat, corn and cotton from the United States, as well as 10 percent tariffs on imports of U.S. sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables and dairy products. Canada also responded, immediately imposing 25 percent tariffs on $20.5 billion in U.S. goods and announcing that the tariffs would extend to $85 billion more in 21 days.But Mr. Trudeau, in his news conference, left no doubt that he saw the move against Canada as a kind of territorial aggression; Mr. Trump has repeatedly suggested that Canada should become part of the United States. “What he wants to see is a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that’ll make it easier to annex us,” Mr. Trudeau said, adding: “That’s never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state.”He said that he would meet Tuesday afternoon with other Canadian officials to discuss the country’s response, including levying additional tariffs on U.S. exports and potentially canceling contracts for U.S. businesses.Here’s what you need to know:Markets drop: In New York, the Dow continued to tumble, losing more than 600 points on the day — and more than 1,300 since Monday. European stock markets also fell on Tuesday. Shares in European carmakers that have big manufacturing operations in Mexico were pummeled, too, and analysts at Barclays predicted the tariffs “could wipe out effectively all profits” for G.M., Ford and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler and Jeep.Consumer pain: The chief executive of several major retailers said their prices would increase as a result of the tariffs, and the prices of gasoline and electricity were also expected to rise, perhaps sharply, analysts said.Mexico responds: President Sheinbaum said on Tuesday that her government rejected the Trump administration’s assertion that Mexico’s government had failed to crack down on cartels that export drugs including fentanyl to the United States, calling it “offensive, defamatory and without substance.” Mr. Trump has characterized the latest tariffs as a response to what he deems a lack of action on such issues. Ms. Sheinbaum said Mexican officials had a call with Mr. Trump scheduled for Thursday. China’s influence: China’s country’s status as the top overseas market for American farm products gives it considerable influence over prices and demand in the commodities markets of the Midwest. Besides placing levies on U.S. food imports, China has halted the sale of its goods to 15 American companies. But a trade war comes with serious risks for China.At a downtown Toronto branch of Ontario’s main liquor distributor, all California wines were removed from the shelves, and staff members were also removing bottles of U.S. bourbon. Earlier Tuesday, Doug Ford, Ontario’s premier, announced that the province, Canada’s most populous, would pull all U.S. alcoholic drinks from the locally controlled distributor, L.C.B.O., or Liquor Control Board of Ontario, a measure that will cost U.S. producers about $700 million annually. ImageCredit...Matina Stevis-GridneffEven as he said in a Fox News interview that President Trump might roll back some of his tariffs as soon as Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added that the Trump administration was still considering other trade-related tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which would be announced April 2. He cited Canada’s sales tax and tariff on dairy products as evidence of unfair behavior. “There’s USMCA with a lot of cheating on the side,” Lutnick said. “The Canadians like to cheat.” Tariffs in Trump’s second term in office As of March 3 Source: Peterson Institute for International Economics, Wells Fargo Economic Insights The New York Times AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Fox News that Trump would “work something out” with Canada and Mexico on tariffs and announce it on Wednesday. Lutnick said the Canadians and Mexicans were on the phone with him all day “trying to show that they’ll do better, and the President’s listening.”“I think he’s going to figure out, you do more, and I’ll meet you in the middle some way, and we’re going to probably be announcing that tomorrow,” Lutnick said.Lutnick said the president was looking carefully at people who were trying to follow USMCA, the trade agreement he negotiated and signed in his first term. “The president is considering giving you relief if you live under those rules,” Lutnick said. “If you haven’t lived under those rules, well, then you got to pay the tariff.”Mexico gave Trump much of what he wanted in a drug and border crackdown. Tariffs came anyway.ImageMexican Army soldiers in Culiacán, the capital of the Mexican state of Sinaloa, last month. Mexico stepped up activity against drug cartels in the state after facing the threat of tariffs from President Trump in February.Credit...Daniele Volpe for The New York TimesFacing the threat of tariffs from President Trump after he took office, Mexico bent over backward to comply with his demands.Almost immediately, the government moved to secure its northern border, severely stanching migration to the United States. Then it hunted cartel leaders in a dangerous fentanyl stronghold. And just last week, in a once-in-a-generation move, it delivered into U.S. custody 29 of the country’s most powerful drug lords.But even after all of that, Mr. Trump imposed the tariffs anyway, shaking global markets. The move left officials in both countries baffled about what the White House was trying to accomplish and frantically asking the same question: What was Mr. Trump’s endgame?Even some people close to the president seem to disagree on the answer.Some outside advisers predict that the tariffs, which are currently at 25 percent on most imports from Mexico and Canada, will result in a steady stream of revenue for the United States.Others maintain that they are Mr. Trump’s attempt to shake up the global order and flex his muscles on the world stage.Many believe that the president, who has seen trade deficits as a crisis for decades, is simply trying to follow through on a threat that he has dangled over Mexico for months. By pressing forward, they say, Mr. Trump is seeking to ensure that he is seen as tough among world leaders as he pushes his foreign policy agenda in other global hot spots, including Gaza and Ukraine.Mr. Trump had initially announced the tariffs shortly after taking office. But he delayed their imposition right before they were to take effect in early February, after speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada. He gave them about another 30 days to show results.On Monday, the White House said that the tariffs were going forward because both Mexico and Canada had “failed to adequately address” the flow of drugs into the United States, noting that the cartels have “an intolerable relationship with the government of Mexico.”That statement prompted some experts in Mexico to theorize that perhaps Mr. Trump wanted Mexico to go harder after politicians accused of corruption.“Trump keeps insisting on this point, and Sheinbaum has done absolutely nothing on those links,” said Eduardo Guerrero, a security analyst based in Mexico City.Still, there was little more to go on than theories at this stage. And regardless of what Mr. Trump’s actual motivations might be, his decisions have resulted in a state of confusion and frustration on both sides of the border.Two Mexican officials said that they had reached a limit on what they were able to offer in an effort to avoid the tariffs, and that it was unclear what more Mexico could have done on security. They cautioned, though, that they still had very little understanding of what else Mr. Trump might want.Mr. Trump’s moves have also bewildered some American officials who have worked for years on issues related to drug cartels. They expressed concern that without a clear path forward, the tariffs could jeopardize any future security cooperation with Mexico, according to two people familiar with the matter.Even some within the Trump administration recognized that the imposition of the tariffs may have finally exhausted the Mexican government’s willingness to work with the United States and that the country may have little additional capacity to deliver further wins.But even though there was some internal pushback about the tariffs, Mr. Trump’s advisers no longer voice the sort of robust disagreement on what he wants that they did during his first term.ImageCars waiting in traffic to cross into the United States from Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, on Friday. Mr. Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on Mexico has resulted in confusion and frustration on both sides of the border.Credit...Alejandro Cegarra for The New York TimesThe puzzlement about the tariffs was being felt even after high-level meetings last week in Washington between a delegation from Mexico and senior U.S. officials to hammer out a security agreement between the two countries.The goal of the talks from the Mexican perspective was to avoid the tariffs altogether by reaffirming Mexico’s desire to work in concert with the United States on cracking down on the cartels and stemming the flow of illicit drugs across the border.U.S. officials used the talks as the backdrop to reveal a secretive but spectacular development they hoped would appeal to Mr. Trump. Just before the delegation left Washington, Mexican officials announced that they were delivering into U.S. custody dozens of cartel leaders and were even speeding up the process of turning them over by skirting their country’s normal extradition laws.That move, lauded as a win for Mr. Trump, was widely viewed as one of the most important efforts by Mexico in decades to send drug traffickers to face charges in American federal courts. While the deal was based on negotiations that had started during the last administration, it was hastily concluded by diplomats and law enforcement officials in time to be ready for the meetings last week, according to the people familiar with the matter.Those expelled from Mexico were some of the most powerful and violent cartel leaders in the country’s history.Among them was Rafael Caro Quintero, a Sinaloa cartel figure who masterminded the torture and murder of Enrique Camarena, an agent for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration who was working under cover in Guadalajara in 1985.Mexico also released into American hands Miguel Ángel Treviño Morales, a former leader of the Zetas cartel, which helped perfect the practice of using carnage as a message.The handovers were just one in a series of concessions by Mexico.Since Mr. Trump first started floating the idea of tariffs in November, the Mexican government has intensified its military crackdown in Sinaloa state, a major hub of fentanyl production. The region is the home base of the Sinaloa cartel, which the U.S. government blames for much of the synthetic opioids flooding over the border.A slew of arrests, drug lab raids and fentanyl seizures have struck at the core of cartel operations in Culiacán, the state capital of Sinaloa, prompting some producers to shut down manufacturing of the drug altogether, according to interviews with six cartel operatives.Ms. Sheinbaum announced the deployment of 10,000 National Guard troops at the border in early February, as Mexico and the United States have ratcheted up enforcement measures that have contributed to a plunge in illegal crossings. Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, announced last week that only 200 people had been apprehended at the southern border one Saturday in February, which she said was the lowest daily figure in more than 15 years.The tariff announcement on Monday was met with shock in Mexico, but experts said it was unlikely that even after what was seen as unfair punishment, Ms. Sheinbaum would shut down collaboration on security issues. The risks, they said, were simply too high.“While she’s a very nationalist and leftist woman, she’s also very pragmatic in terms of her relationship with the U.S.,” Mr. Guerrero said. “If that relationship goes badly, it would be a disaster for her government.”Markets in New York have closed. The S\u0026P 500 fell as much as 2 percent, before moderating losses in the afternoon and ending the day down 1.2 percent. The day’s selling was broad based, with roughly 80 percent of the stocks in the S\u0026P 500 lower for the day.ImageCredit...Sarah Yenesel/EPA, via ShutterstockThat was true even after a mini afternoon rally, with that recovery propelled by some of the largest tech companies like Nvidia and Alphabet, which have a large impact on the overall index’s value because of their size. Out of 11 sectors, tech was the only one to end the day higher, and it was up by only a fraction of a percentage.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTJohn C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said at an event hosted by Bloomberg that the central bank was paying close attention to how the new tariffs would affect economic activity, including whether businesses continued to invest and consumers continued to spend. The Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady at the current range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent at its next policy meeting, set for later this month. Williams said there was no need to “change it right away,” and that the economy was in a “very good place.”A global trade war raises fears of higher inflation and slower growth.ImageTrucks near the U.S.-Mexico border at the Otay Commercial crossing in Tijuana, Mexico, on Tuesday.Credit...Guillermo Arias/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesEconomists have been bracing for tariffs ever since President Trump won the election last year. But the measures he took on Tuesday against the United States’ closest trading partners far exceeded what they expected, raising the risks of a much more significant blow to the economy.For a period of time, it was not entirely clear whether Mr. Trump would follow through on threats to impose new tariffs on the country’s three largest trading partners, Canada, Mexico and China. Many economists, policymakers and even administration officials had talked about the levies as simply negotiating tools that could be used to extract better terms from other countries.But on Tuesday, a 25 percent tariff on nearly all imports from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10 percent tariff on imports from China went into effect. Even now that the tariffs are in place, a number of experts still question how long they will last given their potential to significantly damage an otherwise solid economy.Economists this week published a raft of new estimates that sought to capture how bad the damage could be.One of the biggest concerns is how tariffs will impact price pressures that have yet to be fully extinguished in the aftermath of the worst inflation shock in decades following the pandemic. Consumer price growth remains higher than officials at the Federal Reserve, who are responsible for keeping inflation low and stable, want it to be. For them to lower interest rates, they want to be certain that inflation is coming back down to its 2 percent target.Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI, an investment advisory firm, warned that if these tariffs were maintained, it would increase the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge by roughly half a percentage point by the final quarter of the year. That gauge — the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices — stood at 2.6 percent as of January.The impact could persist into next year, Mr. Guha warned, forecasting an additional 0.2 percentage point bump in core P.C.E. inflation in 2026.Another concern is what these tariffs may mean for economic growth. The last time there was a global trade war stewarded by Mr. Trump, growth fears edged out those related to inflation. The reason was partly because price pressures at that time were, if anything, too low rather than too high. Moreover, companies responded to the uncertainty by pulling back, lowering business activity and raising the prospects of a much sharper slowdown. That prompted the Fed to lower interest rates in 2019 to safeguard the economy.This time around, Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, expects that if the tariffs are maintained and retaliation ensues, as has already started, the growth in gross domestic product will be a full percentage point lower than it would otherwise have been. That would suggest the U.S. economy would only grow 1 percent in 2025. Over the course of 2024, it grew 2.5 percent.Ms. Bostjancic also estimates that what households end up spending on everyday items will increase on average by around $1,000 annually as a result of the tariffs.“Part of the negative impact on economic activity stems from the drop in business, consumer and investor confidence, as the consensus view was that tariffs would be used as a threat and negotiating tool, instead of being implemented,” she said. “The deterioration in confidence could very well lead businesses to pare or at least delay investments and new hires, consumers to delay purchases, and for financial risk assets, such as equities, to decline or increase in volatility.”This dynamic will further complicate the Fed’s already tough task of trying to figure out when or whether to restart interest rate cuts. John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said there was no need to change the central bank’s policy settings “right away,” suggesting officials will opt against taking any action at their upcoming meeting later this month.Mr. Williams, who casts a vote at every meeting, warned that tariffs would likely lead to higher U.S. prices but that the magnitude of the impact was highly uncertain.The impact of tariffs on inflation may start to show up “later this year,” he said at an event hosted by Bloomberg. Mr. Williams stressed that the Fed was also paying close attention to how tariffs will impact economic activity, including if businesses continue to invest or if consumers continue to spend. “That’s where I think another big uncertainty is.”At least right now, he said the economy was in a “very good place.” Financial markets are now pricing in three rate cuts this year, one more than expected at the start of Trump’s second term in office.Speaking at a House hearing on Tuesday, Mike Konczal, an economic official under the Biden administration, added that the extreme uncertainty surrounding Mr. Trump’s tariff plans would also be detrimental.“That kind of policy uncertainty is very poor for investments, very poor for growth,” he said. With “prices increasing at a period where consumers and everyday people are much more sensitive to prices than they may have been in more recent decades, I do worry it will feed into inflation expectations.”‘A fight with no winners’: Trudeau, on his way out of office, sharply rebukes Trump over tariffs.VideotranscripttranscriptTrudeau Calls U.S. Tariffs on Canada, ‘A Very Dumb Thing To Do’Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was visibly angry as he responded on Tuesday to President Trump’s tariffs against Canada, blaming the president for the potential economic burden on both Americans and Canadians.Canadians are reasonable and we are polite, but we will not back down from a fight — not when our country and the well-being of everyone in it is at stake. At the moment, the U.S. tariffs came into effect in the early hours of this morning, and so did the Canadian response. Canada will be implementing 25 percent tariffs against $155 billion worth of American goods, starting with tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately, and tariffs on the remaining $125 billion of American products in 21 days time. Now, it’s not in my habit to agree with The Wall Street Journal. But Donald, they point out that even though you’re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do. I want to speak first, directly, to the American people. We don’t want this. We want to work with you as a friend and ally. And we don’t want to see you hurt either. But your government has chosen to do this to you. Markets are down, and inflation is set to rise dramatically all across your country. Your government has chosen to put American jobs at risk at the thousands of workplaces that succeed because of materials from Canada, or because of consumers in Canada, or both. They have chosen to raise costs for American consumers on everyday essential items like groceries and gas, on major purchases like cars and homes and everything in between. What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy. Because that will make it easier to annex us, is the second half of his thought. Now first of all, that’s never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state. Because when it comes to defending our great nation, there is no price we all aren’t willing to pay.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was visibly angry as he responded on Tuesday to President Trump’s tariffs against Canada, blaming the president for the potential economic burden on both Americans and Canadians.CreditCredit...Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press, via Associated PressPrime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada rebuked President Trump directly on Tuesday over sweeping new tariffs and pledged to “relentlessly” battle to protect his country’s economy. “A fight with Canada will have no winners,” Mr. Trudeau said, just days before he is set to step down as prime minister.Speaking at a news conference in Ottawa, the Canadian capital, and flanked by senior members of his cabinet, Mr. Trudeau labeled a trade war between the North American neighbors “very dumb” and portrayed Mr. Trump’s motives in attacking Canada, one of the United States’ closest allies, as furthering the territorial aggression that the American president has repeatedly expressed toward its northern neighbor.“What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that’ll make it easier to annex us,” said Mr. Trudeau said, adding, “We will never be the 51st state.”“When it comes to defending our great nation, there is no price we all aren’t willing to pay,” he said.After U.S. tariffs of 25 percent on almost all Canadian goods took effect at midnight on Tuesday, Mr. Trudeau imposed retaliatory tariffs that amount to about $20.5 billion and has promised another $85 billion in tariffs in three weeks if the United States did not back down.Mr. Trudeau, whose country is home to the largest Ukrainian diaspora outside of Russia, also raised questions about Mr. Trump’s foreign policy priorities in pursuing a deal to end the war started by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.“Today, the United States launched a trade war against Canada,” he said. “At the same time, they’re talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin — a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense.”During Mr. Trump’s first term, Mr. Trudeau went out of his way to avoid publicly responding to taunts by Mr. Trump or publicly challenging the president’s exaggerations and false statements.But since Mr. Trump announced in November his plan to impose tariffs on Canada, as well as Mexico and China, Mr. Trudeau has adopted an increasingly aggressive tone, escalating his accusations in early January after announcing that he was would quit his post. That decision came in the context of a drastic decline in his popularity and political infighting in his Liberal party that led to the resignation of Chrystia Freeland, his finance minister and deputy prime minister.But the prime minister’s comments on Tuesday reflected the prevailing mood in Canada, where economic anxiety over the economic effects of American tariffs has sparked a surge of patriotism and widespread anger, and fueled boycotts of U.S. goods and travel.Mr. Trudeau repeatedly suggested that Mr. Trump was ignoring the wishes of Americans and not acting in their interest, a notable departure from the restraint Canadian leaders have long exercised in commenting on domestic American affairs.Directly addressing “the American people,” Mr. Trudeau said that the tariffs would increase their cost of living under undermine their security. “Your government has chosen to do this to you,” he said.On Russia, Mr. Trudeau asked, “How do Americans feel about jettisoning one’s friends and allies in favor of a country that has never wished Americans well and continues to act in ways that harm the global economy and specifically the American economy and American values and principles?”Mr. Trudeau suggested that he had been unable to speak with Mr. Trump since their last telephone call on Feb. 22.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBusiness leaders across Mexico have expressed dismay and shock on Tuesday at the stiff tariffs imposed by the United States, which many agreed could have a devastating impact on their country’s economy.José de Jesús Rodríguez, president of the chamber of commerce of Mexico City, predicted economic turmoil for Mexico, including a possible recession and unemployment of as much as 15 percent, given the deep integration of supply chains between Mexico and the United States. “It is extremely disappointing and frustrating,” he said. “The United States broke their word, and it dictates the future of our commercial relationship with the U.S., meaning it’s time for us to look to other regions.”Trump’s tariffs could strain the system that collects import duties.ImageStepping up enforcement efforts is likely to require that the Justice Department devote significantly more staff to pursuing tariff evasion cases.Credit...Ariana Drehsler for The New York TimesThe sweeping tariffs on Canadian, Mexican and Chinese products that President Trump imposed on Tuesday could strain the system that collects import duties and the government agencies that enforce those fees, trade and legal experts said.Collecting import duties is usually a routine task, but the new tariffs are being imposed on Mexican and Canadian goods, many of which have been imported into the United States duty-free for many years. Adding to the challenge is the sheer volume of goods subject to the new tariffs — U.S. imports from China, Mexico and Canada totaled over $1.3 trillion last year, or about two-fifths of all imports.The tariffs apply a 25 percent duty on goods from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10 percent on imports from China.Importers typically employ customs brokers to calculate and pay tariffs to the government agency that collects them, U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Adam Lewis, a co-founder and the president of Clearit, a customs broker, said that it would not be hard to tweak software to collect the new tariffs, but that a crucial part of the tariffs payment system might need significant adjustments. Importers must buy a “customs bond,” a type of insurance that guarantees the duties will be paid. Mr. Lewis said some customers might have to increase the size of their bonds to cover the extra tariff payments.“Many of their products were coming in duty-free, and all of a sudden there’s going to be a 25 percent increase,” he said. “It’s quite large.”In addition, policing importers for tariff evasion will now become a much bigger task for Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Justice. Some importers may try to avoid tariffs by understating the cost of goods in customs declarations or by falsely claiming they were imported from countries not subject to tariffs.“The greater the breadth and severity of these new tariffs, the greater the likelihood that at least some potential importers may want to misrepresent the value or the origin of their goods,” said Kirti Vaidya Reddy, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at the law firm Quarles.If the government finds that an importer has not paid duties, customs officials are likely to demand that the importer pay what is owed and a penalty that can double or even triple the amount due.In a statement, a customs agency spokeswoman said: “The dynamic nature of our mission, along with evolving threats and challenges, requires C.B.P. to remain flexible and adapt quickly while ensuring seamless operations and mission resilience. These tariffs will help maintain America’s global competitiveness and protect American industries from unfair trade practices.”Some evasion cases have become the subject of criminal prosecutions. Last year, a Miami importer pleaded guilty to participating in an import scheme involving Chinese truck tires that the Justice Department said had cost the United States more than $1.9 million in forgone tariff revenue.But stepping up enforcement efforts is likely to require that the Justice Department devote significantly more staff to pursuing tariff evasion cases, which, lawyers said, can take time to build.“The Department of Justice has the personnel and infrastructure to do it, but these cases are complex, transnational and document-heavy,” said Artie McConnell, a former federal prosecutor who is a partner at the law firm BakerHostetler. “You can’t rush it, and prosecutions likely won’t come quickly.”Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, says Trump’s tariffs “are oriented around specific objectives, in this case, to reduce the amount of fentanyl coming in this country, across our borders. And so these tariffs, I think, are hopefully temporary.”“Hopefully, when it’s all said and done, it won’t be something that will create a lot of disruption” to farmers in states like his, Thune said. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPrices at the gas pump in the Northeast could rise as much as 40 cents per gallon by mid-March because of the 10 percent tariff on energy imports from Canada that took effect today, according to Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. That’s because the region gets a substantial portion of its gasoline and diesel from a refinery in Canada, across the border from Maine. Consumers in the Midwest, where refineries are heavily dependent on Canadian oil, can expect a smaller increase in gasoline and diesel prices, in the ballpark of 5 to 20 cents per gallon, De Haan said.Tariffs will force U.S. oil refineries to pay more for Canadian crude oil.ImageBP’s refinery in Whiting, Ind., is among the U.S. refineries that are most dependent on Canadian oil.Credit...Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York TimesA BP refinery built around 1889 on the south shore of Lake Michigan, near Chicago, is a reminder of just how difficult it can be to undo the trade ties that bind the United States and Canada.No matter how much oil the United States pumps — and it already is the top producer in the world by far — its refineries were designed to run on a blend of different types of oil. Many cannot function well without the darker, denser, cheaper crude oil that is hard to find domestically.Canada is flush with that oil, known as heavy crude. And facilities like BP’s refinery in Whiting, Ind., were built around that supply.Companies have little reason to spend billions of dollars reconfiguring their systems for trade policy that may be fleeting. Not to mention there is uncertainty about the trajectory of global demand for gasoline and diesel, which some experts think could peak in the next decade as more people buy electric cars as well as trucks that run on natural gas and other fuels.Whiting, a facility of tanks, towers and more than 800 miles of pipelines, is among the U.S. refineries most dependent on Canadian oil. On any given day, between 65 percent and three-quarters of the crude flowing through it is of the dark, viscous variety found in the oil sands of Alberta.BP can tweak its recipe — but only so much. Too little of the viscous stuff and the company would need to cut back its production of the fuels that power cars, trucks and airplanes. “You can’t turn the Titanic on a dime, and the industry is kind of the same way,” said Rick Weyen, a retired refining executive who worked at the Whiting refinery in the 1980s and ’90s.In a concession to the oil industry, which was one of his biggest supporters in last year’s election, Mr. Trump said oil and other energy products imported from Canada would be subject to a 10 percent tariff, not 25 percent.At that level, some consumers may see gasoline prices rise, but analysts said much of the added cost would be absorbed by Canadian oil producers and U.S. refiners that are effectively locked into doing business with each other.The United Automobile Workers union hailed the new tariffs as step in the right direction to help workers. In a statement, the union said the North American Free Trade Agreement and its successor, the USMCA negotiated by Mr. Trump during his first term, have for decades caused losses of blue-collar jobs as companies moved production to Mexico and other countries.“Tariffs are a powerful tool in the toolbox for undoing the injustice of anti-worker trade deals,” the union said. “We are glad to see an American president take aggressive action on ending the free trade disaster that has dropped like a bomb on the working class.” The union added that it is in discussions with the White House and hopes to shape tariff policies in the coming weeks in ways that help factory workers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSpeaker Mike Johnson, at a news conference at the Capitol on Tuesday, said he supported President Trump’s initial round of tariffs, saying they were “not an adversarial thing.”“This is to continue good relationships and trade policies,” Johnson said. “I think this initiative will achieve that desired result. My suspicion is that there’s a country that’s charging us hypothetically 100 percent tariffs on imports, and we do the same? They will begin to lower those import tariffs pretty quickly, and you will get back to a point of equilibrium that does resemble free trade again. I think that’s good for the American people and for our country. And as the president said, just have a little patience with this. Let it play out, see how it develops, and I think at the end of the day America is going to be better off.”ImageCredit...Kenny Holston/The New York TimesPresident Trump, responding to Canada’s Trudeau with a post on his social media site, threatened to add a reciprocal tariff of a “like amount” in response to Canada’s retaliatory tariffs, suggesting he was open to an escalating tit-for-tat trade war. “Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada,” Trump wrote, using a favorite jab, “that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!”The furious reaction to Trump’s tariffs continues in Canada, and has not been limited to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or his party. “At 12:01am, President Trump stabbed America’s best friend in the back,” Pierre Poilievre, the leader of Canada’s Conservative Party, told reporters, projecting a message of unity and pitching his plan to fight back against the tariffs. Poilievre is a favorite, according to recent polls, to become Canada’s next leader.ImageCredit...Spencer Colby/EPA, via ShutterstockOther Canadian politicians are weighing in with retaliatory measures of their own. Tim Houston, the premier of Nova Scotia, said American companies would no longer be able to bid on provincial procurement contracts and could see their existing contracts cancelled. “Unfortunately, some people need to touch the hot stove to learn, and while we cannot control or predict their behaviour, we can control how we respond,” Houston said in a post on X. The White House says tariffs could be lifted once fentanyl deaths decline, a trend already underway.ImageMembers of the Mexican Army in Culiacán, Mexico, last month. The area is a hub of fentanyl production.Credit...Daniele Volpe for The New York TimesHoward Lutnick, the U.S. secretary of commerce, said in an interview on Tuesday that the tariffs President Trump imposed on Canada, Mexico and China could be lifted if those countries proved to Mr. Trump that they were stopping the flow of fentanyl and reducing the number of fatal fentanyl overdoses in the United States.“You’ve seen it: It has not been a statistically relevant reduction of deaths in America,” Mr. Lutnick said on CNBC. “It’s just black and white. And we told them it was outcome based.”But fentanyl-related overdose deaths have already been steeply declining over the past year, according to preliminary data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the Trump administration promoted just last week.Between September 2023 and September 2024, roughly 87,000 people died of drug overdoses, a decline of almost 24 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the most recent C.D.C. update. Around 55,000 of the deaths were attributed to synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, a decrease of around 30 percent.Overdose data lags by several months, as states confirm deaths and report them to the C.D.C., which then publishes national figures. Mr. Trump has suggested without evidence in recent weeks that the numbers are a significant undercount.“We lose 300,000 people a year to fentanyl,” Mr. Trump said at a cabinet meeting last week. “Not 100, not 95, not 60, like you read. You know, you’ve been reading it for years. We lost, in my opinion, over the last couple of years, on average, maybe close to 300,000 people dead, and the families are ruined.”The decrease in fentanyl overdoses, drug policy experts have said, has more to do with public health measures than changes in border policies. During the Biden administration, naloxone, an overdose-reversing medication, was approved for over-the-counter sales and became more widely available. Federal grants allowed communities to stockpile the rescue drug.Buprenorphine, a treatment for opioid addiction, has also been easier to find for some drug users, after some restrictions for prescribing it were lifted by Congress in 2022.While fentanyl causes the majority of fatal overdoses, other street drugs play a major role, including stimulants like methamphetamine and cocaine, and xylazine, an animal tranquilizer that can sedate a drug user for hours and does not respond to overdose reversal medication.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAirlines, which were already facing simmering concerns from investors, suffered steep stock losses amid fears that a trade war could slow the economy and rein in travel spending. “It’s a confluence of factors,” said Tom Fitzgerald, an airline industry analyst for the investment bank TD Cowen. “It tends to be a sector where investors sell first and ask questions later.”Auto industry stocks slumped Tuesday amid fears that tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada would wipe out profits from companies already struggling with tepid demand. Almost all automakers build vehicles in Mexico and Canada which they sell in the United States. None of them can afford to absorb the additional 25 percent tariffs and will be forced to pass most of it on to customers. The tariffs “could wipe out effectively all profits” for G.M., Ford and Stellantis, analysts at Barclays said in a report. Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler, Dodge and Ram vehicles, was among the hardest hit Tuesday, with its shares falling more than 7 percent in midday trading.ImageCredit...Ian Willms for The New York TimesBank stocks have traditionally been considered a bellwether for the economy because lenders make money when consumers feel comfortable enough to take on debt (think: credit cards, mortgages and corporate finance deals). The tariff news appears to be doing the opposite, with bank stocks down about 5 percent on Tuesday, per the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, triple the drop for the stock market overall. Banks with big international operations at risk of disruption, like Citi, are being pummeled in particular.The German stock exchange ended the day down 3.5 percent on the tariffs news, with automotive companies leading the plunge. The auto parts maker Continental dropped 11.6 percent, while BMW saw its shares drop 5.9 percent and Daimler Truck, which owns Freightliner and Thomas Built Buses, ended the day down 7.8 percent. All of the companies rely on production facilities in Mexico to help supply the U.S. market.ImageCredit...Michael Probst/Associated PressAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSenator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, tells reporters on Capitol Hill that he hopes that the tariffs won’t persist for an extended period of time. “Texas does an enormous amount of trade with both Mexico and Canada,“ Cruz said. “So my hope is these tariffs act as the incentive that President Trump said they were designed to be.”Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, said that he has ordered the removal of all U.S.-made liquor from the province-controlled alcohol distributor, cancelled the province’s contract with Elon Musk’s Starlink, and said he will write to all political leaders in New York State, Michigan and Minnesota, to warn them that if the tariffs persist, he intends to put a 25 percent surcharge on electricity exported to those states from Ontario.ImageCredit...Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press, via Associated PressPrime Minister Justin Trudeau’s remarks to Trump made it clear that he believes Canada’s traditional alliance with the United States has been broken. Trudeau was visibly angry as looked directly at the camera and addressed Trump repeatedly as “Donald” and called him out for betraying an ally while seeking closer relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Trudeau, who is expected to resign as Canada’s political leader early next week after his Liberal Party announces its new leader on Sunday, pledged to “relentlessly fight to protect our economy.” He also left no doubt that a trade war would be costly for both countries. “A fight with Canada will have no winners,” he said.ImageCredit...Spencer Colby/EPA, via ShutterstockTrudeau said it was difficult to determine Trump’s true intentions in imposing tariffs. “What he wants is to see is a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that’ll make it easier to annex us,” Trudeau said, adding: “First of all, that’s never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state.”VideoCreditCredit...Associated PressAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTTrudeau says the focus of his government will not be on managing the effects of the tariffs in the short term but on ending “this unjustified trade war that hurts Americans families and Canadian families.”VideoCreditCredit...Associated PressTrudeau addressed Trump directly in his remarks, calling him “Donald” and saying, “You’re a very smart guy, but this is a very dumb thing to do.”VideoCreditCredit...Associated PressAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMexico’s president rejects Trump’s tariffs and his characterization of her country.VideoPresident Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico said her government would impose countermeasures if President Trump’s 25 percent tariffs on Mexican goods remained in effect later in the week.CreditCredit...Alfredo Estrella/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesPresident Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico kept her silence overnight. But on Tuesday morning, she kicked off her daily news conference with a sharply-worded statement in which she said her government rejected President Donald Trump’s characterization of Mexico, and she roundly criticized the 25 percent tariffs that he imposed on it hours earlier.Ms. Sheinbaum said Mexican officials had a call with Mr. Trump scheduled for Thursday, and that if the tariffs remained in effect, Mexico would announce countermeasures, including retaliatory tariffs, on Sunday.“We don’t want to enter into a trade war,” she said. “That only affects the people.”After ticking off a list of Mexico’s recent successes in cracking down on drug trafficking and more — as Mr. Trump asked Mexico’s government to do to avert tariffs — Ms. Sheinbaum rejected what she called the “fentanyl argument” invoked by Mr. Trump to justify the imposition of the tariffs.“For humanitarian reasons,\" her statement said, “we cooperate to prevent the illegal trafficking of drugs into the United States. However, as we have stated on many occasions, the government of that country must also take responsibility for the opioid crisis that has caused so many deaths in the United States.”Her statement addressed what she said were her government’s actions in the areas that Mr. Trump said he wanted to see changes in, specifically the seizure of drugs and arms and the extradition to the United States of close to three dozen cartel leaders, which she said had been “recently transferred to the United States for the benefit of both countries’ security.”“We are emphatic,” Ms. Sheinbaum said. “There is no reason, justification, or excuse that supports this decision that will affect our people and nations. We have said it in various ways: cooperation and coordination, yes; subordination and interventionism, no. Mexico deserves respect.”She ended by urging her country to show unity in the face of the crisis. “I call upon the people of Mexico, all of you, to face this challenge together, to stay united,” Ms. Sheinbaum said. “I reiterate: it is time to defend Mexico and its sovereignty. We must stay alert and calm. Cool heads.”Picking fights with the world, Trump shows how far he is willing to take ‘America First.’ImageSince taking office, President Trump has picked fights with other nations that he believes are taking advantage of the United States.Credit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesOn the campaign trail, President Trump made no secret about how he would approach a second term: He would get tough with nations around the world, even friends and allies, that he believed were taking advantage of the United States’ economic and military might.The result — which has seemingly caught many international leaders off guard — has been a fraying of military alliances and aggressive tariffs against America’s closest neighbors.Gone is the alliance-first foreign policy of past administrations. The first weeks of the second Trump term have taken on the feel of America vs. the world.“The free world needs a new leader,” Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, wrote on social media after Mr. Trump clashed with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in the Oval Office last week. “It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.”Now Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs — 25 percent on most imports from Canada and Mexico and two rounds of 10 percent levies on imports from China — which he has said are punishment for their failure to stem the flow of drugs into the United States.The moves have quickly sparked a trade war: China and Canada retaliated immediately, imposing their own tariffs on U.S. goods on Tuesday. Mexico said it would announce its countermeasures, including retaliatory tariffs, on Sunday.The list of countries targeted by Mr. Trump has continued to grow. He has mocked Canada as the 51st state and called its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, a “governor.” (As a result, Mr. Trudeau’s low approval risings got a noticeable rise after Mr. Trump targeted the country.)He has threatened to seize the Panama Canal and annex Greenland from Denmark. He has frozen military aid for Ukraine as the country attempts to fight off a Russian invasion. He has cut off foreign aid that benefits countries throughout Africa, South America and Asia. Now he has imposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico.Some of his many threats may just be that — threats or negotiating tactics — but Mr. Trump has shown a willingness to follow through particularly when it comes to tariffs and withholding foreign aid.“It means uncertainty, because right now, it isn’t always clear what is a tactic and what is actually meant,” said Nicholas J. Cull, professor of public diplomacy at the University of Southern California. “So it’s very confusing for people, and I suspect that a lot of foreign policy is being played for domestic audiences to get cheers from the base and to keep people uncertain.”Slightly more Americans approve of Mr. Trump than disapprove after the first weeks in office of his second term, according to averages of polls. He will give a joint address to Congress this evening.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT",

But the measures he took on Tuesday against the United States’ closest trading partners far exceeded what they expected, raising the risks of a much more significant blow to the economy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a period of time, it was not entirely clear whether Mr. Trump would follow through on threats to impose new tariffs on the country’s three largest trading partners, Canada, Mexico and China. Many economists, policymakers and even administration officials had talked about the levies as simply negotiating tools that could be used to extract better terms from other countries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut on Tuesday, a 25 percent tariff on nearly all imports from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10 percent tariff on imports from China went into effect. Even now that the tariffs are in place, a number of experts still question how long they will last given their potential to significantly damage an otherwise solid economy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEconomists this week published a raft of new estimates that sought to capture how bad the damage could be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the biggest concerns is how tariffs will impact price pressures that have yet to be fully extinguished in the aftermath of the worst inflation shock in decades following the pandemic. Consumer price growth remains higher than officials at the Federal Reserve, who are responsible for keeping inflation low and stable, want it to be. For them to lower interest rates, they want to be certain that inflation is coming back down to its 2 percent target.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKrishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI, an investment advisory firm, warned that if these tariffs were maintained, it would increase the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge by roughly half a percentage point by the final quarter of the year. That gauge — the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices — stood at 2.6 percent as of January.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe impact could persist into next year, Mr. Guha warned, forecasting an additional 0.2 percentage point bump in core P.C.E. inflation in 2026.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother concern is what these tariffs may mean for economic growth. The last time there was a global trade war stewarded by Mr. Trump, growth fears edged out those related to inflation. The reason was partly because price pressures at that time were, if anything, too low rather than too high. Moreover, companies responded to the uncertainty by pulling back, lowering business activity and raising the prospects of a much sharper slowdown. That prompted the Fed to lower interest rates in 2019 to safeguard the economy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis time around, Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, expects that if the tariffs are maintained and retaliation ensues, as has already started, the growth in gross domestic product will be a full percentage point lower than it would otherwise have been. That would suggest the U.S. economy would only grow 1 percent in 2025. Over the course of 2024, it grew 2.5 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMs. Bostjancic also estimates that what households end up spending on everyday items will increase on average by around $1,000 annually as a result of the tariffs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Part of the negative impact on economic activity stems from the drop in business, consumer and investor confidence, as the consensus view was that tariffs would be used as a threat and negotiating tool, instead of being implemented,” she said. “The deterioration in confidence could very well lead businesses to pare or at least delay investments and new hires, consumers to delay purchases, and for financial risk assets, such as equities, to decline or increase in volatility.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis dynamic will further complicate the Fed’s already tough task of trying to figure out when or whether to restart interest rate cuts. John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said there was no need to change the central bank’s policy settings “right away,” suggesting officials will opt against taking any action at their upcoming meeting later this month.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Williams, who casts a vote at every meeting, warned that tariffs would likely lead to higher U.S. prices but that the magnitude of the impact was highly uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe impact of tariffs on inflation may start to show up “later this year,” he said at an event hosted by Bloomberg. Mr. Williams stressed that the Fed was also paying close attention to how tariffs will impact economic activity, including if businesses continue to invest or if consumers continue to spend. “That’s where I think another big uncertainty is.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt least right now, he said the economy was in a “very good place.” Financial markets are now pricing in three rate cuts this year, one more than expected at the start of Trump’s second term in office.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpeaking at a House hearing on Tuesday, Mike Konczal, an economic official under the Biden administration, added that the extreme uncertainty surrounding Mr. Trump’s tariff plans would also be detrimental.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“That kind of policy uncertainty is very poor for investments, very poor for growth,” he said. With “prices increasing at a period where consumers and everyday people are much more sensitive to prices than they may have been in more recent decades, I do worry it will feed into inflation expectations.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"live-blog-post\" data-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/04/us/tariffs-us-canada-mexico-china#trudeau-canada-tariffs-trump\" data-source-id=\"100000010030099\" role=\"article\" aria-posinset=\"58\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" aria-live=\"off\" aria-labelledby=\"post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2E2MzQxMjI3LTc2NjUtNTIwZS1iZWZkLWRiNmQzMTc4ZGFjNQ==\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"live-blog-byline\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/ian-austen\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Ian Austen\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/18/reader-center/author-ian-austen/author-ian-austen-thumbLarge.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/18/reader-center/author-ian-austen/author-ian-austen-thumbStandard.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/18/reader-center/author-ian-austen/author-ian-austen-thumbLarge.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp 150w\" sizes=\"40px\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlL2E2MzQxMjI3LTc2NjUtNTIwZS1iZWZkLWRiNmQzMTc4ZGFjNQ==\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#trudeau-canada-tariffs-trump\"\u003e‘A fight with no winners’: Trudeau, on his way out of office, sharply rebukes Trump over tariffs.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\" data-testid=\"VideoBlock\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eVideo\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv aria-labelledby=\"modal-title\" role=\"region\"\u003e\u003cheader\u003e\u003cp\u003etranscript\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003etranscript\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTrudeau Calls U.S. Tariffs on Canada, ‘A Very Dumb Thing To Do’\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch4\u003ePrime Minister Justin Trudeau was visibly angry as he responded on Tuesday to President Trump’s tariffs against Canada, blaming the president for the potential economic burden on both Americans and Canadians.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdl\u003e\u003cdt\u003e\u003c/dt\u003e\u003cdd\u003e\u003cp\u003eCanadians are reasonable and we are polite, but we will not back down from a fight — not when our country and the well-being of everyone in it is at stake. At the moment, the U.S. tariffs came into effect in the early hours of this morning, and so did the Canadian response. Canada will be implementing 25 percent tariffs against $155 billion worth of American goods, starting with tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately, and tariffs on the remaining $125 billion of American products in 21 days time. Now, it’s not in my habit to agree with The Wall Street Journal. But Donald, they point out that even though you’re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do. I want to speak first, directly, to the American people. We don’t want this. We want to work with you as a friend and ally. And we don’t want to see you hurt either. But your government has chosen to do this to you. Markets are down, and inflation is set to rise dramatically all across your country. Your government has chosen to put American jobs at risk at the thousands of workplaces that succeed because of materials from Canada, or because of consumers in Canada, or both. They have chosen to raise costs for American consumers on everyday essential items like groceries and gas, on major purchases like cars and homes and everything in between.

Mr. Lewis said some customers might have to increase the size of their bonds to cover the extra tariff payments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Many of their products were coming in duty-free, and all of a sudden there’s going to be a 25 percent increase,” he said. “It’s quite large.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, policing importers for tariff evasion will now become a much bigger task for Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Justice.
