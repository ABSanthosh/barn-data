Tillis, a noted Trump adversary, had been locked into a heated conflict with the president in the days before announcing his retirement.The North Carolina Senate race opened up after Republican incumbent Thom Tillis, a noted adversary of President Trump, announced he would not seek reelection. / REUTERS/Aaron P. BernsteinAfter the senator voted against, then lambasted Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” the president vowed to endorse any Republican who would challenge Tillis in the upcoming primary.While Trump won North Carolina in a landslide in 2024, Democrats saw Tillis’ retirement as an opportunity to flip his seat. Former Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, is expected to announce his candidacy on Monday.According to Politico’s report, the president is “optimistic” that Whatley’s connections to major party donors will help him secure the seat for Republicans.A native of Watuaga County, North Carolina, Whatley previously served as the chair of the state’s Republican Party until assuming his current role in March 2024.While Republicans courted Lara Trump and are now moving onto Whatley, Democrats hope former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper can flip the Senate seat. / Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesThe North Carolina race marks the third time Lara Trump, who previously served as Whatley’s RNC co-chair, has considered a Senate run.She initially considered entering the Republican primary to replace North Carolina Senator Richard Burr when he retired in 2022, but ultimately withdrew from contention.Two years later, the president briefly considered nominating his daughter-in-law to fill Marco Rubio’s senate seat, which he vacated to become secretary of state.She even resigned from her post as Whatley’s RNC co-chair in Dec. 2024, increasing speculation that she planned to take Rubio’s place. However, Trump publicly withdrew her name from consideration just two weeks later.Lara Trump, who married Eric Trump in 2014, now hosts a talk show on the Fox News Channel and occasionally releases Christian pop. / REUTERS/Carlo AllegriSince leaving the RNC, Trump, who shares two children with the president’s second son, has been tacitly exploring an entertainment career.In February, she began hosting the talk show My View with Lara Trump on the Fox News Channel. She has also started releasing original music, dropping her sixth Christian pop single just three days ago.",
