The gear shifter pierced his steel-toe boot and his helmet split from the impact of the crash.“There’s no steel toe left,” said his mother, Patsy, who asked to not use her last name. “There is a crack through it but the helmet saved his life.”But the video only tells part of the story. Patsy said the driver tried to run her son off the road several times as he rode to work before the motorcycle and Kia came into view of the dashcam.
