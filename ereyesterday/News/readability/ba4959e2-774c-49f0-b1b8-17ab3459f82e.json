  "text": "A South Korean navy plane crashed in the southeastern city of Pohang on Thursday, killing all four crew members on board, according to local media. The navy said the cause of the crash was under investigation.The plane took off from the an air base in the afternoon, local time, for takeoff and landing training, local news reported, and crashed on a nearby mountain just six minutes later. No civilians were reported dead or injured.Photos from the scene show scorched debris from the aircraft and firefighters surveying the damage. Videos and photos from news outlets captured black, billowing smoke against an otherwise clear sky.The P-3CK aircraft that crashed was one of eight of its kind operated by the South Korean navy, which said it would temporary halt all other P-3 flights. The navy said there were two commissioned officers and two noncommissioned officers on board. The bodies of all four have been recovered. The navy also said it would launch a task force to determine what caused the crash.The fatal crash comes in the aftermath of several recent aviation disasters that appear to have increased anxiety about flying. In December, a passenger airplane crashed and bust into flames at a South Korean airport, killing 179 people, making it the world’s deadliest plane crash in six years. A month later, a plane flying into Washington, D.C., collided with an Army helicopter, killing all 67 passengers.Earlier in May, a Japanese training aircraft crashed minutes after taking off, leading Japan to ground most of its remaining training planes and conduct emergency inspections.",
