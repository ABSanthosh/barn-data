  "text": "Jason Haight, who worked with embattled pop mogul Sean Diddy, revealed that Diddy once rented a mansion for $25K for a party with his team and insisted that all bedroom keys were given to him. Jason worked as a resident manager at the 15,000 sq ft Parisian Palace in Las Vegas between 2005 and 2017. Diddy was arrested in September on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation for engagement in prostitution. Calling all the charges false and all the cases against him baseless, Diddy did not plead guilty and will face trial on May 5, 2025. Diddy has been accused of holding Freak Off parties where women were forced to engage in sex with male prostitutes in an elaborate manner that went on for days. Speaking about this specific party, Jason revealed that Diddy's team requested double-sided locks in bedrooms. The party took place on May 3, 2014 and there was a rampant cocaine use with broken bottles and condom wrappers left all over the property, US Mirror reported. \"They requested that all interior bedroom door locks were to be ordered new and left unopened for their arrival for security purposes as they would need to supervise the installation.\"\"And both keys were to be given to Mr Combs directly and nobody else.\"Jason said he was given a rough estimate of 850 guests for the mansion party and a fee of $25,000 for 24 hours was agreed. \"The bedrooms the following day were disgusting, broken bottles of alcohol, used condoms, blood on the beddings, powder and razor blades by the hundreds, lubricant on the dressers, marble floors.\"Five new cases against DiddyFive fresh lawsuits were filed against Diddy accusing him of rape and drugging victims, including minors. The suits cover alleged acts that occurred between 2001 and 2022 in Miami and New York. They were all filed by anonymous accusers: three men and two women, one of whom was 17 when she was allegedly assaulted at one of Combs’s high-profile “White Parties” in the Hamptons. One of the men, a former actor, says that he visited New York City for an audition but was allegedly drugged and gang-raped.All five accusers allege that they were sexually assaulted after consuming a drink and feeling disoriented. Three of the lawsuits allege that these events happened at parties or events attended by Combs, the Washington Post reported.",
