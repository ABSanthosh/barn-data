  "text": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:A scholar from the Netherlands used AI to determine that the Dead Sea Scrolls may be older than previously believed.The new AI model pairs handwriting data with radiocarbon dating information to date ancient manuscripts.In the future, scientists hope the model will be useful in dating other mysterious ancient textsDating ancient artifacts is very difficult. Experts have a number of techniques they can use to get close, but there are limitations that often can’t be overcome without additional information. That said, sometimes you get lucky, like the researchers investigating the famous Dead Sea Scrolls did when they realized that the author wrote the dates of creation directly on several of the pages.However, not every scroll was labeled, and as a result, the undated Dead Sea Scrolls have been much harder for scientists to pin down. But when new technologies arise, things can change.According to a new study—in which scientists used AI modeling to study handwriting styles across ancient manuscripts with known dates—some of the undated Dead Sea Scrolls may be older than previously believed. Mladen Popovic (from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands) and his research team claim that their work not only re-dates some Dead Sea Scrolls, but could open a new way to place undated manuscripts on the timeline of ancient history. The team published their findings in the open-access journal PLOS One.“It is very exciting to set a significant step in solving the dating problem of the Dead Sea Scrolls and also creating a new tool that could be used to study other partially dated manuscripts from history,” the authors wrote in a statement. “This would not have been possible without the collaboration between so many different scientific disciplines.”The process started with a bounty of ancient texts used to help build datasets. The team parsed through historic manuscripts from various sites in modern-day Israel and the West Bank and used radiocarbon dating to estimate the ages of the documents. The team then trained a machine-learning model to understand the handwriting styles of each document in direct relation to the historic date of the manuscript.The AI model—dubbed Enoch, after the prominent biblical figure—then merged the two datasets. The goal of the work is to be able to “objectively determine an approximate age range” of a manuscript based solely on the handwriting style on the document.During testing, the scholars said that Enoch’s age estimates for the 135 Dead Sea Scrolls were “realistic” 79 percent of the time, and non-realistic 21 percent of the time (non-realistic here meaning significantly too old, significantly too young, or indecisive).The Enoch model, paired with radiocarbon dating, estimates older ages for “many of the Dead Sea Scrolls” than traditional handwriting analysis methods. The authors said that more data and further research could help pinpoint the timelines.“With the Enoch tool we have opened a new door into the ancient world, like a time machine, that allows us to study the hands that wrote the Bible,” the authors wrote in the statement, “especially now that we have established, for the first time, that two biblical scroll fragments come from the time of their presumed authors.”You Might Also Like",
