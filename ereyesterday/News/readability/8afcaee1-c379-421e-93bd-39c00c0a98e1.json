  "text": "SYDNEY — Markets across the Asia-Pacific region rebounded when they opened Tuesday, even as President Donald Trump threatened to hit China with additional tariffs that would escalate the tit-for-tat trade war between the world’s two largest economies.After a day of steep losses not seen since the covid-19 pandemic, stock markets in Japan, South Korea and Australia all rose on Tuesday morning.Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained more than 5 percent when it opened while South Korea’s KOSPI was trading 2.3 percent higher and Australia’s ASX 200 cautiously moved into positive territory.The rebounds reflected the neutral end to trading in the United States, where stock markets gyrated wildly Monday before the S\u0026P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed largely flat.Still, analysts said investors were mainly recouping Monday’s losses, and optimism was tempered by Trump’s latest broadside against China.Trump on Monday threatened to impose an additional 50 percent tariffs on China if Beijing did not “withdraw” its retaliatory measures on Tuesday, a move that would take duties on Chinese-made goods to at least 104 percent — and in some cases more.“Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social website. “Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately.”Leaders across the Asia-Pacific region — though notably not in China — have launched efforts to negotiate with the White House over the tariffs that many analysts fear could tip some nations, and perhaps the globe, into recession.Trump on Monday signaled he was open to cutting deals with countries around the world to ease tariffs, even as White House officials continued to suggest there would be no quick end to new import duties.“We’re going to get fair deals and good deals with every country. And if we don’t, we’re going to have nothing to do with them,” Trump said in a joint Oval Office appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “They’re not going to be allowed to participate in the United States.”Countries including Israel, Taiwan and Vietnam have offered to drop their duties on the United States as part of a deal to avert Trump’s tariffs from taking effect.Between 50 and 70 countries have been in touch with the White House to negotiate, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday.Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba urged Trump to reconsider tariffs on his country during a Monday phone call, warning that the measures could lead to a drop in Japanese investment in the United States.Trump mentioned the call on his social media platform, calling the tariffs “tough but fair” and announcing that Japan would be sending a “top team to negotiate.”“They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade,” Trump wrote. “They don’t take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs. Likewise Agriculture, and many other ‘things’.”But both Trump and Bessent — who the president tasked with leading the negotiations — also expressed optimism over talks with Japan. “So we have a great relationship with Japan,” Trump later told reporters. “We’re going to keep it that way.”South Korea’s trade minister, Cheong In-kyo, is scheduled to visit Washington on Tuesday to discuss the blanket 25 percent tariff Trump has imposed on the nation’s goods.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government had also contacted the Trump administration over the 10 percent tariffs it faces despite Australia’s large trade deficit with its closest military ally.Albanese, who has warned of the impact of steeper U.S. tariffs on Australia’s Asian trading partners, refused to rule out a recession on Tuesday as he campaigned ahead of a May 3 federal election.Any U.S.-Australia trade talks could be complicated by a steady drumbeat of criticism from Republicans over biosecurity measures that prevent the importation of American beef.“Australia has sold $29 billion worth of beef in the United States, and we haven't been able to sell one hamburger in Australia because of barriers,” said Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Senate Republican.Trump posted a clip of Barrasso’s comments on his Truth Social account.",
