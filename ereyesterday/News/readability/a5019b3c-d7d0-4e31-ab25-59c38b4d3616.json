As her daughter is family, a simple agreement was drawn up, not an actual real-estate contract to purchase. The agreement was for us to make periodic payments, large payments, while her daughter paid off the mortgage on the house. In the agreement, there were four homes in her daughter’s rental portfolio that were named as collateral. There were no terms in the agreement pertaining to a prepayment penalty on the loan she took on the property, and nothing noted in regard to force majeure even though the home was in Florida and within one mile of the water. The U.S. just lost its last pristine credit rating. What that means for markets. My husband and I spend more money on our daughter and her family than on my single son. Do we compensate him? My second wife says her 2 kids should inherit our estate, but I also have 2 kids. Is that fair? My wife and I paid off my stepdaughter’s $415K mortgage in exchange for her house, but it’s now worth $310K. Should we sue? My husband will inherit $180K. I think we should invest the money. He wants to pay off his $168K mortgage. Who’s right? In September 2024, the home was devastated by Hurricane Helene. We had already given $375,000 towards the purchase price of $415,000. There was one $40,000 payment left, due in January 2026. As we never took title to the home, we asked for the price to be reduced, based on the condition of the home following the storm, or to reimburse us for our full investment. In response, my stepdaughter said she wanted to continue with the agreement as written. She told us we owned the home based on the agreement, even though we felt the agreement was in breach since all four of the collateral homes were sold without giving us notice. She also never made any attempt to revise the agreement and add any new collateral. We were told that we would be responsible for the loss in value, plus a repayment penalty of more than $10,000. The sale was not enough to pay off the remaining mortgage, nor the significant prepayment penalty. She took our final $40,000. payment not due for another 13 months, to satisfy the full pay-off due. We were now into the agreement for the full $415,000. We are 71 and 67 and can’t afford this kind of loss in retirement. She refuses to repay the remaining money until January 2026 since that was the term in the original agreement, and will not pay any interest on the remaining amount she has agreed to pay. We are left with a home worth $310,000 — not $415,000.",
