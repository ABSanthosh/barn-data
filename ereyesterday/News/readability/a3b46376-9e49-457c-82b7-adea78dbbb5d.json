  "text": "Here’s the latest on the agreement.Israel approved a cease-fire agreement with Hamas early Saturday, setting up the first reprieve in Gaza in over a year. Palestinians have celebrated the truce with the hope that it will finally end the devastating 15-month war, and Israelis are anxiously awaiting the return of scores of captives abducted by Hamas.The full Israeli cabinet passed the agreement during a meeting that continued, unusually, into the Jewish Sabbath and into Saturday morning. The Israeli government said it would go into effect on Sunday. Israeli civilians will have a short window to file objections, but the courts are widely expected to allow the agreement to go forward.The Gaza war began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people in Israel and saw 250 taken hostage. Israel’s ensuing military campaign has leveled much of Gaza, and tens of thousands of Palestinians and hundreds of Israeli troops have been killed.The conflict went far beyond Israel’s borders, setting off a domino effect that is still reshaping the region. Hezbollah began attacking at Israel in solidarity with Hamas, leading to an Israeli campaign that hobbled the Lebanese militant group. And Israel and Iran — which backs both groups — exchanged direct blows, with Iranian missiles flying toward Israel and Israeli fighter jets bombarding Iran.The cease-fire deal involves a complex array of Israeli withdrawals, security mechanisms and hostage-for-prisoner swaps. Under its terms, Israel and Hamas will observe a 42-day truce, during which Hamas will release 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. During the truce, both sides will negotiate the next phase: an end to the war and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.But it was far from clear how long the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could hold, and the negotiations to end the war are likely to be bitter and difficult. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, faces internal rifts in his coalition, where some have decried the truce for leaving Hamas in power in Gaza for now.Here’s what else to know:First pause in more than a year: The cease-fire would be the first since November 2023, when 105 hostages were freed in a weeklong truce in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. Roughly 98 hostages remain in Gaza, according to the Israeli authorities, dozens of whom are presumed dead.Attacks in Gaza: Deadly strikes have continued since the cease-fire deal was announced. The Palestinian Civil Defense, an emergency service organization, said Friday that Israeli strikes had killed more than 100 people since the announcement. That figure could not be independently verified. The Israeli military said on Thursday that it had struck about 50 targets across the Gaza Strip over the previous day, adding that “numerous steps” had been taken to prevent civilian harm before the strikes.Background on the deal: Qatar and Egypt mediated the cease-fire deal alongside the United States. Officials from both the Biden administration and the incoming government of President-elect Donald J. Trump played a major role in pushing the deal ahead during a last-minute marathon of shuttle diplomacy in the Qatari capital, Doha. But Israel’s final sign-off was complicated by last-minute disputes with Hamas. Both sides accused the other of reneging on the terms of the agreement.Trump’s inauguration: President-elect Donald J. Trump, who had pressured the parties to reach an agreement before his inauguration, repeated in an interview shown on Thursday that he wanted the deal closed before he took office on Monday.Israel prepares to receive hostages held in Gaza for over a year.ImageDitza Heiman, 84, was part of a group of hostages released in 2023.Credit...Abir Sultan/EPA, via ShutterstockThe Israeli authorities are making preparations to welcome home dozens of hostages held incommunicado by Hamas for over a year in Gaza, without knowing whether they will return starved, traumatized or dead.Thirty-three hostages are supposed to be freed in the first phase of the Gaza cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas, in the first such major release since a weeklong cease-fire seven weeks into the war. Some families have caught glimpses of their loved ones in Hamas-directed hostage videos. But it is far from clear in what condition the captives will return.At Israeli hospitals, health officials have been preparing isolated areas where the hostages can begin recuperating in privacy. Israel’s Health Ministry has drafted an extensive protocol for their psychological and physical treatment. There are particular concerns that they may be severely malnourished.“The ones who were freed back then were already poorly nourished,” Hagar Mizrahi, a senior Israeli health ministry official, said of the hostages freed during the 2023 truce. “Imagine their situation now, after an additional 400 days. We are extremely worried about this.”After Hamas led the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and capturing about 250 others, about 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were freed in the weeklong truce in November that year. A few were later released in Israeli military operations, and Israeli soldiers recovered the bodies of dozens of others.But around 98 hostages remained in Gaza, dozens of whom presumed dead by the Israeli authorities.Of the women, older men and other hostages returning under the first phase of this cease-fire deal, many are believed to have been held in the militant group’s warren of tunnels in Gaza, conditions likely to leave physical and psychological scars.Health officials have been poring over every piece of intelligence — including the hostage videos — in an effort to discern the hostages’ condition, Dr. Mizrahi said. A committee of officials that includes Dr. Mizrahi has determined that some were killed.Israeli officials say the logistics of the release will be broadly similar to those during the previous cease-fire, when 105 hostages were released in exchange for 240 Palestinians jailed in Israel.In that exchange, Hamas fighters handed over hostages — mostly women and children — to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Red Cross’s workers ferried the captives from Gaza in a marked ambulance to Egypt before taking them to Israel.At the border crossing, Israeli intelligence agents verified their identities. Around the same time, Israeli security officials released a specified group of Palestinian women and teenage prisoners.This time, the Israeli authorities have established three reception points to receive the hostages along the Gaza border, according to an Israeli military official. Those will be staffed by Israeli soldiers, as well as doctors and psychologists, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in accordance with protocol.From there, the hostages will be taken to the Israeli hospitals that have been preparing to care for them, the official said.The 105 hostages released in November 2023 came home after roughly 50 days in captivity in Gaza. They arrived in a country that had fundamentally changed; some learned only then about friends and loved ones who had been killed in the Hamas-led attack.At first, officials aimed to reintegrate returning hostages as quickly as possible, according to Dr. Mizrahi. Now, the health authorities recommend that the hostages being released remain in the hospital for at least four days, if not longer, she said.In the meantime, the hostages’ family members — some of whom themselves survived captivity — can only wait.“Last time, we saw the Red Cross transferring the hostages, and some of them were running to the relatives, hugging them,” said Einat Yehene, a clinical psychologist working with the Hostage Families Forum, an advocacy group. “It’s not going to be easy and similar this time, given the physical and the emotional conditions we expect.”The Israeli government approved the cease-fire and hostage release deal with Hamas after hours of deliberations, the Israeli prime minister’s office said shortly after midnight on Saturday local time. The deal will go into effect on Sunday, the prime minister’s office said.It’s nearly midnight in Jerusalem, and the Israeli cabinet has been meeting behind closed doors for several hours to discuss the cease-fire and hostage release deal without any updates on their progress.Israel and Hamas have reached only one cease-fire agreement to release hostages over the course of the war, in November 2023. Israeli ministers approved that deal under similar circumstances: very late at night after hours of debate.In an outdoor courtyard in Dheisheh, a community in the West Bank founded decades ago as a Palestinian refugee camp, people waited to hear whether family members jailed by Israel might be released as part of the cease-fire deal.

But Jewish religious authorities have long held that life-saving actions can nullify the Sabbath’s prohibitions.With guarded hopes, families of hostages in Gaza anticipate their release.ImageDaniel Lifshitz, whose grandfather, Oded, is among the roughly 100 hostages held in Gaza, spoke to journalists at Hostages’ Square on Friday in Tel Aviv.Credit...Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York TimesFamily members of Israeli hostages held in Gaza welcomed the Israeli security cabinet’s approval of the cease-fire agreement on Friday, which brought it one step closer to taking effect. But joy over the prospect of reuniting with loved ones was tempered by uncertainty about whether Israel and Hamas would adhere to the deal beyond its initial phase.“The stomach is turning, and the heart is poured out on the floor, but it’s what we’ve been waiting for,” said Daniel Lifshitz, whose grandfather, Oded, 84, is among the roughly 100 hostages held in Gaza.Mr. Lifshitz said the involvement of President-elect Donald J. Trump and his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, made him confident that the deal would happen even before the cabinet gave its approval. Now, Mr. Lifshitz said, the challenge is to ensure that both Israel and Hamas abide by the agreement’s terms and return all of the hostages.“I trust that Trump and Witkoff will do what’s needed to be done,” Mr. Lifshitz said.While Mr. Lifshitz’s grandfather is among the hostages set to be released in the deal’s initial phase, the family has no information about his well-being and whether he is still alive.“Preparing for a festivity and a funeral simultaneously is impossible,” Mr. Lifshitz said in an interview.Doron Zexer, whose family hosted the Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander during his military service in Israel, and who is a prominent advocate for his release, said the news that hostages are likely to be released was joyous, even if Mr. Alexander was not immediately among them.“I’ll be the happiest man alive to see any one of the hostages return, but there’s also immense worry over the second phase,” Mr. Zexer, 50, said.Mr. Alexander is not among the roughly 33 hostages, mostly women and older people, who are expected to be released in the deal’s first six weeks.Even as the agreement progresses, families have no clear indication of whether Israel intends to pursue the deal beyond its initial phase and commit to an enduring cease-fire in Gaza, allowing the remaining hostages to return home.“I know there are extremists, but I hope the prime minister would not let them take charge,” Mr. Zexer said in an interview. “This must end with the last one of the remaining hostages being released.”Earlier on Friday, while ministers convened to vote on the deal, hostage families gathered in a public plaza in Tel Aviv known as Hostages Square to urge decision makers to support the agreement.Dozens of Israelis trickled into the square to support the families and seek comfort, some wearing shirts and pins that have become familiar symbols in Israel during the 15-month-long campaign for the hostages’ release.At a news conference, Einav Zengauker, whose son, Matan, has been held captive in Gaza since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, said, “The signed agreement is a comprehensive deal in phases. Our role is to do everything to ensure the agreement is fully implemented.”Her son is not among those set to be released in the deal’s initial stage. “This agreement must be followed through to the end to bring everyone home and end the war,” she said.Michel Illouz, whose son, Guy, was abducted alive during the attack and subsequently killed in captivity, said Israel’s goal of defeating Hamas would not allow it to pursue the deal to completion.“It’s impossible to crush Hamas and return the hostages; that’s a self-contradictory statement,” he said during the news conference.He pleaded with Israeli leaders to accept the deal’s terms so that all captives — along with the remains of those who are no longer alive — could return to Israel.“I have no grave where I can tell my eldest son how much I miss him,” Mr. Illouz said. “We have no hope to receive our children back alive — we can only hope to receive a grave and try to get some closure.”The Israeli government published a list of 95 Palestinian prisoners it said would be part of the first group to be freed as part of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. More names will be published after ministers formally approve the deal, the Israeli justice ministry said.Rawan Sheikh AhmadReporting from Haifa, IsraelAmong the prisoners on the list is Khalida Jarrar, a prominent Palestinian lawmaker and a leading figure in the West Bank. Jarrar, a senior member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, was most recently arrested in December 2023. Palestinian prisoner organizations have reported that she has been held in solitary confinement under harsh conditions. The World Health Organization looks to rebuild medical services as aid into Gaza increases.ImageHundreds of aid trucks are lined up in Arish, Egypt, close to the Rafah crossing.Credit...Ali Moustafa/Getty ImagesThe World Health Organization said it hoped that a Gaza cease-fire would see aid deliveries accelerate sharply to between 500 and 600 trucks daily, from 40 to 50 in recent months, and allow the first steps toward restoring health services after 15 months of war.“The possibility is very much there,” said Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, the W.H.O. representative for Palestinian territories, if Israel opens up the Rafah crossing on Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, which has been closed since May, and other entry points to the north and south of the territory.“We will see if the political will is there and impediments are taken out and routes are opening up,” he told reporters on Friday.The cease-fire deal announced this week is expected to go into effect as early as Sunday.Hundreds of aid trucks are already lined up in Arish, close to the Rafah crossing, mostly carrying food, tents and other supplies provided by Egypt, Al Qahera News, an Egyptian state-owned TV channel, reported.Half of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are not operational, while the others are only partially functional, and the W.H.O. estimates that more than $10 billion will be needed in the next five to seven years to rehabilitate Gaza’s health system, Dr. Peeperkorn said. But for now the W.H.O. is focusing on delivering critical needs ranging from medicines and trauma care supplies to fuel and spare parts for generators. It also sees repairing crippled electricity supplies, water and waste management systems as priorities for restoring public health, he said.Over the coming six weeks to two months W.H.O. also plans to bring in prefabricated hospitals and emergency medical teams to support treatment no longer available in hospitals that were heavily damaged in the fighting.Aid agencies are also calling for a dramatic escalation in medical evacuations of more than 12,000 patients, one-third of them children, with severe war-related injuries or chronic illnesses for which no treatment is available in Gaza.The W.H.O. reported that Israel has approved evacuation of 5,405 patients since the start of the war, but only 29 of the 1,200 patients it applied to relocate over a one-month period at the end of 2024. It now is looking to restart once-regular transfers to hospitals in East Jerusalem and Egypt as well as access to hospitals overseas.“This is not a logistical problem,” James Elder, a spokesman for the U.N. children’s agency, told reporters. “It’s a problem of intent.”Rawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting.Natan OdenheimerReporting from JerusalemThe Israeli defense minister, Israel Katz, ordered the immediate release of five settlers held under administrative detention for their alleged involvement in attacks on Palestinians, including recent riots in the West Bank. This comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sought to persuade hawkish members of his government not to leave the coalition over the cease-fire deal. Administrative detention in Israel allows imprisonment without trial for security reasons. Natan OdenheimerReporting from JerusalemMore than 3,000 Palestinians are currently held under such orders, some for extended periods. There are only five known Jewish administrative detainees, according to a spokesperson for Honenu, a right-wing legal aid organization representing the detainees being released today.Johnatan ReissReporting from Tel AvivThe Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, welcomed the security cabinet’s cease-fire approval and said he expects the full cabinet “to follow suit in swiftly affirming this decision.” As president, a largely ceremonial role, Herzog does not participate in votes on policy decisions. “I harbor no illusions — the deal will bring with it great challenges and painful, agonizing moments,” he said in a statement. Johnatan ReissReporting from Tel AvivThe Israeli security cabinet has recommended that the full cabinet approve the proposed cease-fire and hostage release agreement, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. A full cabinet meeting intended to grant final approval for the deal will be convened later today, it said.Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Gazans since the deal was announced, emergency officials say.ImageMourners with the bodies of Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza City on Thursday.Credit...Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersSince the cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel was announced on Wednesday, Israeli airstrikes have continued across the Gaza Strip, with northern Gaza facing the heaviest attacks, emergency officials in the territory said on Friday morning.Palestinian Civil Defense, an emergency services organization, said that more than two dozen children were among those killed, and that more than 200 people were injured across the territory. The highest toll was in Gaza City, where more than 80 Palestinians had been killed, Civil Defense said.The group’s figures could not be independently confirmed. The Israeli military did not immediately comment.Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s official news agency, said that Israeli warplanes had struck homes in northeastern Gaza City, resulting in deaths and injuries. Rescue workers and ambulance teams have been unable to reach the area to recover bodies, Wafa said.Ahmad al-Mashharwi, who has been sheltering with more than a dozen family members in a rented house in Gaza City, described the attacks as relentless.“The cease-fire feels meaningless,” he said in a phone interview. “Artillery and airstrikes continue around us, especially in northern Gaza.”The cease-fire, if it goes into effect, is supposed to pave the way for more humanitarian aid to reach Gaza. Mr. al-Mashharwi said that conditions in northern Gaza were dire, with prices soaring and even the most basic goods in short supply.“We can’t afford food or clean water, and my children are going hungry,” he said. “We’ve been stripped of everything — there’s no safety, no resources, nothing to help us survive.”Johnatan ReissReporting from Tel AvivFamilies of the hostages held a news conference in Tel Aviv to urge the government to move forward with the deal — and make clear that Israel intends to stick with it until all the hostages have been released. “The signed agreement is a comprehensive deal in phases. Our role is to do everything to ensure the agreement is fully implemented,” said Einav Zengauker, whose son, Matan, is among the roughly 100 hostages held in Gaza. “This agreement must be followed through to the end, to bring everyone home and end the war.”ImageCredit...Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York TimesRawan Sheikh AhmadReporting from Haifa, IsraelHundreds of aid trucks, mostly carrying supplies provided by Egypt, are lined up in Arish, Egypt, not far from the border with Gaza, awaiting a cease-fire, according to Al Qahera News, an Egyptian state TV network.

Her son, a soldier, is not among those set to be released in the deal’s initial phase. “We’re happy for the other families, who fought very hard for this,” she said, “But we’re frustrated that a comprehensive hostage release deal has not been reached.”ImageCredit...Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York TimesThe Israeli security cabinet has begun meeting in Jerusalem to discuss the cease-fire and hostage release deal with Hamas, the Israeli prime minister’s office said in a statement. Israeli ministers are widely expected to approve the agreement. The security cabinet is a smaller forum of government ministers; should they vote to enact the agreement, the wider cabinet must also convene to sign off.Despite the delays, the Israeli government just said in a statement that the cease-fire and hostage release agreement could still go into effect on Sunday, providing that Israeli ministers approve the deal. “The release of hostages can be realized according to the planned framework, under which the hostages are expected to be freed on Sunday,” the Israeli prime minister’s office said.Biden says he urged Netanyahu to accommodate Palestinians’ ‘legitimate concerns.’ImagePresident Joe Biden and his advisers struggled for months to negotiate an end to the conflict in Gaza.Credit...Tierney L. Cross for The New York TimesPresident Biden said Thursday that in the days after the war in Gaza began, he pushed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to prevent civilian deaths and to accommodate Palestinians’ concerns, while maintaining the United States’ firm support for Israel.Mr. Biden spoke with the MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell in his last television interview while in office, during which he also discussed his political career and presidency. The interview, which aired Thursday night, was taped earlier in the day.The 15-month-long war, which began after Hamas led a deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians. Most of Gaza’s roughly two million residents have been displaced at least once, and much of the enclave has been destroyed.Mr. Biden and other leaders announced a provisional cease-fire deal on Wednesday that has raised hopes that Israel’s military assault on Gaza will come to an end. Under the deal to halt the fighting, some hostages held by Hamas in Gaza would be released.The president and his advisers struggled for months to negotiate an end to the conflict. Mr. Biden, who put the cease-fire deal on the table in May, said on MSNBC that he had told Mr. Netanyahu repeatedly that “he has to find a way to accommodate the legitimate concerns” of Palestinians. He called Mr. Netanyahu a friend but said, “We don’t agree a whole lot lately.”Critics, including some families of hostages who have pressed for a cease-fire deal, have accused Mr. Netanyahu of intentionally stalling negotiations to prolong the conflict. Mr. Biden did not directly answer when asked whether he thought Mr. Netanyahu had done so. He said that the Israeli prime minister had come under political pressure from Israel’s right-wing, and was at times forced “to do some of the things that, in my belief, I thought were counterproductive.”To achieve the cease-fire agreement, President-elect Donald J. Trump and Mr. Biden directed their advisers to work together. Mr. Biden said in the Thursday interview that he had had no discussions with Mr. Trump about the negotiations during the past two weeks.Mr. Biden recalled that the first time he urged Mr. Netanyahu to prevent civilian deaths was during a visit to Israel 10 days after the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Mr. Biden said he told the prime minister that the United States would support Israel, but that “you can’t be carpet-bombing these communities.”Israel’s bombing campaign has been one of the most intense in 21st-century warfare, and the country has at times used inaccurate bombs.During the interview, Mr. Biden defended his steadfast support for Israel throughout the conflict.“When Iran thought it was going to blow Israel off the map — they had those thousands of missiles heading their way,” he said. “Well, guess what? We didn’t let it happen.” Israel’s security cabinet is scheduled to meet Friday morning to vote on the cease-fire deal, Israeli officials said.President Biden, in his final television interview in office, which aired on MSNBC on Thursday night, defended his choice to steadfastly support Israel throughout the conflict, after he and his advisers struggled over many months of intense diplomatic efforts to finalize a cease-fire agreement.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said Israeli and Hamas negotiators had worked out their remaining differences in a Gaza cease-fire agreement. He ordered a meeting of Israel’s political security cabinet on Friday to vote on the deal, his office said in a statement.Angry about a potential cease-fire in Gaza, far-right protesters block roads in Israel.ImageProtesters disrupting traffic in Jerusalem on Thursday.Credit...Peter van Agtmael for The New York TimesImageProtestors using rocks to block roads in Jerusalem on Thursday.Credit...Peter van Agtmael for The New York TimesImageDemonstrators gathered with fake blood on their hands on Thursday during a protest of the cease-fire deal.Credit...Peter van Agtmael for The New York TimesHundreds of far-right demonstrators blocked roads in Jerusalem on Thursday in protest of the provisional cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas.The demonstrators were seeking to pressure the Israeli government to reject the agreement, which would begin with a 42-day truce and the release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Israel’s cabinet must still vote on the deal, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s hard-line national security minister, threatened to resign and remove his party from the Israeli government if the cabinet voted to approve the provisional cease-fire deal.The protesters said they supported freeing hostages, but they were worried that the agreement undermined Israel’s ability to remove Hamas from power in Gaza.ImageThe Israeli border police clearing protesters of the proposed cease-fire deal in Jerusalem on Thursday.Credit...Peter van Agtmael for The New York TimesImageDemonstrators blocked traffic in Jerusalem for hours on Thursday.Credit...Peter van Agtmael for The New York Times“I feel betrayed by the state of Israel,” said Efrat Ashkenazi-Hershkovitz, 50, whose brother died fighting in Gaza. “This deal will free people with blood on their hands,” she added, referring to the Palestinian prisoners expected to be released by Israel under the agreement.For hours, the demonstrators, some teenagers, disrupted traffic in Jerusalem. They threw rocks onto highways, and clashed with police officers attempting to clear them.In the evening, a few hundred demonstrators gathered at a central junction near the Israeli parliament, where they displayed an exhibition of cardboard coffins draped in Israeli flags.One demonstrator, Eliav Turjman, a rabbi from Yeruham, Israel, said the Hostages Families Forum — the lobby representing the families of the hostages that has pushed for a cease-fire and hostage release deal — “appealed to Israelis’ hearts instead of their reason, which would dictate that we should occupy Gaza and expel its residents.”",
