  "text": "BEIRUT — The Israeli military bombed the last fully functional hospital in Gaza City early Sunday, medics there said, giving patients, doctors and displaced Palestinians sheltering on the grounds only 20 minutes to evacuate before it struck and destroyed key parts of the facility.More than 200 people — 88 patients and 120 staff members — were at al-Ahli Hospital when its reception received a call from the Israeli military telling them to leave the building shortly before 2 a.m. local time, according to the facility’s medical director and an American orthopedic surgeon volunteering at the hospital.No one was killed directly by the strike but a child who was receiving treatment for a head injury died as a result of the rushed evacuation, according to a statement from the Baptist Church in Jerusalem, which oversees the hospital.A video shared by Fadel Naim, director of al-Ahli, showed the child on the street in her hospital bed during the attempt to evacuate her. An oxygen tank was placed next to her as a man wept over the bed. Naim said she died from a lack of oxygen and the cold.The Israel Defense Forces said Sunday that it carried out the attack and that the target was a “command and control center used by Hamas.” It did not provide evidence for the claim.Hamas denied in a statement that the hospital was being used for military purposes and called for the formation of an international investigative committee “to refute these false allegations” and “put an end to these crimes that continue without accountability.”Samer Attar, an orthopedic surgeon from Chicago, said he was awakened at 2 a.m. to screaming as the message to evacuate circulated among staff and patients. In a series of voice notes, Attar described a scene of chaos as people scrambled to evacuate while others weighed whether it was safer to stay.“I was mobbed by patients. It was just fear and panic,” said Attar, who said he stayed at the hospital in part because he thought it might be less dangerous, but also because not all the patients could be evacuated.Some patients were wheeled out on beds by family members and pushed through the streets to other facilities, while others were evacuated by ambulance. But at least 30 patients, many of them with complex injuries, were unable to leave, he said.Attar and a nurse joined those patients in the surgical unit on the first floor. “Then, there was a loud explosion,” he said. “The ceiling, parts of it collapsed on top of us. The power went out. For about 30 minutes we just did not know what was happening.”The attack destroyed al-Ahli’s emergency room, paramedic office, ambulance bay, blood bank and chemistry lab, Attar and Maher Ayyad, the hospital’s medical director, said. Some patients spent the night on the street, according to Ayyad, who said the hospital was partially out of service Sunday and could not receive new patients until the damage has been fully assessed.Al-Ahli became a mainstay for health care in northern Gaza after al-Shifa Hospital, once the enclave’s largest medical complex, was rendered completely out of service by Israeli military activity, Ayyad said. Its capacity had doubled to 100 beds.“The Diocese of Jerusalem is appalled at the bombing of the hospital now for the fifth time since the beginning of the war in 2023 — and this time on the morning of Palm Sunday and the beginning of Holy Week,” the Baptist Church in Jerusalem said.Later Sunday, the IDF issued new evacuation orders for parts of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The military said over the weekend that it seized control of an east-west corridor that runs between Khan Younis and Rafah.“Gaza will become smaller and more isolated,” Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement Sunday. “And more of its residents will be forced to evacuate from the combat zones.”Israeli leaders have vowed to increase military pressure on Hamas. The militant group attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 others hostage.Israel’s military campaign against the group has killed more than 50,000 people in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. The bombardment has destroyed much of the enclave, including medical facilities and public infrastructure.The IDF on Sunday also carried out strikes in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. One of the strikes hit a car in Deir al-Balah, killing six brothers, according to Khalil al-Degran, spokesman for al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the bodies were taken.In a statement, the military said it had targeted a vehicle carrying the deputy head of a Hamas sniper cell in Deir al-Balah. According to Degran, the passengers were siblings from the Abu Mahadi family, and were on their way to a community kitchen to cook and distribute food to the displaced when their car was struck.Harb reported from London.",
