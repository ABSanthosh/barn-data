She wanted the public trial to show rape victims they were not alone.Gisèle Pelicot leaving the courthouse in Avignon, France, after judges sentenced her former husband on Thursday to 20 years for serially raping her.Credit...Miguel Medina/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesDec. 19, 2024Updated 3:24 p.m. ETIn a packed courtroom on Thursday in Avignon, France, the head judge asked each of the dozens of men accused of raping Gisèle Pelicot — while she was near-comatose and at the invitation of her husband of 50 years — to stand briefly. Then he pronounced their convictions swiftly, one after the other: all guilty.By the time it was over, every one of the 51 accused men had been convicted, most of them for raping Ms. Pelicot in her own bedroom. Her husband, Dominique Pelicot, 72, who had admitted to drugging her over nearly a decade to abuse her, was the only one to get the maximum sentence: 20 years.The rest were given sentences mostly ranging from six to nine years.And with that, the trial that had both horrified and captivated France for almost four months ended with a victory for the woman at its center, Ms. Pelicot. She became a feminist icon for her bravery in allowing the case to be tried publicly, to more fully expose the horrors of rape in a country where #MeToo hardly gained traction.After it was over, she stepped into a swarm of French and international reporters and hundreds of supporters eagerly awaiting her, who held up signs of appreciation and cheered when she emerged. There were so many of them that they stopped traffic on the road outside the courthouse.“Justice for Gisèle, justice for all,” one sign read. Another proclaimed: “All the women on Earth support you. Thank you Gisèle.”As she has throughout the trial, Ms. Pelicot retained her trademark poise, giving a simple statement about her decision to allow the world to witness the painful details of her rapes rather than keep them private as is allowed by French law. Her goal was to force discussions of rape, including those facilitated through the use of drugs.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
