It's a record that fascinated me, but I never thought I was capable of it, I really lacked the confidence to attempt it,\" the climber said in a statement sent to AFP.Jornet ran to the summit while Vedrines, who also holds the record for a speed ascent of K2 in Pakistan, mixed trail-running and skiing.\"Bravo, what a show. The artist,\" Jornet, currently preparing for the prestigious US Western States race in June, wrote in tribute on social media.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",
