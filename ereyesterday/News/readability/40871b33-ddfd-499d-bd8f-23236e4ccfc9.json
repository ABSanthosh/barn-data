  "text": "Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer announces opposition to Republican-backed funding bill (File photo)Senate Democrats announced on Wednesday their opposition to a Republican-proposed stopgap funding bill through September 30, heightening the possibility of a government shutdown by week's end.Following intensive party discussions over two days, Senator Chuck Schumer, D-NY, announced that his party members would not support the House-approved bill maintaining current federal funding levels for six months. Instead, he advocated for a one-month extension to enable Congress to evaluate individual spending bills and reach a mutually acceptable agreement.\"Our caucus is unified\" on such a measure to \"keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,\" Schumer stated briefly from the floor.Government shutdown likely after Schumer says Senate Dems will block GOP funding billThis stance has left parliamentary leaders without a viable solution to prevent a shutdown, scheduled to commence at 12.01 am Saturday (local time) if Congress fails to extend federal funding. Senate Republicans require support from a minimum of eight Democrats to overcome procedural obstacles. Thus far, only Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania has indicated willingness to break any filibuster.The Republican majority in both chambers shows no inclination towards Democratic compromise on spending measures. Modifying the House bill or approving an alternative would necessitate the House's return for another vote, which appears improbable. Republican leadership deliberately concluded chamber proceedings Tuesday night after passing the continuing resolution, effectively pressuring Senate acceptance.Despite Schumer's public opposition, Democrats continued private discussions about avoiding a shutdown without appearing to yield to Trump. Some suggested allowing the stopgap bill to proceed if Republicans permitted Senate floor revisions. This would enable Democrats to present their political opposition and demonstrate their resistance, even if proposed changes ultimately failed.However, during Wednesday's gathering, House Democratic leadership urged their Senate colleagues to maintain firm opposition to the government funding bill.",
