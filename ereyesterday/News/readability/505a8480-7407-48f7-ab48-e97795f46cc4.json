  "text": "Israel's military has admitted killing a United Nations (UN) worker with tank fire, having previously denied responsibility, in an incident in the Gaza Strip last month.After a UN staff member was killed when a UN compound in Deir al-Balah was damaged on 19 March, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had not struck the site.But the IDF said on Thursday that the initial findings of its investigation into the incident indicated its troops had in fact killed the UN worker after wrongly identifying the building as containing an \"enemy presence\".It said in a statement: \"The building was struck due to assessed enemy presence and was not identified by the forces as a UN facility.\"These preliminary findings have been shared with the UN and the full conclusion will also be provided, it said.It added: \"The IDF regrets this serious incident and continues to conduct thorough review processes to draw operational lessons and evaluate additional measures to prevent such events in the future.\"We express our deep sorrow for the loss and send our condolences to the family.\"The incident, which killed Bulgarian UN worker Marin Valev Marinov and seriously injured five other UN personnel, came a day after Israel renewed its offensive against Hamas after a two-month ceasefire collapsed.At the time, UN Secretary General António Guterres called for a full investigation into the incident, while a spokesperson said: \"The locations of all UN premises are known to the parties to the conflict, who are bound by international law to protect them and maintain their absolute inviolability.\"Following the attack, the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) said that \"explosive ordnance was dropped or fired\" at a guesthouse, which was in an \"isolated\" location. Its executive director, Jorge Moreira da Silva, said it was \"not an accident\".The IDF said in a statement on the day of the attack: \"Contrary to reports, the IDF did not strike a UN compound in Deir el-Balah. The IDF calls on media outlets to act with caution regarding unverified reports.\"Footage verified by the BBC showed injured people - two wearing blue UN flak jackets - arriving at a hospital in an ambulance and a UN car.Separately, the IDF said earlier this week that \"professional failures\" had led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in an incident in Gaza last month.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 1,978 people have been killed since Israel renewed its offensive on the territory, with at least 50 reported killed by Israeli strikes on Thursday.Israel says it is putting military pressure on Hamas to release the 59 hostages it is still holding, 24 of whom are believed to be alive. It has also blocked all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza for seven weeks. The UN says this is \"further depriving people of the means for survival and undermining every aspect of civilian life\".The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 51,300 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.",
