  "text": "Here are the latest developments.The Israeli military confirmed on Thursday that Yahya Sinwar, the powerful and elusive militant leader who has been the No. 1 target for Israel since the beginning of the war, had been killed in battle.Mr. Sinwar was viewed as the architect of the brutal Oct. 7 attack on Israel that set off the 13-month war that has plunged the Gaza Strip into a humanitarian crisis and began a wider conflict that now includes the fighting in Lebanon.After a firefight in Gaza on Wednesday with Hamas forces, Israeli soldiers retrieved a body that appeared to be that of Mr. Sinwar. A sample of his DNA was tested to confirm his identity, according to an Israeli official with knowledge of the matter. The police in Israel said they had also used Mr. Sinwar’s dental records and fingerprints, both of which were on file, for identification purposes. There was no immediate response from Hamas.Since launching the assault on Hamas in Gaza last October in retaliation for Hamas’s cross-border raids, in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 abducted, Israeli officials have repeatedly said that their goal was nothing less than the destruction of the militant group.But no target loomed larger for Israel than Mr. Sinwar himself. Over his past year in hiding in the devastated enclave, he was believed to still be closely overseeing Hamas military operations.Israel’s military and intelligence services, backed by the United States, dedicated vast resources in its search for Mr. Sinwar. But in the end, a unit of trainee squad commanders unexpectedly encountered him while on an operation in southern Gaza, according to four Israeli defense officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel stopped short of declaring total victory against Hamas in a statement, and vowed to get the remaining hostages in Gaza released. He made an offer to those holding hostages, promising to let them “leave and live” if they set aside their weapons and returned the captives.His death might encourage Hamas to agree to Israeli demands, and might also offer Israel a military success that could lead the Netanyahu government to ease its negotiating stance. Hamas and the Israeli government have remained far apart on key issues during months of negotiations over a truce.Mr. Sinwar’s death raises hopes for an end to a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of Gazans and plunged many more into a humanitarian crisis.Here’s what else to know:Identifying the body: Israeli officials initially matched Mr. Sinwar’s dental information and fingerprints with records on file, the Israeli police said in a statement. A sample of his DNA was tested to confirm his identity, according to an Israeli official with knowledge of the matter.Reaction in Israel: For the families of the dozens of hostages remaining in Gaza, the death of Mr. Sinwar brought both a moment of satisfaction and deep trepidation for the fate of the captives.Hamas leadership: Mr. Sinwar’s death deals a significant blow to the militant organization’s leadership. These are some of the remaining leaders of the militant group.The International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor sought warrants for 3 Hamas leaders. All 3 are now dead.ImageOver the last year, Israel has confirmed the deaths of, from left, Ismail Haniyeh, Mohammed Deif and Yahya Sinwar. All were top Hamas leaders. Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesYahya Sinwar is the third of three Hamas leaders to be assassinated in the months since the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court requested warrants for their arrest on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court’s prosecutor, Karim Khan, applied for the warrants in May because he said at the time that he had “reasonable grounds to believe” that the three — Mr. Sinwar; Mohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas’s military wing; and Ismail Haniyeh, then the chief of the group’s political office — shared responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including “the killing of hundreds of Israeli civilians” in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, and the taking of more than 200 hostages.At the same time, Mr. Khan requested warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, because he said there was reason to believe that they also bore responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including using the starvation as a weapon of war against civilians and directing attacks against civilians.The Hague-based court, which was formed by international treaty in 1998 to prosecute war crimes and genocide, had not announced whether it would approve the warrants before all three Hamas figures were killed. Israeli military leaders said that Mr. Deif was killed in an airstrike in July in Gaza, which local health authorities said killed at least 90 other people. Weeks later, Mr. Haniyeh died when a bomb exploded in the guesthouse in which he was staying to attend a funeral in the Iranian capital, Tehran. Israel said on Thursday that Mr. Sinwar, the political leader of Hamas and its most senior figure, had been killed in Gaza the previous day.In August, Mr. Khan withdrew his request for the warrant for Mr. Haniyeh, citing his death. Legal experts said then that he was likely to also withdraw his warrant request for Mr. Deif, who at that point was believed but not confirmed to be dead. Mr. Khan may now withdraw his warrant request for Mr. Sinwar.It was not immediately clear whether the deaths would have any impact on the court’s decision on the outstanding arrest warrant requests for Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gallant. If the court does issue the warrants, member states could be required to arrest the Israeli officials on entry into their territories.Senior officials in Israel — which like the United States, China, India and Russia is not a member state of the court — have called the requests involving Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gallant outrageous, saying the prosecutor was equating them with the leaders of Hamas. Last month, the Israeli attorney general’s office filed documents to the court challenging its jurisdiction to issue the warrants on technical grounds.Israeli military drone footage claims to show Sinwar shortly before he was killed.ImageA still frame from video filmed by an Israel Defense Forces drone shows a man the Israeli military identified as Yahya Sinwar sitting in a chair.Credit...Israel Defense ForcesThe Israeli military released a video on Thursday showing a drone flying into a building in Rafah, where a man the video identifies as Yahya Sinwar is sitting on a chair. The Israeli military described the video as showing Mr. Sinwar “moments before his elimination.”While the video has been edited, it is clear that the man, who is covered in dust, watches the drone for at least 20 seconds before throwing an object, possibly a stick, at the drone. The Times could not independently verify the identity of the man.The room seen in the drone video matches the location of earlier photographs obtained by The New York Times showing the corpse of a man closely resembling Mr. Sinwar. There is new damage to a wall of the room visible in the photographs, which indicates that an explosion occurred at some point after the drone footage. Also in the photos, the corpse is wearing a green kaffiyeh similar to the one worn by the man in the video. The room is on the second floor of a residential building in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood of Rafah in southern Gaza. Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli military released several videos of Israeli soldiers in the area after Mr. Sinwar was killed. The Times determined this footage was filmed near the same house in northern Rafah.Israel’s military has recently expanded its operations in this neighborhood of Rafah. A video filmed in September showed soldiers going on a patrol in Rafah from a nearby military position. In the clip, the soldiers drive by the house in which Mr. Sinwar was later killed, although it is not clear whether he was in the building at the time the footage was filmed.Sinwar had been a priority target for Israel since his release from prison in 2011.ImageAn Israeli soldier walking out of a tunnel in the Gaza Strip during an escorted tour by the military for international journalists in December.Credit...Tamir Kalifa for The New York TimesThe Israeli military hunted Yahya Sinwarfor years before killing him in a firefight on Wednesday.The Israeli military’s confirmation of the Hamas leader’s death on Thursday followed hours of uncertainty over whether Mr. Sinwar, who had evaded Israel so often in the past, had actually been killed.Since his release from an Israeli prison in 2011, and his subsequent ascent through Hamas’s ranks, Mr. Sinwar had been among the highest priority targets for Israel’s intelligence operation.In 2021, during a brief war with Hamas, Israel bombed Mr. Sinwar’s home in an unsuccessful attempt to kill him. After that war ended, Mr. Sinwar announced on television that he was going to walk home and dared Israel to assassinate him. Then he strolled through the streets of Gaza, waving at shopkeepers and pausing for photos with admirers.But Israel’s efforts to find Mr. Sinwar intensified significantly after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which he helped to plan.During a raid early in the war on a tunnel in Gaza City, in northern Gaza, Israeli soldiers found a video, filmed days earlier, of Mr. Sinwar moving his family to a different hiding spot under the city.Israeli intelligence officials have said that they believe Mr. Sinwar, who married and had children after his release from prison, kept his family with him for at least the first six months of the war.In January, Israeli and American officials said they thought that they had made progress toward finding him, when Israeli commandos raided an elaborate tunnel complex in southern Gaza based on intelligence that he might be hiding there.But he had left the bunker, in the city of Khan Younis, just days earlier, leaving behind documents and stacks of Israeli shekels totaling about $1 million. After that, the trail appeared to go cold.In the months that followed, Mr. Sinwar released no audio or video messages. Some Israeli officials said that, in the absence of signs of life, it was possible that he was dead.He was not. Over the summer, his importance to negotiations over a cease-fire and the release of the hostages became clear, and Israeli and U.S. officials said that he was a significant impediment to a deal.The assassination of the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, in July infuriated Mr. Sinwar, according to American officials. In August, Hamas named Mr. Sinwar as its political leader, bolstering his power within the group.His power, which derived in part from his presence in Gaza, was difficult to exercise for largely the same reason that it was so difficult for Israel to locate him: He avoided almost all electronic communication tools.Since the Oct. 7 attacks, Mr. Sinwar had avoided appearing in public, and he had not issued any audio or video messages in months, hoping to avoid giving away details that could lead to his capture or death.Israeli forces, who have used communications between Hamas leaders to target them, appeared unable to identify exactly how Mr. Sinwar exchanged information with other Hamas officials.Mr. Sinwar had stopped using electronic communications even before the war. Once it began, most experts had said that he lived full time in the network of tunnels that Hamas built beneath Gaza, and that he was most likely surrounded by hostages seized on Oct. 7 to reduce the chances that Israeli forces would attempt to kill him with an airstrike or a ground assault.In September, an allied militant group in Lebanon, Hezbollah, released a letter from Mr. Sinwar thanking that group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, for supporting Hamas in its war with Israel. Hezbollah had begun cross-border exchanges of fire with Israel almost immediately after the war in Gaza began. Some Hamas officials at the time suggested that the letter, which was not handwritten, had been written outside Gaza by someone else but with Mr. Sinwar’s approval.It may prove to have been Mr. Sinwar’s last public communication, and it did little to help Mr. Nasrallah. Weeks later, Israel’s military assassinated him in an airstrike in Lebanon and then invaded Lebanon, aiming to drive Hezbollah away from its northern border.The killing of Sinwar is another blow to Iran.ImageA billboard showing Yahya Sinwar in Tehran in August.Credit...Atta Kenare/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesFor Iran, a key supporter of Hamas, the killing of Yahya Sinwar represents yet another tactical and morale blow in a wave of Israeli attacks on the country’s militant allies in the region.Iranian state news media are portraying Mr. Sinwar’s death as “martyrdom,” praising the top leader of Hamas for dying while fighting Israel in Gaza, distinguishing him from leaders who died while hiding in bunker tunnels or remained outside of Gaza.Mr. Sinwar’s death was not unexpected, he was in Gaza and had been Israel’s top target since the beginning of the war. Perhaps because of that, his killing has not shaken Tehran as much as the assassination of Hamas’s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, which took place in Tehran, or that of Hassan Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, another armed group also backed by Iran, in Beirut.Iran’s mission to the United Nations said in a post on X that Mr. Sinwar would “become a model for the youth and children who will carry forward his path toward the liberation of Palestine. As long as occupation and aggression exist, resistance will endure, for the martyr remains alive and a source of inspiration.”Iran’s president and foreign minister have not yet commented directly on the killing, likely waiting for Hamas to issue a statement of confirmation. But Gen. Mohammad Baqer Ghalibaf, the conservative speaker of Iran’s Parliament, at a speech in the city of Mashhad on Thursday, alluded to Mr. Sinwar when speaking of militant leaders killed by Israel.“The martyrs of the Zionist regime’s crimes, especially martyr Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, are all considered great treasures for Islamic movements and people. Their martyrdom does not mean the end of the resistance and the fight will continue,” said General Ghalibaf.Supporters of Iran’s government posted messages of condolence and praise for Mr. Sinwar on social media. Hossein Kazeruni, a hard-line cleric, said on X that Mr. Sinwar died fighting Israel’s military “like a man, weapon in hand, wrapped in kaffiyeh, chest out.”Official Iranian media was highlighting Mr. Sinwar’s close ties to Iran, including a video of him visiting Tehran in 2011 after his release from an Israeli prison and meeting with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who told him, “With this spirit and mind-set, you will definitely be victorious.”Reza Salehi, a conservative analyst in Tehran who is close to the government, said in an interview that the killing of Mr. Sinwar would not eradicate Hamas; rather, it would fuel more support for it. But he also said it would not prompt Iran to retaliate.“Iran is not going to respond, but it is a significant event,” Mr. Salehi said. “In the short-term, Sinwar’s absence will affect Hamas’s field command and disrupt cease-fire negotiations.”He added that Israel’s “aggressive onslaught” on Iran’s allies has already prompted a recalculation of Iran’s offensive and defensive strategies, meaning that Iran was departing from what it refers to as strategic patience to being more willing to take risks and strike back.Iran has long funded, trained and provided weapons to Hamas and other Palestinian militants as part of the government’s ideology that Israel and Zionism must be eradicated and the lands returned to Palestinians. Iranian officials have repeatedly praised Mr. Sinwar as the architect of the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on Israel, which Iran has described as “justified” and “a big victory.”The news of Mr. Sinwar’s killing comes as Iran awaits Israel’s response to Iran’s missile attack earlier this month to avenge the killings of Mr. Nasrallah, Mr. Haniyeh and an Iranian senior commander.Analysts in Iran said that it was unlikely that Mr. Sinwar’s killing would have a significant impact on Iran’s calculations of war with Israel. Iran wants to avoid an all-out war at the same time that it wants to establish deterrence against any potential widespread attacks by Israel on its infrastructure, nuclear sites and military bases. But Iran has warned it would strike back if they are attacked.The U.S. military did not aid the Israeli operation that killed Sinwar, the Pentagon said.Image“Just to be crystal clear: This was an Israeli operation,” Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder said on Thursday. “There was no U.S. forces directly involved.”Credit...Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesU.S. military forces had no role in the Israeli operation that killed Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, in Gaza, the Pentagon said on Thursday.Maj. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, stressed that point in a briefing to reporters on Thursday.“Just to be crystal clear: This was an Israeli operation,” General Ryder said. “There was no U.S. forces directly involved.”U.S. military personnel have helped the Israeli military locate other Hamas leaders, as well as hostages held in Gaza since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel. But the Israeli operation that killed Mr. Sinwar, General Ryder said, was separate from the U.S. military’s continuing support.Several other current and former senior U.S. military and defense officials concurred with General Ryder’s assertion that the United States did not play a role in the specific Israeli operation that killed Mr. Sinwar, which Israeli officials described as a chance encounter made by a unit of trainee squad commanders on patrol in southern Gaza on Wednesday that engaged Palestinian fighters in a firefight.“It does sound like it was a routine patrol,” said Mick Mulroy, a former top Middle East policy official at the Pentagon and a retired C.I.A. officer. “If true, it shows the importance of these patrols.”General Ryder also echoed remarks made by President Biden earlier in the day that the killing of Mr. Sinwar presented an opportunity to negotiate a cease-fire.“Broadly speaking, we absolutely support a cease-fire so that we can ensure that humanitarian assistance is getting into Gaza, that the Palestinian people can see a restoration of security and stability,” General Ryder said. “But we also recognize the threat that Hamas has posed to Israel and so we’ll continue to consult with Israel and our partners in the region.”He added: “Obviously we want to see a cease-fire as soon as possible, and most importantly the release of the hostages that continue to be held by Hamas.”In a call to note Sinwar’s death, Biden tells Netanyahu he’s sending Blinken to Israel to work on a Gaza cease-fire.ImagePresident Biden at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday before leaving for Germany.Credit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesPresident Biden said on Thursday that the death of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who was killed by the Israeli military on Wednesday, could create the opportunity to “move on” to a cease-fire in Gaza, adding that he had spoken to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to congratulate him on Mr. Sinwar’s death.“It’s time for this war to end and bring these hostages home. So that’s what we’re ready to do,” Mr. Biden told reporters upon his arrival in Berlin on Thursday evening. He added that he was “hopeful” about the prospects of a cease-fire and would be sending Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken to Israel in the coming four to five days to discuss securing Gaza and what the “day after” the war will look like.“Yahya Sinwar was an insurmountable obstacle to achieving all of those goals,” Mr. Biden said in a statement earlier on Thursday. “That obstacle no longer exists. But much work remains before us.”The death of Mr. Sinwar, the Hamas leader who was the architect of the Oct. 7 attacks, comes as the relationship between Mr. Netanyahu and the U.S. president has frayed. The two leaders had spoken last week for the first time in two months to discuss Israel’s plans to retaliate against Iran for a missile attack earlier in October. Looming over that discussion was the burden of their worsening ties.President Biden has on occasion privately expressed his frustrations with Mr. Netanyahu and his conduct of the war in Gaza, sometimes in salty terms, as documented in a new book by the investigative reporter Bob Woodward. Mr. Biden has also lamented to Mr. Netanyahu directly that he lacks a strategy for the war, according to the book.But Mr. Sinwar’s death seems to present an opportunity for both men to claim a victory and perhaps get on the same page again. According to Mr. Netanyahu’s office, President Biden called him on Thursday evening and both leaders “agreed that there is an opportunity to advance a deal to free the hostages and they will work together to achieve that goal,” according to the Israeli statement.Negotiations on a cease-fire deal that would see the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza have been deadlocked for months, with both Israel and Hamas blaming each other.After landing in Berlin to meet with European leaders, President Biden walked over to reporters and said he had already congratulated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and would be sending Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken to Israel in the next four or five days. “Now is the time to move on,” Biden said. “Move on, move toward to a cease-fire in Gaza, make sure that we move in a direction that we’re going to be in a position to make things better for the whole world. It’s time for this war to end and bring these hostages home.”ImageCredit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesU.S. military forces had no role in the Israeli operation that killed Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, in Gaza, according to the Pentagon. Maj. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, made that point repeatedly in a briefing to reporters on Thursday. “Just to be crystal clear: This was an Israeli operation,” he said. “There was no U.S. forces directly involved.”Israeli soldiers and intelligence agents had spent months pursuing Yahya Sinwar after the attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, occasionally finding clues but never managing to trap him, according to Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman. Signs of Sinwar’s DNA were found at one point in a tunnel a few hundred meters from where Israeli forces found the bodies of six Israeli hostages killed by their captors six weeks ago, Hagari told reporters.Israeli demonstrators and supporters of the families of those still held hostage in Gaza rallied near the Israeli Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv on Thursday.ImageCredit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesImageCredit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesPresident Biden called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Thursday in the wake of the death of Yahya Sinwar, Netanyahu’s office said.

It is time to chart a different path.”VideotranscripttranscriptThe path that Sinwar wanted for the region — death, destruction, instability, chaos — is a path that we know the people of the region reject. The horrors of the past year cannot be the future, and they do not need to be the future. It is time to chart a different path.Miller said he hoped that the next leader of Hamas would look at the suffering of the Palestinian people and decide “to pursue a different path forward.” He declined to speculate about who that Hamas leader might be.The State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, said in a briefing with reporters on Thursday that Sinwar was responsible for the deaths of civilians from about 30 countries, including Israel and the United States, as well as for the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. He called the Hamas leader the “chief obstacle” to cease-fire talks and said his death offered “a seismic opportunity” to relaunch negotiations to end the war.In a statement on the death of Yahya Sinwar, the American secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, said the United States would “redouble its efforts with partners to end this conflict” and aimed to “secure the release all hostages, and chart a new path forward that will enable the people of Gaza to rebuild their lives and realize their aspirations free from war and free from the brutal grip of Hamas.”Sinwar evaded Israeli intelligence for years. Trainee soldiers came upon him.ImageAn Israeli military vehicle driving along the border of Gaza, on Thursday.Credit...Amir Cohen/ReutersFor over a year, Israel’s security establishment, backed by the United States, dedicated vast resources and gathered mounds of intelligence in its hunt for Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who was an architect of the Oct. 7 attacks.But in the end, a unit of trainee squad commanders unexpectedly encountered Mr. Sinwar while on an operation in southern Gaza, according to four Israeli defense officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.The unit was on patrol in southern Gaza on Wednesday when the Israeli soldiers came upon a small group of fighters, the officials said. The soldiers — backed by drones — engaged in a firefight, and three Palestinian militants were killed.During the battle, Israeli fire brought down part of a building where the militants had taken cover, two officials said. As the dust cleared and they began searching the building, the Israeli soldiers noticed that one of the bodies bore a shocking resemblance to the Hamas leader, the three officials said.It was a seemingly unlikely place to find him. Israeli and U.S. intelligence had long assessed that Mr. Sinwar — fearful for his own safety — had been hiding deep underground, surrounding himself with Israeli hostages to avoid assassination.Photographs obtained by The New York Times, some of which later circulated online, show the body of a man with facial features strongly resembling Mr. Sinwar. The man’s body has several severe wounds, including to the head and leg. The photographs show that the body has several features matching those seen in archival footage of Mr. Sinwar, including distinctive moles near his eyes and crooked teeth.Hours after the fight was over, the soldiers approached the bodies cautiously. The area was still littered with explosive devices, two officials said. They also thought that the body of one fighter, later identified as Mr. Sinwar, was booby-trapped.They found money and weaponry alongside the militants, according to one of the officials, who shared photos of the scene, including some in which the items were on display.The troops, one of the officials said, were also concerned that there might be hostages in the area as well, but none were found with the fighters. There is no evidence that any of the hostages still held in Gaza were harmed during the battle, the Israeli military said.On Thursday evening, the Israeli military, after completing its identification process, announced that Mr. Sinwar was dead.Aric Toler, Riley Mellen and Christiaan Triebert contributed reporting.President Emmanuel Macron of France said on social media that Sinwar was “the main person responsible for the terrorist attacks and barbaric acts of October 7th,” adding that he thinks “with emotion” about the victims and their loved ones. He added: “France demands the release of all hostages still held by Hamas.”Vice President Kamala Harris, speaking about Yahya Sinwar’s death after a campaign stop in Milwaukee, said that “justice has been served.” She added: “He had American blood on his hands.” Harris said Sinwar’s death should lead to a cessation of Israel’s offensive in Gaza. “This moment gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza,” she said.VideoPresident Biden says he will be speaking soon with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “to discuss the pathway for bringing the hostages home to their families, and for ending this war once and for all, which has caused so much devastation to innocent people.”President Biden said he directed Special Operations forces to work with the Israelis to track down Sinwar and other Hamas leaders hiding in Gaza in the past year. “With our intelligence help, the IDF relentlessly pursued Hamas’s leaders, flushing them out of their hiding places and forcing them onto the run.” It’s unclear if Israel used information from U.S. intelligence sources to track Sinwar down on Wednesday.People gathered around to watch the news on Sinwar’s fate on television in a makeshift cafe on the side of a road in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, on Thursday.ImageCredit...Bilal Shbair for The New York TimesIsrael’s biggest allies are reacting to the news of Yahya Sinwar’s death. Germany’s Foreign Office said that the Hamas leader had “brought death to thousands of people and immeasurable suffering across an entire region.” It called on Hamas to “immediately release all hostages and lay down its weapons,” saying that “the suffering of the people in Gaza must finally end.”Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke today with Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, to discuss “shared efforts to end the war in Gaza and reduce the escalation in Lebanon,” the Qatari prime minister’s office said. Qatar has been a major mediator in talks over a cease-fire with Hamas, which maintains a political office in Doha, the country’s capital.Iranian state news media are portraying Sinwar’s death as “martyrdom” and distinguishing him from leaders who died while hiding in bunker tunnels or commanding fighters from outside Gaza, praising Sinwar for dying while fighting Israel in Gaza.ImageCredit...Atta Kenare/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesSince Sinwar was in Gaza and had been Israel’s top target since the beginning of the war, Iran, to a degree, had been expecting his death. It did not shake Tehran as much as the assassinations of Hamas’s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, and Hezbollah’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah.Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, celebrated Sinwar’s death, calling the Hamas leader “a mass murderer who killed thousands of Israelis and kidnapped hundreds of our citizens.” But he stopped short of declaring total victory in Israel’s war against Hamas. “Today, evil took a heavy blow — the mission ahead of us is still unfinished,” Netanyahu said. He added that Sinwar’s death was “an important milestone in the sunset of Hamas’s evil rule in Gaza.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, in announcing that Yahya Sinwar had been killed by the Israeli military, directed his statements to the families of hostages being held in Gaza. “This is an important moment in the war,” Netanyahu said, adding that he pledged to work to bring the remaining hostages home. He called it an “obligation.”In his statement, Netanyahu told Gazans holding the remaining dozens of hostages in the enclave that they would be allowed “to leave and live” if they set aside their weapons and returned the captives. But, possibly concerned about reprisals for Sinwar’s death, he warned that anyone who harmed Israeli hostages would pay with their lives.Israeli officials identified Yahya Sinwar by matching his dental information and fingerprints with records on file, the Israeli police said in a statement. The matches provided “definitive identification” of the Hamas leader, the police said.Hamas has yet to respond to Israel’s announcement of Sinwar’s death. Several Hamas officials abroad did not answer calls or requests for comment by text message.For the families of hostages, a moment of satisfaction and fear.ImageFamilies and supporters of Israeli hostages, in Tel Aviv on Thursday.Credit...Violeta Santos Moura/ReutersFor the families and supporters of the scores of hostages remaining in Gaza, the killing of Yahya Sinwar, their chief captor, brought both a moment of satisfaction and deep trepidation for the fate of the captives.“On the one hand it’s a national closing of the circle,” said Anna Astmaker, a cousin of Karina Ariev, a surveillance soldier who was abducted from her army base near the Gaza border last year and who turned 20 in captivity.“I heard a lot of celebrations and cheers of joy in my neighborhood, and justifiably so,” Ms. Astmaker said, speaking by telephone from her home in Jerusalem soon after Mr. Sinwar’s death was confirmed. “But my head immediately filled with questions,” she added.“What does it mean for Karina and the other hostages?” she said, raising the prospect of an accelerated push for a deal to bring them home or, more darkly, the possibility that Mr. Sinwar’s supporters could avenge his killing by harming them.Mr. Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, was an architect of the Oct. 7 terror attack in Israel during which more than 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others — civilians and soldiers — were captured and taken into Gaza, according to the Israeli authorities.More than a hundred hostages were released in an initial deal last November during a temporary cease-fire in fighting after Israel had launched a punishing counteroffensive, and in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees from custody in Israel.Of the 101 hostages remaining in Gaza, at least a third are believed to be no longer alive.Only eight hostages have been rescued alive by Israeli forces. Others were taken into Gaza dead, have since been killed by their captors or, in some cases, were killed accidentally by Israeli fire.Adding to the fears and sense of urgency over the fate of those remaining, six hostages were fatally shot at close range in late August by their captors in a tunnel in Rafah, in southern Gaza, apparently as Israeli soldiers, unaware of their presence, were operating nearby, aboveground, according to Israeli officials.Negotiations for a new cease-fire deal that would bring about the hostages’ release have been at an impasse for some time.Einav Zangauker, the mother of hostage Matan Zangauker and one of the most vocal and prominent campaigners for a hostage deal, said in a video statement, “Now, more than ever, the lives of my son Matan and the other hostages are in tangible danger.”Ms. Zangauker, addressing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, implored the Israeli government to come up with a new diplomatic initiative. “Don’t bury the hostages,” she said, adding, “You have your victory image. Now bring a deal.”Critics have accused Mr. Netanyahu of delaying a deal in recent months by adding new conditions. Mr. Netanyahu, in turn, blamed the failure on Mr. Sinwar.In a televised statement announcing Mr. Sinwar’s death, Mr. Netanyahu addressed the families of the hostages, saying it was his, and the country’s, “supreme commitment” to bring them home. He called on all those holding the hostages to put down their weapons and give them up, promising that those who did so would be allowed to come out of hiding and live.Ms. Astmaker said it was not clear to the families if the government knew where the hostages were, or what their situation was. The family of Ms. Ariev, the surveillance soldier, last received a sign that she was alive several months ago.The Hostages Families Forum, a grass-roots group that supports the hostages’ families and advocates their release, commended the Israeli security forces for eliminating Mr. Sinwar, but also spoke to the precariousness of the moment.“We express deep concern for the fate of the 101 men, women, elderly and children still held captive by Hamas in Gaza,” the group said in a statement.Yehuda Cohen, the father of an abducted soldier, told Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster, that the death of Mr. Sinwar could have two very different outcomes for the hostages, echoing the concerns of Ms. Astmaker and Ms. Zangauker. It could help advance a process toward their release, he said. But he also said he was “fearful,” particularly after the killing of the six hostages in August.“I hope no order has gone out,” he said, meaning an order for the gunmen holding the hostages to execute them should Mr. Sinwar be killed.Carol Sutherland contributed reporting.For Iran, a key supporter of Hamas, the killing of its leader, Yahya Sinwar, represents another tactical and morale setback among a series of Israeli attacks on its allied militant groups in the region. Iranian officials have not commented yet, but pundits and supporters of the government have started posting messages of condolence on social media. Iranian state news media have published Sinwar’s biography and said that the ideology of Hamas would endure long after the death of its leaders.Here’s a look at the remaining leadership of Hamas, which has long been targeted by Israel.ImageYahya Sinwar in Gaza City last year.Credit...Samar Abu Elouf for The New York TimesThe death of the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed on Wednesday by Israeli forces in Gaza, deals a significant blow to the militant organization.Israel has made eliminating Hamas’s leadership an aim of the war in Gaza, and it considered Mr. Sinwar one of its biggest targets. Long considered by Israel and the United States as the planner of Hamas’s military strategy in Gaza, Mr. Sinwar also took on the role of the organization’s political chief two months ago, after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh.For months, Mr. Sinwar had evaded the sort of Israeli efforts to find and kill him that have led to the deaths of other senior officials in Hamas, including Mr. Haniyeh.Hamas’s leadership structure is opaque, but here is what is known about some of Hamas’s most prominent figures who are still believed to be alive or whose fate is unclear:Khaled Meshal, a former political head of HamasImageKhaled Meshal in Doha, Qatar, in August.Credit...Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/ReutersBorn near the West Bank city of Ramallah, Mr. Meshal became the leader of Hamas’s political office in 1996, directing the group from exile. Two years later, Israeli agents injected him with a slow-acting poison in Jordan, sending him into a coma before he was saved by an antidote provided by Israel as part of a diplomatic deal with Jordan.Mr. Meshal spent his career moving from one Arab nation to another, living in Kuwait, Jordan, Qatar and Syria. When he stepped down as head of the political office, he was succeeded in 2017 by Mr. Haniyeh. Mr. Meshal remains an influential official in the group.Khalil al-Hayya, the deputy leader of Hamas in GazaImageKhalil al-Hayya in Damascus, Syria, in 2022.Credit...Louai Beshara/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMr. al-Hayya, who now lives in exile in Qatar, has been a Hamas official for decades and is Mr. Sinwar’s deputy. He survived an Israeli assassination attempt in 2007, when an airstrike on his home in Gaza killed members of his family while he was not there.Mousa Abu Marzouk, a member of Hamas’s top political bureauImageMoussa Abu Marzouk, center, in Beirut, Lebanon, in January.Credit...Hussein Malla/Associated PressOne of Hamas’s founders, Mr. Abu Marzouk started his political career in the United Arab Emirates, where he helped found a branch of the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood, from which Hamas was formed, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations.He later went to the United States, where he helped found Islamic institutions, including those focused on the Palestinian cause. In 1996, when he headed Hamas’s political bureau, he faced Israeli charges of financing and helping organize terrorist attacks. After 22 months spent in a Manhattan jail on suspicion of terrorism, he agreed to relinquish his permanent resident status in the United States and said he would not contest the terrorism accusations that led to his detention. The United States then deported him to Jordan.Muhammad Deif, the commander of Hamas’s militaryImageAn undated handout photo reportedly shows Muhammad Deif.Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMr. Deif, another of the suspected planners of the Oct. 7 attacks, joined Hamas as a young man. In 2002, he became the leader of Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, succeeding its founder, who was killed in an Israeli strike. Mr. Deif has since orchestrated multiple attacks on Israel, including a series of suicide bombings in 1996.In July, Israeli forces bombarded a densely packed coastal area of Gaza with heavy munitions in an attempt to kill Mr. Deif. Scores of Gazans were killed in the attack. Israel’s military later said that it had killed Mr. Deif in the strike. Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied his death.He had been at the top of Israel’s list of most-wanted terrorists for decades, earlier evading more than eight attempts on his life, according to Israeli intelligence. In 2014, an Israeli airstrike killed one of his wives and their infant son.",
