These dust particles, suspended in the air, have trapped heat, exacerbating the already high temperatures, and reduced visibility to as low as 1,000 metres (3,280ft). Local authorities have advised local people and visitors to stay indoors as the dust cloud lingers, as it can trigger respiratory issues and irritation to the eyes.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionElsewhere, Cyclone Chido has continued its destructive path, making landfall in Malawi on 15 December as a moderate tropical storm with wind speeds of 124mph (200km/h) and heavy rainfall. As of 18 December, the storm has killed an additional seven people and injured a further 16. The cyclone has damaged more than 250 houses in the region, swept roofs off buildings, and blocked roads.",
