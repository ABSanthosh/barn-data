  "text": "Donald Trump may no longer be able to run again, but that hasn’t stopped him from dominating the political fundraising game. The US president has already raised at least $600 million for his political causes, with a goal of reaching $1 billion ahead of the midterm elections next year, according to sources quoted by the Associated Press.Despite being a lame-duck president, Trump has kept a packed fundraising schedule. Those close to his team say the objective is simple — to keep a firm grip on the Republican Party, help push his second-term agenda, and ensure GOP control in Congress after next year’s elections.Trump, who once resisted asking donors for money, is now embracing fundraising with full force. “It’s leverage,” said Marc Short, a former top aide to both Trump and Mike Pence. “It’s a reflection of the power that he still holds.”His fundraising machinery sprang into action the day after his election win. According to sources, Trump surprised his team by calling for an immediate resumption of fundraising, not just for the transition or inauguration, but for political committees that would showcase his continued clout. Donors were asked to “double up.” If they had given $1 million before, Trump wanted another million after.Behind this operation are seasoned campaign hands like Chris LaCivita, Trump’s 2024 co-campaign manager, and longtime pollster Tony Fabrizio. The money is being spread across a web of political entities, including MAGA Inc., Never Surrender PAC, and a nonprofit called Securing American Greatness, which recently launched TV ads promoting Trump’s tax agenda.Some events have grabbed headlines for their exclusivity and high price tags. Earlier this month, a $1.5 million-per-head fundraiser was held at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia for AI and crypto backers. In April and March, he hosted “candlelight dinners” at Mar-a-Lago.Watchdogs and Democrats have often criticised Trump for blurring the lines between official duties and campaign fundraising. Many of the donors attending these events also have business before the government. However, with a conservative Supreme Court and Republican control in Congress, campaign finance regulations have been steadily weakened.Trump’s team is reserving much of the funds for next year’s primaries and midterms. The focus is on holding the House and potentially punishing Republican incumbents who’ve gone against his agenda. Trump is already rolling out endorsements across the country and has made it clear he’ll play a major role in upcoming races.“I’m going to be very active,” Trump said recently on Meet the Press, adding, “I’ve raised a lot of money for congressmen and senators that I think are really good people.”Trump’s aides say he doesn’t want a repeat of 2018, when Republicans lost the House and Democrats later impeached him twice — once over Ukraine and again after the Capitol riot.There are questions, however, about how much of the money will actually go to other candidates. In 2022, MAGA Inc. spent just $19 million, a small portion compared to other GOP groups. Most of it went to attacking Democrats like Fetterman, Warnock, and Kelly — all of whom won.Still, insiders believe this time could be different. With limited personal political ambitions left, some expect Trump to pour more into races. “Those who think Trump will be more generous say he has little else to do with the cash,” one source told the Associated Press.At the Senate Republican committee, members have been told not to count on presidential support. “I would be shocked if that changes,” Short said. “I don’t think anybody’s sitting there thinking: Maybe he’ll give me some of that.”",
