  "text": "Photo: Instagram/virginiarobertsrising11Virginia Giuffre, a woman who became a central figure in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case, is once again making headlines — but this time for deeply personal and tragic reasons. The 41-year-old advocate, known for her tireless efforts to support victims of sexual abuse, took to Instagram to share a devastating update, claiming that she has only days left to live after suffering kidney failure from a severe car accident. Posting a harrowing image of herself bruised and lying in a hospital bed, Giuffre described the start of 2025 as \"the worst start to a new year.\" While she refrained from going into detail, she revealed that the accident involved a school bus traveling at 110 km/h (68 mph), and the collision left her critically injured, eventually leading to renal failure. Doctors have reportedly informed her that she has just four days to live. With her trademark bluntness, Giuffre wrote, “I’m ready to go, just not until I see my babies one last time.” Messages of support have poured in from across the globe, with her father, Sky Roberts, responding with an emotional plea, praying for her survival and offering any help he can.To truly understand the significance of this moment, it’s important to reflect on Giuffre's journey. As a leading survivor of the Epstein scandal, she has transformed her pain into a forceful advocacy for justice and victims' rights.Virginia Giuffre is an American woman who became widely known for her accusations against prominent figures in the context of the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case. She alleged that she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with several powerful men, including financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein himself, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, and Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Giuffre filed a lawsuit against Prince Andrew in 2021, accusing him of sexual abuse, which he denied. The case led to significant media attention, and in 2022, Prince Andrew settled the lawsuit out of court without admitting liability. Giuffre has been a vocal advocate for justice for victims of sexual abuse and human trafficking, and her story has contributed to the broader scrutiny of Epstein's network of associates. Her name has been associated with various legal proceedings related to Epstein's alleged activities, and she is often seen as one of the key figures in the ongoing investigations and revelations about Epstein’s abuse.Also, the demand to release the full list of Epstein files gained ground on Monday after Giuffre made a social media post claiming that she was dying.",
