Additionally, Meta will bring on around 1 gigawatt in compute and end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, he said.\"This is a massive effort, and over the coming years it will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation, and extend American technology leadership,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Facebook.Meta shares closed at $647.49 on Friday, a new all-time high after the announcement.The company has been pouring billions of dollars into AI and ramping up related research and development in recent years, but it's a fiercely competitive market and will take time before investors begin to reap those benefits. In an April call with investors, Zuckerberg said he expects to see a \"multiyear investment cycle\" before Meta's AI products will scale into profitable services, but he also noted that the company has a \"strong track record\" in that department.Shares of Meta plunged 16% at the time. The company still generates the vast majority of its revenue from digital advertising.Zuckerberg said Friday that he expects the company's Meta AI digital assistant to become the \"leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people.\" Meta is also building an AI engineer that will contribute \"increasing amounts of code to our R\u0026D efforts,\" Zuckerberg added.\"We have the capital to continue investing in the years ahead,\" he wrote in his Facebook post.",
