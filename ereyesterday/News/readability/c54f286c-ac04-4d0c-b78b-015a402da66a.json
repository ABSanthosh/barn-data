  "text": "The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, has shared a rare and touching photo of Prince Harry with their daughter, Lilibet, in celebration of International Women’s Day. Meghan shared the heartfelt image on Instagram, showing the three-year-old curled up on her father’s lap as he gently kisses her head while they relax on a boat.The post included additional photographs celebrating influential women, featuring a cheerful selfie of Meghan with her mother, Doria Ragland. The collection also contained an intimate snapshot of Meghan and Harry sharing a joyful embrace on the beach.The caption read: Celebrating the strong women around us \u0026 the girls with dreams who will become women with vision. Also thanking those who uplift us every day.'Despite mixed reviews of her new Netflix programme With Love, Meghan appears enthusiastic, announcing its second season renewal through a celebratory Instagram dance. Industry sources suggest the surrounding controversy influenced the decision for renewal.Responding to recent criticism, she acknowledged her learning process, admitting she makes mistakes, but emphasised that she is \"learning every day\" following the widespread backlash to her highly anticipated Netflix show.She said: 'Right now! I’m launching my business, As Ever, which has been my heartsong for years. Every day I’m learning so much as a founder. I’m taking baby steps and big strides at the same time, making mistakes and learning from them, and really working to find all the joy while diving into the creative process and the business,”'Being in the granular parts of the business gives me the same feeling I have when I’m gardening: bare hands in the soil, planting a seed with so much care, and nurturing it as it grows.There’s something energizing about being in my 40s and turning my passion project into a business - and sharing that with the world,” she added.Meghan's show sees her welcoming famous friends to a California estate, where she shares tips on cooking, gardening, and hosting. However, critics have panned the series, dismissing it as “gormless lifestyle filler” with a “tangible desperation.” Some reviewers claim the Duchess is “trying to cling to fame by any means possible,” while another described a scene where she “joylessly fills kids’ party bags with seeds.”Similarly, Kate Middleton marked International Women’s Day with a heartfelt tribute, sharing a series of posts dedicated to women who have inspired her over the past year.\"Celebrating #InternationalWomensDay! Here are just a few of the brilliant women who have inspired us over the last 12 months,\" she wrote on X.Among those honored was 17-year-old photographer Liz Hatton, who tragically passed away from cancer last year. Kate reflected on her meeting with Liz and her mother, Vicky, in Windsor last October, praising their strength and resilience.\"Celebrating the strength, resilience, and creativity of Liz and her mother, Vicky. It was an honor meeting them both. Liz’s memory lives on in Vicky’s unwavering resilience. Thank you for such a moving moment,\" she wrote in one post.",
