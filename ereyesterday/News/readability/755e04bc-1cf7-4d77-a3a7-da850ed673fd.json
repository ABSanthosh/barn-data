  "text": "JAFFA, Israel — Israel has declined to renew the visa for a top U.N. official in the occupied Palestinian territories in what humanitarian officials say is part of a pattern of Israel retaliating against those who criticize its conduct in the Gaza war and toward Palestinians.Jonathan Whittall of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is the latest local head of a U.N. agency to be denied a visa to Israel, according to Farhan Haq, a spokesman for Secretary General António Gutteres. OCHA monitors, coordinates aid, and advocates for international humanitarian law in Gaza and the West Bank.A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment. The Israeli mission to the U.N. in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“Each time we report on what we see, we face threats of further reduced access to the civilians we are trying to serve,” Tom Fletcher, head of humanitarian affairs for the U.N., told the Security Council Wednesday. “Nowhere today is the tension between our advocacy mandate and delivering aid greater than in Gaza. Visas are not renewed or reduced in duration, explicitly in response to our work on protection of civilians.”Phillip Lazzarini, the director of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, or UNRWA, has not been granted a visa since June 2024, according to agency spokeswoman Juliette Touma. The local heads of U.N. Women and the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights have also been denied visas, Haq said in a statement.“In recent months, we’ve seen Israeli visas for U.N. staff in the Occupied Palestinian Territory renewed for shorter durations,” Haq said. “This is in addition to the long-standing refusal to grant visas to certain U.N. agencies.”An OCHA spokesman said the agency was notified of the decision last week.“This came immediately after remarks in a press briefing about starving people being killed while trying to reach food,” spokesman Eri Kaneko said.“Speaking about conditions on the ground is part of OCHA’s mandate,” he said. “Attempts to silence us are not new, but threats of reduced access to the civilians we’re trying to serve are intensifying.”Israel has long accused the United Nations of unfairly singling it out for criticism. U.N. officials deny the claim. Relations have deteriorated further during Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza.Hamas-led fighters streamed out of the enclave early on Oct. 7, 2023, to attack communities in southern Israel. They killed around 1,200 Israelis and took another 250 back to Gaza as hostages. Israel responded with a military campaign that has killed more than 58,000 Palestinians in the enclave, according to the Gaza health ministry, destroyed most of its buildings and infrastructure and displaced nearly all of its 2.2 million people, according to U.N. officials.Israel has accused UNRWA of ties to the militant group Hamas. It banned the group in January. UNRWA said Israel did not provide evidence and rejected the claim. But the ban has had sweeping implications for the delivery of lifesaving humanitarian aid in Gaza, where UNRWA is the backbone of relief efforts. The agency now has no international staffers in the Palestinian territories, Touma said.The agencies whose leaders are being targeted are “the ones who do advocacy, the ones who do rights work,” said one U.N. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.Israel and the United Nations have been at odds for years. But according to the official, Israel now is “more coercive, they’re more emboldened, and they basically know that they can get away with it. It just means a further weakening of the important functions which OCHA performs.”Whitall is one of a small group of international humanitarian staffers still allowed access to Gaza. Israel has banned international media from reporting independently from the enclave, and has targeted Palestinian journalists with drone strikes, claiming they are militants.In recent months, Whittall has become a face of the humanitarian response in Gaza.“While the world’s attention is elsewhere, people in Gaza today are being killed trying to reach food,” he told reporters late last month. He criticized a new U.S. and Israeli-backed aid distribution program, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, created to replace the U.N.-led system there.Israeli troops have repeatedly opened fire near crowds waiting to collect food aid at GHF distribution sites. The Israeli military has described its actions as “warning shots.”More than 670 people have been killed since GHF began distributing food in late May, according to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. Thousands more have been wounded.“As military operations continue from the air and ground, there remains an abhorrent disregard for humanitarian law,” Whittall said last month. “People’s lives and dignity are under attack every day. Everything I have described is entirely preventable. These are conditions created to kill.”In April, Whithall helped lead the search for 14 Palestinian emergency workers found in a mass grave in southern Gaza.The Israeli military says its soldiers believed the men were militants and fired on them from a distance. A Washington Post analysis of the events of that predawn morning, based on dispatcher records, witness testimony, video footage, satellite imagery and photographs of the dead, found shots were fired at close range and that the vehicles were clearly marked as belonging to first responders.“The general pattern has been you don’t get a visa if you speak out,” Touma said. “The latest is about the new so-called aid mechanism,” she said, referring to GHF. “But it’s generally anyone who speaks about the atrocities of what the Israeli army is doing in Gaza or against the policies in the West Bank or about the violations that the government of Israel is committing.”Loveluck reported from London.",
