McDonald's also pulled the onions.Restaurants in a dozen US states temporarily pulled the burgers from their menus this month amid the outbreak linked to them.The number of people sickened now stands at 90, including 27 who had to be hospitalized, and an elderly man in Colorado died.McDonald's on Sunday said it would resume selling its Quarter Pounder hamburgers after tests for e.Coli came back negative.The e.Coli bacterium causes stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting that last three to four days.
