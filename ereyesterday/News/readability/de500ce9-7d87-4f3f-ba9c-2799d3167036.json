  "text": "BERLIN — Germany’s domestic intelligence agency on Friday designated the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, as an “extremist endeavor,” a move that lowers hurdles for the spy agency in conducting certain kinds of surveillance on the party, the second-largest in Germany’s parliament.In a statement, the intelligence agency said the designation was “due to the extremist nature of the entire party, which disregards human dignity.” The statement cited the group’s anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant orientation.The reclassification — AfD was previously designated a “suspected” extremist group — is likely to reignite debate over potentially banning the party via Germany’s Constitutional Court. Such a move would initiate a lengthy legal process lasting years that experts and even the AfD’s fiercest critics say may carry greater risks than rewards.AfD party leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla called the upgraded classification a “severe blow to German democracy” and said the party was being publicly discredited and criminalized shortly before a change of government in Germany. The country’s chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, is due to be elected by parliament and sworn in Tuesday.The Trump administration has shown support for the AfD, including ahead of parliamentary elections in February, and on Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the decision “tyranny in disguise” in a post on X. “What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD,” Rubio wrote, “but rather the establishment’s deadly open border immigration policies that the AfD opposes.”The post prompted a response from Germany’s foreign ministry, which said the decision was “the result of a thorough \u0026 independent investigation.”Vice President JD Vance had previously denounced the AfD’s exclusion from German politics at the Munich Security Conference in February and met with Weidel. The AfD denies being a far-right party. One of the party’s most controversial figures has twice been convicted and fined for using a banned Nazi slogan. German authorities said Friday’s designation by the intelligence agency, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, or BfV, was based on an expert review spanning about three years. Statements and positions from high-ranking AfD party representatives from across Germany were included in the report.“The AfD’s ethnic and descent-based understanding of the people, which devalues ​​entire population groups in Germany and violates their human dignity,” was decisive in the classification, BfV Vice Presidents Sinan Selen and Silke Willems said in a joint statement. “This understanding of the people is reflected in the party’s overall anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim stance,” they added.While some in Germany have argued that banning the country’s second-most-popular party could be harmful to a functioning democracy, others fear that if courts reject a ban on the party, it could strengthen AfD by feeding its narrative of persecution.Outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Friday that the domestic intelligence agency provided detailed justification but that proceedings to ban the party must not be rushed.“I am against a hasty decision,” Scholz said.Founded in 2013 as a Euroskeptic party, support for the AfD grew significantly at the height of the migration crisis a decade ago, enabling the party to win seats in the federal parliament for the first time in 2017. Despite shifting further to the right, the AfD has continued to grow and in February achieved its highest share of the national vote.During the winter election campaign, Scholz accused Vance of interfering in domestic affairs after Vance denounced efforts by the German establishment to keep the far right out of power. All parties in Germany currently rule out cooperation with the AfD as part of the country’s political fire wall — the post-World War II agreement by mainstream parties to block the far right from being part of any government.Vance’s comments came after tech billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump adviser, declared in December that “only the AfD can save Germany.” Musk later told AfD supporters via a video call at an election rally in January that Germans should “move beyond” the country’s historical guilt, in an apparent reference to the Nazi dictatorship and the atrocities of the Holocaust.In September, the AfD made history as the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since World War II. In the February elections, the AfD doubled its vote count compared with the 2021 elections and finished as the second-strongest party, with 20.8 percent of the vote.When the party was designated as a “suspected” extremist group, the use of intelligence resources to surveil the group, including with informants and video and audio recordings, was permitted. Under the new classification, however, the threshold for using such means is lower.The reclassification of the AfD at a federal level was expected last year, but the domestic intelligence agency held off, citing concerns that it could be accused of violating political parties’ right to equal opportunities during the election campaign. The AfD has long claimed that the classifications are politically motivated.",
