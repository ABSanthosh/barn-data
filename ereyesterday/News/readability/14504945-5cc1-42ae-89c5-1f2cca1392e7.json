  "text": "At least 6,000 inmates escaped from a high-security prison in Mozambique’s capital Maputo on Christmas Day after a rebellion, the chief of police has said, as widespread post-election riots and violence continue to engulf the country.The police general commander, Bernardino Rafael, said 33 prisoners had died and 15 others were injured during a confrontation with the security forces.The prisoners fled during violent protests in which police cars, stations and general public infrastructure were destroyed after Mozambique’s constitutional council confirmed the ruling Frelimo party as the winner of the 9 October elections.The escape from Maputo’s central prison, located 14km south-west of the city, started about midday on Wednesday after “agitation” by a “group of subversive protesters”, Rafael said. He said prisoners at the facility had snatched weapons from prison officers and began freeing other detainees.Rafael said: “A curious fact is that in that prison we had 29 convicted terrorists, who they released. We are worried, as a country, as Mozambicans, as members of the defence and security forces.“They[protesters] were making noise demanding that they be able to remove the prisoners who are there serving their sentences”, said Rafael, adding that the protests led to the collapse of a wall, allowing the prisoners to flee.He called for the voluntary surrender of the escaped prisoners and for the population to be informed about the fugitives.Videos circulating on social media showed the moment inmates left the prison, while other recordings revealed the captures made by military personnel and prison guards. Many prisoners tried to hide in homes, but some were unsuccessful and were detained.In an amateur video, one prisoner, still with handcuffs on his right wrist, said he had been in the disciplinary section of the maximum security prison and had been released by other inmates.",
