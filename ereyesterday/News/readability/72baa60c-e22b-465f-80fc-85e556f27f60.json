President Trump called on President Vladimir V. Putin to “STOP!” in a post on social media.VideoThe attack, the biggest on the capital since last summer, came hours after the Trump administration threatened to walk away from peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.CreditCredit...Brendan Hoffman for The New York TimesApril 24, 2025Updated 7:06 p.m. ETRussia killed at least 12 people and injured 90 others in a huge attack on the Ukrainian capital early Thursday, prompting President Trump to issue a rare public criticism of Moscow just hours after he lashed out at President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.The assault was the deadliest on the capital, Kyiv, since last summer. Explosions shook buildings and sent more than 16,000 people into the subway system to take shelter; clouds of smoke rose over the city as the sun came up.One missile hit a two-story building with 12 apartments where emergency workers hunted for survivors. A five-story building next door lost all its windows. People stood outside, staring at the damage and talking on their phones, telling loved ones that they were alive. No military target was visible nearby.Mr. Zelensky said nearly 70 missiles, including ballistic ones, and about 150 attack drones had targeted cities across the country — although Kyiv was hit the hardest.In a post on social media, he said later that Russia had also attacked 150 frontline positions using the “massive strike” as cover. He said the “situation was toughest” in the area of Pokrovsk, a key rail and road hub for Ukraine’s army.On Thursday, Mr. Trump lashed out at President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia about the attack, showing how his administration’s positions can seem to flip-flop without warning.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
