  "text": "At least 12 medical workers were killed in Lebanon on Friday, including the director of the Dar Al-Amal University Hospital in Baalbek province — as the World Health Organization condemned an “extremely worrying pattern” of deadly attacks on Lebanon’s health sector and medical workers in Belgium gathered in solidarity with health workers in Gaza and Lebanon.Lebanon’s health ministry said Ali Allam, the hospital director, was killed in his home next to the hospital in an Israeli strike along with six of his colleagues. Allam’s death was a “great loss,” the health ministry statement said, adding that Allam was “known for his closeness to the people and his quick response to their needs.”The hospital was the largest in the Baalbek-Hermel governorate, which has been pounded by airstrikes in recent days. In an interview with The Post late last month, Allam said that despite airstrikes in the area, the hospital would not close or evacuate its patients.Another five health-care workers were killed in Lebanon while others were wounded in Gaza, local authorities said Friday.Three paramedics from the Islamic Health Committee, a Hezbollah-affiliated civil defense organization, were killed and three others injured in an attack on the southern town of Qotrani, the country’s Health Ministry said Friday.Earlier the same day, two other paramedics from the same organization were killed in an Israeli attack on a vehicle in the southern town of Deir Qanoun Ras al-Ain, according to the ministry.Israel has accused Hezbollah, without providing evidence, of using ambulances to transport fighters.Lebanese health authorities said that as of Wednesday 214 health workers had been killed and 321 wounded since Oct. 7, 2023. It said there had been dozens of attacks on hospitals and emergency workers.In northern Gaza, medical staff were injured in an attack on the Kamal Adwan Hospital on Thursday night, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which blamed Israeli forces and said the hospital was left without oxygen or water. The Israeli military said it was not aware of a strike in the area of the hospital but said that “the area in question is an active war zone.”“The same scene repeats and worsens,” the hospital’s director, Hossam Abu Safiya, told The Post. “Every time the hospital is targeted, it leaves behind casualties and destruction of infrastructure. In light of scarce resources, the inability to bring in medical delegations, and restrictions on medical supplies, ambulances, and civil defense vehicles, we urgently appeal to the international community, global organizations, and humanitarian institutions to intervene immediately.”Meanwhile, medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said Friday on X that an Israeli drone strike the previous afternoon almost hit five of its Palestinian and international staff who were returning home from Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis.“As always, the Israeli authorities were notified about our movements and the vehicle was identifiable with an MSF logo,” the charity said. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The WHO said Friday in a news release that almost half of the 137 attacks on health care in Lebanon between Oct. 7, 2023, and Nov. 18 resulted in the death of a health worker or patient — “a higher percentage than in any active conflict today across the globe,” including Ukraine and Gaza, it said.Almost 1,200 attacks were registered in the occupied Palestinian territory over the same period, according to the release.“Depriving civilians of access to lifesaving care and targeting health providers is a breach of international humanitarian law,” said Abdinasir Abubakar, WHO representative in Lebanon, in the release.Meanwhile, in Brussels, a group of health workers gathered in solidarity with health workers in Gaza and Lebanon to denounce what they called the “systematic dismantling of healthcare systems” there.",
