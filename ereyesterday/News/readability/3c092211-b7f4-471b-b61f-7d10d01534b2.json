  "text": "President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to Hamas on Monday saying that if all Israeli hostages are not released from Gaza by Saturday “all hell is going to break out.”“If all of the hostages aren’t returned by Saturday at 12 o’clock … I would say, cancel it and all bets are off and let hell break out,” he said in remarks to reporters.When asked whether he meant retaliation, Trump said, “You’ll find out, and they’ll find out, too. Hamas will find out what I mean.”Trump’s strong comments came after Hamas earlier in the day said it would delay “until further notice” the release of three Israeli hostages set for Saturday — the first major setback for the ceasefire and hostage-release deal.Hamas blamed its delay on recent Israeli shelling and gunfire in Gaza, along with an insufficient flow of aid, in a statement announcing the move. The group said it remained committed to the ceasefire agreement’s terms. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said that a delay in releases would represent a “complete violation” of the agreement, and that Israel’s military would assume its “highest level of readiness.”An Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a consultation with senior defense officials after the Hamas statement and would move Tuesday’s security cabinet meeting to the morning.In a statement, Hamas said it had announced the delay five days ahead of the expected release to leave time for negotiations.The move by Hamas came as Trump said Palestinians displaced from Gaza to neighboring countries, under his proposal for the United States to “own” Gaza and develop real estate there, would not have the right to return to the enclave. His comments came during an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier set to air Monday evening, portions of which were released on Sunday and Monday.“Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land,” Trump said of the plan, which he first floated last week during Netanyahu’s visit to Washington.Asked by Baier if Palestinians would be allowed to return to Gaza, Trump replied: “No, they wouldn’t, because they’re going to have much better housing. In other words, I’m talking about building a permanent place for them.” Trump mentioned Jordan and Egypt as countries that would take in Gaza’s Palestinians, and he expressed optimism about making a “deal” with the two governments.“You know, we give them billions and billions of dollars a year,” he said.Trump’s initial proposal last week prompted a swift rejection from Saudi Arabia and sparked anger in nearby countries, including Jordan, that are already home to millions of Palestinian refugees. Jordan’s leader, King Abdullah II, is set to meet the president in Washington on Tuesday.Here’s what else to know:Netanyahu, in an address to Israel’s legislature Monday, called his meeting with Trump last week, at which Trump unveiled his plan for Gaza, “the most significant” he had “ever had with an American president.” Israel sees “eye to eye with the U.S. administration on all the goals of the war,” Netanyahu said.The United Nations on Monday said it had paused operations in an area of Yemen controlled by Houthi rebels, following their detention of eight U.N. staffers, on top of the dozens already detained. “The United Nations remains fully committed to assist the millions of people in need across Yemen,” the statement said.Images of “emaciated Israeli hostages” released Saturday by Hamas under the ceasefire agreement were “deeply distressing,” the U.N. Human Rights Office said in a statement Monday, as were the “severe conditions” that Palestinian detainees released by Israel under the deal had faced. The statement also expressed concern over “the public parading of hostages released by Hamas.”Israel’s military withdrew Sunday from the Netzarim Corridor — a line of fortified checkpoints dividing the central Gaza Strip — as part of the ceasefire deal with Hamas, the militant group said, allowing Palestinians to begin traveling toward the north. Photos showed people traveling from the south of the enclave in vehicles piled high with mattresses and other belongings.Israel sent a negotiating team over the weekend to Qatar, where talks for the second phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire are set to occur. Three male Israeli hostages were released Saturday in exchange for 183 Palestinian prisoners, in the fifth round of releases under the current ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group.Hazem Balousha, Niha Masih, Lior Soroka and Matt Viser contributed to this report.",
