  "text": "US President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order to withdraw US from several UN organisations, including the Human Rights Council (UNHRC), while initiating a comprehensive assessment of US financial contributions to the multinational organisation.The White House also withdrew from the primary UN relief organisation for Palestinians (UNRWA), alongside a planned evaluation of involvement with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).White House staff secretary Will Scharf explained these actions were taken in response to perceived \"anti-American bias\" within these UN agencies.The United States, amongst 47 members elected by the General Assembly for three-year terms in the UN Human Rights Council, was set to conclude its current term on December 31, maintaining observer status at present.The directive issued on Tuesday appears to terminate all American engagement in council activities, encompassing both country-specific human rights assessments and investigations into particular rights violations.\"More generally, the executive order calls for review of American involvement and funding in the UN in light of the wild disparities and levels of funding among different countries,\" Scharf said.The Republican has consistently criticised Washington's substantial financial contributions to international organisations, particularly urging other nations to increase their share at NATO.UNRWA serves as the primary humanitarian organisation for Palestinians, providing essential aid to approximately 1.9 million displaced individuals in Gaza who rely on its assistance for basic survival.Earlier, the Biden administration suspended US funding to UNRWA in January 2024 after Israel claimed 12 staff members participated in Hamas's October 7, 2023, assault.Several investigations identified some concerns regarding neutrality at UNRWA but failed to substantiate Israel's primary accusations. Subsequently, most donors who had suspended their support resumed their financial contributions.",
