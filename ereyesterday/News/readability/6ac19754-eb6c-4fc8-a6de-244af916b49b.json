  "text": "Of the more than 200 wildfires incinerating Canadian forests — and sending smoke into the United States — more than half are burning “out of control,” and some are being monitored but allowed to burn, Canadian authorities said.As fires intensify, so do concerns over air quality. But conditions on the ground mean that suppressing many of the fires swiftly is not realistic, authorities and researchers say.Although Canadian authorities have mobilized a “full response” to most of the fires, which means firefighters are actively trying to suppress them, the majority are expected to continue growing, and some are being observed and analyzed without an immediate response, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center (CIFFC) said.Severe winds and smoke complicate suppression efforts, significantly impairing visibility, and remote areas with tall flames pose significant challenges for the deployment of firefighters, according to wildfire researchers in Canada.If there’s no imminent threat to human life or buildings and infrastructure, it is common practice for wildfires not to be immediately suppressed, said Paul Kovacs, executive director for the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction in Toronto.“Part of risk management is occasionally you say, ‘What’s appropriate for what we know about this fire?’ It’s possible that the proper response is to let it burn,” Kovacs said.The fires have scorched some 5.4 million acres, according to the CIFFC, mostly in forested areas north of the county’s major population centers. Two people died in fires last month in the province of Manitoba, according to reporting by the CBC, Canada’s national broadcaster.Whether a fire is fought, and to what degree, comes down to decisions by agencies on the ground across Canada’s provinces, Awa Cissé, a communications officer for CIFFC, said in an email.Authorities in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, which border the United States, have declared states of emergency. In Manitoba, 17,000 residents have been ordered to leave in the “largest evacuation Manitoba will have seen in most people’s living memory,” Premier Wab Kinew said at a news conference last week.Historically, Indigenous communities, most of whom live in fire-prone and under-resourced areas, are disproportionately affected by wildfires, the Canadian government says.Of the 203 active blazes, about 104 are deemed “out of control” by CIFFC as of Wednesday and an additional seven are “out of control” but are being monitored by fire agencies. About 24 fires are not expected to grow past boundaries already determined by authorities and about 68 are contained and expected to be extinguished.The biggest wildfires are concentrated in Canada’s boreal forest, which spans the country’s vast north. Experts say fires are more difficult to contain in remote parts of Canada than places more dense with roads and infrastructure, such as California.All Canadian firefighters have been mobilized in response to the fires, and about 140 firefighters from the United States are also engaged, though that number can change as the situation develops, the CIFFC said.Far-reaching heavy plumes of smoke have traveled across North America, an inevitability given the atmospheric conditions, said fire ecologist Lori Daniels, a professor in the department of forest and conservation sciences at the University of British Columbia.Smoke has reached as far as Europe, skies were hazy in northern Florida over the weekend, and air quality in the U.S. Midwest and on the East Coast has been affected. The National Weather Service issued air quality warnings Wednesday, including for parts of New York and New England. Smoke particles can cause health issues and worsen asthma, experts warn.“The atmosphere doesn’t differentiate between international borders,” Daniels said. “That’s a reality on both sides of the border. We sometimes drink smoke that comes from the U.S., and unfortunately, right now, the U.S. is drinking smoke that comes from Canada.”While the smoke might be harmful to humans, wildfires are not purely destructive — another reason the goal is not always to extinguish them. They are sometimes determined to be beneficial by provincial agencies, to get rid of forest pests and maintain land, according to Mike Flannigan, an expert on wildfires at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia. In the boreal forest, Flannigan said, blazes are part of a “cycle of life” on land home to highly flammable spruce and pine trees.",
