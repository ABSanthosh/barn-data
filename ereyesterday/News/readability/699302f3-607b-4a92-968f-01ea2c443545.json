  "text": "Heavy downpours flooded and submerged parts of Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo’s capital, over the weekend, destroying roads, inundating homes and killing about 30 people, according to officials.The Ndjili River that flows through the city of around 17 million overflowed its banks Friday, sending floodwaters cascading through some neighborhoods. Footage published by wire agencies showed cars, trucks and the lower floors of homes almost completely submerged in muddy water.Some were killed as walls collapsed amid the surging floodwaters, provincial health minister Patricien Gongo said on social media Saturday. A number of survivors were taken to hospitals for treatment, he said. Gongo told Reuters on Sunday that the provisional death toll stood at around 30.Kinshasa Gov. Daniel Bumba offered condolences to the families of the flood victims in a recorded statement Sunday. He said government officials met for a crisis meeting to “provide immediate solutions.”The central African country’s capital is on the southern bank of the Congo River, the second-longest river in Africa, and is prone to flooding. The Ndjili River flows through parts of Kinshasa and connects to the Congo River.Major floods have wreaked havoc in Congo in recent years, with torrential downpours displacing hundreds of thousands of families and killing more than 300 in late 2023 and early 2024. Those rains caused the Congo River to rise more than 20 feet, to its highest levels in more than six decades. Heavy rains resumed months later, exacerbating the crisis.The latest destructive floods come amid reports Congo held private talks with the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel movement to stop fighting in a bloody conflict that has killed at least hundreds and displaced thousands in the country’s east. In January, the rebel group began a lightning offensive and took control of Goma, a large eastern city. Since then, the rebels have dismissed calls for ceasefire and the violence has continued.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s senior adviser for Africa, Massad Boulos, said after meeting with Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi last week that Washington is in talks with Congo over a possible minerals deal, according to a readout issued by the president’s office.Boulos’s Congo visit marked his first official trip in his new role. The U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa described it as a visit to “advance efforts for durable peace in eastern Congo and to promote U.S. private sector investment in the region.”",
