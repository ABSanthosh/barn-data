  "text": "Israeli forces will remain in southern Lebanon past the 60-day withdrawal deadline set by the ceasefire agreement with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in November, according to a statement Friday from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a move that Hezbollah described earlier as a “blatant violation of the agreement.”In response, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes called for “a short, temporary ceasefire extension,” saying it is “urgently needed.”In his statement, Netanyahu said the planned Sunday withdrawal of the Israeli military was conditioned on the Lebanese army’s deployment into southern Lebanon, and the withdrawal of Hezbollah beyond the Litani River. However, “since the ceasefire agreement has not yet been fully enforced by the Lebanese state, [Israel’s] gradual withdrawal process will continue, in full coordination with the United States,” the statement said.Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati raised the possibility of a delayed Israeli withdrawal earlier this week, saying during a televised interview that he was told the delay could be a “few days” by U.S. Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, the co-chair of the ceasefire committee. On Friday, a spokesman for the Lebanese military said they had yet to be formally notified of Israel’s plan to miss the withdrawal deadline.Hezbollah warned Thursday against “any pretexts or arguments to prolong the occupation” by Israeli troops in the south. In a statement, it called for Lebanon’s political leadership to pressure the ceasefire’s sponsors, including the United States and France, “to act effectively and keep pace with the last days of the deadline in a way that ensures the full withdrawal.”“Exceeding the sixty day period is considered a blatant violation of the agreement,” the Hezbollah statement said, adding that it “requires the state to deal with it by all means and methods guaranteed by international conventions to restore the land and reclaim it from the occupation.”In his statement, Hughes, the NSC spokesman, said the U.S. would “work closely with our regional partners to finalize the extension.”Here’s what else to knowIsrael’s U.N. envoy said that UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, must cease its operations in Jerusalem and vacate the offices it operates in the city by Jan. 30, in a letter to the Secretary General of the United Nations.The Israel Defense Forces said Friday that troops fired warning shots at armed people who approached Israeli positions in several areas in Gaza over the past day. It did not say whether anyone was hurt.Netanyahu said on X that Tesla CEO Elon Musk was “being falsely smeared,” after the billionaire made two hand gestures during a speech Monday following President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Musk disputed accusations that the gestures resembled Nazi salutes. In his post Thursday, Netanyahu called Musk a “great friend of Israel.”The U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Yemen said in statement Friday that the United Nations has suspended “all official movements” in areas under the control of the Houthi militant group, after the Houthis detained additional U.N. personnel. Since May, the Houthis, who control much of the north in a divided Yemen, have arbitrarily detained dozens of U.N. employees and members of civil society groups and nongovernmental organizations.",
