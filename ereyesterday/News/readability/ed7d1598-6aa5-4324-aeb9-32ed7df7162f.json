The incident occurred in the Serra Mesa area near Aero Drive.A spokesperson for SDPD said the motorcyclists “failed to yield,” prompted the traffic stop. When the riders finally came to a stop, they reportedly did not do so on the shoulder of the roadway. Instead, police said the riders were blocking a lane of traffic, which is why the northbound freeway was temporarily shutdown.The freeway reopened a short time later, though some lanes were impacted for around two hours for the response. Due to the large number of motorcyclists stopped, additional officers were called in to assist. The SDPD spokesperson confirmed that traffic stop led to three arrests for a felony warrant and “weapons-related offenses.”No further details were immediately provided by police.Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
