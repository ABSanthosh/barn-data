  "text": "Modern dating dynamics and shifting gender roles have played an important role in Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential election, according to a recent New York Times op-ed. The publication, written by playwright Sarah Bernstein, attributes Trump’s popularity with young men to resentment over women outpacing men in education and employment — a trend tied to cultural expectations rooted in age-old fairy tales.The ‘Cinderella effect’Bernstein points to the popular Disney princess Cinderella as a prime example of traditional narratives shaping societal expectations. In the story, Cinderella’s life improves by marrying a wealthy prince, reflecting the historical belief that a woman’s status depended on finding a successful husband. Meanwhile, the prince is valued solely for his wealth and position, reinforcing the idea that men are defined by their ability to provide and women by their ability to secure a provider.As women have advanced in education and careers, these old expectations have caused tension. Since the 1980s, women have steadily outperformed men in college enrolment and graduation. By 2022, only 42% of students in four-year colleges were men.Bernstein says this shift has left many men feeling left out, leading to the rise of the “manosphere” — an online space where podcasters and influencers promote traditional masculinity.Trump and the 'manosphere'Bernstein connects Trump’s popularity with young men to the manosphere, which she says links masculinity to financial success and supports the outdated idea of men as sole providers.“While so-called female gold diggers are an obsession of the manosphere, much of its content reinforces the male-breadwinner norm — tying money to manliness and women’s preference for providers to biology,” she wrote.Ahead of the election, Trump appeared on popular podcasts like The Joe Rogan Experience and Full Send Podcast, making direct appeals to young male voters. His efforts contrasted with Kamala Harris’s podcast appearances on shows like Call Her Daddy and Club Shay Shay. However, Harris’s team failed to secure an invitation to Rogan’s podcast, a platform widely regarded as influential among young men.Changing youth voteThe election saw a noticeable shift in the youth vote. While Democrats have historically relied on at least 60% of younger voters, early exit polls showed Harris capturing just 54% of this demographic, according to NPR.Bernstein suggests that the division between men and women in both work and relationships is worsening societal issues like loneliness and declining birth rates. “Now that women are pulling ahead, the fairy tale has become increasingly unattainable,” she wrote.In her closing argument, Bernstein urged society to challenge traditional ideas of masculinity and femininity for mutual benefit. “If we are willing to reject the manosphere’s narrow ideas of masculinity, we will find that it is possible for both men and women to thrive at the same time — in work and in love. This future is ours to create. Don’t let anyone tell you it’s a fairy tale.”",
