  "text": "President Donald Trump said the United States would send “some more weapons” to Ukraine, making the comment days after the White House announced the Pentagon had halted some such shipments to the country.“We have to,” Trump said of the U.S. providing weapons to Ukraine, speaking to reporters during a dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “They have to be able to defend themselves. They’re getting hit very hard now.”Trump said the shipment would include “defensive weapons primarily,” remarking that “so many people are dying in that mess.” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said last week that the Defense Department decided to halt some shipments to Ukraine after a review found American military stockpiles to be low.The president, who has insisted on taking a more diplomatic approach with Russian President Vladimir Putin than his predecessor, President Joe Biden, reiterated his comments from recent days about his disappointment with Putin. Trump and Putin spoke by phone on Thursday, and Trump afterward said he “didn’t make any progress with him.”“I’m not happy with President Putin at all,” Trump said to reporters Monday. “But, this is something that would have never happened if I were president.”",
