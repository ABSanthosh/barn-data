  "text": "Haiti’s ruling council swore in a new acting prime minister Monday, despite claims from the previous premier that his ouster was illegitimate, as escalating violence forced the main airport in the gang-beset country to halt flights.In a decree published Monday, the transitional presidential council announced that Garry Conille, a former official with the U.N. children’s agency, would be replaced as prime minister by businessman Alix Didier Fils-Aimé. The council said this weekend that it had fired Conille, who had been in the position since May.The move by the council — a body tasked with restoring order to a nation in the grip of gang violence and with preparing a path for free-and-fair elections — plunged Haiti deeper into a constitutional crisis, with Conille claiming that his removal was “nothing more than a maneuver that further weakens our country and seriously compromises our chances of overcoming the crisis.”The escalating political turmoil in the beleaguered Caribbean nation marked a new blow to the U.S.-backed political transition and raised fears that the heavily armed gangs that control an estimated 85 percent of the capital, Port-au-Prince, would exploit the political chaos to sow even more mayhem.Shortly before the swearing-in ceremony Monday afternoon, a Spirit Airlines flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Port-au-Prince was struck by gunfire and forced to land in the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. One flight attendant was injured, the airline said.The U.S. Embassy in Haiti said the violence had forced a “temporary pause in operations” at Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince. An embassy statement implied that gangs were responsible.If so, it would be the second time in as many months that armed gangs in Haiti struck an aircraft in the country. In late October, a U.N. helicopter was hit and forced to land in Haiti’s capital. Coordinated gang attacks earlier this year forced Toussaint Louverture to close for nearly three months.There are no democratically elected officials in Haiti. Its presidency has been vacant since the still-unsolved assassination of Jovenel Moïse in 2021. Elections have not been held since 2016, and the country’s National Assembly has been empty since the last senators’ terms expired in early 2023.The transitional presidential council was the product of emergency meetings in March held by U.S., Haitian and other Caribbean leaders after gangs joined to bust open prisons and attack the international airport, preventing then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry from returning home from a trip abroad. Henry, who had been sworn in after Moïse’s killing, resigned.U.S. officials in April applauded Haitian leaders for moving forward “in a spirit of reconciliation” in forming the nine-member council, which was tasked with accepting a Kenyan-led multinational police mission to counter the gangs and restore stability so that Haiti could hold elections in 2026.But critics cast doubt on the council’s long-term viability, saying it was yet another government imposed on Haiti by foreign powers — and one made up of members of the same elite groups that many Haitians hold responsible for the nation’s dysfunction.In a letter to the Haitian people Sunday, Conille, who also served as prime minister from 2011 to 2012, said the decision to oust him was “taken outside any legal and constitutional framework.”Conille and the council have bickered for weeks — and trust in the government has been waning.The council had pressured Conille, whom it appointed prime minister in May, to replace several members of his cabinet. He refused. An anti-corruption watchdog recommended charges against three members of the council, accusing them of seeking $750,000 in bribes from the director of the National Bank of Credit to keep his job.As the infighting worsened, Brian Nichols, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, called for “national unity” and said that “we strongly support the efforts of Prime Minister Conille and his cabinet” in advancing the priorities established by the council.Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Haiti in September as a show of support for Conille.The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.Conille said in his letter that Haiti’s constitution allows only parliament to fire the prime minister. The terms of the political accord that established the council, he added, “do not in any way allow the council to unilaterally terminate the prime minister’s functions.”“I choose, out of patriotism, not to respond to this situation with division, but rather with responsibility,” he said, adding that he intends to work with the council “to continue this fight for the stability of our country … and to challenge any illegal action motivated by narrow political interests that only add to the suffering of our people.”Conille signed the letter “the prime minister.”Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, said Monday that Guterres urged “all Haitian stakeholders to work constructively together to advance the political transition.”“Overcoming their differences and putting the country first remains critical to that end,” he told reporters at a news conference in New York.Gangs have long held power in Haiti, but they have grown in strength since Moïse’s assassination — killing and kidnapping thousands and forcing more than 700,000 to flee their homes. Gangs have ramped up attacks in recent weeks in what Western officials called politically motivated violence.The U.N. human rights office reported last week that nearly 4,900 people were killed in gang attacks from January to September. The assaults have worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis in a country where nearly half the population faces acute food insecurity, the office said, and there are “famine-like conditions” in several areas where displaced people are living.Donors have contributed 43 percent of the $674 million in humanitarian aid requested for Haiti by the United Nations.Haiti’s police have been outnumbered and outmatched by the gangs, and lawlessness has spread.The United States has a long history of failed interventions in Haiti. The Biden administration has ruled out deploying U.S. troops, choosing to lead an effort to build an international policing mission after Haitian leaders requested one in 2022. Washington has provided the mission much of its funding.The force, which is led by Kenya, was green-lit by the U.N. Security Council in 2023, and several hundred officers deployed this summer. But the force has struggled to secure resources and has made little progress against the gangs. One of the deadliest gang massacres in Haiti took place last month.The United States has sought to transform the Kenyan-led mission into a traditional U.N. peacekeeping mission, which would guarantee funding and resources for the force, but those efforts have been stymied by Russia and China.Support for the mission is uncertain under a Trump administration. Congressional Republicans for months held back funding for the force, citing concerns about what they said was a lack of specifics about its goals and exit strategy. Biden was forced to use his drawdown authority to direct millions to the mission.Bob Rae, Canada’s ambassador to the United Nations and head of a U.N. advisory group on Haiti, said Sunday that the political turmoil was unhelpful.“Just when we are trying to find support for the security, economy and well-being of the country,” he said on X, “the instability within the transitional council helps neither the Haitian population nor the trust of your partners.”",
