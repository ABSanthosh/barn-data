  "text": "Here are the latest developments.Deadly strikes in central Gaza overnight killed or injured dozens of Palestinians, health officials and the United Nations said on Monday, as the Israeli military hit a hospital complex where it said Hamas fighters were hiding and a separate attack damaged a school turned shelter.An Israeli strike caused a tent encampment to catch fire in the courtyard of Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, leaving five people dead and dozens hurt, according to Doctors Without Borders, which has medical staff working in Gaza.Video footage taken by The Associated Press and the Reuters news agency on Monday morning showed people looking through smoking debris and trying to extinguish fires at the encampment, where displaced people were sheltering in tents at the complex in the city of Deir al Balah. The Israeli military said that it had struck what it described as a Hamas command center, a claim that could not be independently verified.Eduardo Maia Silva, a White House National Security Council spokesman, called the images and videos that emerged from the scene “deeply disturbing” and said that “even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields” Israel “has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties.”A separate attack hit a school compound in central Gaza where families were sheltering in the city of Nuseirat, according to Palestinian civil defense, an emergency service, which said that at least eight bodies had been recovered from the scene. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports. The main U.N. agency aiding Palestinians in Gaza said the facility was to have been used as a site for polio vaccinations after a mass anti-polio campaign in the territory resumed on Monday.The strikes in Gaza followed a weekend of intense fighting along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, home of the Iran-backed militia Hezbollah. Across Lebanon, at least 51 people were killed and 174 others injured on Saturday, and at least three people were killed and 84 wounded on Sunday, the Lebanese authorities said, as Israel’s weekslong assault on Hezbollah continued.Here’s what else to know:Protecting peacekeepers: The U.N. Security Council was holding a closed emergency meeting about Israeli attacks in southern Lebanon that have hit and wounded U.N. peacekeeping forces. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, issued a video statement shortly before the U.N. meeting on Monday saying that Israel was not targeting the peacekeepers.Drone attack: The Hezbollah drone strike on an army base in northern Israel that killed four soldiers this weekend has highlighted Israel’s vulnerability against attacks from unmanned aircraft.U.S. sends military aid to Israel: The United States said on Sunday that it was sending an advanced missile defense system to Israel, along with about 100 American troops to operate it. It will be the first time the United States has sent forces to Israel since the Hamas-led attacks there last October.Lebanon strike: The Lebanese Red Cross said on Monday that 21 people had been killed in an Israeli airstrike on the village of Aitou in northern Lebanon, more than 70 miles from the Israeli border. The largely Christian region is not known to have been previously targeted by Israel over the past year as it has traded strikes with Hezbollah.Eduardo Maia Silva, a National Security Council spokesperson, said the White House had “made our concerns clear to the Israeli government” after an Israeli airstrike Monday on a hospital compound in Gaza set fire to tents housing displaced people. “The images and video of what appear to be displaced civilians burning alive following an Israeli airstrike are deeply disturbing,” he said in a statement.ImageCredit...Ramadan Abed/ReutersThe Israeli military had said the hospital compound was being used as a Hamas command center. Silva said that Israel had a responsibility to avoid civilian casualties, adding, “What happened here is horrifying, even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.” Gaza hospital blaze survivors say they are living a ‘recurring nightmare.’ImagePalestinians in the courtyard of Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al Balah, central Gaza, after the deadly attack on Monday.Credit...Abdel Kareem Hana/Associated PressThis was not the first time that displaced Gazans camping on the grounds of Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital awoke to Israeli strikes on the place where they were trying to find safety. But Monday’s strike overshadowed any they had survived before: flames jumping from tent to tent, shrieks of agony and bodies so charred they were unrecognizable.“It is like living inside a recurring nightmare. Every time we sleep, we wake up to this same scenario of tents struck, people screaming,” said Mahmoud Wadi, a 20-year-old whose extended family had been living on the hospital grounds for months.Mr. Wadi said this was the seventh strike on the hospital his family had witnessed since setting up a tent outside the facility. This time, instead of awakening in a daze to the sight of smoke rising from one spot in the camp, the heat of flames was everywhere, he said. He saw bodies “scorched and black, like giant lumps of coal.”The Wadi family is one of scores of families that have set up camp in the parking lot of the compound, hoping that international laws prohibiting attacks on hospitals made the area a safe place to shelter. Instead, these families say, they have survived repeated strikes on the hospital. The latest attack, shortly after 1 a.m. on Monday, triggered a fire that set the camp ablaze.The Israeli military said in a statement posted to social media that it had been targeting a Hamas command center located near the hospital. The fire that erupted afterward was likely caused by secondary explosions, it said.ImageThe damaged grounds of Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al Balah on Monday.Credit...Abdel Kareem Hana/Associated PressSurvivors interviewed amid the smoldering remains of the camp told The New York Times that the fast-moving fire had been fueled by the explosions of families’ cooking gas canisters and flames that fed off their plastic tents.“The most difficult scene you can experience is seeing your neighbors burning alive and not being able to do anything to rescue them,” said Abed Musleh, a 25-year-old who fled northern Gaza and was sheltering in a tent in the parking lot with his wife, two children, and his four sisters. He estimated the fire burned at least 30 tents. Residents scrambled to find any buckets not burned in the blaze to try and help rescuers put out the fire.The Palestinian health authority said four people died and over a dozen were injured, but that the death toll would likely rise. Later Monday, Doctors Without Borders, which has medics operating in Gaza, said five people were killed and dozens were wounded, some with severe burn injuries.Despite the repeated strikes, Mr. Musleh had no plans to leave. He cannot find anywhere else to go, he said, and he still couldn’t imagine that any other place would be safer than a hospital.Israel has come under repeated criticism for hitting civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, during the yearlong war in Gaza. A U.N. report last week accused Israel of a deliberate policy to destroy the health care system. The Israeli military has said it acted on information that Hamas was operating from the hospital compound, and it has repeatedly said that it tries to avoid civilian casualties.But for Gaza’s two million people, an increasingly common refrain is that nowhere is safe — and that, with more than 90 percent of the population displaced, there are few places left to go.Mohammed Ramadan, whose family of 10 survived but lost their tent, said he felt trapped by impossible options: “There are no safe places, and no places left to shelter in.”The foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy and Britain expressed “deep concern” about attacks on the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon. Their statement noted that any deliberate attack on U.N. peacekeepers would violate international humanitarian law. The U.N. Security Council is set to meet this afternoon to discuss the attacks.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier on Monday that Israel did not deliberately target the U.N. force and called such claims “completely false.” Netanyahu says that Israel was targeting Hezbollah, and said the militant group was operating near U.N. peacekeeper facilities.Ireland's prime minister, Simon Harris, told President Isaac Herzog of Israel on Monday that attacks on peacekeepers in southern Lebanon were “outrageous” and violated international law. About 340 Irish soldiers are part of the U.N. peacekeeping force there. Prime Minsiter Benjamin Netanyahu has called for the peacekeeping troops to leave the area, which the U.N. and a number of nations have denounced.The U.N. says Israeli shells hit a food distribution center in northern Gaza.The U.N. agency responsible for Palestinian aid said Israeli forces fired shells that hit one of its food distribution centers in northern Gaza on Monday while people were trying to get food, leaving dead and wounded.The Israeli military said the incident was under review. In a statement, it said that it “directs its strikes and operations only against terror targets and operatives and does not target civilians.”The shells hit a distribution center in Jabaliya, killing at least 10 people and wounding 40 others, said Juliette Touma, the director of communications for the U.N. Palestinian aid agency, UNRWA. Reuters reported the same death toll, citing Palestinian medics. It was not possible to confirm the reports independently.Israeli forces have mounted an offensive in north Gaza, an area shattered by a year of Israeli airstrikes and fighting, to prevent Hamas from regrouping. They have directed civilians to leave but more than 400,000 remain, some saying that they have been fatigued by repeated evacuation orders — and that they are doubtful they would be safer elsewhere.The U.N. human rights office said that Israeli forces appeared to be sealing off north Gaza from the rest of the enclave by erecting sand barriers at a key crossing point and that they had reportedly “opened fire, killing some Palestinians trying to evacuate” farther south. In a statement, it said it was appalled by the bombing in northern Gaza.The human rights office also said that the separation going up in the area raises concern that Israel does not intend to allow civilians to return to their homes.Israel’s military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, said that northern Gaza’s health system had all but collapsed and that telecommunications had been cut. The U.N., he said, has not been able to provide any assistance since the end of last month. Basic services have been interrupted or forced to a halt, among them UNRWA’s health center, and only two wells are operational, he said.The medical aid charity Doctors Without Borders said on Monday that one of its staff members had died after being hit by shrapnel last week in Jabaliya.The Israeli military agency that oversees policy for the Palestinian territories, COGAT, said that 30 trucks passed a crossing point into northern Gaza on Monday. “Israel is not preventing the entry of humanitarian aid, with an emphasis on food, into Gaza,” it said in a statement.Lara JakesLara Jakes writes frequently about the weapons industry.What to know about the THAAD antimissile system the U.S. is sending to Israel.ImageA Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit deployed last year in Guam during a multinational joint military exercise.Credit...Chang W. Lee/The New York TimesThe advanced THAAD air defense system that the United States is sending to Israel is a sign of how both countries are bracing for more attacks against Israel by Iran and its allies.It adds another layer of protection to the several types of air defense systems that Israel already uses to shoot down missiles. Along with the THAAD battery, whose deployment the Pentagon announced on Sunday, about 100 American troops will go to Israel to operate it, putting U.S. service members closer to the heart of a widening Middle East war.“It’s a political message of the United States to Israel that, ‘We are with you,’” said Yehoshua Kalisky, a military technology expert at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. “And to enemies, it’s: ‘Don’t.’”Here is a look at the THAAD system and what it can do.What is THAAD?The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is a mobile surface-to-air interceptor designed to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles. It is categorized as a short-, medium- and intermediate-range interceptor that can strike incoming targets both within the Earth’s atmosphere and above it.The system is made up of five parts: Interceptor missiles, launchers, radar, a command-and-control platform, and other support equipment unique to the THAAD. There is no warhead on the missile, which destroys its targets by the force of its impact.There are only nine active THAAD batteries in the world, according to its manufacturer, Lockheed Martin. Seven of them are assigned to the U.S. Army, and among other locations are deployed in Guam and South Korea. The battery that the Biden administration has ordered to Israel presumably would be among those seven.Two others are being fielded in the United Arab Emirates.The Pentagon announced almost a year ago that it was sending a THAAD battery to the Middle East to help protect Israel, but did not specify where it would be.How will it be used?Because it can reach above the atmosphere, the THAAD should be able to intercept ballistic missiles launched from Iran and Yemen, said Fabian Hinz, a missiles and Middle East expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. It can also shoot down shorter-range missiles launched by Hezbollah, in neighboring Lebanon.Iran and its allies have also fired guided cruise missiles and drones, which operate at much lower altitudes and speeds than ballistic missiles.Mr. Kalisky said the THAAD would be particularly useful in intercepting debris from other missiles that have been downed before it falls to the ground, where it can inflict casualties and damage infrastructure. (He also said the THAAD has an exceptional radar that can detect incoming missiles from farther distances.)But Mr. Hinz said they would likely serve as another layer of urgently needed air defenses, given that some Iranian missiles evaded Israeli interceptors during a barrage earlier this month. Iran lies more than 500 miles from Israel.“We have seen that the Iranian strategy is to fire large volleys in order to overwhelm Israeli defenses,” Mr. Hinz said. “If you have additional interception capability, that is quite useful.”How is it different from Israel’s other air defense systems?It’s largely a matter of range, meaning how far the missile can fly. The THAAD has a range of about 125 miles. Its launchers and command centers can be moved to different sites.Mr. Kalisky compared the THAAD to one of Israel’s main defense systems, the David’s Sling, a stationary weapon at a fixed location that can shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic and cruise missiles. It has a range of about 185 miles and is also a “hit-to-kill” weapon that downs its targets by flying into it. The David’s Sling is jointly produced by Raytheon and Israeli weapons producer Rafael.Then there is Israel’s Arrow series, which is produced by Israel Aerospace Industries and Boeing.The Arrow 2 can intercept targets high in the atmosphere, with an altitude of about 30 miles and a range of about 60 miles. It has a fragmentation warhead packed with explosives that can blow up near incoming missiles even if it does not directly hit its targets.The Arrow 3, another hit-to-kill weapon, can go beyond the atmosphere with a range of up to 1,500 miles. It is one of Israel’s most advanced defenses and was used to counter the Iranian strikes on Oct. 1. Both the Arrow 2 and the Arrow 3 are ground-based mobile launchers.The Iron Dome system is perhaps the best known of Israel’s air defenses, largely because it is used more than the others. Its short-range interceptors — just 6 inches wide and 10 feet long — rely on miniature sensors and computerized guidance to zero in on short-range rockets. It is produced by Rafael, the Israeli defense contractor.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday published a video from a military base in northern Israel where four Israeli soldiers had been killed on Sunday by a Hezbollah strike, vowing that Israel would keep up its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon despite the heavy price in lost lives.At least 4 people are killed after Israel strikes a Gaza hospital compound.VideoPeople worked through smoke and darkness to extinguish fires and look through debris following the deadly attack on Deir al-Balah.CreditCredit...Ramadan Abed/ReutersThe Israeli military carried out an airstrike on a hospital compound in central Gaza early Monday morning, setting ablaze dozens of tents in the parking lot where displaced Palestinians had taken refuge. At least four people died, according to the Palestinian heath authority, and 40 more were wounded.Video footage taken by The Associated Press and the Reuters news agency on Monday morning shows charred remains of tents, blackened appliances and smoldering piles of clothes in the parking lot of the facility, Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al Balah.The Israeli military said in a statement posted to social media that it had been targeting what it described as a Hamas command center located near the hospital. “Shortly after the strike, a fire ignited in the hospital’s parking lot, most likely due to secondary explosions,” the military said. The claims could not be independently confirmed.The strikes ignited the neat rows of tents, and video taken afterward shows firefighters and volunteers rushing to put out the blazes with hoses and buckets of water. Other footage shows emergency medical workers combing through the smoldering debris in search of casualties.“The situation is just horrific,” said Louise Wateridge, the Gaza spokesperson for UNRWA, the U.N. agency tasked with aiding Palestinian refugees. She woke up around 3 a.m. to a call from a colleague who had been sheltering in the courtyard with the other families when the airstrike hit. He escaped his tent just in time. Not everyone was so lucky.“There were no warnings,” Ms. Wateridge said. “Everyone was sleeping.”Scores of families have been sheltering in the hospital parking lot for the past several months, having fled fighting elsewhere in Gaza. For some, it’s the third or fourth time they have moved in search of shelter. Al Aqsa, as central Gaza’s only functioning hospital, was thought to be relatively safe.Before the start of the war in Gaza last October, Al Aqsa provided care to tens of thousands of patients every month. Since the fighting began, thousands of Gazans have sought safety inside the compound’s walls, even as it has been struck several times by Israeli forces.The Israeli military has said that it was acting on information that Hamas was operating from the hospital compound, and it has repeatedly said that it tries to avoid civilian casualties. But its operations have drawn widespread criticism, including from the United Nations, which accused Israel in a report last week of a “concerted policy” to “destroy Gaza’s health care system as part of a broader assault” on Hamas.Ms. Wateridge of UNRWA asked her colleague where he would go next now that his tent and all his remaining possessions were gone.“He was completely silent for a moment,” she said. “Then he told me, ‘There is no safe place.’ He thought the hospital was the safest place to be.”Raja Abdulrahim, Abu Bakr Bashir and Gabby Sobelman contributed reporting.Hezbollah’s strike on an army base shows Israel’s weakness against drones.ImageMilitary facilities near the site of a drone attack outside Binyamina, Israel, on Monday.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesMinutes before a deadly Hezbollah drone strike on an army base in northern Israel this weekend, Israeli police officers notified the Air Force about reports of a suspicious aircraft, the police said. They were told not to worry because the aircraft was Israeli, prompting the officers to close the case.The Air Force’s assessment appeared to be wrong: Moments later, four Israeli soldiers were killed and dozens more were wounded in the Hezbollah attack, the latest of several recent drone strikes that have highlighted weaknesses in the way that Israel detects unmanned aircraft.In July, the Houthi militia in Yemen hit an apartment building in Tel Aviv, killing one civilian. Hezbollah last week hit a nursing home north of Tel Aviv, causing damage but no casualties. Earlier in the year, Hezbollah broadcast footage that was captured by a drone that flew over sensitive installations in Haifa, seemingly without being detected.The latest strike, on a training base south of the Israeli city of Haifa, highlighted how Hezbollah retains the ability to hurt Israel despite devastating Israeli attacks on its leadership and infrastructure. It also pointed up Israel’s defensive shortcomings, prompting the Israeli military to launch an investigation and its chief spokesman to acknowledge on Sunday: “We must provide better defense.”One of the civilians who spotted the drone, Viki Kadosh, said she was “so frustrated, because 10 minutes before the hit, we had called in to warn about it.” Speaking on Monday to Galei Tzahal, a radio station run by the Israeli military, Ms. Kadosh said: “We spotted it flying very low, right above our home. We heard the sound it was making and immediately noticed there was something strange about it.” The Israeli military declined to comment.The sequence of drone attacks has caused alarm in Israel as it prepares for a potential escalation with Iran. After Iran fired a barrage of ballistic missiles at Israel nearly two weeks ago, Israel is widely expected to retaliate, a response that could prompt Iran to fire more missiles and drones.While Israel has a world-leading system to detect and intercept missiles, which can travel faster than 1,000 miles an hour, its radar systems have found it more challenging to spot unmanned aircraft, which sometimes move slower than 100 miles an hour.Drones often contain less metal and emit less heat than high-velocity rockets and shells, meaning that they do not always set off alerts. And even when they are spotted, enemy drones are sometimes mistaken for Israeli aircraft, including small private planes, because they fly at similarly low altitudes and speeds.“All the systems that we have in the Western world — it’s not only Israel — are built to defend or to protect the airspace from regular fighter planes and missiles,” said Ofer Haruvi, a former head of the drone department in the Israeli Air Force. “You need to redesign part of these systems so that they can see and detect and track this kind of slow-moving target.”Israel’s Iron Dome anti-rocket system destroys the vast majority of rockets fired from Gaza and Lebanon, while its Arrow 3 interceptors were instrumental in largely blocking two massive barrages of ballistic missiles fired by Iran in April and again this month. To enhance those defenses, the United States said on Sunday that it would send Israel another anti-missile system, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD.But Israel’s anti-drone system in particular requires improvement, experts said.It relies mainly on radar, which is primarily designed to detect relatively large metallic objects like planes by transmitting a signal and receiving the signal’s reflected echo, according to Onn Fenig, the head of R2 Wireless, a company that designs drone detection systems and works with the Israeli military.He said there are alternatives, including receptors that passively detect and classify the radio waves emitted by a drone, optical sensors that scan the skies for visual signs of a drone and acoustic sensors that detect the sound of a drone’s engine.All these systems have advantages and blind spots, and Israel needs to combine them in order to build a more robust drone detection system, Mr. Fenig said.“There’s no magic solution that, if implemented, would solve all your problems,” he said. “But we need a complete change in mind-set.”Myra Noveck contributed reporting.The U.N. Security Council will hold a closed emergency meeting later Monday after members of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon came under Israeli fire last week.Council members condemned the attacks in a meeting on Lebanon last week. The Council has the authority to deploy, withdraw or move peacekeepers. António Guterres, the secretary general of the U.N., said on Sunday that attacks on peacekeepers are a violation of international law and potentially a war crime.A Gaza school turned shelter is hit in a deadly strike, the U.N. says.VideoA school turned shelter was attacked late Sunday, a day before children were to receive their second dose of a polio vaccination.CreditCredit...Haitham Imad/EPA, via ShutterstockA strike overnight on a school compound in central Gaza where families were sheltering resulted in fatalities and damage, according to UNRWA, the main U.N. agency that aids Palestinians.The head of the agency, Philippe Lazzarini, did not name the UNRWA school in the city of Nuseirat, or provide details of the attack, but he cited reports that 20 people had been killed. The Palestinian Civil Defense, an emergency service, said on Monday that it had recovered eight bodies from a strike on a school in Nuseirat and added that other medical teams had recovered more killed.The reports had not been independently verified. The facility was to have been used for the second stage of a campaign to vaccinate children in Gaza against polio, Mr. Lazzarini said, but the drive did not take place there because of “severe damage.”The attack, and one on a hospital nearby, was “another night of horror” and the situation in Gaza was “a never ending hell,” Mr. Lazzarini said on social media on Monday.Palestinian health authorities say that more than 40,000 people have been killed in the enclave during Israel’s campaign against Hamas, which began after the militant group launched an attack on Israel on Oct. 7 last year in which around 1,200 people were killed.Israel’s military did not claim responsibility for an attack on the school, but said the incident was under review.In recent months, Israel’s forces have conducted dozens of airstrikes on schools that in the past year have been turned into shelters for people displaced by the war. In almost every case, it has said that the compounds were being used by Hamas, though it has not provided evidence in support of the claims.Hundreds of people have been killed in the attacks, which have been criticized as a violation of international law by the United Nations and some governments.The vaccination campaign restarted on Monday, a month after nearly 560,000 children under the age of 10 were given the first dose of the vaccination against the disease. Aid agencies plan to administer second doses across Gaza over the next two weeks. Israel and Hamas have agreed to pause fighting for several hours a day in areas where vaccines are being administered.This time, UNRWA said in a statement that it aimed to reach 590,000 children under the age of 10 in less than two weeks, providing vitamin A in addition to the polio vaccine to support the health of children “living in extremely dire hygiene and sanitation conditions.”The campaign will be run in coordination with Israel’s military to ensure that “the population will be able to safely reach the medical centers where the vaccinations will be given,” according to a statement by COGAT, the Israeli military agency that oversees policy for the Palestinian territories and liaises with international relief organizations.More than 1,500 Israelis have been killed in the conflict, mostly during Hamas’s attack on Oct. 7. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s counterattack, including thousands of children.An UNRWA spokeswoman, Louise Wateridge, said that, while the campaign was critical, “the children will inevitably return straight back into the dangerous and inhumane conditions they came from.”The COGAT statement did not mention UNRWA. The agency, which has had more than 200 of its Palestinian employees killed during the war, has been key to efforts to provide shelter, food and other basic services during the war, but Israel accuses it of aiding Hamas. Israel’s parliament has taken steps toward passing a bill branding UNRWA as a terrorist organization.Two Palestinians were killed during an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin and its refugee camp this morning, the Palestinian Authority’s health ministry said, providing no further details. The Israeli military said that its forces were carrying out a “counterterrorism operation” there to apprehend a wanted person and that one “armed operative” was killed. ImageCredit...Jaafar Ashtiyeh/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe Hezbollah drone strike on an army base in northern Israel that killed four soldiers this weekend has highlighted Israel’s vulnerability against attacks from unmanned aircraft, experts and officials said. The Israeli police said on Monday that its officers had referred reports of a drone to the Air Force in the minutes before the strike, only to be told erroneously that the aircraft was Israeli, prompting the officers to close the case. The Israeli military declined to comment.The Lebanese Red Cross said that 18 people had been killed in an Israeli airstrike on the village of Aitou in northern Lebanon, more than 70 miles from the Israeli border.

This follows weeks of daily attacks, mainly targeting the Dahiya, the tightly packed cluster of neighborhoods adjoining the Lebanese capital. Some displaced residents have taken the opportunity to return home and collect belongings.Southern Lebanon, along with the Bekaa Valley in the country’s east, continue to be pounded by Israeli bombardment. The Israeli military issued new evacuation warnings for more than two dozen towns and cities in southern Lebanon on Monday.ImageCredit...Abbas Fakih/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesA strike overnight on a school compound in central Gaza where families were sheltering has resulted in fatalities and damage, according to UNRWA, the main U.N. agency that aids Palestinians.

They left about 45 minutes later, after the U.N. warned that their presence was putting peacekeepers in danger.“The inviolability of U.N. premises must be respected at all times,” Mr. Guterres said in a statement on social media on Sunday. “Attacks against peacekeepers are in breach of international law and may constitute a war crime.”The Israeli military said that its soldiers had entered the peacekeeping base as they tried to flee from Hezbollah missile fire and were in contact throughout the episode with the U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as UNIFIL.The mission came under Israeli fire several times last week, and Israeli officials have called on the United Nations to pull its peacekeeping forces back. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that the United Nations’ refusal to do so “makes them hostages of Hezbollah,” the armed Lebanese group that the Israeli military has been targeting in a weekslong air and ground offensive.“This endangers both them and the lives of our soldiers,” Mr. Netanyahu said, in a message directed at Mr. Guterres.The U.N. force has rejected Israel’s calls to leave its positions in southern Lebanon. Mr. Guterres does not have authority over UNIFIL, whose presence is mandated by the U.N. Security Council.United Nations peacekeeping forces have been in southern Lebanon since 1978. The mission includes over 10,000 civilian and military personnel from 50 countries who are assigned to prevent border violations between Lebanon and Israel over a 75-mile stretch referred to as the Blue Line.In an overnight call with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III “reinforced the importance of Israel taking all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of UNIFIL forces and Lebanese Armed Forces,” the Pentagon press secretary, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, said in a statement.The episode on Sunday was the latest in a series of Israeli challenges to the peacekeeping force since invading southern Lebanon in late September.On Saturday, UNIFIL reported that Israeli soldiers had blocked peacekeepers’ passage through an area northeast of Ramyah, prompting the mission to issue its fourth warning in recent days to Israel and other parties “to steer clear of the mission’s premises and operations.”“UNIFIL’s mandate provides for its freedom of movement in its area of operations,” it said.Video taken Monday at a hospital complex in central Gaza shows rows of tents on fire while firefighters and others rush to put it out with hoses and buckets of water.
