By Monday, far-right and even some mainstream politicians were calling for the return of some of the nearly one million Syrians who have made Germany home.“Many refugees who have found protection in Germany are now finally hopeful of being able to return to their Syrian homeland and rebuild their country,” said Nancy Faeser, the German interior minister, who is responsible for refugees.Several European countries, including Britain, Germany, Greece, Italy and Sweden, swiftly announced that they would temporarily suspend legal proceedings considering asylum status for Syrians. Austria went a step further and announced that it would also prepare to deport Syrians whose claims for asylum fail.ImageRebel forces in Damascus, Syria, celebrating on Monday the ouster of Mr. al-Assad.Credit...Daniel Berehulak/The New York TimesThe primary reason cited by the various authorities was that the Assad regime from which the asylum seekers had fled no longer exists.
