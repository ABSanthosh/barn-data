  "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday declared a \"historic victory\" in the 12-day conflict with Iran and pledged to stop Tehran from restoring its nuclear infrastructure.In a televised address to the nation, Netanyahu said, \"We have achieved a historic victory,\" after both nations agreed to a ceasefire. \"Iran will never have a nuclear weapon.\"\"We have thwarted Iran's nuclear project. And if anyone in Iran tries to rebuild it, we will act with the same determination, with the same intensity, to foil any attempt,\" he said in an address which lasted around 10 minutes. Earlier on Tuesday, Israeli military chief Eyal Zamir stated that their strikes had delayed Iran's nuclear program \"by years\" and that the operation against Iran was now \"entering a new phase.\"Even as the ceasefire took hold on Tuesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said though Iran was ready to return to the negotiating table with the United States for nuclear talks, his country would not back down from “asserting its legitimate right” to peaceful use of atomic power, reported news agency AFP.In a statement released earlier on Tuesday, Israel's government said its strikes had eliminated the \"dual existential threat\" posed by Iran's nuclear program and missile capabilities.Netanyahu claimed that Israel's attack on Iran, named \"Operation Rising Lion\", would be \"recorded in the annals of Israel's wars, and will be studied by armies all over the world.\"The operation involved multiple strikes on Iran’s nuclear and missile facilities, targeted killings of military and intelligence officials, and the bombing of state media outlets and Evin prison in Tehran.Following US involvement in the conflict with strikes on Sunday, President Donald Trump stated that American forces had \"totally obliterated\" Iran's main nuclear facilities.However, analysts noted that it was still uncertain whether the strikes had fully neutralized the nuclear threat, as Iran may have relocated its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium from the targeted locations.Tehran has always denied any plans about nuclear weapons.",
