  "text": "The United States withdrew from Gaza ceasefire negotiations on Thursday (local time), alongside Israel, after indirect talks failed to yield progress. Special envoy Steve Witkoff blamed Hamas for the collapse and said Washington would now “consider alternative options”.Witkoff accused Hamas of not \"acting in good faith\" and stated that the United States was bringing home its team. He remarked on social media that Hamas's response \"clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire in Gaza.\"Washington stated that he would now \"consider alternative options to bring the hostages home and try to create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza,\" he added. Qatari mediators had been facilitating indirect discussions between Israeli and Hamas representatives for over two weeks. The goal was to establish a ceasefire and secure the release of Israeli hostages amid the prolonged conflict. Despite recalling negotiators from Doha, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government still seeks a ceasefire, while placing responsibility on Hamas for stalling progress. “We are working to reach another deal for the release of our hostages,” he told AFP. “But if Hamas interprets our willingness to reach a deal as a weakness, as an opportunity to dictate surrender terms that would endanger the State of Israel, it is gravely mistaken,” he added. Following Hamas’s submission of its response to the latest proposal, Israel said its negotiators would return for consultations. A Palestinian source close to the talks revealed that Hamas’s response included suggested changes around aid entry, military withdrawal zones, and guarantees for a permanent cessation of hostilities. As talks collapse, international concern is mounting over the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. More than two million Palestinians face severe shortages, with growing warnings of widespread malnutrition. The World Health Organization has called the food crisis “man-made,” while France has blamed it on Israel’s “blockade”. Israel rejects the charge, arguing that Hamas is blocking aid distribution and accusing international organisations of failing to collect available supplies. Relief agencies say Israeli permissions are limited and safe aid transport remains difficult in a live conflict zone. In Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, Umm al-Abd Nassar, who lost her son in Israeli strikes, urged Hamas to secure a deal. “They need to do something. Enough with this destruction and people dying,” she told AFP. Meanwhile, France announced it will formally recognise a Palestinian state during the UN General Assembly in September. President Emmanuel Macron said the move reflects an urgent need “to end the war in Gaza and rescue the civilian population”. Over 140 countries already recognise Palestinian statehood, despite opposition from Israel and the US. France’s recognition will be the most prominent endorsement from a European power. Palestinian vice president Hussein al-Sheikh welcomed the decision, calling it support for “self-determination and the establishment of our independent state”. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced an “emergency call” with France and Germany to address Gaza’s humanitarian situation. “We will discuss what we can do urgently to stop the killing and get people the food they desperately need,” Starmer stated. “A ceasefire will put us on a path to the recognition of a Palestinian state and a two-state solution which guarantees peace and security for Palestinians and Israelis,” he added. Throughout the 21-month conflict, both sides have stuck to firm positions, preventing temporary truces from becoming permanent. Israel insists on dismantling Hamas’s military and administrative presence, while Hamas demands a permanent ceasefire, full Israeli withdrawal, and unrestricted aid access. According to the Gaza health ministry, 59,587 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in Israel’s military campaign. Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel killed 1,219 people, also mainly civilians. Of the 251 hostages taken during the assault, 49 remain in Gaza, with the Israeli military believing 27 are dead.",
