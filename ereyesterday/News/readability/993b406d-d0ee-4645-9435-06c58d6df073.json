  "text": "QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa announced on Monday that his government will apply a 27% tariff on Mexican goods in an effort to promote fair treatment for his country's companies. In a post on X, Noboa said he favors more exchange of goods with other countries, including a potential free trade deal with Mexico, \"but not when there is abuse.\" Until there is such a deal, he added, the 27% duty will apply. Last year, Ecuador and Mexico broke off diplomatic relations after Noboa ordered a raid on the Mexican embassy to arrest a former Ecuadorean vice president. The South American nation is set to hold a first-round general election this Sunday, in which Noboa is running to remain in office. Mexico's economy ministry, which handles trade policy, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reporting by Alexandra Valencia; Editing by Brendan O'Boyle)",
