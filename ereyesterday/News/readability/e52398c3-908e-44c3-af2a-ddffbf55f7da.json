  "text": "BUCHAREST, Romania — The centrist, pro-European mayor of Bucharest defeated a right-wing Euroskeptic on Sunday in a presidential election that analysts called Romania’s most consequential since the 1989 fall of communism.“What you did was extraordinary,” Nicusor Dan told the throngs gathered around his campaign headquarters in Bucharest early Monday. “You confronted the hate wave. This is your victory.”Then he addressed his opponent, the nationalist George Simion. “To the one who lost today,” he said, “we have to be united. I also offer you respect.”With 97 percent of the vote counted, Dan led Simion by more than seven percentage points, Romania’s Permanent Electoral Authority reported, a mathematically insurmountable margin. Simion conceded early Monday.“We were alone against everyone,” he said in a video posted on Facebook. “I am proud of you and I congratulate my opponent for winning.”Simion, a MAGA-embracing member of Romania’s Parliament, once advocated what he said were the country’s historical claims on Moldovan and Ukrainian territory. During the campaign, he suggested that Romania, an E.U. member and NATO ally, should end its support for Ukraine.“I think what Mr. Simion said was pleasing to Russia,” Dan told reporters. “Exactly what the Russian administration says.”European leaders feared that Simion would align Romania with Hungary and Slovakia, countries that have disrupted the bloc’s unity on confronting Russia. Romania is home to a critical NATO air base and a key element of the U.S. ballistic missile defense system.Several leaders congratulated Dan before an official result.“I look forward to further developing the strategic partnership between our friendly nations for the sake of their stability, security, and prosperity,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on X that voters had chosen “the promise of an open, prosperous Romania in a strong Europe.” And Moldovan President Maia Sandu posted that “Moldova and Romania stand together, supporting one another and working side by side for a peaceful, democratic, and European future for all our citizens.”Crowds in central Bucharest chanted, “Russia, Russia, don’t forget: Romania is not yours!”“MAGA lost today,” said Irineu Darau, a senator with the center-right Save Romania Union. “So did Russia.”Simion initially said he would not concede. Appearing on the steps of Romania’s Parliament flanked by signs reading “RESPECT” as the polls closed Sunday evening, he said his projections showed that he had won by 400,000 votes.Thousands of people, many of them young and many waving Romanian and E.U. flags, waited outside Dan’s headquarters for a victory speech.“I’m very happy for our children,” said Evelina Necula, 44. “This is the result we worked so hard to see.”Necula said that her grandparents were imprisoned in the Soviet Union and that her parents joined the Romanian revolution of 1989.“We have done it,” she said.Darau, the senator, said “the quiet majority” came out to vote, “as they do when times are tough.”She said Dan should move quickly on economic and fiscal reforms. Romania’s public deficit is at 7.5 percent of GDP, and its credit rating is on the brink of junk status.“The people have been frustrated for 25 years. Things do need to change.”Dan acknowledged as much.Simion ran on a “far-right platform,” Dan told reporters early Monday, “but the anger among many voters was real.”Marius Lulea, a vice president of Simion’s party, said support for their campaign had sent a message“Silent Romania exists, needs hope and demands to be listened to,” he wrote on social media. “We will continue to fight for deep, Christian Romania.”Turnout Sunday was high at about 65 percent, a sign of the elevated interest in this increasingly polarized, politically volatile country where social media is overrun with antisemitism and conspiracy theories.Romania’s Foreign Ministry warned of viral “fake news attempts” on TikTok and other platforms aimed at undermining trust in the election.“Coordinated social media viral postings are currently mounting an aggressive campaign of spreading false allegations regarding the voting process,” the ministry said in a statement. “Of particular concern are those designed to manipulate the public opinion regarding the voting process abroad.”Sunday’s election was essentially a do-over after the constitutional court annulled November’s presidential election over campaign finance violations and an illicit social media campaign that Romanian authorities said was stoked by Russia.The top vote-getter then was Calin Georgescu, an ultranationalist with a history of support for Moscow and a prominent vaccine critic during the coronavirus pandemic.Georgescu, backed by a social media campaign linked to Russia, became a TikTok sensation and jumped in a matter of weeks from less than 1 percent in polls to 23 percent of the vote.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied the allegations of Russian support for Georgescu as “yet another slander against Russia.”U.S. Vice President JD Vance criticized the decision to annul the election. Dan said early Monday that the ruling had been “correct” but “was not well explained to either the Romanian people or our partners.” He said he hoped to clarify the circumstances and “regain the trust” of the Trump administration.The court barred Georgescu from running in this election, but he remained a looming presence. He called Simion his “protégé.”After the court upheld Georgescu’s ban in March, Simion said “those who committed the coup d’état should be skinned alive in the public square for what they did.”He suggested he might name Georgescu as his prime minister.Romanian voters rejected candidates from the two main parties two weeks ago in the first round of the election, leaving the stark choice between an outsider and an independent with opposite views of Romania’s future.During the four years that the mainstream Social Democrats and National Liberals have governed Romania in coalition, inflation and inequality have soared, and the economic growth propelled by the country’s entry into the European Union has stalled. Critics have alleged widespread corruption.",
