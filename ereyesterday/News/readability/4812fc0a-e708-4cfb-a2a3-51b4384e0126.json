  "text": "EPAPakistani security officials inspect the site of an alleged Indian drone strike in KarachiIndia has accused Pakistan of attacking three of its military bases with drones and missiles, a claim which has been denied by Islamabad.The Indian Army said it had foiled Pakistan's attempts to attack its bases in Jammu and Udhampur, in Indian-administered Kashmir, and Pathankot, in India's Punjab state.Blasts were reported on Thursday evening in Jammu city in Indian-administered Kashmir as the region went into a blackout.Pakistan's defence minister told the BBC they were not behind the attack.\"We deny it, we have not mounted anything so far,\" Khawaja Asif told the BBC, adding: \"We will not strike and then deny\".EPABlasts were reported in the city of Jammu which went into a black-outEarlier on Thursday, India said it had struck Pakistan's air defences and \"neutralised\" Islamabad's attempts to hit military targets in India on Wednesday night.Pakistan called that action another \"act of aggression\", following Indian missile strikes on Wednesday on targets in Pakistan and Pakistani-administered Kashmir.India's strikes on Wednesday sparked a chorus of calls for de-escalation from the international community with the UN and world leaders calling for calm. The attacks and incidents of shelling along the border have fanned fears of wider conflict erupting between the nuclear-armed states.It is being viewed as the worst confrontation between the two countries in more than two decades.India said it hit nine \"terrorist infrastructure\" sites on Wednesday in retaliation for a militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month.Pakistan has strongly denied Indian claims that it backed the militants who killed 26 civilians in the mountainous town of Pahalgam.It was the bloodiest attack on civilians in the region for years, sending tensions soaring. Most of the victims were Indian tourists.Indian-administered Kashmir has seen a decades-long insurgency against Indian rule which has claimed thousands of lives.Kashmir has been a flashpoint between the countries since they became independent after British India was partitioned in 1947. Both claim Kashmir and have fought two wars over it.ReutersLocals in border areas have had to be evacuated due to the cross-border shelling - here women and children arrive at a shelter near JammuThere were calls for restraint from around the world after India launched \"Operation Sindoor\" early on Wednesday. But on Thursday both sides accused each other of further military action.Pakistan's military spokesman said drones sent by India had been engaged in multiple locations.\"Last night, India showed another act of aggression by sending drones to multiple locations,\" Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said. \"These locations are Lahore, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi, Attock, Bahawalpur, Miano, Chor and near Karachi.\"He said one civilian had been killed in Sindh province and four troops injured in Lahore.The US consulate in Lahore told its staff to shelter in the building. India said its latest action had been taken in response to Pakistan's attempts to \"engage a number of military targets in northern and western India\" overnight.\"It has been reliably learnt that an Air Defence system at Lahore has been neutralised,\" a Defence Ministry statement said. Pakistan denied the claim.There was no independent confirmation of the two countries' versions of events.Later in the day India's foreign secretary Vikram Misri told a news conference in Delhi: \"Our intention has not been to escalate matters, we are only responding to the original escalation.\"Meanwhile, casualty numbers continue to rise. Pakistan says 31 people have been killed and 57 injured by Indian air strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and firing along the Line of Control, since Wednesday morning.India's army said the number of people killed by Pakistani firing in the disputed Kashmir region had risen to 16, including three women and five children.India initially did not name any group it believed was behind the attack in Pahalgam but on 7 May it accused the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group of carrying it out.Indian police have alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, a claim denied by Islamabad. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.In a late-night address on Wednesday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed to avenge those killed in India's strikes.He repeated Pakistan's claim that it had shot down five Indian fighter jets, saying that was a \"crushing response\". India has not commented on that claim.Following the reports of Thursday's explosions in Jammu, local media cited Indian military sources on Thursday in reporting that blasts across the Jammu region were also reported in the towns of Akhnoor, Samba and Kathua.",
