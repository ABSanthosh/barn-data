  "text": "JERUSALEM — Hamdan Ballal, a Palestinian co-director of the Oscar-winning documentary “No Other Land,” was attacked Monday by a group of Jewish settlers in the West Bank and later arrested by the Israeli army, according to activists and a neighbor who spoke to The Washington Post.Ballal was in his home village of Susya, part of the cluster of rural Palestinian communities known as Masafer Yatta, when settlers approached the village and tried to graze their sheep on private Palestinian land just before iftar, the sundown meal at which Muslims break their daily fast during Ramadan, according to Nasser Nawaj’ah, who lives in the small village and reports on settler violence for the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem. He spoke with Ballal’s wife, who described the attack.A video taken by Khamudi Mahmoud, a resident of the village, shows a tall man wearing a T-shirt and baseball cap aggressively approaching Ballal in a rocky clearing as Ballal backs away and a crowd of villagers shout behind him.Dozens of masked settlers wielding batons, knives and a rifle then attacked property and residents, activists focused on documenting settler attacks in the area said in a statement afterward.Jewish-American activists shared dash-cam footage on March 24 of Israeli settlers smashing the windshield of their car in the West Bank. (Video: Center for Jewish Nonviolence)“Hamdan tried to retreat, and he brought his kids and wife inside the house and stood at the door to protect them,” Nawaj’ah said. Four settlers began to hit the door of Ballal’s house, injuring Ballal’s head, according to Nawaj’ah, recounting what Ballal’s wife told him.The settlers fired bullets next to the house and then dragged Ballal away while he was injured, Nawaj’ah said.The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement posted to X that a “violent clash” broke out between Palestinians and Israelis and that it involved “mutual stone-throwing.” Three Palestinians and one Israeli were arrested, the statement said, after the security forces were hit with rocks.Yuval Abraham, an Israeli co-director of “No Other Land,” wrote on X that Ballal was “lynched” by “a group of settlers.” He added: “They beat him and he has injuries in his head and stomach, bleeding. Soldiers invaded the ambulance he called, and took him.” In its statement, the IDF denied that any of the Palestinians were detained from inside an ambulance.Joseph and Raviv, two Jewish American activists with the Center for Jewish Nonviolence organization who have been living in the West Bank for two months to help document alleged human rights violations against Palestinians there, were in a nearby village when they received a call around 6:15 p.m. Monday from Palestinian residents of Susya that a “big attack” by settlers was underway there.“We drove to the village as fast as we could,” said Joseph, who, like other activists quoted in this story, spoke on the condition that only his first name be used out of fear of retaliation.When Joseph, Raviv and three other Americans approached Susya about 15 minutes later, Joseph said, one of the two roads leading up to the village was “full of Israeli army and security personnel” in vehicles. So the activists began to drive up the other road. Three of the activists, including Raviv, got out of the car and walked up the hill toward the village.“As we headed up, a teenager started coming towards us and shouting, and then he came at us, he started pushing us and shoving us,” Raviv recounted. “He got really aggressive; he started punching.”Jewish-American activists said they filmed Israeli settlers on March 24 attacking Masafer Yatta, West Bank, an area featured in the 2025 film \"No Other Land.\" (Video: Anna Lippman)The attacker, whom the activists captured on video wearing a ski mask and swinging punches at the group, was soon joined by more than a dozen settlers, according to Raviv. They began to throw rocks toward the activists, who ran back to their car. One masked attacker lobbed a rock directly at the car windshield, smashing the glass. The attackers also damaged the car tires.Joseph said Israeli soldiers and police officers nearby watched without intervening.“They refused to go after [the settlers],” Joseph said.When the activists tried again to drive up the hill toward the village, soldiers blocked their path.Raviv reached the village on foot, they said. The group came upon an ambulance, settlers, army vehicles and three police vehicles, Raviv said.“They had three Palestinians zip-tied and blindfolded that they were bringing and arresting,” they said.Nawaj’ah said the village residents tried to defend themselves and hide in their houses, and had not attacked the settlers. Stones thrown by settlers shattered the windshields of at least two cars in the village, one of which belonged to Hamdan, photos shared by activists showed.A lawyer representing the arrested Palestinians was told by a police official that the army was still holding the three at a military base, where they were receiving medical treatment and may be held overnight until they can be questioned in the morning, according to Oneg Ben Dror, an activist who was in touch with the lawyer.Basel Adra, another Palestinian co-director of “No Other Land,” also said on X that he was with Ballal’s son near the family’s bloodstained home on Monday night in the wake of the attack and arrests. “This is how they erase Masafer Yatta,” he wrote.The incident is the latest in a string of settler attacks in Susya. There have been more than three dozen attacks in the area in 2025 alone, according to a compilation from activists. Nawaj’ah said settler attacks have increased in frequency recently and are “happening lately on a daily basis in Susya.”The attack on Ballal comes just weeks after “No Other Land” won an Oscar for best documentary feature. The film centers on residents of Masafer Yatta trying to stop the Israeli military. Its directors are a group of Palestinian and Israeli activists, including Adra, Rachel Szor, Abraham and Ballal.The film garnered rave reviews. Ty Burr wrote for The Post that the “powerful” documentary offered “a jolt of moral clarity.”“Watching these images, you find it hard to understand why the world isn’t rising up in collective outrage,” he wrote.The film was the highest-grossing of all the Oscar-nominated documentaries and won a slew of international awards, even though it has lacked a U.S. distributor. Abraham and Adra said publicly that U.S. distributors were worried about the political backlash to distributing the film.The film has drawn ire globally, too. The Israeli culture minister, Miki Zohar, called its Oscar win “a sad moment for the world of cinema.” A prominent Palestinian rights group said the film made “occupation, apartheid, and settler colonialism seem normal.”Scribner reported from Fort Worth.
