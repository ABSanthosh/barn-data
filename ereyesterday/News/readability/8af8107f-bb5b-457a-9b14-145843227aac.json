  "text": "John Countryman, a prolific Hollywood child actor of the 1930s and ’40s who worked under the name Johnny Russell and then built a long career as a U.S. diplomat in North Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere, died Dec. 14 at a hospital in Leesburg, Virginia. He was 91.The cause was complications from pneumonia, said his daughter, Vanessa Countryman.Mr. Countryman’s path from movies to the State Department in the early 1960s predated that of his onetime child co-star, Shirley Temple, by more than a decade.Her appointment under her married named Shirley Temple Black as U.S. ambassador to Ghana in 1974 brought much fanfare — and public reminiscing about Hollywood’s Golden Age. Mr. Countryman, instead, had quietly risen through the Foreign Service as a career diplomat with a reputation for handling challenging assignments.In Libya, as head of the U.S. Embassy’s economic section, he watched strongman Moammar Gaddafi’s growing belligerence toward the United States. Following Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979, Mr. Countryman helped direct fast-shifting U.S. policies from Washington and coordinated outreach with nervous Arab allies.When protesters in Tehran stormed the U.S. Embassy later that year — eventually holding 52 hostages — Mr. Countryman was a leader of the State Department’s crisis team during the 444-day standoff.Earlier, as the No. 2 American diplomat in Gabon in the mid-1970s, Mr. Countryman was reunited with Temple as part of the U.S. diplomatic corps in Africa. She still carried star power. But for a brief moment in Hollywood as children, Mr. Countryman had managed to nudge her slightly out of the spotlight.In the 1940 fantasy film “The Blue Bird,” the cherubic 7-year-old was a scene stealer playing the younger brother of Temple’s character as they sought the bird of happiness. The movie seen as 20th Century Fox’s response to MGM’s hit “The Wizard of Oz” from a year earlier.Hollywood journalists reported that Temple’s mother, Gertrude, demanded the studio replace the young Mr. Countryman because her daughter shared so much screen time with him. Producer Darryl F. Zanuck insisted that he remain in the film, based on the 1908 play by Maurice Maeterlinck.Many reviewers marveled at the film’s Technicolor pop, but some also noted that Temple, then 12, seemed to be aging out of the girlhood precociousness that her fans adored. Mr. Countryman “runs rings around her,” wrote film critic A.S. Kany in the Dayton Herald.He arrived in Hollywood several years earlier after work as a child model in New York, landing one of his first roles playing the son of a boxer (Allan Lane) in 1937’s “The Duke Comes Back.”In a casting call for the film “Always Goodbye” (1938), 489 boys auditioned to play the role of a son that Barbara Stanwyck’s character gives up for adoption after her fiancé is killed. Mr. Countryman, then 5, won the part and a studio contract “in one of the most exhaustive screen-test surveys ever made in Cinema City,” the Associated Press reported.As Johnny or John Russell, Mr. Countryman appeared in more than a dozen other films including two in 1939: playing Jesse James Jr., the son of the western outlaw, in “Jesse James” starring Tyrone Power, and a small role one of the boys supporting Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) in director Frank Capra’s “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.”In the early 1940s, Mr. Countryman’s Hollywood run was mostly over. “Both my parents and I decided a normal childhood was to be preferred,” he recalled in an oral history for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training.During a dinner one night when he was in high school on Long Island, his godfather Thomas Paprocki, an Associated Press sports cartoonist and columnist, offered some career advice. “Out of the clear blue sky … he said, ‘John whatever you do in life, you ought to think about being a diplomat,’ ” Mr. Countryman recounted. The suggestion stuck.After he graduated from Fordham University in 1954 with a bachelor’s degree in English, Mr. Countryman received a Fulbright Fellowship to the University of Berlin as his introduction to Europe and foreign affairs.Mr. Countryman’s first diplomatic post was Istanbul from 1963 to 1965. He then studied Arabic in Beirut and served in the U.S. Consulate in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia — home of the oil giant Aramco — from 1968 to 1971. In the aftermath of 1967’s Israeli-Arab war, Mr. Countryman was part of delicate diplomacy to aid the Saudi military while preserving U.S. influence in Israel.At his next post, as chief economic officer at U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, Libya, he filed reports to Washington on Gaddafi’s volatile style. Mr. Countryman left Libya in 1973 amid deepening rifts between Washington and Gaddafi’s regime.Mr. Countryman was deputy chief of mission in Libreville, Gabon, until 1975 and then returned to Washington for roles including director of Arabian Peninsula affairs at the State Department. In 1981, Mr. Countryman named ambassador to Oman, where he negotiated a key military cooperation pact amid a nearly decade-long war between Iraq and Iran.He retired from the Foreign Service in 1987, two years after leaving the Oman post. In a message to future diplomats, Mr. Countryman said etiquette and cultural sensitivity should remain as much a priority as advocating for U.S. interests.“If I am eating at the French ambassador’s, I know how to use the fish knife. But if I am at a sheikh’s goat-grab in a tent, I knew how to eat in a way that will not offend people,” he said in his oral history. “I think that is something that you should be able to do.”John Russell Countryman was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 25, 1933, and spent part of his childhood in suburban Mount Vernon, New York. His father was a photo and art editor for the Associated Press, and his mother, who was born in Czechoslovakia, traveled with her son to modeling shoots and movie sets.After graduating from Fordham, he spent three years in the Air Force as a pilot and then earned a master’s degree in English at the University of Miami in 1961 while studying for the Foreign Service exam.After retiring from the State Department, he sold real estate in Washington and was executive director of Mission for Peace and Cooperation in the Middle East, a private group that organized seminars on peace efforts in the region.His first marriage ended in divorce. In 1973, he married Illona Zwolska Vachon. Other survivors include a daughter from his second marriage, Vanessa Countryman, secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission.When it came time for his interview as part of the Foreign Service exams, Mr. Countryman said his old performance skills came in handy.Asked to describe his most-admired American statesman, Mr. Countryman recalled his presentations at the home of Kentucky lawmaker and presidential candidate Henry Clay while working as a summer tour guide during college.“I could see almost a smug look on the face of the panel,” he recalled. He was asked to pretend he was a diplomat in Bolivia giving a speech on Clay. Mr. Countryman said he began to regale the group with descriptions of Clay’s home and how the rooms reflected his life and views.“I had this thing all memorized,” Mr. Countryman said in his oral history. “It was beautiful. It was very articulate.”",
