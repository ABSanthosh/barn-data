There was no immediate comment on the cease-fire discussion from Moscow, which had no officials at the talks.“Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day cease-fire” if Russia did the same, the statement said. It added, “The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
