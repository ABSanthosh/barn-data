Philip Earle is projected to wing his riding in Labrador.There are still 342 seats left to tabulate. Canada Election LIVE: First Polls Close As Canadians Vote To Choose PM To Take On Trump Canadians voted on Monday (local time) to decide whether to extend the Prime Minister Mark Carney-led Liberal Party's decade in power or hand over the country's control to Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party. The first polls closed in Newfoundland, and initial trends will start coming soon. There are still another two hours to go until voting ends in Ontario, Quebec and Alberta, following which the exit polls and results will likely start coming in from around 8:00 PM, approximately 6:30 AM IST on April 29 (Tuesday). Canada Election Live: Key Races In Canada's Crucial Parliamentary Election BURLINGTON, ONTARIOThis Ontario riding southwest of Toronto is the ultimate in Canadian bellwethers, having elected a legislator from the winning party for 12 consecutive elections going back to 1984.In 2021, Liberals got 45.7 per cent of the votes as compared to 37.3 per cent of the Conservatives. Canada Election Live: Key Races In Canada's Crucial Parliamentary Election EDMONTON SOUTHEAST, ALBERTAThis is an oil-producing region of Canada and has been a challenge for Liberals because of their policies. Conservatives, who seem to regard the economy somewhat more than the climate, have a clear edge. Justin Trudeau never managed to win more than a handful of seats in this key region, but with him gone, the Liberals aim for a stronger show.In Edmonton Southeast, former Liberal Cabinet minister Amarjeet Sohi has got a ticket from his party. Canada Election Live: Key Races In Canada's Crucial Parliamentary Election CUMBERLAND-COLCHESTER, NOVA SCOTIAAtlantic Canada has 32 seats and is located in the first time zone where results start showing. This region has four provinces under it, and becomes a key first-indicator of which way the result is heading due to early leads. This region is politically volatile and therefore, contests are close.In 2019 the Liberals had managed a win by a very slim margin of a few hundred votes, but lost it to the Conservatives in 201. Canada Election Live: Key Races In Canada's Crucial Parliamentary Election AURORA-OAK RIDGES-RICHMOND HILL, ONTARIOKey to any victory is the so-called Golden Horseshoe, a riding-rich crescent that sits on Lake Ontario and includes Toronto as well as other cities. From 2018 to 2021, it was the Conservatives that held this key constituency. Some of the major issues in this crucial riding is extreme unhappiness over cost of living, a housing crisis, and immigration.The Conservatives have strongly criticised the ruling Liberal government over these issues, and should they be able to wrest the riding, it will give them a big advantage. Canada Election Live: Key Races In Canada's Crucial Parliamentary Election TROIS-RIVIERES, QUEBECQuebec, the province with a sizeable population and second-highest number of ridings in the country, is a key region for any party which wants a strong mandate in parliament. But Quebec is a challenge for all other parties as it is the only parovince in Canada which has its own party - the Bloc Quebecois. Quebec has been seeking independence from Canada and usually people vote for their own party.But Trois-Rivieres is one of the ridings in Quebec where three, sometimes four parties, contend for the vote. The 2021 result was very close, with the Bloc winning by just 83 votes of the 58,110 that were cast. Canada Election Live: Key Races In Canada's Crucial Parliamentary Election BURNABY CENTRAL, BRITISH COLUMBIABurnaby Central is a new constituency. The total seats in Canada's parliament, each representing a riding, has gone up from 338 in 2021 to 343 to 2025. This is due to a rise in the country's population. The result in this riding is important for Jagmeet Singh's New Democratic Party since it is in British Columbia, a stronghold for Sikh voters. The contest here for the NDP is with the Liberal Party of Canada and the result will show if they have the might to take on the party in power.Jagmeet Singh, who had kept former PM Trudeau's minority government alive in return for more social spending, says it is because of him that Canadians here benefited. Mr Singh is the NDP candidate here. However, latest polls suggest that he is running third in the riding with most Canadians backing the Liberals.

She is one of the few MPs who have retained ministerial posts from the previous Justin Trudeau government. Anand, who was previously the Minister of Transport, had announced her decision to step down from electoral politics but has since changed her mind. HOW ARE WINNERS DECLARED?Canada follows a first-past-the-post electoral system, which means that the winning candidate is one who has received the most votes in a constituency or riding, even if the total is not a majority of the ballots cast. WHO ARE THE KEY CANDIDATES?While Mark Carney, who is the current Prime Minister and leads the Liberal Party of Canada, and Pierre Poilievre, who is currently the Leader of the Opposition and heads the Conservative Party of Canada are the most likely candidates to become the next Canadian PM, there are some other key contestants who are aiming for the top spot.These include Yves-Francois Blanchet, who leads the Bloc Quebecois party - a sovereigntist organisation, which means a party that has a history and ideology of supporting Quebec's right to self-government or full independence from Canada, and Jagmeet Singh of the New Democratic Party, which has a leftwing ideology for legislation. Jagmeet Singh also has a history of being a pro-'Khalistan' sympathiser - which is rooted in a separatist ideology, and has been a cause of much friction with India. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THE CANADIAN POLLS?Among Canada's 10 provinces and 3 territories, the three regions in the northernmost part of the country - which are the largest parts of Canada, are so sparsely-populated, that each of these territories have just one seat. The three territories are called Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. WHAT IS THE COST OF THE 2025 CANADIAN ELECTION?As most elections do, the parliamentary polls in Canada also comes at a fairly steep cost. According to estimates given by Elections Canada, the 2025 parliamentary elections will cost the state exchequer $570 million (Canadian Dollar), which is roughly $411 million (US Dollar). WHO VOTES WHEN?

Canada Election 2025 Live: First Polls Open A person walks past election signs for various political parties in Montreal ahead of the opening of polls in Canada's federal election on April 28, 2025. (AFP) HOW MANY VOTERS? HOW MANY CONSTITUENCIES?Canada's electorate comprises of more than 28 million registered voters, who will elect 343 members of parliament or MPs, each representing a constituency of the world's second-largest nation. In Canada, constituencies are popularly called ridings, and in contrast to the 2021 election, this year the number of ridings has gone up five - from 338 to 343. The reason Canada is voting in April - six months prior to the originally scheduled parliamentary election in October - is because current prime minister Mark Carney said he is facing immense US pressure and his minority government is unable to withstand it effectively. Donald Trump is serious about his threat to make Canada the 51st state of the United States and has already imposed punishing tariffs on them. Mark Carney, who announced snap polls, has appealed for a strong mandate in order to deal with President Trump's threats. Canada Election 2025 Live: Canada Votes For New Government Public broadcaster CBC's poll aggregator on Sunday put the Liberals' national support at 42.8 percent, with the Conservatives at 38.8 percent. As with US elections, national polling numbers may not predict a result. (AFP) Canada Election 2025 Live: Canadians Set To Choose Their Next Prime Minister Canadians began voting Monday for a new government to confront annexation threats from the United States and deal directly with President Donald Trump, whose trade war has defined the campaign.The first polling stations to open in the massive country that spans six times zones were in the Atlantic province of Newfoundland and Labrador.(AFP) Canada Election 2025 Live: First Polls Open First polls in Canada open, as Canadians get ready to choose their next Prime Minister",

The total seats in Canada\u0026#39;s parliament, each representing a riding, has gone up from 338 in 2021 to 343 to 2025. This is due to a rise in the country\u0026#39;s population. The result in this riding is important for Jagmeet Singh\u0026#39;s New Democratic Party since it is in British Columbia, a stronghold for Sikh voters. The contest here for the NDP is with the Liberal Party of Canada and the result will show if they have the might to take on the party in power.\u003cbr/\u003eJagmeet Singh, who had kept former PM Trudeau\u0026#39;s minority government alive in return for more social spending, says it is because of him that Canadians here benefited.
