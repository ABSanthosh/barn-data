That outcome is “within our grasp,” he added.Mr. Hochstein’s visit was widely considered a sign that the United States’ efforts to broker a truce were moving forward. He met earlier on Tuesday with Nabih Berri, the Lebanese Parliament speaker who is a key interlocutor between the United States and Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group and political party in Lebanon that is at war with Israel.Last week, Iran appeared to signal support for an end to the war in Lebanon. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, dispatched a top adviser to Syria and Lebanon on Friday who called for Hezbollah to accept a cease-fire, according to two Iranians affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards Corps and who were familiar with the details of the effort.Though both Mr. Hochstein and Lebanese officials have spoken of progress in the discussions, it is unclear whether those talks have ironed out details. Previous U.S.-led negotiations on a cease-fire stalled in September as the war escalated.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
