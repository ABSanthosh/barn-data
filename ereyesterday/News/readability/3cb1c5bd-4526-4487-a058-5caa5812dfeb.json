  "text": "Representative image (AP photo)GENEVA: Iran is relying on electronic surveillance and the public to inform on women refusing to wear the mandatory headscarf in public, a UN report said Friday.The findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran come after it determined last year that the country's theocracy was responsible for the \"physical violence\" that led to the death of Mahsa Amini. In the report, UN investigators outline how Iran increasingly relies on electronic surveillance. Among the efforts include Iranian officials deploying \"aerial drone surveillance\" to monitor women in public places. At Tehran's Amirkabir University, authorities have deployed facial recognition cameras and software to find out who is not wearing the hijab. Surveillance cameras on Iran's major roadways also are believed to be involved in searching for uncovered women.The \"Nazer\" mobile phone app offered by Iranian police allows the public to report on uncovered women.",
