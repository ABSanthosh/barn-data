  "text": "CAIRO — Israel’s recovery of the body of another hostage from Gaza underscores that “the time has come to bring all 100 hostages home,” an umbrella group of hostage families said Wednesday, as Egyptian officials tried to rally momentum behind a proposal for a 60-day ceasefire.The body of Itay Svirsky, 38, who was kidnapped by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, from Kibbutz Beeri in southern Israel and killed in captivity, was retrieved this week and returned to Israel for burial, the Israel Defense Forces and the Shin Bet security agency announced in a statement Wednesday.“Returning Itay’s body for proper burial in Israel provides crucial closure for his family. However, families are still waiting for their loved ones after 425 days in captivity,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement Wednesday.The announcement came the same day as the findings of an Israeli investigation into the deaths of six hostages in February, which concluded that they were probably shot by their captors right after Israel struck a target nearby.After the retrieval of Svirsky’s body, 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, including 96 whom militants kidnapped last year and four held since 2014. A total of 36 of those hostages are confirmed dead, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office.The hostage families’ forum called on the Biden administration and the incoming administration of Donald Trump to “do everything necessary to achieve a deal for the hostages’ return” before Trump takes office on Jan. 20.Egypt has been trying to breathe new life into stalled ceasefire talks in recent weeks and has introduced a fresh proposal for an initial 60-day pause in hostilities. But key sticking points remain, including Hamas’s desire that any cessation of hostilities be permanent, according to a former Egyptian official with knowledge of the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.Ghazi Hamad, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, denied the movement had received such a proposal from Egypt.Cairo also played host in recent days to representatives from rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah in an effort to broker an agreement over postwar governance of Gaza.In a statement Thursday, Hamas said a delegation had concluded its meetings in Cairo and that the movement approved an Egyptian proposal for the formation of a Palestinian committee to govern Gaza after the war.Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Malta on Thursday, where they discussed, among other topics, the situation in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza, according to a Foreign Ministry spokesperson.Saar emphasized to Blinken that Israel perceives an opportunity to advance a deal for the release of hostages and is committed to moving forward with such an initiative.The Israeli security cabinet is scheduled to convene Thursday to discuss efforts to reach a deal, according to an Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.Earlier this week, Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, raised the plight of Israeli hostages with Trump over dinner at his Mar-a-Lago estate.Hazem Balousha contributed to this report.",
