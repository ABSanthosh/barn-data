  "text": "Israel and Iran launched fresh attacks on each other late on Saturday, stoking fears of a wider conflict after Israel expanded its surprise campaign against its main rival with a strike on the world's biggest gas field.Tehran called off nuclear talks that Washington had said were the only way to halt Israel's bombing, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks were nothing compared with what Iran would see in the coming days.Israel's military said more missiles were launched from Iran towards Israel late on Saturday, and that it was working to intercept them. It also said it was attacking military targets in Tehran. Iranian state television said Iran had launched missiles and drones at Israel.Several projectiles were visible in the night sky over Jerusalem late on Saturday. Air raid sirens did not sound in the city, but were heard in the northern Israeli city of Haifa.Israel's ambulance service said a woman in her 20s was killed and 13 other people injured when a missile struck a two-story house in northern Israel.Iran said the Shahran oil depot in Tehran was targeted in an Israeli attack but that the situation was under control.U.S. President Donald Trump had warned Iran of worse to come, but said it was not too late to halt the Israeli campaign if Tehran accepted a sharp downgrading of its nuclear program.A round of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks due to be held in Oman on Sunday was canceled, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi saying the discussions could not take place while Iran was being subjected to Israel's \"barbarous\" attacks.In the first apparent attack to hit Iran's energy infrastructure, the semi-official Tasnim news agency said Iran partially suspended production at the world's biggest gas field after an Israeli strike caused a fire there on Saturday.The South Pars field, offshore in Iran's southern Bushehr province, is the source of most of the gas produced in Iran.Fears about potential disruption to the region's oil exports had already driven up oil prices 9% on Friday even though Israel spared Iran's oil and gas on the first day of its attacks.An Iranian general, Esmail Kosari, said on Saturday that Tehran was reviewing whether to close the Strait of Hormuz controlling access to the Gulf for tankers.Missiles launched from Iran towards Israel are intercepted, as seen from Gedera, Israel, on June 14, 2025.Ilan Assayag | ReutersIsrael Katz, Israel's defense minister, on Saturday warned Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that \"Tehran will burn\" if it keeps firing missiles at Israeli civilians, Reuters reported.\"The Iranian dictator is taking the citizens of Iran hostage, bringing about a reality in which they, and especially Teheran's residents, will pay a heavy price for the flagrant harm inflicted upon Israel's citizens. If Khamenei continues to fire missiles at the Israeli home front, Tehran will burn,\" Katz said in a statement.IDF told Israeli citizens to seek protected shelter until further notice while its \"Iron Dome\" missile defense systems intercept the new threat, NBC News reported.Meanwhile, an NBC crew in Tehran reported that drones, missiles and fighter jets could be heard across parts of the city as Iran deploys its air defenses.The latest rocket launches come as Israel continues carrying out military operations against Iran following what it called a \"preemptive strike\" against that country's nuclear program and other targets, while Tehran seeks retribution.A view of the damage after one of the missiles fired by Iran in retaliation for the attacks hit very close to the Ministry of Defense in Tel Aviv, Israel on June 13, 2025.Saeed Qaq | Anadolu | Getty ImagesThe U.S. military is helping to shoot down Iranian missiles and projectiles being launched at Israel, three American officials told NBC on Friday.The Pentagon had recently moved military assets into the region ahead of Israel's initial strike, another U.S. official told NBC.The assets include U.S. Navy destroyers that were positioned off the coast of Israel to intercept aerial counterattacks from Iran, that official said. The U.S. also used ground-based interceptors, including THAAD and Patriot batteries, two U.S. officials told NBC.Photos and videos from Tel Aviv showed Israel's Iron Dome intercepting rockets over the city.Israeli Iron Dome air defense system fires to intercept missiles over Tel Aviv, Israel, Friday, June 13, 2025.Leo Correa | APThe U.S. has insisted that the American military was not involved in Israel's \"unilateral action.\"But U.S. President Donald Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Friday that the U.S. was aware of Tel Aviv's plan. And in a call with NBC, he seemed pleased with Israel's performance, saying, \"They had the finest equipment in the world, which is American equipment.\" Trump and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke earlier Friday, a U.S. official told NBC. He also spoke on the phone with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for about 20 minutes, a White House official told NBC.Iran's official state news agency said after launching its counterattacks, \"The Hard Retaliation operation has begun.\"\"Iran has launched a powerful and decisive response to the Zionist regime's recent brutal attack,\" the agency said. \"Just moments ago, Iran began firing hundreds of ballistic missiles toward the occupied territories.\"An explosion is seen during a missile attack in Tel Aviv, Israel, Friday, June 13, 2025.Tomer Neuberg | APVideo showed missiles striking Tel Aviv.Israeli defense systems are operating to intercept the missiles, according to IDF, which instructed the public to enter protected spaces and remain there until further notice.U.S. stock markets closed lower Friday, as Iran's retaliatory strikes fueled fears of a broader regional conflict. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 700 points, or nearly 2%, while the S\u0026P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each dropped more than 1%.Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a statement, said, \"The Zionist regime will not remain unscathed from the consequences of its crime.\"\"The Iranian nation must be guaranteed that our response will not be half-measured,\" Khamenei said.Smoke rises after a missile attack in Tel Aviv, Israel, Friday, June 13, 2025.Leo Correa | APIran will not participate in the sixth round of nuclear negotiations with the United States scheduled for this weekend, Iranian state television reported earlier.The talks were expected to take place on Sunday in Muscat, Oman.\"We are still hoping for talks,\" a U.S. official said Friday morning, hours after Israel launched its Operation Rising Lion assault on Iran.But the Times of Oman reported that the Oman News Agency and Iranian state television said the talks were suspended until further notice.This picture shows rocket trails in the sky above Netanya on June 13, 2025.Jack Guez | AFP | Getty ImagesIsrael said it had struck Iranian nuclear sites in Isfahan and Natanz, along with many other targets.Israeli Army Spokesperson Brigadier General Effie Defrin said the attacks, dubbed Operation Rising Lion, in addition to targeting Iran's nuclear program, are intended to degrade the nation's long-range missile capabilities, NBC reported.Defrin said Israel is aware of Iran's intention to launch missiles and drones in retaliation.Meanwhile, two Iranian news agencies reported that two explosions were heard near the nation's Fordo nuclear enrichment site, according to NBC. That site is buried deep underground.Read more CNBC politics coverageVance Boelter sought in fatal shooting of Minnesota Rep.

CNBC could not independently verify this report.Trump pulled the U.S. out of the first Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal during his first term in the White House, and imposed wide-ranging and economically debilitating sanctions against Tehran.But Trump has been steadfast in pursuing a new deal over Iran's nuclear program since returning to the White House earlier this year.However, negotiations between the U.S. and Iran have yet to bear fruit.Tehran has accused Washington of not respecting Iran's right to enrich uranium for what it says are peaceful purposes.— CNBC's Natasha Turak and Reuters contributed to this report.",
