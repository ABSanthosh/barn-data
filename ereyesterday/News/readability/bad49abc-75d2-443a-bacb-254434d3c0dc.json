  "text": "President Donald Trump’s approval rating is sinking ― and not even Fox News can spin it.The right-wing network, which is usually a safe space for the MAGA faithful, on Wednesday shared its latest poll numbers, which show the president’s approval rating is now far behind every other 21st-century president at a similar point.Trump’s approval rating is 44% at almost 100 days in office, compared with 54% for Joe Biden, 62% for Barack Obama and 63% for George W. Bush at the same point.He’s even behind himself: Trump’s approval rating was 45% at the 100-day mark of his previous term in office.The poll is driven in part by economic issues, which had been Trump’s strong spot during his first term. But right now, just 38% approve of how he is handling the economy, versus 56% who disapprove. He’s also deep underwater on inflation (33% approve, 59% disapprove) and tariffs (33% approve, 58% disapprove), according to the poll.Trump’s 44% overall approval rating is also a 5-point drop from the 49% approval rating he enjoyed in the March Fox News poll.The Fox News poll isn’t an outlier.A new Reuters/Ipsos poll finds his overall approval rating is 42%, with just 37% approving of how he has handled the economy. A new Pew poll finds his approval rating is just 40%, down 7 points in two months.The RealClearPolitics poll average finds his disapproval rating has jumped 12 points in three months and is now at 51.6%, compared with 46.1% who approve.",
