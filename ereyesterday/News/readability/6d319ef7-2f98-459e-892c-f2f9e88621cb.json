  "text": "More than eight years after launching a blood-drenched war on drugs as president of the Philippines, elected on a platform that boiled down to shoot first and ask questions later, Rodrigo Duterte, 79, found himself under arrest and en route to The Hague on Tuesday under a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court. He had long taunted the international community to hold him accountable.It was a moment of reckoning for the Philippines, which under his rule saw thousands killed in a sweeping crackdown.Duterte’s push to stamp out drugs nationally began immediately after his 2016 election victory — under a promise to continue with the approach that he used to make a name for himself in seven terms as the mayor of Davao City, the country’s third-largest.Rodrigo Duterte’s supporters cheered for him during his 2016 presidential campaign. He was sworn into office on June 20, 2016. (Video: Reuters)“Forget the laws on human rights. If I make it to the presidential palace, I will do just what I did as mayor,” he said at his final campaign rally. “You drug pushers, holdup men and do-nothings, you better get out because I’ll kill you.”“I’ll dump all of you into Manila Bay and fatten all the fish there.”He soon made good on his word.Summary executions left victims on the street with bound limbs and taped faces, next to cardboard signs reading: “I am a drug addict.” Others were dumped in the water, sometimes loaded down with concrete.For years, Duterte urged the killings in explicit terms, while denying direct state links and pointing instead to “vigilante killers” and gangland justice out of his control.Many killings happened in murky police encounters: drug users shot in the back of the head, drug packets seemingly planted at crime scenes, the same guns found on different victims, according to reports from rights groups including Human Rights Watch. Police reports often alleged self-defense, copy-pasting the Filipino stock phrase “nanlaban,” or “they fought back.”The United Nations, United States and Europe criticized then-Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s deadly war on drugs in 2016, but he did not back down. (Video: Reuters)Even as calls grew to investigate accusations of systematic, state-sanctioned killings by police, Duterte remained popular. A national survey in 2019 found that around 80 percent of Filipinos polled were “satisfied” with the administration’s campaign.The Philippine government in June 2022 reported that at least 6,252 people had died “during antidrug operations” since July 2016.Some rights groups have said as many as 30,000 people died in the war on drugs.For years, Duterte seemed to enjoy the same deep-seated impunity that he appeared to extend to those who killed during the drug war.The ICC is responsible for trying individuals charged with some of the most serious crimes under international law, including genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Many such charges are largely symbolic, as the ICC does not try people in absentia. If tried, Duterte would join a small list of less than two dozen people who have been held in the ICC detention center and appeared before the court.Duterte has often railed against international law and compared himself to its opponents.“Hitler massacred 3 million Jews. Now, there is 3 million drug addicts. … I’d be happy to slaughter them,” he said in public remarks in 2016. (More than 6 million Jewish people were killed in the Holocaust.)Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said in 2016 he’d kill drug addicts the way Adolf Hitler killed “3 million Jews.” Hitler killed 6 million Jewish people. (Video: Reuters)As international scrutiny increased and cases began piling up, Duterte dared the international community to arrest him. He mocked the concept of human rights.“Your concern is human rights, mine is human lives,” he said in his 2018 State of the Nation address, meaning lives lost to drug addiction.Before a regional summit in September 2016, he said: “The campaign against drugs will continue. … Plenty will be killed until the last pusher is out of the streets. … And I don’t give a s--- about anybody observing my behavior.”He warned that “nobody has the right to lecture” him about human rights and extrajudicial killings.“I am the president of a sovereign state. And we have long ceased to be a colony. I do not have any master except the Filipino people,” he said. He was expected to meet with then-president Barack Obama, who called the meeting off after Duterte in that briefing appeared to call him a “son of a whore.”The ICC began investigating Duterte in 2018, and three years later it formally authorized an investigation on accusations of the crime against humanity of murder.All the while, even up until his arrest, Duterte continued to dare the international community to act.He repeatedly said he was willing to “rot in jail” to rid the Philippines of drugs.Addressing the United Nations, United States and European Union directly in a 2016 speech, he taunted: “Come here, investigate me. … I will play with you in public.”In December 2020, he said “all addicts have guns. If there’s even a hint of wrongdoing, any overt act, even if you don’t see a gun, just go ahead and shoot him.”“Human rights, you are preoccupied with the lives of the criminals and drug pushers,” he continued, reported the Philippine Star. “The game is killing. … I say to the human rights, I don’t give a s--- with you. My order is still the same.”In July 2019, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte attacked Iceland for spearheading a U.N. resolution to investigate his bloody war on drugs. (Video: Reuters)After Iceland led a U.N. resolution calling for an investigation of Duterte’s drug war in 2019, Duterte went on a rambling rant decrying the country’s abundance of ice.“Iceland. That’s your problem, you have too much ice, and there is no clear day or night there,” he said. “So you can understand no crime. There is no policeman either, and they just go about eating ice.”“Please don’t f--- with me, I will really kill you,” he said. “So what’s wrong? I am asking the human rights people. Is it wrong to say if you destroy my country I will kill you? Is that a crime for a president, mayor or a governor to say that in public?”At a congressional hearing in November, Duterte said “I’m asking the ICC to hurry up,” saying the issue has been left hanging. “And if I am found guilty, I will go to prison and rot there for all time.”Footage from former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte’s daughter shows him questioning his arrest while being held in Villamor Airbase in Manila on March 11.
