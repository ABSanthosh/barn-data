  "text": "President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to impose a 35 percent tariff starting Aug. 1 on more than half of Canada’s exports to the United States in the latest jolt to the on-again, off-again trade talks between the North American neighbors.In a letter posted on his social media site Truth Social, Trump blended complaints about Canadian trade practices and what he said was Ottawa’s failure to prevent illicit cross-border shipments to the U.S. of fentanyl, a highly addictive drug. The president left open the possibility of “an adjustment” to his tariff plans, if Canada stepped up efforts to police the border.The announcement marked a setback in Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s bid to negotiate a new economic partnership with the U.S. ahead of the July 21 deadline to which the two sides agreed. Canadian officials have been seeking a deal that would lift tariffs Trump imposed earlier this year. In a social media post late Thursday, Carney said that effort would continue toward the new Aug. 1 deadline contained in Trump’s letter.Prospects for an eventual deal are probably now no better or worse than before Trump’s latest escalation, according to Simon Lester, a trade specialist and nonresident fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute.“I took that letter to be a negotiating tactic by Trump,” Lester said. “I think the Canadians are probably used to Trump’s negotiating approach by now and are just staying focused on the substance of the talks.”Indeed, Carney’s response to Trump’s threat was low key. The Canadian government has made “vital progress” toward curbing what independent experts say is the minor amount of fentanyl that crosses the U.S.-Canadian border, he wrote on the social media site X.“We are committed to continuing to work with the United States to save lives and protect communities in both our countries,” the prime minister said.Trump’s Canadian missive was among nearly two dozen letters the White House dispatched this week to U.S. trading partners. The letters, complete with occasional typos and the president’s habit of capitalizing random nouns, represented the latest twist in his campaign to achieve “reciprocity” in U.S. trade relations.President Donald Trump has threatened and pulled back deadlines to impose tariffs no fewer than four times over his first six months in office. (Video: JM Rieger/The Washington Post, Photo: Tom Brenner/The Washington Post)Trump on April 2 declared that the annual U.S. trade deficit amounted to a “national emergency,” as he announced the highest U.S. taxes on imported goods in nearly a century. After a week of financial market distress, he paused the tariffs for 90 days to allow for negotiations with more than a dozen top trade partners, including the European Union and Japan.The president has said the tariffs are needed to encourage greater domestic manufacturing and to eliminate the trade deficit. But he clouded that message Thursday when he announced tariffs of 50 percent, the highest to date, on goods from Brazil, although the U.S. enjoys a surplus in trade with the South American nation.Few countries are more exposed to Trump’s tariffs than Canada, which sends more than three-quarters of its exports to the United States. Since his return to the White House, Trump has put Canada in his crosshairs, imposing several sets of tariffs that are weighing on its economy and threatening to use “economic force” to annex the country.In February, Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on Canadian goods — as well as those from Mexico — that went into effect the following month. Soon afterward, he exempted goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which amount to roughly 40 percent of Canada’s exports to the United States. Canadian energy and potash were hit with a lower tariff of 10 percent.It is likely that USMCA-compliant goods will remain exempt from the 35 percent tariff, if it takes effect, according to a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. “But no final paper has been drafted, and no final decisions by POTUS [have] been made,” the official added.In June, Canada rescinded a planned digital services tax that would have affected firms such as Apple and Meta, after Trump called the levy a “blatant attack” on the U.S. and threatened to quit the trade talks.Carney, a former central banker, was elected prime minister in April after casting himself as the person best equipped to handle Trump and the rupture in bilateral ties caused by his tariffs and annexation threats. Carney promised an aggressive “elbows up” approach to Trump, using a popular hockey term. More recently, the Canadian leader has adopted a less-combative tone, occasionally employing flattery in a bid to improve bilateral ties.The new tariff rate is separate from those imposed or threatened on specific sectors, such as automobiles, copper, steel and aluminum, all of which the U.S. imports from Canada. If Canada retaliates for Trump’s latest threat, then the U.S. will increase its tariffs by the same amount in addition to the 35 percent rate, Trump said.Canada has imposed retaliatory tariffs on many U.S. goods, although it later rolled some of them back. Carney last month said he could adjust countertariffs against U.S. steel and aluminum products “consistent with progress made” in the trade negotiations.There is little evidence to support Trump’s claim that traffickers are smuggling significant amounts of fentanyl across the northern border. Less than 1 percent of fentanyl seized at or near U.S. land borders in the 2024 fiscal year came from Canada, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.The Canadian government has taken steps to mollify Trump, even as it has stressed that the country is not a significant source of the drug. In December, Ottawa unveiled a nearly $950 million plan to tighten security at the U.S.-Canada border and this year appointed a “Fentanyl Czar.” Canadian officials have said they are not sure what more the Trump administration wants them to do.Trump has listed several other — and, at times, contradictory — justifications for the tariffs on Canadian goods, including the U.S. trade deficit with its northern neighbor, which he frequently overstates by more than $100 billion, and the country’s supply management system for dairy products. His letter to Carney mentioned both.",
