  "text": "In a bold move to attract major investments, President-elect Donald Trump has pledged expedited federal permits for construction and energy projects exceeding $1 billion. Announcing the plan on his Truth Social account on Wednesday, Trump wrote, “Anyone making a $1 billion investment in the United States will receive fully expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to, all Environmental approvals.” He ended his post with the emphatic call: “GET READY TO ROCK!!!”Environmental concerns take center stageThe announcement, while stirring enthusiasm among some energy stakeholders, sparked immediate backlash from environmental advocates. Critics argue the plan violates the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires thorough environmental reviews of major projects.Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, called the proposal “blatantly illegal” and accused Trump of prioritizing corporate polluters. “This is another example of Trump selling out America to the highest bidder,” she said. Alexandra Adams from the Natural Resources Defense Council added, “What if someone wants to build a waste incinerator next to Mar-a-Lago or a coal mine next to Bedminster? Community impacts matter.”Push for permitting reformDespite the controversy, Trump’s push underscores bipartisan interest in overhauling permitting processes. Energy analyst Kevin Book noted that permitting delays often hinder billion-dollar projects across sectors. “The substance here is real. Trump is serious about permitting reform,” Book said.A bipartisan proposal led by Senators Joe Manchin and John Barrasso aims to streamline approvals for energy and mineral projects, but its future remains uncertain. Critics like Rep. Raul Grijalva argue the plan prioritizes oil and gas companies while undermining environmental protections.“Drill, baby, drill”Jason Miller, a senior Trump adviser, hinted at sweeping deregulation under Trump’s leadership, dubbing his second term a potential “golden age of regulation-cutting.” “He’s ready to move heaven and earth to bring money into the US,” Miller said at a Wall Street Journal conference.While the plan energizes Trump’s base, its legal hurdles and political implications set the stage for fierce debates in 2025. Environmental groups, lawmakers, and industry leaders are bracing for the next chapter of America’s energy policy.",
