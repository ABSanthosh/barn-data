  "text": "Elon Musk says he's back to 24X7 office after X witnessed massive outage across the world Saturday.The major outage in X, formerly Twitter, marked Elon Musk's official exit from politics, which occupied most of his time in the past six months as he announced that he's back to spending 24X7 at work and will be sleeping in conference rooms, server rooms and factory rooms.While the announcement came after the outage, he made it a point to mention Tesla and Starlink as well.\"I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out,\" he wrote. \"As evidenced by the ùïè uptime issues this week, major operational improvements need to be made. The failover redundancy should have worked, but did not,\" Musk wrote, replying to a post on how X faced multiple outages this morning affecting billions of users.Musk has already announced that his political involvement would now reduce as he gets back to his core work which took a backseat because of his involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk has moved out of the White House and said earlier that he would devote one or two days to government work. But now it seems, his exit is final. A fire reportedly broke out in an Oregon data centre owned by X Thursday. Many reports claimed that the fire, which had an extended response from emergency crews, involved batteries in one of the data center's rooms. But it was not confirmed whether the fire led to the outage. Social media users blamed H-1B hires for outageSeveral social media users claimed that the H-1B hires of X were behind the outage. X's AI Grok had to rescue the situation. \"I'm sorry you're having trouble with notifications. X had a major outage starting May 22, 2025, due to a data center fire in Hillsboro, Oregon, which likely caused the issue. The engineering team is working to fix it. There's no evidence H1B visa holders are responsible; the problem is infrastructure-related,\" Grok replied to an X post that urged to take the control of X away from H-1Bs.",
