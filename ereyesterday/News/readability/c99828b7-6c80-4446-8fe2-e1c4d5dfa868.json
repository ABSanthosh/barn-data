  "text": "U.S. ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee claimed U.S. authorship Friday of a controversial new proposal to bring humanitarian aid into Gaza, telling reporters in Jerusalem that the plan is an “initiative” by President Donald Trump and that Israel has little to do with it.“Today, we are announcing that the process is ongoing. It is launched,” Huckabee said in a news conference outside the doors of the U.S. Embassy. He declined to provide details about timing, or which countries or organizations would be involved.But the initiative, which the administration had hoped to have well underway by the time Trump travels to the Middle East next week, remains in flux as anticipated major funders — including the United Arab Emirates — have declined to participate. No other country so far has announced support.Humanitarian aid leaders such as David Beasley, the Trump-appointed former head of the World Food Program and former South Carolina governor, whom the administration has tried to enlist in a leading role, are insisting on major revisions to the plan before agreeing to play a part, according to a person familiar with the planning who, like others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity about the sensitive proposal.The UAE and Beasley did not respond to requests for comment.The United Nations and major nongovernmental humanitarian organizations have publicly called the plan — which would see food distributed to select Gazans at Israeli-designated locations in military-occupied areas — dangerous, unworkable, insufficient and a violation of their principles of neutrality and international law.Israel has imposed a complete blockade on Gaza for more than two months, allowing no food or other aid to enter since it broke a temporary truce that began in January and resumed military operations against Hamas. The United Nations and other aid groups have said they have run out of stockpiled food to distribute and that water and fuel are dangerously scarce.Trump said Monday that people in Gaza “are starving and we are going to help them get some food.” Even as the administration has blamed Hamas for continuing the war, he has reportedly grown increasingly frustrated with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s unwillingness to accept a ceasefire.While administration officials have been closely involved in the current proposal, an early version of the plan was raised by Israeli military leaders in late February. Netanyahu’s security cabinet approved its implementation last Sunday, along with a new military strategy that will again relocate much of Gaza’s population — including hundreds of thousands of previously displaced civilians who returned to their homes in the decimated northern part of the enclave during the ceasefire — to humanitarian “zones” in the south as Israel begins an offensive against remaining Hamas fighters.The southern zones are to include four to six Israeli-constructed distribution hubs, with corridors for truck convoys entering Gaza from the Kerem Shalom crossing in the southeast corner of the enclave. Security for the corridors, convoys and hubs is to be provided by U.S. private security contractors.While the initiative says aid distribution will reach at least 1 million Gazans, the initial stage will offer supplies to fewer than 200,000, according to people briefed on the plan. It calls for Israeli-vetted heads of families to pick up a 44-pound package of aid at one of the distribution hubs once a week.“The Israelis are going to be involved in providing necessary military security because it is a war zone, but they will not be involved in the distribution of the food,” Huckabee said. “Their role will remain on the perimeter. … The Israelis are supportive. Any allegation that the Israelis don’t care about humanitarian aid is absolutely false.”“They also care very much that Hamas doesn’t steal that aid. But that is a view that is shared by the president and by all of us in the United States,” he said.Huckabee said more details would be released “in the coming days.”Israel and the United States have said the main reason for the plan is that Hamas has stolen most of the aid delivered to Gaza — a charge that aid organizations and some administration officials have disputed.To head the effort, a registered nonprofit has been established in Switzerland, called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, to collect and distribute funding and manage contracts with security contractors and others.Meanwhile, Trump Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has put on the table a proposal for Hamas to begin to release up to 24 hostages still thought to be alive in exchange for a 50-day ceasefire. That proposal has been rejected by Hamas because Israel refuses to agree to a permanent end to the war. Huckabee said implementation of the aid plan does not depend on a ceasefire.Witkoff called U.N. Security Council ambassadors to a meeting at the U.S. mission at the United Nations this week to discuss the aid plan. On Thursday, heads of a number of leading aid organizations participated in a virtual meeting at which a 14-page Gaza Humanitarian Foundation document was distributed, outlining how the initial stages of the aid distribution will grow to reach far greater numbers of Gazans.Amid reports that Trump is losing patience with Israel, senior Netanyahu adviser Ron Dermer visited the White House on Thursday, according to White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.Huckabee denied reports that Trump was backing away from Israel. “I think the answer to that is an emphatic no,” he said.",
