The two sides have come close before to such agreements, only to see them unravel at the last minute over the details.President Trump said on Tuesday that Israel had agreed to the conditions for a temporary truce, and he called on Hamas to do the same.“The movement submitted the response” to mediators, Hamas said in a statement late Friday night, adding it was “characterized as being positive.”The proposal calls for hostage-for-prisoner swaps and negotiations leading to a permanent end to the nearly two-year-old war in Gaza.Mr. Trump said earlier this week that he had been pressuring Israel and Hamas to make a deal ahead of a visit by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to Washington on Monday.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
