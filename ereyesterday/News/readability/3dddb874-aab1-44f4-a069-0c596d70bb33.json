  "text": "Senior officials in Lebanon are reviewing a U.S.-backed cease-fire proposal to end the war between Israel and Hezbollah, as Israel continued to target Beirut’s southern suburbs on Saturday.The proposal is largely based on U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, officials said. It calls for Hezbollah to withdraw from southern Lebanon and says only the Lebanese military and U.N. peacekeepers should operate in the region, which borders Israel.Lebanese officials are expected to respond to the proposal soon. Lebanon’s parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri, who Hezbollah said was authorized to negotiate on its behalf, said Friday that discussions were “progressing.” A lawmaker from the same parliamentary bloc as the speaker, Qassen Hashem, told local radio Saturday that the response to the draft cease-fire proposal would be ready by Monday or Tuesday at the latest, while accusing Israel of trying “to discuss the draft under fire to impose its conditions.”Israel’s military has stepped up strikes on southern Beirut in recent days. On Saturday, Israeli strikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs, as Israel’s military issued evacuation notices to residents and said the strikes targeted Hezbollah’s “terrorist infrastructure.”Israel’s military said it had intercepted four drones and 20 projectiles that had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory early Saturday, setting off sirens in the Western Galilee border area.Here are other key developmentsWorld Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said an attack on a civil defense center in northeastern Lebanon had killed at least 12 paramedics. “Attacks on health care are becoming the new normal in conflicts,” he wrote on X. “This must stop — everywhere!”Iran’s Foreign Affairs Ministry denied any meeting between Trump-ally Elon Musk and the country’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York, Iranian state media reported. The New York Times reported that the two met Monday to discuss how to defuse tensions between Tehran and Washington. Trump’s election has fueled fierce debate in Iran over whether to negotiate, or take a more hostile stance, with his administration.Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz on Friday gave the go-ahead for 7,000 notices to be sent to ultra-Orthodox Jews to enlist in the Israel Defense Forces. Ultra-Orthodox Jews make up more than 12 percent of Israel’s population and have lent crucial backing to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had promised them exemptions from military service.At least 43,799 people have been killed in Gaza during the war and 103,601 injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. At least 3,445 people have been killed and 14,599 injured in Lebanon, the country’s Health Ministry said. Neither agency distinguishes between civilians and combatants.Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, including more than 300 soldiers. It says 373 soldiers have been killed in its military operation in Gaza.Live coverage contributors 8Iran’s defense minister arrives in Damascus to meet Syrian officialsReturn to menuIranian Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh traveled to Damascus on Saturday to join meetings with Syrian political and military officials.On arriving in the Syrian capital, Nasirzadeh told reporters that Syria plays a “prominent and strategic role” in Iran’s foreign policy. Tehran, he said, stands ready to support Syria “as a friend and strategic partner” in all aspects.As Israel has increased strikes on Syria and in the region, Iran has expanded its outreach to allies.Nasirzadeh, leading a delegation of high-ranking Iranian officials, was set to meet with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, according to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency. He was also due to meet with Syrian Defense Minister Ali Mahmoud Abbas, whom he said invited the delegation, the Iranian Defense Ministry said.The officials were expected to discuss defense ties, “cooperation on fighting terrorism” and regional developments, the Defense Ministry said in a news release.Ali Larijani, a top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made an official visit to Damascus on Thursday.Larijani met on Friday with Lebanese caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati, who urged the Iranian delegation to support Lebanon in its efforts to reach a cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel, Lebanese state-run media reported.Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, is backed by Iran.“It is crucial to avoid actions that could create sensitivities among Lebanese factions or favor one group over another,” Mikati told Larijani on Friday. Larijani later told reporters that Iran would back any decision made by the Lebanese government.IDF continues attacks on southern LebanonReturn to menuIsraeli forces launched a fresh wave of strikes on southern Lebanon on Saturday.Lebanese state media reported strikes on the town of Khreibeh that killed four children and their parents. On Friday, National News Media said three people were killed and nine injured in a strike on a residential area in Tyre.Lebanese media reported that Israeli ground forces reached their deepest point in Lebanon since the start of their invasion six weeks ago. The Associated Press reported that the IDF briefly captured a strategic hill in the village of Chamaa, three miles from the border. Those claims could not be independently verified.The Israeli military issued evacuation warnings in Haret Hreik, Al-Ghobeiry, Burj al-Barajneh and more than a dozen other communities, one in “a series of steps,” the IDF Arabic-language spokesman Avichay Adraee said, to “reduce the possibility of civilian casualties.”The chief of the IDF’s general staff toured the Kfarkela area of southern Lebanon this week with other commanders, the military said Saturday. Herzi Halevi said Hezbollah had “paid a big price.\"\"Its chain of command has collapsed, many of its operatives have been killed, and extensive infrastructure dismantled,” Halevi said. The IDF will “continue to fight, to implement plans, to go further, conduct deep strikes, and hit Hezbollah very hard,” he said, and will stop “when we know that we are bringing back the residents” of northern Israel to safety.A commando brigade in southern Lebanon has continued conducting “limited, localized, targeted raids” in southern Lebanon using “special equipment, airstrikes and tank fire” to target Hezbollah, the IDF said in a statement.The IDF said it found an underground shaft used as a weapons storage facility with crats of equipment included explosives and grenades, as well as a truck holding a mobile rocket launcher.Gaza strikes kill at least 26, civil defense saysReturn to menuIsraeli airstrikes continued to pound Gaza on Friday, with at least 26 people killed across the enclave, according to rescue workers.A strike on a tent in Mawasi, an area that Israel has designated a safe zone, killed at least seven people, according to Mahmoud Basal, a spokesman for the Gaza Civil Defense. A further seven strikes killed 19 others, he said. The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The bombardment came as aid agencies continued to sound the alarm about a lack of humanitarian aid to Gaza, particularly the north, where the United Nations has accused Israel of blocking lifesaving aid.Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, said Friday that cases of malnutrition had begun to appear at the hospital. “This is a dangerous indicator that the food supply is beginning to run out in the northern Gaza Strip,” he said in a recorded video message. He said dozens of bodies remained under the rubble after the latest rounds of bombardment, with no access for ambulances and civil defense vehicles.The United States confirmed this week that Israel will face no policy consequences for the lack of aid reaching the hunger-ravaged Gaza Strip, following a warning last month from the Biden administration that it had 30 days to improve access or potentially lose some U.S. military assistance. The United Nations said Thursday that six attempts to deliver lifesaving aid in the previous two days to besieged areas of the north had been blocked.Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, on Friday said none should be let in. “As long as we have hostages in the Gaza Strip, we must not make any concessions, not even to the civilian population,” he told Israeli news site Arutz Sheva.Israel drops massive bomb in Beirut strike, as Lebanon mulls cease-fireReturn to menuBEIRUT — The Israeli military dropped a 2,000-pound bomb equipped with a U.S.-made guidance kit on an 11-story building in Beirut on Friday, striking near the heart of the Lebanese capital as officials there mulled the new draft of a U.S.-backed cease-fire proposal.The attack, which was witnessed by a Washington Post reporter, collapsed the building in the Tayouneh neighborhood, sending a fireball into the sky and a plume of smoke over Beirut’s largest park. It came as Israel has stepped up strikes on the city’s southern suburbs in recent days, an area Israeli officials say hosts Hezbollah militants and infrastructure.The military did not provide details on the target. In a statement, it said the Israeli air force “conducted a series of strikes” against “weapons storage facilities, a command center, and additional Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure sites.”This is an excerpt from a full story.",
