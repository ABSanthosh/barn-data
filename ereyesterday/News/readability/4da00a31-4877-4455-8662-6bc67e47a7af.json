  "text": "President Trump's tariffs became very real for importers last month as the government collected more than $17.4 billion in \"Customs and Certain Excise Taxes\" during April. That was nearly double March's haul of $9.6 billion, dwarfing the smaller spikes in revenue seen during Trump's first term. All told, the duties have deposited more than $70 billion into government coffers since Jan. 1. \"As Billions of Dollars pour in from Tariffs ... we’re only in a TRANSITION STAGE, just getting started!!!\" Trump said on Truth Social Friday. He could be right. April's data will perhaps provide only a glimpse of what's coming. The biggest tariffs — 10% duties on nearly every country in the world — took effect on April 5, with plenty of additional tariffs promised for the months ahead.

The Port of Los Angeles, as one example, is now projecting a drop in cargo volume of more than a third starting next week. The large haul also comes despite significant concessions from Trump in April that offered a reprieve to giant importers like auto and technology makers and countries that had been in line for much higher tariffs before the 90-day reprieve.

He has also promised new sector-specific tariffs to be announced in the weeks or months ahead on items such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. The data is significant but could be slightly overstated, with the Treasury Department reporting both customs duties and certain excise taxes from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as a single category. Excise taxes are different from customs duties, and more precise data is expected in the coming months, but the amount of those taxes collected by DHS historically is small. Trump himself has often touted the surge of government tariff receipts, suggesting the US government is on its way to a repeat of an era of US history that ended more than a century ago when tariffs made up a significant portion of government revenues. \"We're going to make a lot of money [from tariffs] and that money's going to be used to reduce taxes,\" Trump said on April 23. \"We're going to get big, big tax breaks.\"",
