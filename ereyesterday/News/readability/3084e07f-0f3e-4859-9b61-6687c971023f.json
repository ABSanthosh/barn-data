  "text": "JAFFA, Israel — Israel carried out massive strikes on a hospital complex in southern Gaza on Tuesday, causing chaos at the facility, overturning concrete on roads and in the courtyard and leaving gaping craters from a raid the military said targeted an underground bunker used by Hamas.At least 28 people were killed in the attack on the European Hospital, according to Gaza’s civil defense force. In a statement, the Israeli military said it targeted Hamas operatives “in an underground terrorist infrastructure site.”Two people familiar with the matter, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press, said the target was Mohammed Sinwar, chief commander of Hamas’s military wing and brother of slain militant leader Yahya Sinwar. Israeli media, citing security officials, reported the same and that nine bunker-busting missiles were used in the attack.Hamas denied in a statement late Tuesday that it had “military bases” in the area and accused Israel of targeting the hospital with the aim of putting it out of service. “The occupation has repeatedly used these claims to attack and destroy the medical sector and kill and terrorize innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip,” the statement added.Videos posted online showed multiple, successive explosions and towering plumes of smoke in the vicinity of the hospital in Khan Younis. Other footage, including videos geolocated by The Washington Post, show scenes of mayhem in the aftermath of the strike, as well as major damage to the hospital entrance.“They bombed the European Hospital, oh God,” Palestinian journalist Hussien Khreis said as he filmed himself running through the courtyard, in a video posted to Instagram. “Everybody go inside!” he shouted.The hospital, one of Gaza’s largest, has frequently housed displaced Palestinians along with patients and staff over the course of the war. It was knocked out of service in July after the Israeli military ordered its evacuation, then reopened in August with the help of PalMed Europe, a Paris-based nonprofit of Palestinian doctors.The strike was the second Israeli attack on a hospital in Gaza on Tuesday. Earlier, the military targeted Nasser Hospital, also in Khan Younis, killing wounded journalist Hassan Eslaiah.It also came just one day after Hamas released Israeli American hostage Edan Alexander, 21, as a goodwill gesture to the Trump administration. The bombs landed as President Donald Trump gave a major foreign policy speech in the Saudi capital, Riyadh.Hamas and the United States had communicated in recent days to secure Alexander’s release, sidelining the Israeli government. The outreach began when Hamas officials contacted Bishara Bahbah, chairman of Arab Americans for Trump, in April, he said, asking him to relay a new ceasefire proposal to the administration.Bahbah said he convinced Hamas to release Alexander without preconditions — something “the president would really appreciate” — to lay the groundwork for negotiations over a permanent ceasefire. “The timing was also very important, because it was going to be on the eve of the president’s trip to the Middle East,” Bahbah said, adding that the decision by Hamas to free Alexander was “based on a strong desire to move the U.S. president to see the suffering of the Palestinians.”On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would continue its war against Hamas, which attacked Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking some 250 others back to Gaza as hostages.“Eliminating Hamas and releasing all our hostages — these go hand in hand,” Netanyahu said. “In the coming days, we are going in with full force to complete the mission — and completing the mission means defeating Hamas, destroying Hamas.”Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 52,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. It has also leveled much of the territory and damaged or destroyed Gaza’s health-care sector.Nermeen Ziyad Abo Mostafa, a medical student, was at her home near the European Hospital when the strikes hit. “My heart almost stopped, a continuous belt of fire,” she posted on her Instagram story, with a photo of dark smoke billowing into the sky.“We started running from one corner to another, shouting at each other to gather in one place, I could not feel my ears from the force of the successive explosions, the fire of the bombs lit up everywhere even though it was not night.”“I write these words and my hands are trembling from the difficulty of the situation,” she added.Parker reported from Jerusalem and Balousha reported from Toronto. Heba Farouk Mahfouz in Cairo, Mohamed El Chamaa in Beirut and Evan Hill in New York contributed to this report.",
