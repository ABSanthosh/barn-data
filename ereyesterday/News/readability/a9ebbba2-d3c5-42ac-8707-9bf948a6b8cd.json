The move follows several days of communication between the militant group and the United States, with Hamas saying the talks had shown “high positivity.”Alexander, 21, was captured during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. His family received the news of his expected release on Sunday, which also marked Mother's Day in the United States.
