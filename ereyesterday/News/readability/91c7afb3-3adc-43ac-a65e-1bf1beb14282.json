  "text": "President-elect Donald Trump, during his fiery speech at the AmericaFest in Phoenix, Arizona, on Sunday, took a direct swipe at \"woke culture,\" calling it \"bullshit\" and blaming it for undermining America’s strength. The 78-year-old’s comments sparked widespread reactions on social media, including an endorsement from Elon Musk, who tweeted “YES!” alongside a viral clip of Trump’s remarks.“Woke has to stop. It’s destroying our country. Woke is bullshit,” Trump declared, referencing the renaming of US military bases that previously honored Confederate leaders. He pledged to reverse such changes, including restoring the original name of Fort Bragg in North Carolina, now called Fort Liberty.Trump vows to end 'transgender lunacy'Trump also vowed to end critical race theory and “transgender insanity” in schools, promising a hardline approach to culture war issues as part of his post-inauguration agenda.“I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation, get transgender out of the military, and out of our elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools,” Trump said, signaling his administration's hardline stance.Trump also promised to “keep men out of women’s sports,” emphasizing that “it will be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.”The president-elect’s remarks come amid a growing political divide in the US over transgender rights, with states moving in opposite directions on issues such as medical treatments for minors and access to LGBTQ-themed books in public and school libraries. Republican-controlled states have sought to restrict access, while Democratic states have moved to safeguard transgender rights.In his first rally-like speech since the November election, he also threatened to retake control of the Panama Canal, pushed back on criticism of Elon Musk’s influence, and suggested he could soon meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Agenda for \"Liberation Day\"Trump outlined his plans for his first day in office, which he referred to as \"liberation day.\" He vowed to crack down on illegal immigration, expand domestic energy production, and eliminate \"woke ideology\" from public institutions.In a broader policy statement, Trump criticized the renaming of Mount McKinley to Denali during the Obama administration. He promised to restore the mountain’s original name, saying, “McKinley was a very good, maybe a great president. He deserves that honor.”Panama Canal and foreign policyThe former president surprised many by suggesting he might seek to reclaim control of the Panama Canal, calling it a “vital national asset.” He criticized Panama’s handling of the canal and demanded it be returned to the US, warning Panamanian officials to “be guided accordingly.” Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino swiftly rebuffed the comments, asserting the canal’s sovereignty and emphasizing cooperation on mutual security issues.Trump also floated the possibility of an early meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. “Bringing the war to an end is one of the things I want to do quickly,” he said, noting that Putin had expressed readiness for talks.Praise for Elon MuskResponding to claims that Elon Musk was acting as a “shadow president,” Trump dismissed the idea but praised Musk’s contributions to technology and space exploration. “No, he’s not going to be president. He wasn’t born in this country,” Trump quipped, adding, “I like having smart people.”Vaccine skepticism and TikTokTrump defended his controversial choice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services Secretary, hinting at possible investigations into vaccines and their links to autism despite a lack of scientific evidence. “We’re going to find out a lot,” Trump said, emphasizing his goal to “make America healthy again.”On TikTok, Trump expressed openness to allowing the app to continue operating in the US, citing its role in reaching young voters during the 2024 election. “Maybe we gotta keep this sucker around for a little while,” he said.Closing rhetoricTrump concluded by reiterating his commitment to fulfilling his campaign promises and tackling culture wars head-on. “We’re going to stop woke,” he declared, signaling a combative presidency ahead.",
