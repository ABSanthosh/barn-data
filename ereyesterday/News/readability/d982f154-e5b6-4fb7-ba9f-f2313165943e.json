  "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday (local time) that he has nominated US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, noting his efforts in \"forging peace in one region after another\".\"I want to present to you, Mr President, the letter I sent to the Nobel Prize Committee. It's nominating you for the Peace Prize, which is well deserved, and you should get it,\" Netanyahu said as Trump hosted him for talks at the White House.Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize nominations from supporters and lawmakers over the years. He has openly expressed frustration about not receiving the prestigious award.He has criticized the Norwegian Nobel Committee for overlooking his role in mediating tensions between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.He has also sought credit for helping maintain peace between Egypt and Ethiopia, and for brokering the Abraham Accords agreements aimed at normalizing relations between Israel and several Arab nations.Trump campaigned as a \"peacemaker,\" promising to use his negotiating skills to quickly end wars in Ukraine and Gaza. However, both conflicts continues to rage even after five months of his presidency.Talks held to continue negotiations: The discussion between both leaders focused on efforts to broker a ceasefire and secure a hostage-release deal in Gaza, as reported by news agency Reuters. Israeli officials were holding indirect negotiations with Hamas in Qatar at the same time, with the United States acting as a mediator. Ahead of the meeting, Netanyahu said talks with Trump could help advance the ongoing negotiations. Trump had predicted before their meeting that an agreement might be reached this week.This was the third in-person meeting between Trump and Netanyahu since Trump returned to office in January. It also came just over two weeks after Trump ordered air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in support of Israeli attacks under Operation Midnight Hammer. Netanyahu also met with Trump’s Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to prepare for the White House discussions. Netanyahu is also scheduled to visit the US Capitol on Tuesday to meet congressional leaders..Ahead of his visit to Washington, speaking to reporters, Netanyahu said he would thank Trump for the US air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. He also confirmed Israeli negotiators were working on a deal in Doha, Qatar’s capital.Israeli officials hope that success in the conflict with Iran will pave the way for normalisation of relations with other neighbours such as Lebanon, Syria and Saudi Arabia, another issue expected to be on the agenda with Trump.Qatar talks continue:White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Steve Witkoff would travel to Doha this week to join the negotiations.On the second day of negotiations in Qatar, mediators held a round of talks with further discussions expected in the evening, according to local sources quoted by Reuters. Hamas has demanded a complete end to the war before agreeing to release remaining hostages, while Israel has insisted it will not halt fighting until all hostages are freed and Hamas is dismantled.A previous ceasefire collapsed in March and efforts to revive it have so far failed. Meanwhile, Israel has intensified its military campaign in Gaza and imposed severe restrictions on food distribution.Trump has been an ardent supporter of Netanyahu. Last month, Trump waded into domestic Israeli politics by lashing out at prosecutors who are handling a corruption case against Israeli leader. Netanyahu says he is not guilty of the charges, which include bribery, fraud and breach of trust.",
