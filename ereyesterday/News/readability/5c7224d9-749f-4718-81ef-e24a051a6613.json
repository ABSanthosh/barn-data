The conflict between Israel and Iran entered its fourth day of violence, prompting urgent diplomacy.By Monday afternoon, Trump issued a stark warning on social media, saying: “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!”The US president has repeatedly urged Iranian leaders to return to the negotiating table, saying they have failed to act even after being given time. “They have to make a deal,” he said, adding that Iranian leaders would “like to talk” but did not do so during the 60-day window before Israel launched its aerial strikes.“They are not winning this war,” Trump said of Iran. “And they should talk and they should talk immediately before it’s too late.” When asked if the US would consider military involvement, Trump responded, “I don’t want to talk about that.”Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the summit’s host, described the moment as historically significant. “We’re gathering at one of those turning points in history,” he said. “The world’s more divided and dangerous.”Other G7 leaders moved quickly to respond to the crisis. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz held informal talks late Sunday to discuss the growing instability in the Middle East. Starmer’s office confirmed the hour-long discussion.Germany is preparing a draft summit statement that will underline the G7’s united stance on preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. “Iran must under no circumstances be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons-capable material,” Merz told reporters.",
