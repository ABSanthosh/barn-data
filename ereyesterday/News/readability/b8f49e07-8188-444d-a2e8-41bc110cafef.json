  "text": "Here’s the latest.Yields on U.S. government bonds spiked sharply on Friday in a sign that the world’s faith in the United States economy had been shaken by President Trump’s trade war with China, as many investors appeared to be turning to German government bonds as a safe haven.In the stock market, meanwhile, the S\u0026P 500 ended with a gain, recovering more of its losses after a major drop last week when President Trump first announced his sweeping global tariffs. But a slumping dollar and shakiness in the U.S. bond market continued to signal investor worry. The sharp rise in the yield on 10-year Treasury bond came as the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies, kept up a fast-moving tit-for-tat tariff fight that has fueled worries over a global recession.On Friday, China responded to President Trump’s tariffs by mocking the American president’s policies as a “joke” and raising its own levies on U.S. goods to 125 percent. In recent days, Mr. Trump has imposed a minimum tariff rate of 145 percent on all Chinese exports to the United States.Last week, Mr. Trump imposed steep “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries and then, hours later, postponed most of them for 90 days, save those on China.U.S. government bonds, known as Treasuries, form a major part of the foundation of the global financial system. The yield on a 10-year Treasury, which underpins corporate and consumer borrowing, rose 0.1 percentage points on Friday, bringing it up from less than 4 percent at the end of last week to more than 4.5 percent this week.Yields, or the return an investor expects expressed as a percentage of the bond’s face value, generally rise when many investors are seeking to sell, driving bond prices down. That means that as yields have been rising this week, investors around the world holding trillions of dollars in Treasuries are seeing their value suddenly decline.At the same time, yields on German bunds fell to 2.54 percent, the lowest rate in just over a month, suggesting more investors are seeing the German bonds as a good place to shelter their money.Here’s what else to know:Stock bounce: The S\u0026P 500 fell as much at 0.9 percent in morning trading on Friday before rallying through the afternoon to a gain of 1.8 percent, taking the week’s rise to 3.8 percent. Last week, the index recorded its worst tumble since the 2008 financial crisis.Bank earnings: As several Wall Street banks reported quarterly results on Friday, their leaders were careful not to come across as too critical of President Trump, even while acknowledging the economic damage his policies might cause. “The economy is facing considerable turbulence,” Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, said in a statement.Consumer concerns: American consumers, wary of faster inflation this year, are losing confidence in the economy, according to the latest survey by the University of Michigan. The survey showed consumer sentiment plummeted again in April. In the year-ahead, respondents expect inflation to rise to 6.7 percent, the highest reading since 1981 and a sharp acceleration from March’s 5 percent level.Trump reaction: Despite market volatility, President Trump claimed his administration was “doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY.” The president did not cite any specific examples of talks underway with foreign leaders or trade deals nearing completion.Customs and Border Protection: Customs officials said importers had not been able to submit a tariff on certain goods. The glitch appeared to be preventing importers from applying a lower tariff rate on goods that were in transit to the United States before some of Mr. Trump’s tariffs took effect. Customs and Border Protection said it was releasing the goods and allowing importers to submit their customs duties later.Back from another trip to Washington, where he met with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Mexico’s economy minister said Friday that his country could succeed in negotiating its way out of tariffs — or at least improve conditions for the Mexican industry.“Secretary Lutnick told me, ‘Your president has done a good job. And we respect Mexico. We want you to do well, too,’” Marcelo Ebrard said during an event with officials and business leaders, adding that his team is still in talks to try to bring down tariffs on Mexican steel, aluminum and auto exports. “If we persevere and if we are prudent — firm but prudent — we will continue to move forward.”At the White House press briefing, Karoline Leavitt said President Trump was “optimistic” that a trade deal could be reached with China and that he was ready to be “gracious” about it. She wouldn’t say if there were any plans for negotiations between the two countries. Leavitt said that more than 75 countries had asked to cut deals, including South Korea, Japan and Vietnam. She said U.S. allies and foes alike needed the U.S. to survive, “and the president is using that leverage to our advantage.”ImageCredit...Kenny Holston/The New York TimesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAt the end of the trading week, stocks bounced back from last week’s sharp fall, while the government bond market and the U.S. dollar continued to signal concern. The S\u0026P 500 rose 1.8 percent on Friday, taking the gain for the week to 3.8 percent.“It’s a different U.S. investment environment,” said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG, noting the challenging trading conditions that have arisen from a rapidly shifting tariff regime. “It’s almost like we are on the apprentice. There are elements of a reality show going on in real time.”Stocks have gained for the week, but other corners of the market reflect investors’ anxiety. April 9 April 10 April 11Stocks on Wall Street ended a volatile week with a bounce on Friday, while government bond markets continued to signal investor worry about the impact of new import taxes, as China raised its tariffs on American-made products to 125 percent.The S\u0026P 500 fell as much as 0.9 percent in morning trading before rallying through the afternoon to a gain of 1.8 percent, taking the week’s rise to 3.8 percent. Last week, the index recorded its worst tumble since the 2008 financial crisis.Markets around the world have veered sharply between large gains and losses amid the turmoil and confusion caused by President Trump’s pronouncements on tariffs.“We know what the issue is,” said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG. “We have heavy-handed tariffs and now we have an impact between the U.S. and China, and that’s not good for activity and planning.”In the government bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield rose again on Friday, taking its gains since last week to roughly 0.5 percentage points, a huge move in a market that underpins corporate and consumer borrowing. The U.S. dollar slumped 0.9 percent on Friday, to its lowest level in about two years.Analysts at ING noted that there was a “confidence crisis” in the dollar as U.S. assets lost some of their haven appeal.All week, markets have been whipped around by the varying intensity and focus of Mr. Trump’s trade policy. Steep “reciprocal” tariffs were imposed on dozens of countries and then, hours later, paused for 90 days. At the same time, the United States and China ratcheted up tariffs on the trade between them.On Thursday, the S\u0026P 500 index slumped 3.5 percent after the Trump administration clarified that tariffs on Chinese imports totaled 145 percent, not 125 percent as it had said the day before. A day earlier, the benchmark index had surged 9.5 percent as Mr. Trump delayed the rollout of high tariffs on dozens of countries.Laurence D. Fink, chief executive of the giant asset manager BlackRock, reiterated his call on a recession. The United States is “very close, if not in a recession now,” he said on CNBC. “The market is also underestimating how high inflation can get.”In the latest survey by the University of Michigan, consumer sentiment plummeted again in April as expectations for inflation surged. In the year ahead, respondents expect inflation to rise to 6.7 percent, the highest outlook since 1981 and a sharp acceleration from 5 percent in March. Expectations for longer-run inflation climbed to 4.4 percent in April.On typical trading days, stock indexes post modest gains or losses, but over the past 10 days, the S\u0026P 500 has suffered some of its steepest declines as well as its biggest one-day gain since the 2000s. Traders are betting this will continue. The VIX index, a measure of volatility known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose to levels last seen during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. The VIX is derived from trading in options — or bets on future moves — in the S\u0026P 500, so it rises when options investors anticipate greater swings in the index.The turmoil has extended into a wide variety of assets, and the government bond sell-off — at the same time as declines in stocks and the U.S. dollar — has puzzled traders and analysts. Some speculation has focused on whether heavy losses in the stock market have led investors to sell their bond holdings, or whether a foreign central bank is selling U.S. assets.Through Friday, the S\u0026P 500 still sat more than 12 percent below its latest peak in mid-February.Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said on Friday in a call with journalists that his bank was concerned about the rise in Treasury yields and was looking at the bond market “every minute.”By the close of trading on Friday, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was close to 4.5 percent, its highest level since February.“It’s a different U.S. investment environment,” Mr. Goncalves said, noting the challenging trading conditions that have arisen from a rapidly shifting tariff environment.“It’s almost like we are on ‘The Apprentice,’” he said, referring to Mr. Trump’s former reality-TV series. “There are elements of a reality show going on in real time.”Rob Copeland and Maureen Farrell contributed reporting.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGeneral Motors will temporarily suspend production at an electric commercial van factory in Ontario, Canada, starting Monday. Unifor, the union representing workers at the plant, said it would affect about 1,200 of its members. Jennifer J. Wright, a spokeswoman for GM Canada, said the shutdown, until October, was due to “market demand and re-balancing inventory,” not tariffs.ImageCredit...Carlos Osorio/ReutersInvestors are seeking safety in Germany’s government bonds.ImageAlexanderplatz square in Berlin. In Europe, German government bonds are considered to be a benchmark and haven asset. Credit...Markus Schreiber/Associated PressGermany has long taken flak from Wall Street and financial capitals around Europe for the extreme fiscal conservatism that has kept the country’s debt levels low. But as global markets convulsed this week, investors rewarded Germany’s caution by snapping up its government bonds, which are known as bunds.Investors have reeled after President Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on nearly every trading partner, temporarily rescinded even higher “reciprocal” tariffs hours after they came into effect and steadily ratcheted up tariffs on China to well above 100 percent.The resulting tumult hit U.S. assets hard, including Treasuries and the dollar, normally considered haven assets. That sent investors seeking other places for safety, such as gold, the Swiss franc and German bunds.The 10-year yield on German bunds, which moves inversely to prices, fell to 2.56 percent, near its lowest level in more than a month. That is notable relative to the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, arguably the most important interest rate in the world, which has soared higher. On Friday, the 10-year U.S. yield was around 4.5 percent, climbing nearly half a percentage point in one week, a huge move in that market.Germany’s strict limits on government borrowing have given the country a stellar AAA credit rating. But last month, lawmakers decided that the next government could abandon the borrowing limit and take on trillions of euros in fresh debt to bolster the country’s military and crumbling public infrastructure. Germany’s export-driven economy is also heavily exposed to tariffs, given the large amount of trade its automakers and other industrial companies do with the United States.The prospect of extra borrowing and a slowing economy had begun to put pressure on German bunds. But the turmoil elsewhere in recent weeks prompted investors to turn back to the country’s debt as a source of safety.This week, Germany’s expected next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, also announced the blueprint for his government, which included an economic plan to jump-start the ailing German economy. And ahead of its planned borrowing binge, Germany benefits from low debt relative to the size of its economy, at about 60 percent of gross domestic product. By comparison, U.S. debt is about 120 percent of the size of its economy.It was “very striking” that in a moment of stress German bunds were acting as the “haven of choice” instead of U.S. Treasuries, said Sander Tordoir, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform, a research institute.“There does seem to be a real safety premium now being place on German government debt,” he said.Fed under pressure as inflation expectations rise.ImageThe Federal Reserve building in Washington.Credit...Anna Rose Layden for The New York TimesFederal Reserve officials have had one clear message since President Trump sharply escalated the global trade war this month. Keeping inflation expectations in check as price pressures rise is their No. 1 priority.On Friday, they faced a big setback.A new survey released by the University of Michigan found that as consumer sentiment took another nosedive because of fears associated with Mr. Trump’s tariffs, expectations about inflation — in the year ahead and over a longer time horizon — jumped sharply.Over the next 12 months, respondents now expect inflation to surge to 6.7 percent, the highest reading since 1981 and a significant increase from the March level of 5 percent. In five years’ time, they are bracing for inflation to stay stuck above 4 percent. The Fed’s goal is 2 percent inflation.There are reasons to take this data with a grain of salt. For one, the survey tends to reflect political biases. Since Mr. Trump returned to the White House, Democrats, once optimistic about the outlook, have turned much more downbeat, about not only inflation but also growth and the labor market. Republicans, meanwhile, have flipped from being far more pessimistic during Biden’s presidency to much more positive.On the margins, that political divide may be beginning to narrow, with the decline in sentiment in April “pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region and political affiliation,” according to Joanne W. Hsu, director of the consumer surveys. Independents are also starting to change their opinions in a distinct way, accounting for a large part of the rise in longer-run inflation expectations.What has helped to somewhat alleviate concerns about the survey findings is the fact that market measures of longer-run inflation expectations, which are based on U.S. government bonds, have stayed far more stable. The divergence has been so stark as to prompt Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, to refer to the University of Michigan survey as an “outlier,” as recently as last month.But as the prospects of significantly higher consumer prices have grown with the escalation of the global trade war, Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, an investment firm, said the Fed could not ignore the shifts taking place in inflation expectations.“The challenge for the Fed is that it just becomes more and more difficult to downplay it, because there’s just more and more evidence,” he said.It is no surprise then that officials at the Fed are toughening up their talk on inflation.It’s “critically important” that inflation expectations stay stable at this time, John C. Williams, who as president of the powerful New York Fed is a permanent voter on the central bank’s policy-setting committee, said on Friday. He said he now expected inflation to rise to as high as 4 percent this year, as the unemployment rate reaches as much as 5 percent and growth dips below 1 percent.Similar concerns were expressed by Alberto G. Musalem, the president of the St. Louis Fed and a voting member on this year’s policy-setting committee. “I would be wary of assuming the impact of higher tariffs on inflation would be only brief or limited,” he said at a separate event on Friday.Mr. Musalem said the Fed should “lean against” the possibility that what could just be a one-off shock turns into something more persistent. “Discerning between underlying inflation and the direct, indirect and second-round effects of tariffs is likely to be challenging in real time.”Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Fed, also said on Friday that the Fed should be “very cautious” about any moves that indicated a “weakening of the Fed’s commitment to get inflation all the way back down.”Asked about the recent financial market turmoil — a worrisome combination of a sell-off of U.S. stocks at the same time that investors have fled the U.S. dollar for other currencies, in addition to U.S. government debt, Mr. Kashkari pushed back on the idea that the central bank needed to intervene. There are signs of stress, but no “big dislocations yet,” he said. Susan Collins, president of the Boston Fed, said the central bank would “absolutely be prepared” to stabilize financial markets if that was needed.This tough talk is likely to translate to the Fed’s holding off on interest rate cuts until it sees actual cracks in the labor market or other tangible signs that the economy is deteriorating in a significant way.On Thursday, Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Fed, confirmed that the bar for cuts had moved a “little higher.”The “more people think prices are going to be up, the more risk there is that it’s not just transitory, that it gets kind of embodied in the system,” Mr. Goolsbee, who will cast a vote at policy meetings this year, told reporters.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTYields move in the opposite direction to prices. So as yields have been rising unexpectedly, investors around the world that hold trillions of dollars of Treasuries are seeing their value suddenly decline. ‘This is not normal’: Trump’s tariffs upend the normally steady government bond market.The bedrock of the financial system trembled this week, with government bond yields rising sharply as the chaotic rollout of tariffs shook investors’ faith in the pivotal role played by the United States in the financial system.U.S. government bonds, known as Treasuries because they are issued by the U.S. Treasury, are backed by the full faith of the American government, and the market for Treasuries has long been deemed one of the safest and most stable in the world.But the Treasury market’s erratic behavior all week has raised fears that investors are turning against U.S. assets as President Trump’s trade war escalates.The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which underpins corporate and consumer borrowing and is arguably the most important interest rate in the world, rose roughly 0.1 percentage points on Friday. The rise added to sharp moves throughout the week that have taken the yield on the 10-year Treasury from less than 4 percent at the end of last week to around 4.5 percent.These increases may seem small, but they are large moves in the Treasury market, prompting investors to warn that Mr. Trump’s tariff policies are causing serious turmoil. It matters to consumers as well. If you have a mortgage or car loan, for example, then the interest rate you pay is related to the 10-year yield.Ten-year treasuries are also considered a safe haven for investors during time of volatility in the stock market, but this week’s sharp rise in yields have made this market unusually perilous.A bond’s yield moves in the opposite direction to its price. So as yields have been rising unexpectedly, investors around the world that hold trillions of dollars of Treasuries are seeing the value of their holdings suddenly decline.Rising yields on the 30-year long bond have also been historic, analysts said. This bond is considered a particular refuge for pension funds and insurance companies, because they have liabilities that stretch into the future, so they need assets that match that.“This is not normal,” Ajay Rajadhyaksha, global chairman of research at Barclays, wrote in a report on Friday. Grappling for an explanation, Mr. Rajadhyaksha pointed to speculation by Asian investors who are selling in response to tariffs, as well as the possible unwinding of highly leveraged bets in the Treasury market. “Whatever the reason, right now, bond markets are in trouble,” he said.The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose 0.44 percentage points this week, trading roughly flat on Friday. The movement signaled a sharp shift in demand for the long bond. The Federal Reserve fixes a few very short-dated interest rates that then ripple out across financial markets. But the further away from the Fed’s rates you go, the less impact the central bank has.“Once you get to the long end, they aren’t really in the picture,” said Matt Eagan, a portfolio manager at fund manager Loomis, Sayles \u0026 Company. “There are fewer natural buyers in that market. Small changes to supply and demand can lead to big swings.”Typically, the nearly $30 trillion Treasury market is too large to be significantly affected by shifts in buying appetites, analysts said, highlighting just how severe the current moves in the market have been.A measure of volatility in the Treasury market reached its highest level since October 2023.“There has been quite a bit of selling that we have seen,” said Vishal Khanduja, portfolio manager for the total return bond fund at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.Another worrying sign this week has been the decline in the U.S. dollar, which tumbled 0.9 percent against a basket of currencies representing its major trading partners on Friday. Every currency of the group of 10 nations rose against the dollar, further pointing to a move away from U.S. assets.A weaker dollar at the same time as government bonds and stocks are selling off is a rare combination, given the dollar’s role as the global financial system’s safe haven.Despite the monthslong slump in the stock market, which is approaching a bear market, it was the bond market looking “queasy” that Mr. Trump said prompted him on Wednesday to pause the worst of his tariffs for most countries.“The big risk elephant in the room is the Treasury market,” Mr. Eagan said.Officials at the Federal Reserve have acknowledged the recent gyrations, but have not yet appeared too alarmed. Susan Collins, president of the Boston Fed, said markets were “continuing to function well.” There were not “liquidity concerns overall,” she said, though she added that the central bank would “absolutely be prepared” to step in if need be.For investors, the moves echoed the wild price swings from the pandemic-induced sell-off in March 2020 and before that, a bout of volatility in September 2019. Those events spooked investors and prompted rapid intervention from the Federal Reserve to stabilize the market.This time, the Fed is in a trickier position. The inflationary effect of tariffs warrants the central bank keeping interest rates high. But it would be more supportive to financial markets and economic growth to lower interest rates, something the central bank has so far resisted doing.On Friday, a widely watched measure of consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in roughly three years. Expectations for where inflation will be in 12 months time soared, underscoring the Fed’s challenge.In the meantime, this week’s chaotic implementation, then partial reprieve, on global tariffs, followed up by an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, has left global investors unsure of relying on the Treasury market, or even the U.S. dollar, as a source of safety and stability.Foreign investors are among the biggest holders of U.S. government debt. Japan is the largest, based on official data, with more than $1 trillion worth of U.S. Treasury debt. The next largest in China, which holds $760 billion of Treasuries, having already reduced its holdings by more than a quarter of a trillion dollars since 2021.“WAKE UP PEOPLE,” Andrew Brenner, a veteran bond trader and head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities, wrote in a brief email. “THIS IS FOREIGN MONEY EXITING THE TREASURY MARKET DUE TO TARIFF POLICIES.”Some analysts and investors fear that a more rapid pace of selling by foreign investors could push U.S. Treasury yields, and with them U.S. interest rates, even higher.“Picking fights with major trading partners who also finance your debt becomes especially risky with a wide fiscal deficit and no credible plan to rein it in,” Mr. Eagan said.Alternatives around the world are also benefiting. Germany has recently announced plans to invest in its military, financed through new debt. The country’s bond market is seen as Europe’s benchmark and is often compared to the Treasury market.As concerns about tariffs initially took hold last week, the spread, or difference, between the yield on 10-year German bunds and 10-year Treasuries shrank, as investors sought out the U.S. haven.That has quickly reversed.Hobby Lobby, the crafting retailer, told vendors that it was delaying shipments from China as a result of the escalating trade war, according to correspondence dated yesterday and viewed by The New York Times. The retailer told vendors that the back-and-forth tariffs resulted in “a rapidly shifting and unpredictable landscape” and that it hoped diplomacy between the U.S. and China “will yield a more stable and balanced outcome.” As a result, the email said, it was delaying shipments, but not cancelling orders, and would review its plans weekly. Hobby Lobby did not immediately respond to requests for comment.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHere’s what to know about who pays the higher costs caused by Trump’s tariffs.ImagePort of Los Angeles in San Pedro, California.Credit...Maggie Shannon for The New York TimesPresident Trump’s latest tariffs are about to become an unavoidable and expensive reality for American businesses and for people who rely on foreign goods.Shoppers buying clothes from retailers in China may soon pay more than twice as much, now that a special exemption for lower-value imports is disappearing. And companies involved in international trade must now make even more complicated calculations to decide how much they owe in tariffs.“Maybe 3 percent of the people are well prepared,” said Jeremy Page, a founding partner of Page Fura, an international trade law firm, whose clients include large companies. “And that might even be charitable.”Imports from China have been hit with tariffs of 145 percent. That means for every $100 worth of goods a business buys from that country, it has to pay $145 to the federal government. Goods from most other countries have a new 10 percent tax, though that could rise if the countries do not reach trade agreements with the United States by July. And there are separate tariffs on cars, steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump has also said he wants to impose new tariffs on pharmaceuticals and computer chips.Mr. Trump contends that the tariffs will encourage businesses to produce goods in the United States. The tariffs on Chinese goods will almost certainly reduce imports from the country. But American businesses will not be able to quickly get goods from elsewhere — U.S. imports from China totaled $439 billion last year — and they will end up owing huge amounts in tariffs.ImageA garment factory in Guangzhou, China. Imports from China have been hit with tariffs of 145 percent. Credit...Qilai Shen for The New York TimesWho pays the tariffs?Mr. Trump has said tariffs are a tax on other countries, but, overwhelmingly, American businesses importing the goods pay the tariffs to the Customs and Border Protection when goods enter the United States. Importers may pass some or all of the cost of the tariff to consumers through higher prices.“In the short term, prices are definitely going to increase,” said Daniel J. Barabino, chief operating officer at Top Banana, a fruit distributor based at the Hunts Point Produce Market in the Bronx, which imports bananas and other produce from Central America.Importers may also try to negotiate lower prices with foreign suppliers, which would reduce the tariff.How are the tariffs paid?Most importers employ customs brokers who calculate the tariffs owed based on the goods’ value and where they were exported from. Other factors — like whether a product has components from China — can complicate the tariff calculation.Payments are made electronically, from the bank accounts of either importers or the brokers, who later recoup the money from their clients. As Mr. Trump has piled on tariffs, some brokers are becoming more cautious and demanding customers pay up quickly.“With changing tariffs and increased risk, many brokers are tightening their credit policies — asking for upfront payments or requiring funds to be held on account,” said Adam Lewis, a co-founder and president of Clearit, a customs broker.Where does the money go?The tariffs end up at the Treasury Department, which also receives taxes and other government fees, and spends the money on things like salaries, weapons and equipment.What happens if a business pays less than it owes?Calculating tariffs can be difficult, especially when tariff rates change a lot in a matter of days, as they have recently.Trade rules allow for some leeway, said Mr. Page, the lawyer. Importers who realize they have made a mistake and inform Customs and Border Protection are usually allowed to pay what they owe, plus interest.But, Mr. Page said, Mr. Trump’s recent executive orders on metals tariffs were stricter than that. The order said Customs and Border Protection could impose much higher monetary penalties if importers misclassified goods, an approach that, in Mr. Page’s view, defies the law.“That mandate says, ‘We’re going to hammer you no matter what,’” he said.ImageLots filled with new cars at the Nansha vehicle import and export zone in Guangzhou. The tariffs on Chinese goods will almost certainly reduce imports from the country. Credit...Qilai Shen for The New York TimesWill the new tariffs cause delays?Customs and Border Protection’s systems are already showing signs of strain.On Friday, the agency said importers had not been able to submit tariffs owed on certain goods. The glitch appeared to be preventing importers from applying a lower tariff rate on goods that were in transit to the United States before some of Mr. Trump’s new levies took effect.Customs and Border Protection said it was releasing the goods affected by this problem and allowing importers to submit their customs duties later.Late Friday, a spokeswoman for the agency said: “There was a brief technical issue that was quickly identified and resolved. It had no impact on cargo flow, and all applicable tariffs were collected during that time.”“This won’t be the last time that something like this happens,” Mr. Lewis said, adding that there may be backlogs when customs officials do more checks to see if the tariffs on Chinese goods are being paid correctly.Countries that don’t strike trade deals with the United States by July may face higher tariffs, and Mr. Trump may suddenly decide to introduce new tariffs. Fears of such levies could extend a monthslong rush to get goods into the United States before the new tariffs take effect.Supply chains have so far handled the higher volumes without major snags.Trucking activity around Laredo, Texas, one of the busiest border crossings in the United States, was 46 percent higher than it was a year earlier, according to Motive, which gets its data from the tracking devices it provides to trucking companies. Local truckers said their networks had not been strained.At the Port of Long Beach and Port of Los Angeles, trucks took 71 minutes on average to pick up cargo from terminals in the first three months of this year, according to data from the Harbor Trucking Association, a trade group. That was slightly up from 68 minutes in the first three months of last year. In the first quarter of 2022, when the pandemic trade boom caused backlogs at the ports, pickups took an hour and a half.Danielle Kaye contributed reporting.Liz AldermanLiz Alderman, who covers the European economy, reported from Paris.European countries move to shield themselves from the fallout of the global trade war.ImagePrime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain, left, and President Xi Jinping of China meeting Friday in Beijing.Credit...Andres Martinez Casares/Agence France-Presse, via Pool/Afp Via Getty ImagesAs the fallout from President Trump’s rewiring of global trade sets in across Europe, governments are putting in place billions of euros’ worth of “tariff shields” to protect their economies, companies and workers from uncertainty and the growing prospect of a recession.Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain announced more than 50 billion euros’ worth of financial support this week as businesses paused exports to the United States, warned of a hit to their finances and reckoned with putting employees on furlough. More European countries are expected to follow.Mr. Trump’s 90-day suspension of U.S. tariffs this week raised hopes in Europe for negotiations, but the damage has already been done. A severe rout in financial markets has compounded the problem, spurring governments to find lifelines at a time when their budgets are being squeezed by higher military spending as Mr. Trump pivots toward Russia from Ukraine.The tariff pause is “fragile,” President Emmanuel Macron of France warned Friday, because 25 percent tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos and 10 percent tariffs on all other products are still in place, representing €52 billion in levies for the European Union.“Europe must continue to work on all necessary countermeasures and mobilize all available levers to protect itself,” he said in a post on X. He added that French entrepreneurs and industrialists told him that their businesses were already being hit “right to the heart” by Mr. Trump’s tariffs.The whipsaw of the tariff announcements has already led to lower growth forecasts. France, Germany, Italy and Spain — Europe’s biggest economies — downgraded their economic outlooks this week, and Moody’s ratings agency said in a new analysis that the tariffs had raised the risk of a recession in Europe.ImageInspecting a bottle of olive oil at a factory in Antequera, Spain.

Spain’s “trade response and recovery plan” will include low-cost credit for businesses that are hit by reduced orders from American buyers or run into liquidity problems. Spain will also earmark €2 billion to insure risks related to companies’ exports.There could be a human toll, too: Spain will also revive a partial furlough system modeled on the one used during the Covid pandemic to shield workers if companies are forced to reduce production.“The world as we knew it has changed, we have to adapt and react,” Prime Minister Luís Montenegro of Portugal said Thursday at a news briefing.His cabinet unveiled loans and other support measures worth more than €10 billion on Thursday to shore up the economy and help the country’s 70,000 exporters, as well as foreign investors relocating their businesses to Portugal. The package includes financing for capital and investment, and aid, grants and credit insurance for exporters.In Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni plans to visit Washington next week to talk to Mr. Trump about tariffs in a bid to avert re-escalation. The United States is a major market for Italian machinery, pharmaceuticals and cars, not to mention foods like Parmesan cheese and leather and luxury goods.Ms. Meloni has called the tariffs “wrong” and said Wednesday that she planned to repurpose up to €25 billion that Italy received from the European Union’s post-pandemic recovery plan to help offset pain from the tariff war.She said her government had identified about €14 billion that could be redirected to “support employment and increase productivity.” An additional €11 billion from another E.U. fund intended for economic development could also be repurposed, she added.ImageAn autoworker in Stuttgart, Germany, puts finishing touches on a Porsche 911.Credit...Silas Stein/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMr. Trump’s tariffs are adding another challenge to attempts by Germany’s new government to revive its economy, Europe’s biggest. The move risks raising prices for U.S. consumers on well-known brands still fully “made in Germany,” from Porsche and Jägermeister to Fischer Amps and Harry’s razors.A new coalition government, headed by the expected next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, this week announced the Germany Fund, which is intended to strengthen the economy. Germany was already teetering on its third straight year of recession before Mr. Trump’s tariffs, as soaring energy prices caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine hit its manufacturing base.The fund would be seeded with €10 billion of public money, with hopes of raising it to €100 billion from private investors, to support small and midsize businesses that form the backbone of the economy. The government is also pledging a corporate tax break to encourage investment and energy price reductions.After Mr. Trump reversed himself on retaliatory tariffs Wednesday, Mr. Merz said Europe should stay united to push for a favorable deal.“Europeans are determined to defend ourselves and this example shows that unity helps most of all,” he said on German television. “Let’s all set tariffs of 0 percent on trans-Atlantic trade, and then the problem will be solved.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe yield on a 10-year Treasury, which underpins corporate and consumer borrowing and is arguably the most important interest rate in the world, rose 0.1 percentage points on Friday. Friday’s rise added to sharp moves throughout the week that have taken the yield on the 10-year from less than 4 percent at the end of last week to more than 4.5 percent this week.Shortly after midday in New York, the S\u0026P 500 is up more than half a percent. It’s been a bumpy day for stock investors though — the index has swung between gains and losses all day. At the moment, the index is still on track for a gain for the week, thanks entirely to the 9.5 percent surge in stocks on Wednesday.A new global pact would require ships to cut emissions or pay a fee.ImageThe industry produces about 3 percent of planet-warming emissions globally, on par with aviation. A cargo ship near Vancouver, British Columbia.Credit...Alana Paterson for The New York TimesAmid the turmoil over global trade, countries around the world reached a remarkable, though modest, agreement Friday to reduce the climate pollution that comes from shipping those goods worldwide — with what is essentially a tax, no less.An accord reached in London under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations agency, would require every ship that ferries goods across the oceans to lower their greenhouse gas emissions or pay a fee.The targets fall short of what many had hoped. Still, it’s the first time a global industry would face a price on its climate pollution no matter where in the world it operates. The proceeds would be used mainly to help the industry move to cleaner fuels. Some of it could also go to developing countries most vulnerable to climate hazards. The accord would come into effect in 2028, pending approval by country representatives at the agency’s next meeting in October.Given the widespread support for Friday’s terms, the head of the organization expressed hope it would be adopted in October with few or no changes.The agreement marks a rare bit of international cooperation that’s all the more remarkable because it was reached even after the United States pulled out of the talks earlier in the week. No other countries followed suit.“The U.S. is just one country and that one country cannot derail this entire process,” said Faig Abbasov, shipping director for Transport and Environment, a European advocacy group that has pushed to clean up the maritime industry. The agreement is the “first binding decision that will force shipping companies to decarbonize and switch to alternative fuels.”The agreement applies to all ships, no matter whose flag they fly, including ships registered in the United States, although the vast majority of ships are flagged in other countries. It remained unclear whether or how Washington might respond to the fee agreement.A State Department official said only that the U.S. didn’t participate in the negotiations.Ships mostly run on heavy fuel oil, sometimes called bunker fuel and more than 80 percent of global goods move by ships. The industry accounts for around 3 percent of global greenhouse emissions, comparable to the emissions from aviation.The agreement reached Friday is far less ambitious than one initially proposed by a group of island nations that had suggested a universal assessment on emissions.After two years of negotiations, the proposal sets out a complicated two-tiered system of fees. It sets carbon intensity targets, which are like clean-fuel standards for cars and trucks. Ships using conventional shipping oil would have to pay a higher fee ($380 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent produced) while ships that use a less carbon-intensive fuel mix would have to pay a lower fee ($100 for every metric ton that exceeds the fuel standard threshold).It is expected to raise $11 billion to $13 billion a year, according to the Organization’s estimates.“It is a positive outcome,” said Arsenio Dominguez, the organization’s secretary-general. “This is a long journey. This is not going to happen overnight. There are many concerns, particularly from developing countries.”The threshold would get stricter over time. It could allow the industry to switch to biofuels to meet the standards. That is a contentious approach, since biofuels are made from crops, and growing more crops to make fuel could contribute to deforestation.The new shipping-fuel standards are meant to spur the development of alternative fuels, including hydrogen.There were objections from many quarters. Developing countries with maritime fleets said they would be unfairly punished because they have older fleets. Countries like Saudi Arabia, which ship huge quantities of oil, and China, which exports everything from plastic toys to electric cars worldwide, balked at proposals to set a higher price, according to people familiar with the negotiations.“They turned away a proposal for a reliable source of revenue for those of us in dire need of finance to help with climate impacts,” said Ralph Regenvanu, the climate minister for Vanuatu, in a statement after the vote.In the end, countries that voted in favor of the compromise agreement included China and the European Union. Saudi Arabia and Russia voted against it.The United States pulled out of the talks entirely.The global shipping industry agreed in 2023 to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050. Last year, it followed up on that commitment with a more concrete plan, taking the first steps toward establishing an industrywide carbon price.Projections by the International Chamber of Shipping, an industry body, found that it would have a negligible effect on prices. “We recognize that this may not be the agreement which all sections of the industry would have preferred, and we are concerned that this may not yet go far enough in providing the necessary certainty,” said Guy Platten, the council’s secretary general. “But it is a framework which we can build upon.”Claire Brown contributed reporting.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn a sign that the federal government’s technology is struggling to keep up with President Trump’s tariffs, Customs and Border Protection acknowledged on Friday that importers had not been able to submit a tariff on certain goods. The glitch appeared to be preventing importers from applying a lower tariff rate on goods that were in transit to the United States before some of Mr. Trump’s tariffs took effect. Customs and Border Protection said it was releasing the goods and allowing importers to submit their customs duties later.China issued new regulations on Friday that will subject semiconductors made by U.S. firms to higher tariffs. The measures will put pressure on companies like Intel, Global Foundries and others who have U.S. chip factories, potentially encouraging chip companies to shift manufacturing out of the United States to maintain access to the Chinese market, where the bulk of global electronics are made. BlackRock’s chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, said on CNBC that in the wake of the push for tariffs, the United States had become “the global destabilizer.” He called this a big shift from the role the U.S. had played as “the global stabilizer” since the end of World War II.ImageCredit...Timothy A. Clary/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesPresident Trump claimed that his administration was “doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY,” as markets once again whipsawed over the persistent uncertainty surrounding trade. The president did not cite any specific examples of talks underway with foreign leaders or trade deals nearing completion, but he said in a post on Truth Social: “Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLaurence D. Fink, chief executive of the giant asset manager BlackRock, reiterated his call on a recession. The United States is “very close, if not in a recession now,” Fink said on CNBC. “The market is also underestimating how high inflation can get.”According to the latest survey by the University of Michigan, consumer sentiment plummeted again in April as expectations for inflation surged. In the year-ahead, respondents expect inflation to rise to 6.7 percent, the highest outlook since 1981 and a sharp acceleration from 5 percent in March. Expectations for longer-run inflation climbed to 4.4 percent in April.One criticism of the University of Michigan survey is that it reflects political biases. Democrats have tended to be overly pessimistic about the economic outlook since Trump returned to Washington. But recently a broader range of respondents have started to shift their views. The preliminary April report said the slide in sentiment was “pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation.” There was a rise in inflation expectations for the year across all political affiliations, whereas the rise in longer-run expectations was largely driven by independents.Tesla’s U.S. sales plunged in the first quarter as G.M. and others sold more cars.ImageProtests against Tesla have been growing since its chief executive, Elon Musk, took a prominent role in the Trump administration.Credit...Rachel Bujalski for The New York TimesTesla’s sales in the United States fell almost 9 percent in the first three months of the year even as the overall market for electric vehicles grew, according to data compiled by a research firm.Car buyers are moving away from Teslas and toward models like General Motors’ Chevrolet Equinox electric vehicle, which starts at around $35,000 and can travel more than 300 miles on a charge, Cox Automotive, the research firm, said in a report.Sales of all-electric vehicles in the United States rose 11 percent during the first quarter to about 300,000 cars and light trucks, Cox said, much faster than the overall auto market, which has been flat. About 8 percent of new domestic car sales were electric, Cox said, a slight increase from 2024.“Despite many obstacles — and what you may read elsewhere — electric vehicle sales continue to grow at a healthy pace in the U.S. market,” the firm said.Tesla, whose chief executive is Elon Musk, still sells far more electric cars in the United States than any other automaker, accounting for 44 percent of the market, according to Cox. But its share has fallen from 51 percent a year earlier.The decline in Tesla’s U.S. sales mirror a global slump. The company said this month that deliveries during the quarter in all markets fell 13 percent to 337,000 vehicles.Analysts attribute the decline to Tesla’s aging selection of models; poor sales of its newest one, the Cybertruck; increasing competition; and Mr. Musk’s embrace of President Trump and right-wing politics, which has led to protests at Tesla dealerships and alienated many buyers. Democrats and independents are more likely to buy electric vehicles than Republicans.In addition, sales of the Cybertruck have not lived up to projections made by Mr. Musk. Tesla sold 6,400 Cybertruck pickups during the quarter, more than double a year earlier, when the company was still ramping up production, but just half as many as in the last three months of 2024.Traditional carmakers were slow to offer electric vehicles that could compete with Tesla on technology and design but have been catching up. G.M. sold 10,300 Equinoxes in the quarter. The vehicle was not available a year earlier. G.M. brands, which also include Cadillac and GMC, accounted for 11 percent of the electric vehicle market during the quarter, up from 6 percent a year earlier.The Ford Mustang Mach-E was the best-selling electric vehicle that was not a Tesla, according to the Cox figures. But sales of the electric Mustang may suffer in months to come. It is made in Mexico and is now subject to Mr. Trump’s 25 percent tariff on imported cars. That could force Ford to eventually raise the price of the car.Mr. Trump’s trade war is expected to have a smaller effect on Tesla, because the company makes all the cars it sells in the United States in factories in California and Texas. But it will still be hurt. Tesla stopped accepting orders from Chinese customers for its Model S and Model X, luxury vehicles that the company only makes in California, after China placed large levies on U.S. imports in retaliation for Mr. Trump’s tariffs.Claire Fu contributed reporting.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTNeel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, warned on CNBC that the Treasury bond sell-off coupled with a weakening U.S. dollar may suggest that investors hold a dimmer view of the relative safety of U.S. assets in times of stress. “Normally, when you see big tariff increases, I would have expected the dollar to go up,” he said. “The fact that the dollar is going down at the same time, I think, lends some more credibility to the story of investor preferences shifting.”“Investors around the world have viewed America as the best place to invest, and if that’s true, we will have a trade deficit,” Kashkari said. “So now, one of the ways that expresses itself is in lower yields across asset classes in America. If the trade deficit is going to go down, it could be that investors are saying, ‘OK, America no longer is the most attractive place in the world to invest,’ and then you would expect to see bond yields go up.”U.S. stock markets just opened slightly lower. The S\u0026P 500 index is down about 0.3 percent as this extremely volatile week approaches an end.At least twice this morning, Peter Navarro, a senior White House trade adviser, has described the president’s trade strategy as “90 deals in 90 days” — a reference to the 90-day tariff pause announced this week. “Americans should trust in Trump, the markets should trust in Trump, and not get these weak knees,” he said on Fox Business.“Time is not our friend,” said Robin Vince, chief executive of the large bank BNY. He told me in an interview that if the Trump administration does not quickly began to reach trade deals, confidence in stocks and the economy will fall further, long before the 90-day reprieve from tariffs ends.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTNews AnalysisAs Trump remakes the global order, Europe tries to seize the moment.ImageUrsula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in Brussels on Wednesday. Her strategy is intended to leave Europe stronger and less dependent on the United States.Credit...Yves Herman/ReutersPresident Trump has big ambitions for the global trading system and is using tariffs to try to rip it down and rebuild it. But the European Union is taking action after action to make sure the continent is at the center of whatever world comes next.As one of the globe’s biggest and most open economies, the E.U. has a lot on the line as the rules of trade undergo a once-in-a-generation upheaval. Its companies benefit from sending their cars, pharmaceuticals and machinery overseas. Its consumers benefit from American search engines and foreign fuels.Those high stakes aren’t lost on Europe.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the E.U.’s executive arm, has spent the past several weeks on calls and in meetings with global leaders. She and her colleagues are wheeling and dealing to deepen existing trade agreements and strike new ones. They are discussing how they can reduce barriers between individual European countries.And they are talking tough on China, trying to make sure that it does not dump cheap metals and chemicals onto the European market as it loses access to American customers because of high Trump tariffs.It’s an explicit strategy, meant to leave the economic superpower stronger and less dependent on an increasingly fickle America. As Ms. von der Leyen and her colleagues regularly point out, the U.S. consumer market is big — but not the be-all-end-all.“The U.S. makes up 13 percent of global goods trade,” Maros Sefcovic, the E.U.’s trade commissioner, said in a recent speech. The goal “is to protect the remaining 87 percent and make sure that the global trade system prevails for the rest of us.”Success is far from guaranteed. America is still the world’s biggest economy and a critical supplier of military technology and leadership for Europe. There is no real hope of replacing it in those roles overnight. Mr. Trump’s pivot is unlikely to be painless.But not changing is not an option, as Ms. von der Leyen acknowledged in an interview with The Financial Times this week.“I mean, never waste a good crisis,” she said.Expanding the friend group.Europe has made it clear that it is eager to negotiate with the United States. Mr. Sefcovic has traveled to Washington repeatedly and plans to return to the United States on Monday. The goal is to work toward “win-win outcomes,” Olof Gill, a spokesman for the European Commission, said on Friday.The bloc is dangling carrots like cutting tariffs on cars and other industrial products, and ramping up purchases of American liquefied natural gas. It is also threatening retaliation if negotiations fail.But striving for a deal is just Part 1 of the strategy. Part 2? Making new friends.Europe has spent the time since Mr. Trump’s re-election working to strike or improve trade ties with various partners. Officials have been in talks with Mexico, India, South Korea, South Africa and Central Asia, to name a few. The E.U. announced just Thursday that it would begin free trade discussions with the United Arab Emirates.Ms. von der Leyen also spoke this week to Mark Carney, the new Canadian prime minister.“She reaffirmed the E.U.’s strong commitment to open and predictable trade, and expressed her determination to work closely with Canada on reforming the global trading system,” the bloc said in a statement.Dealing with China.The E.U. and the U.S. agree that the existing trading system has failed to prevent China from subsidizing production, allowing it to dump inexpensive products into other markets in a way that puts domestic producers out of business.And Ms. von der Leyen has been clear that changes to the trade rules are now inevitable.She told The F.T. that when it came to the World Trade Organization — the beating heart of the rules-based order that Europe holds dear — the goal was to “modernise, reform and stabilise.”Ms. von der Leyen has underscored that Europe will be on watch as the U.S. and China become further embroiled in an all-out trade battle. China on Friday said it was raising its tariffs on American goods to 125 percent from 84 percent, retaliating for the third time in the escalating trade war between the two superpowers.European officials are worried that Chinese companies will send their metals, chemicals and other products rushing toward the continent, with American customers out of reach. The E.U. has set up an “import surveillance task force” to make sure it can detect — and respond to — potential dumping.ImageAluminum rods at a factory in Binzhou, China, in February. Some European leaders have been pushing for closer ties to China.Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesWhen Ms. von der Leyen spoke to the Chinese premier earlier this week, she urged Beijing to negotiate with the United States and emphasized that China needs to work on longer-term structural solutions to rebalance its trading relationships, the E.U. said.Some European leaders — including Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain — have even been pushing to enhance China and E.U. relations in a world of upheaval. Experts have said it is equally, if not more likely, that trade tensions between the two will intensify under all of the pressure.But will it work?Still, Europe's basic strategy is clear: It’s pushing for a deal with the U.S., but it’s also recognizing that the world is on the cusp of change and hoping to ride that shift to success.One question is whether all of its new alliances will trigger Mr. Trump. The American president has already vented on social media about Europe’s deal-making.“If the European Union works with Canada in order to do economic harm to the USA, large scale Tariffs, far larger than currently planned, will be placed on them both,” he wrote on Truth Social in late March.So far, that threat seems to have done little to deter conversations.There is always the reality that Europe relies on American cooperation for more than just trade, though. Even if it can replace American customers and raw materials with other markets, U.S. military support is still critical in both the war in Ukraine and for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.But for now, the E.U. seems to accept that the rules are about to be rewritten. Given that, its leaders seem to be doing what they can to make sure that when it happens, they are holding the pen.As turbulence hits stocks, bonds and the dollar, one asset is soaring: Gold. On Friday it hit another record, trading above $3,200 per troy ounce. Gold is considered a haven asset, and geopolitical risk often leads to strong demand for it. I’ve written about why the gold price is rising this year.

But a 25 percent levy on imported cars remains in place, and that’s causing anxiety in Solihull, England, where 9,000 people work for a large Jaguar Land Rover car factory.JLR, which sells about a fifth of its cars in the United States, responded to the tariffs by pausing shipments to the U.S. in April.“My brother-in-law works in the Solihull JLR, and I know how many cars they’ve got waiting to be shipped out to America,” said Ben Slade, 42, adding: “I think everybody is nervous.”Britain’s government is in ongoing talks with the United States, in the hopes of reducing the tariffs. Mr. Slade said that while he understood that Britain “has to play nice” with Mr. Trump, he believed the government should be “exploring other options,” adding, “even if it means trading with countries that we deem suspicious, like China.”“We need to do business with them because America can’t be relied upon. Starmer is treating it like the special relationship still exists,” he added, referring to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. “But I don’t think it does.”",

In five years’ time, they are bracing for inflation to stay stuck above 4 percent. The Fed’s goal is 2 percent inflation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are reasons to take this data with a grain of salt. For one, the survey tends to reflect political biases. Since Mr. Trump returned to the White House, Democrats, once optimistic about the outlook, have turned much more downbeat, about not only inflation but also growth and the labor market. Republicans, meanwhile, have flipped from being far more pessimistic during Biden’s presidency to much more positive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the margins, that political divide may be beginning to narrow, with the decline in sentiment in April “pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region and political affiliation,” according to Joanne W. Hsu, director of the consumer surveys. Independents are also starting to change their opinions in a distinct way, accounting for a large part of the rise in longer-run inflation expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat has helped to somewhat alleviate concerns about the survey findings is the fact that market measures of longer-run inflation expectations, which are based on U.S. government bonds, have stayed far more stable. The divergence has been so stark as to prompt Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, to refer to the University of Michigan survey as an “outlier,” as recently as last month.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut as the prospects of significantly higher consumer prices have grown with the escalation of the global trade war, Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, an investment firm, said the Fed could not ignore the shifts taking place in inflation expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The challenge for the Fed is that it just becomes more and more difficult to downplay it, because there’s just more and more evidence,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is no surprise then that officials at the Fed are toughening up their talk on inflation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s “critically important” that inflation expectations stay stable at this time, John C. Williams, who as president of the powerful New York Fed is a permanent voter on the central bank’s policy-setting committee, said on Friday.

The rise added to sharp moves throughout the week that have taken the yield on the 10-year Treasury from less than 4 percent at the end of last week to around 4.5 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese increases may seem small, but they are large moves in the Treasury market, prompting investors to warn that Mr. Trump’s tariff policies are causing serious turmoil. It matters to consumers as well. If you have a mortgage or car loan, for example, then the interest rate you pay is related to the 10-year yield.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTen-year treasuries are also considered a safe haven for investors during time of volatility in the stock market, but this week’s sharp rise in yields have made this market unusually perilous.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA bond’s yield moves in the opposite direction to its price.

Grappling for an explanation, Mr. Rajadhyaksha pointed to speculation by Asian investors who are selling in response to tariffs, as well as the possible unwinding of highly leveraged bets in the Treasury market. “Whatever the reason, right now, bond markets are in trouble,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose 0.44 percentage points this week, trading roughly flat on Friday. The movement signaled a sharp shift in demand for the long bond. The Federal Reserve fixes a few very short-dated interest rates that then ripple out across financial markets. But the further away from the Fed’s rates you go, the less impact the central bank has.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Once you get to the long end, they aren’t really in the picture,” said Matt Eagan, a portfolio manager at fund manager Loomis, Sayles \u0026amp; Company. “There are fewer natural buyers in that market. Small changes to supply and demand can lead to big swings.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTypically, the nearly $30 trillion Treasury market is too large to be significantly affected by shifts in buying appetites, analysts said, highlighting just how severe the current moves in the market have been.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA measure of volatility in the Treasury market reached its highest level since October 2023.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There has been quite a bit of selling that we have seen,” said Vishal Khanduja, portfolio manager for the total return bond fund at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother worrying sign this week has been the decline in the U.S. dollar, which tumbled 0.9 percent against a basket of currencies representing its major trading partners on Friday. Every currency of the group of 10 nations rose against the dollar, further pointing to a move away from U.S. assets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA weaker dollar at the same time as government bonds and stocks are selling off is a rare combination, given the dollar’s role as the global financial system’s safe haven.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite the monthslong slump in the stock market, which is approaching a bear market, it was the bond market looking “queasy” that Mr. Trump said prompted him on Wednesday to pause the worst of his tariffs for most countries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The big risk elephant in the room is the Treasury market,” Mr. Eagan said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOfficials at the Federal Reserve have acknowledged the recent gyrations, but have not yet appeared too alarmed.

Those events spooked investors and prompted rapid intervention from the Federal Reserve to stabilize the market.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis time, the Fed is in a trickier position. The inflationary effect of tariffs warrants the central bank keeping interest rates high. But it would be more supportive to financial markets and economic growth to lower interest rates, something the central bank has so far resisted doing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn Friday, a widely watched measure of consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in roughly three years. Expectations for where inflation will be in 12 months time soared, underscoring the Fed’s challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, this week’s chaotic implementation, then partial reprieve, on global tariffs, followed up by an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, has left global investors unsure of relying on the Treasury market, or even the U.S. dollar, as a source of safety and stability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eForeign investors are among the biggest holders of U.S. government debt. Japan is the largest, based on official data, with more than $1 trillion worth of U.S. Treasury debt. The next largest in China, which holds $760 billion of Treasuries, having already reduced its holdings by more than a quarter of a trillion dollars since 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“WAKE UP PEOPLE,” Andrew Brenner, a veteran bond trader and head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities, wrote in a brief email. “THIS IS FOREIGN MONEY EXITING THE TREASURY MARKET DUE TO TARIFF POLICIES.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome analysts and investors fear that a more rapid pace of selling by foreign investors could push U.S. Treasury yields, and with them U.S. interest rates, even higher.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Picking fights with major trading partners who also finance your debt becomes especially risky with a wide fiscal deficit and no credible plan to rein it in,” Mr. Eagan said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlternatives around the world are also benefiting. Germany has recently announced plans to invest in its military, financed through new debt. The country’s bond market is seen as Europe’s benchmark and is often compared to the Treasury market.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs concerns about tariffs initially took hold last week, the spread, or difference, between the yield on 10-year German bunds and 10-year Treasuries shrank, as investors sought out the U.S. haven.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat has quickly reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"8815fcf0-2c79-5d38-9e05-cc9e09984890\" data-testid=\"reporter-update\" data-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/11/business/trump-tariffs-stocks-china#8815fcf0-2c79-5d38-9e05-cc9e09984890\" role=\"article\" aria-posinset=\"30\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" aria-live=\"off\" aria-labelledby=\"post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvODgxNWZjZjAtMmM3OS01ZDM4LTllMDUtY2M5ZTA5OTg0ODkw\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"live-blog-byline\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/karen-weise\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Karen Weise\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eHobby Lobby, the crafting retailer, told vendors that it was delaying shipments from China as a result of the escalating trade war, according to correspondence dated yesterday and viewed by The New York Times.

Still, it’s the first time a global industry would face a price on its climate pollution no matter where in the world it operates. The proceeds would be used mainly to help the industry move to cleaner fuels. Some of it could also go to developing countries most vulnerable to climate hazards.

The agreement is the “first binding decision that will force shipping companies to decarbonize and switch to alternative fuels.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe agreement applies to all ships, no matter whose flag they fly, including ships registered in the United States, although the vast majority of ships are flagged in other countries. It remained unclear whether or how Washington might respond to the fee agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA State Department official said only that the U.S. didn’t participate in the negotiations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShips mostly run on heavy fuel oil, sometimes called bunker fuel and more than 80 percent of global goods move by ships. The industry accounts for around 3 percent of global greenhouse emissions, comparable to the emissions from aviation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe agreement reached Friday is far less ambitious than one initially proposed by a group of island nations that had suggested a universal assessment on emissions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter two years of negotiations, the proposal sets out a complicated two-tiered system of fees. It sets carbon intensity targets, which are like clean-fuel standards for cars and trucks. Ships using conventional shipping oil would have to pay a higher fee ($380 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent produced) while ships that use a less carbon-intensive fuel mix would have to pay a lower fee ($100 for every metric ton that exceeds the fuel standard threshold).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is expected to raise $11 billion to $13 billion a year, according to the Organization’s estimates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It is a positive outcome,” said Arsenio Dominguez, the organization’s secretary-general. “This is a long journey. This is not going to happen overnight. There are many concerns, particularly from developing countries.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe threshold would get stricter over time. It could allow the industry to switch to biofuels to meet the standards. That is a contentious approach, since biofuels are made from crops, and growing more crops to make fuel could contribute to deforestation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe new shipping-fuel standards are meant to spur the development of alternative fuels, including hydrogen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were objections from many quarters. Developing countries with maritime fleets said they would be unfairly punished because they have older fleets. Countries like Saudi Arabia, which ship huge quantities of oil, and China, which exports everything from plastic toys to electric cars worldwide, balked at proposals to set a higher price, according to people familiar with the negotiations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“They turned away a proposal for a reliable source of revenue for those of us in dire need of finance to help with climate impacts,” said Ralph Regenvanu, the climate minister for Vanuatu, in a statement after the vote.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the end, countries that voted in favor of the compromise agreement included China and the European Union.
