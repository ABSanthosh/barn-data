According to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, the fire has already burned about 1,200 acres and remains completely uncontained. Evacuations are currently underway along Wells Mills Road, between Bryant Road and the Garden State Parkway. CBS news reported that authorities have confirmed sixteen structures are under threat and have been evacuated as a precaution. Aerial footage from the area shows parts of the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area engulfed in flames, with thick smoke visible from miles away.New Jersey Wildfire Causes Evacuations The wildfire has also caused significant traffic disruption. The Garden State Parkway has been shut in both directions near Exit 69. Several local roads have also been closed, including Rt. 532 (Wells Mills Road) from Route 72 to the Parkway, Bryant Road between Rt. 532 and Rt. 539, and Jones Road between Rt. 532 and Bryant Road. Firefighting crews have deployed both a helicopter and a fixed-wing aircraft to drop water on the fire in an effort to slow its spread. No injuries have been reported so far. Officials have urged the public to stay away from the area and strictly advised against flying drones in the fire zone, which can interfere with emergency aircraft.
