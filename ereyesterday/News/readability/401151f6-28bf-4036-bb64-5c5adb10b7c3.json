The foundation added that Israeli troops were doing their own preparations along access roads leading to the distribution centers, without specifying what that entailed. The Israeli military warned Palestinians not to approach the sites or the adjacent roads, saying that they were considered “combat zones.”The pause in operations came after days in which dozens of Palestinians trying to reach one of the foundation’s sites in the southern Gaza city of Rafah were killed after coming under fire, according to local health workers.The circumstances of the episodes remain contested. On Tuesday, the Red Cross and Gaza health officials said that at least 27 people had been killed in the second large-scale deadly shooting in recent days. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said that a number of civilians had been injured and killed in an area outside the site but did not provide a number.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
