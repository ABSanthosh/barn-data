  "text": "Elon Musk has once again defended US President-elect Donald Trump in a post on social media platform X. On Friday, Musk defended Trump by calling the criticism against him a \"coordinated psychological operation.\"Musk’s comment, which directly quoted podcast host Joe Rogan, has drawn attention to their shared belief that Trump’s opponents are engaging in a smear campaign to manipulate public perception.The post came shortly after Rogan, on his popular podcast ‘The Joe Rogan Experience’, claimed that much of the backlash Trump faces is orchestrated rather than genuine. In a recent episode of his recurring segment ‘Protect Our Parks’, Rogan described the criticism of Trump as a \"massive, concentrated psy-op.\"Discussing this with his comedian friends, Rogan argued that public opinion about Trump had been manipulated by deliberate narratives designed to distort his image.“What you’re seeing with Trump, regardless of his flaws, is a massive, concentrated psy-op,” Rogan said during the podcast. “They’ve distorted who he is to the point most people think that way. Most people think that they’ve had narratives—psychological operations—to the point they’ve distorted people’s perception of things.”Musk, who has increasingly aligned himself with conservative views, wasted no time amplifying Rogan’s statement. On X, he posted, “It was a coordinated psychological operation,”.Musk’s comment comes as part of his ongoing support for Trump, a stance he has made clear since acquiring X.During the episode, Rogan sought to illustrate his point by revisiting a 2008 video of Hillary Clinton. In the clip, Clinton advocated for the deportation of undocumented immigrants who commit crimes and proposed steep fines for those entering the US illegally. Rogan used the video to highlight what he perceives as a double standard in how Democrats and Republicans are criticised for their immigration policies. Musk’s post appeared to endorse this perspective, amplifying the argument to his millions of followers.Both Rogan and Musk have been outspoken in their support for Trump. Rogan’s endorsement of the president-elect during the 2024 campaign was widely regarded as a significant factor in Trump’s victory, with the nearly three-hour podcast episode between the two drawing over 20 million views within its first day. Musk, for his part, has defended Trump on numerous occasions, hailing him as a misunderstood figure and a key player in what he sees as a fight against media manipulation and censorship.",
