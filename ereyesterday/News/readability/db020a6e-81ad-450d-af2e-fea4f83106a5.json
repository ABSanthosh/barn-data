He spoke at a news conference on Saturday.Credit...Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersMarch 28, 2025Updated 5:51 p.m. ETThe pope’s doctors did not think he was going to make it.“It’s terrible,” Pope Francis gasped during a breathing crisis last month. The pope, his hand bruised with needle pricks and his oxygen saturation dipping to a dangerously low 78 during his long hospitalization, acknowledged in a failing voice that he might die. He held his doctor’s hand.Francis had ruled out intubation, which would mean being kept unconscious, the leader of the medical team, Dr. Sergio Alfieri, said in an interview. So his doctors decided to treat the pneumonia in both his lungs with a last-ditch barrage of drugs that risked damaging his organs.The pope’s closest aides had tears in their eyes as doctors asked the pope’s personal nurse, empowered to make life-or-death decisions, for permission to go ahead with more aggressive treatment. He consented and, ultimately, the pope responded positively.Even so, the worst had not yet passed. Less than a week later, Francis regurgitated some food and started choking. The doctors, fearing he might die on the spot, immediately suctioned his airway but worried that the inhalation would aggravate his deeply infected lungs. His chief doctor worried all was lost.But it was not.On Sunday 38 days after he entered the Agostino Gemelli hospital, Dr. Alfieri discharged the leader of the Roman Catholic Church to return to the Vatican. He implored his patient, who had resisted going to the hospital in the first place, to rest and convalesce so as not to waste the chance he had been given.“It was a miracle that he left the hospital,” said Dr. Alfieri, adding that the pope was now “not in danger.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
