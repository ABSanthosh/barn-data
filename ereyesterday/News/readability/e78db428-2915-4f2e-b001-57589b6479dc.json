  "text": "DHAKA: The US has strongly taken up human rights issues with the Bangladesh interim govt, amid its tensions with India over attacks on Hindus and other minorities, which Dhaka has constantly played down by dubbing them as \"media exaggeration\".During their talks over phone on Monday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus expressed their commitment to respect and protect the human rights of all. Issues related to minorities came up broadly, a diplomatic source said.While the details of the conversation were not known, the divergence in the accounts of what had transpired engaged the attention of many. The White House in its statement stressed that that \"both leaders expressed their commitment to respecting and protecting the human rights of all people, regardless of religion\". In contrast, the one issued by Bangladesh did not mention anything about discussions on human rights issues. As per Dhaka's telling the two sides discussed issues of \"mutual interest\".Sullivan reiterated the US' backing for a prosperous, stable, and democratic Bangladesh, and offered continued support in meeting the challenges it faces. The chief adviser's press wing said Sullivan praised Yunus's leadership.",
