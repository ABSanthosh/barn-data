The colorful protest was overseen by a large police presence, including officers in riot gear and a water cannon truck.The government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan declared 2025 the Year of the Family. Protesters pushed back against the idea of women’s role being confined to marriage and motherhood, carrying banners reading “Family will not bind us to life” and “We will not be sacrificed to the family”.Critics have accused the government of overseeing restrictions on women’s rights and not doing enough to tackle violence against women.The Turkish president in 2021 withdrew his country from a European treaty, dubbed the Istanbul Convention, that protects women from domestic violence. Turkey’s “We Will Stop Femicides” platform says 394 women were killed by men in 2024.“There is bullying at work, pressure from husbands and fathers at home and pressure from patriarchal society. We demand that this pressure be reduced even further,” Yaz Gulgun, 52, said.International Women’s Day march in Warsaw, Poland, on Saturday. Photograph: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockIn many other European countries, women also protested against violence, for better access to gender-specific healthcare and for equal pay, among other issues.In Poland, activists opened a center across from the parliament building in Warsaw where women can go to have abortions with pills, either alone or with other women.Opening the center on International Women’s Day across from the legislature was a symbolic challenge to authorities in the traditionally Roman Catholic nation, which has one of Europe’s most restrictive abortion laws.From Athens to Madrid, Paris, Munich, Zurich and Belgrade, and in many more cities across the European continent, women marched to demand an end to treatment as second-class citizens in society, politics, family and work.In Madrid, protesters held up large hand-drawn pictures depicting Gisèle Pelicot, the woman who was drugged by her now ex-husband in France over the course of a decade so that she could be raped by dozens of men while unconscious. Pelicot has become a symbol for women all over Europe in the fight against sexual violence.In the Nigerian capital of Lagos, thousands of women gathered at the Mobolaji Johnson stadium, dancing and signing and celebrating their womanhood. Many were dressed in purple, the traditional color of the women’s liberation movement.Women sing and dance during an International Women's Day celebration in Lagos, Nigeria, on 7 March 2025.

Photograph: Zaydee Sanchez/ReutersThe marches, organized by the Women’s March feminist network, come seven weeks into Trump’s second term. Since returning to office, Trump has signed a string of executive actions that advocates say disproportionately affect women.Some of these orders are geared toward cracking down on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in the federal government, signed just hours after his inauguration. The next day, Trump rescinded a decades-old executive order that had barred government contractors from discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin.At least 300 protests were planned for Saturday across the country, according to the Women’s March website.RefuseFascism.org, an organization in Oakland, California, working with Women’s March, invited members of its community to join the march on Saturday, outlining some of the actions they’re fighting against in a statement: “It is Trump blaming plane crashes on DEI. It is JD Vance denigrating women who don’t have children. And these towering misogynists have the audacity to claim their attacks on trans people are in the name of ‘protecting women’.”Coral Murphy Marcos contributed reporting",
