  "text": "In This Article: Amazon (AMZN) is denying reports that it will display the impact of tariffs next to the price of products on its e-commerce site, which drew the ire of the Trump administration on Tuesday. \"The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products,\" Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said in a statement. \"This was never approved and is not going to happen.” According to CNN White House reporter Alayna Treene, President Trump personally called Jeff Bezos to complain about the original tariff report from Punchbowl News, which stated that Amazon would show tariff-related price increases on goods. Trump commented on the matter during a press briefing Tuesday afternoon, saying, \"Jeff Bezos is very nice. Terrific. He solved the problem very quickly. He did the right thing. Good guy.\" Before Amazon released its statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the move \"a hostile and political act.\" Amazon stock recovered from steeper losses during the session and closed down around 0.2%. NasdaqGS - Delayed Quote USD (AMZN) At close: April 29 at 4:00:01 PM EDT On Monday, Reuters reported that some Amazon merchants were planning to pare back their participation in the company's Prime Day event this summer due to tariff uncertainty. \"Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?\" Leavitt said following the Punchbowl News report. \"And I would also add that it's not a surprise because, as Reuters recently wrote, Amazon has partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm.\" It's unclear which report Leavitt was referring to, but a 2021 report from Reuters said Amazon partnered with China's propaganda arm to sell some publications on its US site.

[We] have some conversations about tariffs as well. And we share what some of the concerns are and they're aware of them.\"",
