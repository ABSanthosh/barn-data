  "text": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry (Picture credit: AP)Meghan Markle's team allegedly proposed a \"post-Harry divorce book\" to a publisher, according to a recent Vanity Fair article. The exposé delves into the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's business ventures after stepping back from royal duties.Several former colleagues and associates provided insights for the article, including one source who claimed that “Meghan’s team had a conversation with a publishing house to gauge interest” in a potential book focusing on “a post-Harry divorce.” The source did not disclose when Markle’s team allegedly made the suggestion or identify the publishing house involved. Vanity Fair clarified that “no written or formal proposal” for such a book was ever made, while another insider denied that the conversation ever took place.The article also includes accounts from former colleagues who criticized Markle's behavior, with some revealing they sought therapy after working with her. One source described her as a \"'Mean Girls' teenager,\" adding that the experience was \"really, really, really awful\" and \"very painful.\"The source further alleged that Markle engaged in subtle bullying tactics, such as talking behind people's backs and undermining their self-worth. \"She's constantly playing checkers—I’m not even going to say chess—but she’s just very aware of where everybody is on her board,\" the source stated. \"And when you are not in, you are to be thrown to the wolves at any given moment.\"Multiple sources corroborated that an employee who worked on Markle’s Archetypes Spotify podcast took a leave of absence after just three episodes and eventually quit. Another insider suggested that Markle could improve her public image by admitting her shortcomings instead of portraying herself as a victim.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry signed a reported $20 million Spotify deal in 2020 to produce a podcast. However, insiders claim the couple struggled to develop marketable concepts. \"They wanted a big theme that would explain the world, but they had no ideas,\" one source alleged. Another added, \"I have no idea what [Harry's] interests are beyond polo. No clue what his inner life is like.\"Reportedly, Harry suggested interviewing controversial figures like Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump for a podcast about \"sociopaths,\" while his team pitched a show where he would \"'fix' something every week, ranging from a flat tire to global warming.\" Both ideas were rejected.Rumors also circulated that Beyoncé and Taylor Swift declined invitations to appear on the Sussexes' podcast.Meanwhile, Montecito residents expressed frustration over Markle's upcoming lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard, calling it \"hucksterism\" and an attempt to \"monetize something.\"One resident remarked, \"I still think they’re the most entitled, disingenuous people on the planet. They moved away from England to get away from the scrutiny of the press, and all they do is try and get in the press in the United States.\"",
