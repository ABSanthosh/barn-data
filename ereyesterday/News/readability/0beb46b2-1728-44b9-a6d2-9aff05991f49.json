  "text": "Diddy's lawyers said it's outrageous that Diddy's cell was raided and then the materials seized from there were used by the prosecutors in court filing.The prosecutors in the Sean Diddy case recently said that the music mogul is orchestrating social media campaigns from jail and calling witnesses from other inmates' telephone accounts -- breaking jail rules. Lawyers for Sean Diddy Combs Monday accused the prosecutors of engaging in \"outrageous government conduct\" of raiding Diddy's jail cell and seizing materials and then mentioning those in court papers.The lawyers said the information gathered from Combs' cell at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn were cited in papers the government filed in Manhattan federal court Friday in a bid to keep Diddy locked up until his trial begins in May. “This is a matter of grave concern that, most respectfully, must be addressed immediately,” the lawyers told Judge Arun Subramanian, who already has scheduled a bail hearing for Friday for Combs. They requested an “immediate hearing” so prosecutors can explain who authorized the search of Combs' cell, where personal effects and paperwork were seized.Sean Diddy has been arrested on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation for engagement in sex -- all charges that Diddy refused and did not plead guilty. Meanwhile, more complaints were filed against Diddy with accusers claiming that they were raped by Diddy when they were underage. In a shocking revelation, the prosecutors recently said that Diddy was speaking to people from jail using other inmates' telephone accounts. The prosecutors said a review of the recorded calls divulged that Diddy asked his family to contact potential witnesses in the case. He was also trying to orchestrate social media campaigns aimed at maligning the jury pool and trying to publicly leak materials that would be helpful for him. He involved third parties to contact the witnesses, the prosecutors said.Diddy's lawyers said prosecutors in their bail arguments last week acknowledged that they possess \"possibly privileged materials, such as the notes recovered from the defendant's cell\".",
