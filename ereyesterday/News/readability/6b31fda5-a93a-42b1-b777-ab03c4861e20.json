  "text": "Kayla Epstein and Brajesh UpadhyayBBC NewsThe Trump administration emailed thousands of federal employees on Wednesday, ordering them to report any efforts to \"disguise\" diversity initiatives in their agencies or face \"adverse consequences\".The request came after President Donald Trump banned diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices and programmes throughout the government.Emails seen by the BBC directed workers to \"report all facts and circumstances\" to a new government email address within 10 days.Some employees interpreted it as a demand to sell out their colleagues to the White House.\"We're really freaked out and overwhelmed,\" said one employee at the Department Health and Human Services (HHS).The Office of Personnel Management, which manages the federal workforce, issued guidance requiring agency heads to send a notice to their staff by 17:00 eastern time on Wednesday. It included an email template that many federal staffers ultimately received that night.Some employees, like those at the Treasury Department, got slightly different versions of the email.The Treasury Department email excluded the warning about \"adverse consequences\" for not reporting DEI initiatives, according to a copy shared with the BBC.In one of his first actions as president, Trump signed two executive orders ending \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" or \"DEI\" programmes within the federal government and announced any employees working in those roles would immediately be placed on paid administrative leave.Such programmes are designed to increase minority participation in the workforce and educate employees about discrimination.But critics of DEI, like Trump, argue that the practice itself is discriminatory because it takes race, gender, sexual identity or other characteristics into consideration.Trump and his allies attacked the practice frequently during the campaign.In a speech Thursday at the World Economic Conference in Davos, Switzerland, Trump declared he was making America a \"merit-based country\".Critics of DEI have praised Trump's decision.\"President Trump's executive orders rescinding affirmative action and banning DEI programs are a major milestone in American civil rights progress and a critical step towards building a colour-blind society,\" Yukong Mike Zhao, president of the Asian American Coalition for Education, said in a statement.The group had supported a successful effort at the US Supreme Court to overturn affirmative action programmes at US universities.But current federal employees, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation, said that the email they received felt more like an attempt to intimidate staff than to make the government more fair.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.President Trump has signed a torrent of executive orders since he took office, including a hiring freeze in the federal government, an order for workers to return to the office and an attempt to reclassify thousands of government employees in order to make them easier to fire. The HHS employee who spoke to the BBC criticised the government's DEI practices, believing that while it was important to build a diverse staff and create opportunities in health and medical fields, \"identity politics have played into how we function normally and that's not beneficial to the workforce\".\"But that doesn't mean I want my colleagues to get fired,\" the employee added.He described the impact the email and the DEI orders had on his agency as \"very calculated chaos\".The employee's division had been thrown into confusion, he said, with questions about hiring practices going forward, as well as what programmes and directives were allowed to continue, given Trump's broad definition of DEI.A second HHS employee said that hiring and research grants had been frozen and the entire department staff was waiting to see what they could do next.The HHS, and one of its subsidiary agencies, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), issue millions of dollars in federal grants to universities and researchers across the globe to advance scientific research.Agency employees feared that the DEI order could have an impact outside the government as well. One questioned if grants that allowed laboratories to create more opportunities for hiring minority scientists and medical professionals would now get the axe.An employee who worked at the Food and Drug Administration told the BBC that she had not received the email, but all DEI-related activities had been paused.\"We have been told by seniors to keep doing our jobs,\" she said. \"But there is a sense of fear about how it's going to have an impact on our work in general.\"",
