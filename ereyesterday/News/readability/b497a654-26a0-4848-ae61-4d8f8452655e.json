The officers received “burns, scalds and stab wounds” during the attack, the association said.A statement from the organization said that Mr. Abedi “threw hot cooking oil over them then produced homemade weapons and proceeded to stab the officers.”A spokesperson for the country’s prison service said that, as of 4 p.m. on Saturday, one officer, a woman, had been treated for her injuries at a hospital and then had been discharged. Two male officers remained in the hospital.In 2020, Mr. Abedi was handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 55 years for his part in the 2017 attack in Manchester. The Islamic State terrorist group claimed responsibility for the bombing, which was the deadliest terror attack in Britain since a series of bombings that struck public transport across London in 2005.Mr. Abedi was convicted of murdering the 22 victims who died in the blast after prosecutors said he was “just as responsible” as his brother, Salman Abedi, who died in the attack. British law did not permit a judge to give Mr. Abedi a life sentence without parole, because he was under the age of 21 at the time of the attack.In a statement about Saturday’s attack, the prison service said: “Police are now investigating, so it would be inappropriate to comment further. Violence in prison will not be tolerated, and we will always push for the strongest punishment for attacks on our hardworking staff.”The attack is being investigated by the Durham Constabulary, which said its inquiries were ongoing.ImagePolice officers on guard in 2017, a few days after 22 people were killed and dozens more injured in a bombing at Britain’s Manchester Arena during an Ariana Grande concert.Credit...Andrew Testa for The New York TimesA version of this article appears in print on  , Section A, Page 8 of the New York edition with the headline: Bomber’s Brother Accused in Jail Attack.
