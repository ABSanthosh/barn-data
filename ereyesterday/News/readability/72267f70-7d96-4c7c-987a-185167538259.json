(KREX) – Black Canyon of the Gunnison has seen several structures, overlooks and a campground have been destroyed or heavily damaged from the South Rim Fire, according to the National Parks Service.NPS said the facility management building, the Western National Parks warehouse, the welding shop, several pieces of heavy equipment, the South Rim Campground, and numerous bathrooms and overlooks were affected by the wildfire. However, the park service noted the South Rim Visitor Center, the administration building and the entrance booth survived the blaze.Although the park’s total estimated loss is unknown, NPS announced all reservations for the South Rim Campground and Wilderness Permits are cancelled, with no re-opening date.When the fire is fully contained, damage and safety assessments will begin, according to NPS.The park service said high temperatures, low humidity, gusty winds and dry vegetation have caused the fire to spread faster at Black Canyon. Over 4,200 acres have burned so far, with 14% of it contained as of Friday morning.Blue Mesa Reservoir remains closed west of the middle bridge, while Lake Fork Boat Ramp is not open to launching boats.
