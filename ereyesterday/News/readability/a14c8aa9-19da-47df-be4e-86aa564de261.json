  "text": "Hamas on Saturday said it had responded to a U.S. ceasefire proposal, saying in a brief statement that the group sought a permanent ceasefire, “a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip” and guarantees around the provision of aid to the enclave.Hamas’s statement also alludes to a prisoner exchange: 10 living Israeli hostages as well as 18 bodies to be swapped for an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners. Further details around Hamas’s counterproposal were not immediately available.The initial proposal that prompted the response from Hamas was sent to the group by Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump’s special envoy, on Thursday. That proposal, which was agreed to by Israel, included a similar prisoner swap offering, in exchange for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza.In a statement Saturday, Witkoff called Hamas’s response “totally unacceptable,” saying it “only takes us backward.”“Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,” Witkoff added, saying that the proximity talks would be the venue to negotiate over a lasting ceasefire.Israeli officials echoed Witkoff’s line, with the Prime Minister’s office releasing a statement blasting Hamas for its “intransigence,” and saying Israel would continue working toward returning its hostages and defeating Hamas.Trump said Friday that Israel and Hamas were “very close” to a ceasefire agreement and promised imminent updates. However, a Hamas official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive ongoing negotiations, told The Washington Post that same day that the group intended to offer “amendments” to the initial Israel and U.S. proposal to secure guarantees around ending the war.Hamas has long sought a permanent end to the war in Gaza, as well as a full Israeli withdrawal from the enclave — terms that have largely been unpalatable to the Israeli side, which has sought to keep its options open. On Saturday, Israel dealt another blow to the beleaguered militant group, with the Israel Defense Forces announcing that they had killed Mohammed Sinwar in a strike earlier in the month. Sinwar, the brother of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, was believed by Israel to be the latest chief commander of Hamas’s military wing.Also on Saturday, COGAT, the Israeli Defense Ministry unit that coordinates aid in Gaza, announced that 579 trucks carrying humanitarian aid such as food, medical equipment and flour, had crossed into Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing. After the previous ceasefire was broken by Israel in March, Israel imposed major restrictions on the provision of food and aid to the enclave, prompting rare rebukes and criticism from the country’s major Western allies. In response to mounting pressure, Israel began letting in small amounts of aid in late May.Susannah George, Alon Rom and Hazem Balousha contributed to this report",
