The police sat on the sidelines.Crowds gathered at the Budapest Pride Parade on Saturday.Credit...Attila Kisbenedek/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesJune 28, 2025Updated 2:01 p.m. ETA government ban on Hungary’s annual Pride parade backfired on Saturday when more than 100,000 people marched through the Hungarian capital, far more than have taken part in previous such events.Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Friday warned people to stay away from the banned parade, threatening “clear legal consequences” for anyone taking part. Government warnings, however, only turned what is usually a low-key event attended by a few thousand L.G.B.T.Q. activists and their friends into a mass rally against Mr. Orban’s government.“What is most painful for me is to see how stupid they think we all are,” said Edit Rocza, 46, a special-education teacher who traveled from southern Hungary to take part in the march for the first time. She said she was outraged by Mr. Orban’s claims that the event had been banned to protect children from “homosexual propaganda.”That, she added, was “just a distraction from all the stealing and other real problems we have in this country.”In March, Mr. Orban’s party rushed legislation through Parliament that amended the right of assembly to make it illegal to hold gatherings like Pride parades, under an earlier law banning material that “propagates” homosexuality. Participants in such gatherings faced fines of nearly $600 apiece, while organizers risked imprisonment of up to a year.The ban came as Mr. Orban and his party, Fidesz, were getting increasingly nervous about the rising popularity of Peter Magyar, a conservative opposition leader. Fidesz officials and party-controlled media outlets demanded that Mr. Magyar take a stand on Budapest Pride, setting what many saw as a political trap designed to out him as a closet liberal soft on child protection.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
