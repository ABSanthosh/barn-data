  "text": "US President Donald Trump issued executive orders on Friday aiming to increase nuclear power production fourfold within 25 years, though experts consider this target unrealistic.The orders transfer certain authority from the longstanding nuclear safety regulator to the energy secretary, enabling faster approval of advanced reactor designs and projects.This initiative comes as electricity consumption rises, driven by expanding data centres and AI development. The power grid faces increasing pressure from tech companies, venture capitalists and states competing for available electricity.“We’ve got enough electricity to win the AI arms race with China,” interior secretary Doug Burgum said. “What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50\" years in the industry.Achieving a fourfold increase in nuclear production appears improbable within the specified timeframe. The US currently lacks operational next-generation reactors, with only two new large reactors constructed in nearly 50 years. These Georgia-based reactors faced significant delays and cost overruns exceeding $17 billion.Currently, 94 nuclear reactors provide approximately 19% of US electricity, whilst fossil fuels contribute 60% and renewables 21%, according to the US energy information administration.Trump displayed enthusiasm during the Oval Office signing, surrounded by industry executives, describing nuclear as a \"hot industry\", adding, \"It’s time for nuclear, and we’re going to do it very big.”Burgum, who leads Trump's Energy Dominance Council, highlighted industry stagnation due to excessive regulation, stating: \"Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry.\"The orders aim to restructure the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, implementing faster review processes and establishing an 18-month deadline for application decisions. They include plans for three experimental reactors by July 4, 2026, and invoke emergency measures to secure uranium supplies.Additional provisions include assessing closed plant reopenings and exploring reactor placement on federal and military sites.",
