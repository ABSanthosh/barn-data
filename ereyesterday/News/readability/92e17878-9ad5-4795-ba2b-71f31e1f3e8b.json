His remark came days after Mr. Trump questioned his legitimacy and called him a “dictator without elections,” echoing a Kremlin talking point.It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Zelensky is seriously considering the option of stepping down or was merely responding to the latest jabs from Washington and Moscow. He added that he would trade his departure for Ukraine’s entry into NATO — perhaps a tongue-in-cheek offer, since both Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia solidly oppose Ukraine’s joining the military alliance.“If peace for Ukraine requires me to step down, I’m ready,” Mr. Zelensky said on the eve of the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion. “Another scenario: I could trade my position for NATO membership, if that’s what it takes,” he added.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
