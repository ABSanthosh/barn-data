  "text": "The United States defence department announced on Thursday the establishment of a second military zone along the Mexican border for immigration law enforcement.The new zone, situated in Texas and connected to El Paso's Fort Bliss Army base, follows the pattern of the first zone created in New Mexico last month. Military personnel in these areas are authorised to detain migrants crossing illegally until U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials take charge.Gen. Gregory Guillot, US Northern Command commander, stated: \"The establishment of a second National Defense Area increases our operational reach and effectiveness in denying illegal activity along the southern border.\"On Monday, individuals who entered the U.S. illegally faced charges for breaching a national defence area in New Mexico, where the Army oversees a 170-mile (274-kilometre) stretch considered an extension of U.S. Army Garrison Fort Huachuca, Arizona.Military officials were unavailable Thursday night to specify the dimensions of the new Texas zone, which was not detailed in their press release.Those crossing the border in these military zones could face prosecution for two federal offences: illegal U.S. entry and military property trespassing. This development coincides with the Trump administration's deployment of thousands of troops to the border, while arrests have decreased to levels not seen since the mid-1960s.These military zones enable the federal government to operate outside the constraints of an 1878 law restricting military involvement in civilian law enforcement.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, during a recent New Mexico visit, explained: \"Any illegal attempting to enter that zone is entering a military base, a federally protected area. You will be interdicted by U.S. troops and Border Patrol.\"",
