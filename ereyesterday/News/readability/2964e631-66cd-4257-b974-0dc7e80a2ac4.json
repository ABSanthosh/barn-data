  "text": "In a dramatic escalation of its immigration enforcement agenda, the Trump administration has rolled out a new policy enabling the US government to revoke the visas of foreign nationals—students, workers, and visitors alike—for even minor legal infractions.The “Catch and Revoke” directive, unveiled by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the April 30 edition of the State Department newsletter, introduces a strict one-strike rule. “Whenever the government catches non-US citizens breaking our laws, we will take action to revoke their status,” Rubio stated, calling a visa “a privilege, not a right.”While the policy outlines priority revocations for crimes like domestic violence and assault, its broad and ambiguous language has drawn backlash. “They stripped student visas from people for speeding tickets,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council. “Now they're suggesting they'll do the same to everyone.”The policy also singles out foreign students allegedly supporting Hamas or joining pro-Palestinian campus protests. Rubio blamed the Biden administration for failing to protect Jewish students during recent unrest on campuses. “They allowed campus buildings to be overrun by violent thugs,” he wrote.Citing the Immigration and Nationality Act, Rubio said student visa holders found to support or endorse terrorist groups would be deemed inadmissible. The policy builds on intelligence-sharing with law enforcement to identify and cancel such visas immediately.Rubio also tied the new rule to broader reforms under Trump’s second term. In his 100-day statement, he claimed the State Department had transformed into “a leaner machine” by dismantling offices like the Global Engagement Center, cutting funding to NGOs, and streamlining operations to eliminate bureaucracy.Additional executive actions include requiring US universities to disclose all foreign funding sources or risk losing federal support, measures aimed squarely at international students and institutions seen as sympathetic to America’s adversaries.Rubio defended the changes as a necessity for national security. “The time of contemptuously taking advantage of our nation’s generosity ends,” he wrote.The new policy coincides with Trump’s broader America First strategy abroad, including diplomatic efforts to expel China from managing the Panama Canal, pressuring NATO allies to increase defense spending, and reclassifying the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization.Legal resistance is already underway. Several visa revocations have been reversed in court, and more challenges are expected. Civil liberties groups argue the policy could violate due process and chill free speech.Secretary Rubio was sworn in on January 21, 2025. “With an impending reorganization that will unleash the Department’s talent from the ground-up,” he concluded, “the State Department is set to continue to play a pivotal role in ensuring the safety, security and prosperity of the American people.”",
