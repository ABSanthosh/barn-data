An escalation could undermine efforts to reach a cease-fire, as Iran’s leader signaled he supported ending the war with Israel.Residents searched for their belongings in the rubble of a destroyed apartment building after an Israeli airstrike in central Beirut, Lebanon, on Friday.Credit...Daniel Berehulak/The New York TimesNov. 15, 2024Updated 3:25 p.m. ETThe Israeli military kept up its heavy bombing of a once densely populated area adjoining Beirut on Friday after saying its ground troops were battling new targets in southern Lebanon, signaling a widening of the fighting that could further undercut cease-fire efforts.The airstrikes on the Dahiya area south of Beirut, where the militant group Hezbollah holds sway, were the latest in a string of bombings this week. The Israeli military issued new evacuation warnings just after dawn on Friday, and missiles began landing soon afterward, leveling at least one high-rise residential building that had been identified in the warnings and sending a thick dust cloud through the surrounding streets.There were no immediate reports of casualties. Most residents fled the Dahiya weeks ago, when Israel’s bombing campaign began.There were also signs that Israel’s ground invasion was broadening and that its troops were battling Hezbollah fighters deeper inside Lebanese territory.The Israeli military said on Thursday that its commandos were conducting ground operations against “several new enemy targets” in Lebanon. A senior Lebanese security official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters, said Israeli ground forces were operating around the town of Chamaa, roughly three miles from the border.Hezbollah also said overnight that it had attacked Israeli soldiers near Tayr Harfa, a town south of Chamaa that it described as part of its “secondary line” of defense and where clashes had not been previously reported. On Friday, the group said it had fired rockets at Israeli troops on the outskirts of Talloussah, another town where fighting had not been previously reported.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
