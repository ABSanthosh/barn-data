  "text": "JERUSALEM — As Israeli forces carried out more strikes in a renewed Gaza offensive, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pressed forward on the home front to oust two senior officials in a development that roiled Israeli politics.In a late-night Thursday cabinet session, Netanyahu’s ministers voted unanimously to dismiss Ronen Bar, the director of the Shin Bet intelligence service who Netanyahu said no longer had his trust. Hours later, on Friday morning, the government scheduled another discussion for Sunday over firing Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, who had advised Netanyahu not to fire the spy chief.Netanyahu’s moves to dismiss two of the most prominent and powerful dissenting voices in his government were criticized as unconstitutional by opposition leaders and sparked calls for further protests after large, occasionally chaotic demonstrations already took place this week in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.Almost immediately, opposition parties petitioned the supreme court for an injunction on Bar’s dismissal pending a judicial review, and it was granted by the court. The Business Forum, a group of 200 leading Israeli business leaders, threatened to “bring the Israeli economy to a halt” if the government did not obey the court order to temporarily freeze Bar’s removal.Netanyahu was unmoved as the outcry mounted Friday. “There will be no civil war!” he said in a post on X. “The State of Israel is a country governed by law, and according to the law, the Government of Israel decides who will be the head of the Shin Bet.”If the court ultimately sides with the government, Bar will leave his post sometime before April 10. But a ruling against the government might pit the supreme court in a direct battle with Netanyahu.“What’s taking shape is a more ominous clash between the government and the court, with mixed signals about whether the prime minister will — or will not — comply with its ruling,” said Shalom Lipner, a former Netanyahu aide who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council. “After many long months of stage-setting, a constitutional crisis could be fast upon Israel.”Tensions have been building for months between Netanyahu and his internal security chief, with the two men and their supporters openly blaming each other for the policy and intelligence failures that allowed Hamas to carry out a devastating attack against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Bar has also been seen as one of the leading voices calling on Netanyahu to prioritize striking a deal with Hamas to recover all Israeli hostages, while Netanyahu and some of his allies, particularly on the political right and the far right, have stressed that the Gaza war must continue until Hamas is wholly eliminated.Last month, Netanyahu removed Bar from the negotiating team with Hamas, and the prime minister has accused Bar of disobedience and leaking information about the hostage talks — allegations the Shin Bet director has denied.Further fueling the feud, the Shin Bet, which is responsible for counterintelligence and protecting the integrity of Israeli democracy, opened a probe in February into allegations that three Netanyahu aides were on Qatar’s payroll and maintained improper ties with a gulf nation that is not seen as a friendly state. Baharav-Miara, who authorized the Qatar investigation, has warned Netanyahu against firing Bar, saying it would be a conflict of interest and would jeopardize the independence of the Shin Bet.In an X post that was widely discussed in Israel this week, Netanyahu criticized the Shin Bet investigation as a conspiracy and likened himself to President Donald Trump. “In America and Israel, when a strong right-wing leader wins, the leftist Deep State weaponizes the justice system to thwart the people’s will,” Netanyahu wrote in an X post that was shared by Elon Musk. “They won’t win in either place!”At the cabinet meeting late Thursday, Netanyahu accused Bar of disloyalty and leaking information about the hostage negotiations, according to Israeli media reports. Bar, in response, issued a letter to the cabinet saying it was the Shin Bet’s duty to work “for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and not for the benefit of personal interests,” and he criticized Netanyahu for blocking a probe into “serious incidents.”“The urgent national need for such an investigation cannot be subordinated to the personal considerations of those involved in the matter,” Bar said in the letter, which was reviewed by The Washington Post.Bar’s removal is likely to represent a boost for hawkish voices within Netanyahu’s government who have been calling for Israel to return to more intense fighting against Hamas. After Netanyahu announced his intention to fire Bar and resumed hostilities in Gaza this week, he brought Jewish Power party leader Itamar Ben Gvir back into his cabinet. In recent weeks, another far-right minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has urged Israel to cut off electricity and water to Gaza, return to fighting in the Strip, and gradually annex land if Hamas harms any hostages.Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz appeared to echo Smotrich on Friday by warning that if Hamas did not release all hostages, the Israeli military will seize additional territory in Gaza.“The more Hamas persists in its refusal, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed to Israel,” Katz said in a statement. He added that Israel will use “all measures to apply military and civilian pressure — including the evacuation of the Gazan population southward and the implementation of U.S. President Donald Trump’s voluntary relocation plan for Gaza residents.”In Gaza on Friday, Israeli forces destroyed the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, according to footage posted on social media and the Israeli military. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed it struck “terrorists in a Hamas terrorist infrastructure site that previously had served as a hospital” and said the location has not been used as an active hospital for more than a year.Last year, a Washington Post examination of satellite footage found that the IDF appeared to be using the hospital near the strategic Netzarim Corridor as a base of operations. The hospital previously served as an important cancer treatment center in Gaza before it was forced to close in the early days of the war because of nearby airstrikes and lack of fuel.In a statement, the Turkish foreign ministry condemned Israel’s destruction of the hospital, which was built by Turkey and run by local authorities, and called on the international community to “take concrete and deterrent measures against Israel’s unlawful attacks.”Lior Soroka in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.",
