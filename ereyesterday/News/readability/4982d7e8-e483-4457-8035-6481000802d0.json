  "text": "A federal judge rejected an emergency request on Tuesday to stop billionaire Elon Musk and his department of government efficiency (DOGE) from firing federal employees and accessing agency data.This move bolstered US President Donald Trump’s plan to cut government spending, as he called for large-scale reductions across several departments and agencies. Thousands have already lost their jobs, while many more await dismissal.Fourteen Democrat-led states sued last week, challenging Musk’s authority. But on Tuesday, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled they had not proven immediate or irreversible harm, saying this was not enough to justify blocking his actions. \"Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of showing that they will suffer imminent, irreparable harm absent a temporary restraining order,\" Chutkan said.Chutkan is an appointee of former US President Barack Obama. She previously oversaw the now-abandoned criminal case against Trump for allegedly conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.Legal battle over DOGE’s powersDOGE is an independent agency led by Musk and aims to reduce government spending by cutting jobs and eliminating agencies. While Trump has maintained that agency heads are making the layoffs, critics argue that Musk wields too much power over federal operations.The 14 states claimed in their lawsuit that Musk had not been officially nominated or confirmed for a government position, yet was making key decisions on government contracts, expenditures, and staffing. They also raised concerns about DOGE gaining access to sensitive data from departments including education, labour, health and human services, energy, and transportation.Despite these concerns, Chutkan dismissed the request for a temporary restraining order. She said that uncertainty over DOGE’s actions was not enough to justify immediate court intervention. “The court is aware that DOGE’s unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion for Plaintiffs and many of their agencies and residents. But the ‘possibility’ that Defendants may take actions that irreparably harm Plaintiffs ‘is not enough,’” she ruled.Mass layoffs and buyout schemeMusk’s cost-cutting measures have already led to major disruptions, with thousands of federal employees sent home as agencies face closures. A separate legal challenge sought to block a mass buyout scheme that offered federal employees eight months’ pay if they voluntarily resigned. In an email titled \"Fork in the Road,\" more than two million government workers were warned they could either accept the buyout or risk being fired in future layoffs.The White House said over 75,000 employees have already taken the offer, but unions representing government workers have fought to block the initiative. Last week, another federal judge lifted a temporary freeze on the buyout plan, allowing it to continue.Trump’s sweeping government overhaul has faced multiple court battles, with the White House accusing “judges in liberal districts” of attempting to block the administration’s reforms. However, rulings on these cases have come from judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents, including Trump himself.",
