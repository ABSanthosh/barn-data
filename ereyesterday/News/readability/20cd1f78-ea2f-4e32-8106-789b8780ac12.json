  "text": "Traveling with Secretary of State Blinken Here are the latest developments.Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said Thursday that he expected negotiators to meet “in the coming days” to discuss a cease-fire in Gaza, but that it remained unclear whether Hamas was willing to re-engage in the long-stalled talks after Israel killed its leader.There were signs the talks could begin as early as Sunday, when Israel said it would send David Barnea, the head of its Mossad spy agency, to meet with C.I.A. chief Bill Burns and the prime minister of Qatar.Mr. Blinken spoke from Qatar, where he was meeting with senior officials from the Persian Gulf state, which has acted as an intermediary between Israel and Hamas. Qatar’s prime minister and foreign minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said at a news conference alongside Mr. Blinken that Hamas’s political representatives in Doha have not so far signaled a softer position since the death of the group’s leader, Yahya Sinwar, last week.“We haven’t yet really determined whether Hamas is prepared to engage,” Mr. Blinken said. “The fundamental question is, is Hamas serious?”The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a group representing the families of captives in Gaza, said in a statement on Thursday that it welcomed the resumption of talks. “We must leverage the last military achievements, particularly the elimination of Sinwar, to secure a single comprehensive deal for all hostages’ return,” the group said.Mr. Blinken said the United States was “looking at whether there are different options we can pursue” for a cease-fire beyond a longstanding, U.S.-backed proposal for a weekslong truce. U.S. officials said Wednesday that they were open to the possibility of a shorter cease-fire — lasting roughly a week and a half — in exchange for the release of a small number of the dozens of hostages remaining in Gaza.U.S. officials would welcome even a short pause in the fighting to allow a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza, where the situation is growing increasingly dire in the northern part of the territory amid a renewed Israeli military offensive. On Wednesday night, Palestinian Civil Defense, a local emergency service, said it had been forced to halt rescue operations in the area, calling the situation there “catastrophic.”Here’s what else to know:Israeli soldier deaths: The Israeli military on Thursday announced the deaths of four reservists who were killed in combat in southern Lebanon on Wednesday. All four were members of a reserve infantry brigade involved in Israel’s nearly monthlong invasion of Lebanon.Lebanon: Lebanon’s military said that an Israeli attack had killed three more of its soldiers in the southern part of the country, after a new wave of airstrikes hit residential areas near Beirut overnight. The attacks came as international officials gathered for a conference about the crisis in Paris, where Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, repeated his call for a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah.Gaza aid: Mr. Blinken announced that the United States would provide an additional $135 million in humanitarian assistance “for Palestinians in Gaza, in the West Bank as well as in the region.” He added that as part of his trip to the Middle East, he had been discussing “concrete ideas” for the reconstruction of Gaza after the war.Central Gaza: The Israeli military said it had struck a Hamas command center inside a compound formerly used as a school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza. Video taken after the strike and obtained by the Reuters news agency showed injured people, including children, at the compound, which has been housing displaced Palestinians.Hospital claim: Lloyd J. Austin III, the U.S. secretary of defense, said that Washington had “not seen evidence” of Israeli claims that Hezbollah had set up a bunker complex under a hospital south of Beirut. The Israeli military has asserted that Hezbollah had stashed hundreds of millions of dollars in an underground command center beneath al-Sahel hospital. Fadi Alameh, the hospital’s director, called the claims baseless.Syria strikes: Syria’s state news agency reported that one soldier was killed and seven people were wounded in Israeli strikes on the capital, Damascus, and in Homs, about 100 miles to the north. There was no immediate comment from Israel’s military, which has been targeting Iran’s network of proxies in the region. That network includes the Syrian government, which Israel has long accused of helping funnel arms to Hezbollah through its shared border with Lebanon.Israeli authorities say the U.N. agency for Palestinians employed a Hamas commander they killed.ImageA roadside bomb shelter opposite the entrance to Kibbutz Re’im, in southern Israel, where a group of Hamas assailants attacked on Oct. 7, 2023.Credit...Amit Elkayam for The New York TimesThe Israeli authorities said on Thursday that they had killed a Hamas commander who was involved in the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, on southern Israel and who also worked for the main United Nations agency for Palestinians.The authorities said that the commander, Mohammad Abu Itiwi, was killed in an airstrike Wednesday in the Gaza Strip. Last October, the authorities said, he led an attack on a bomb shelter near Kibbutz Re’im, in southern Israel, where some people fleeing the Nova music festival had sought refuge. Over the last year, they said, he had also directed several attacks on Israeli soldiers in Gaza.The attack on the bomb shelter led to the capture of four hostages and the murder of “many others,” Israel’s chief military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said in a video statement on Thursday.Mr. Abu Itiwi had worked for the U.N. agency, known as UNRWA, since 2022, the authorities said. Admiral Hagari reiterated Israel’s request for an investigation into the involvement of UNRWA employees in the Oct. 7 attacks.A spokeswoman for UNRWA did not immediately comment on the allegations, saying that she was investigating. This is not the first time that the Israeli authorities have accused UNRWA staff members of participating in the Hamas-led attack that ignited the war in Gaza — and their latest accusation will likely inflame tensions between the agency and Israel.In January, Israel accused a dozen UNRWA workers of participating in the Oct. 7 attack or its aftermath, imperiling the organization’s funding. Donors, including the United States, suspended financial support.The United Nations said it fired 10 of the 12 employees Israel had accused, and two are dead. In the following months, seven more UNRWA staff members were accused of participating in the Hamas-led attacks. Of the 19 total claims, there was evidence in nine instances indicating that UNRWA staffers may have been involved, the U.N. concluded in August.An internal U.N. investigation found that Israel had not provided evidence to back up a separate accusation that many UNRWA staff members had ties to Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups.The U.N. agency has accused Israel of waging a violent campaign against it.In May, Philippe Lazzarini, the agency’s commissioner general, wrote in an opinion article in The New York Times that UNRWA staff members had been killed, harassed and hindered in their efforts to provide assistance throughout the war. Mr. Lazzarini added that Israeli officials were “not only threatening the work of our staff and mission, they are also delegitimizing UNRWA by effectively characterizing it as a terrorist organization that fosters extremism and labeling U.N. leaders as terrorists who collude with Hamas.”On Thursday, before Israeli authorities made their announcement, Mr. Lazzarini wrote on social media that the United Nations had never been under “fiercer attack,” and called on people to “push back against attempts to intimidate \u0026 undermine the United Nations including @UNRWA.”Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken arrived in London, where he will meet separately on Friday with the foreign ministers of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, before wrapping up his four-day Middle East diplomacy tour.A large, angry crowd gathered recently outside a bakery in the city of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, where a shortage of flour and rising food prices caused fighting to break out.VideoCreditCredit...EFE/Epa, via Associated PressThe Israeli military strikes a school turned shelter in Gaza that it says was hiding a Hamas command center.The aftermath of an Israeli strike at a school turned shelter in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, on Thursday.The Israeli military said on Thursday that it had struck a Hamas command center embedded in a shelter that was formerly a school in the area of Nuseirat, in central Gaza.The school had been housing displaced people, and video taken after the attack obtained by the Reuters news agency showed people injured, including children. The strike killed at least 17 people, Al Jazeera and Reuters reported, citing the nearby Al Awda hospital. The New York Times could not independently confirm the death toll.There was little immediate information available about the attack, but humanitarian workers in the enclave say these strikes are becoming more common, as aid and medical workers are increasingly struggling to assist civilians amid the fighting and chaos.ImagePalestinians carrying an injured man at the school turned shelter.Credit...Khamis Al-Rifi/ReutersIsrael has accused Hamas of hiding among civilians, especially in busy shelters and hospitals, and has used that as justification for the attacks. But Georgios Petropoulos, who leads the Gaza office for OCHA, the United Nations agency for coordination of humanitarian affairs, said in a phone interview from Gaza on Thursday that Israel should instead target Hamas operatives, rather than just carry out attacks that also kill civilians.Mr. Petropoulos also noted that local emergency workers in Gaza are “terrified of proximity” to the Israeli military because they are frequently detained and sometimes struck. As a result, international agencies like OCHA and the International Committee of the Red Cross are often called upon to accompany the local teams, serving as protection with their presence.On Thursday morning, Mr. Petropoulos said, he had been called to provide one of those escorts for an emergency mission in central Gaza only to learn 30 minutes later that all of the people they were trying to rescue had been killed.It was, unfortunately, not an atypical morning, he added.A correction was made onOct. 24, 2024: An earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of the man who leads the Gaza office for OCHA, the U.N. agency for coordination of humanitarian affairs. His last name is spelled Petropoulos, not Petropolous.Johnatan ReissReporting from Tel AvivThe Israeli military announced the death of another soldier killed in combat in southern Lebanon, who was a member of the military’s elite canine unit. In the past two days, five Israeli soldiers have been killed in southern Lebanon. Since the military launched its invasion in southern Lebanon earlier this month, at least 25 soldiers have died in combat along Israel’s northern border.Johnatan ReissReporting from Tel AvivThe Israeli military announced the deaths of four reservists who were killed in combat in southern Lebanon on Wednesday. All four were members of a reserve infantry brigade involved in Israel’s nearly monthlong invasion of Lebanon.Johnatan ReissReporting from Tel AvivIn a press briefing, the spokesman for the Israeli military, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said that the military had struck more than 3,500 Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon over the past month, including 350 weapons storage depots.ImageCredit...Atef Safadi/EPA, via ShutterstockHere is why the prospect of war between Israel and Iran has the world on edge.ImageA destroyed building in Hod Hasharon, Israel, after an Iranian missile attack earlier this month.Credit...Jack Guez/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAs the number of adversaries that Israel is fighting has piled up over the past year — Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon — the most worrisome prospect has been the potential for a war with Iran.The two nations, which do not share a border, have long been waging conflicts by proxy, subterfuge and sabotage. Each of the militant groups Israel is concurrently fighting is backed by Iran. The indirectness was always by design: Despite being regional rivals, each wanted to avoid what was sure to be a costly, existential direct confrontation.Now, with Israel planning a retaliatory attack after Iran’s ballistic missile barrage of unprecedented scale and scope on Oct. 1, a war seems more likely, alarming the international community and countries in the region.Here is why a war is so concerning.Israel and Iran have two of the region’s most formidable militaries.Israel has one of the world’s most technologically advanced militaries and is among the top military spenders globally as a share of gross domestic product. Israel’s arms industry produces weapons at such a high capacity that last year it produced enough to export a record amount despite its war in Gaza, according to researchers. Israel is also heavily backed by the United States, which has supplied more than 29,000 guided bombs, artillery rockets and assorted missiles since 2009.ImageIranian Revolutionary Guard members march at a parade in Tehran last month.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesIran’s armed forces are among the largest in the Middle East, with at least 580,000 active-duty personnel and about 200,000 reservists, according to an assessment last year by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Iran has made the development of precision and long-range missiles a priority for decades and has amassed one of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles in the region. The country also has a sizable inventory of drones, with ranges of up to 1,550 miles and the ability to fly low to evade radar.A war could draw in the U.S. and Gulf States.A spiraling conflict between Iran and Israel, one of the United States’ closest allies, could pull U.S. forces positioned throughout the region into the fray. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said in a social media post that “anybody with knowledge or understanding” of Israel’s plans to attack Iran should be held accountable. President Biden has indicated that he is aware of Israel’s plans.Senior Pentagon officials have been debating whether the increased U.S. military presence, intended to avert a wider war, has been inflaming the regional conflict by emboldening Israel. The Defense Department said in late September that it was sending a few thousand additional U.S. troops to the region, to bolster the 40,000 who are in place. This month, the United States sent Israel an advanced missile defense system known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, with about 100 American troops to help operate it.ImageA Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit deployed last year in Guam during a multinational joint military exercise.Credit...Chang W. Lee/The New York TimesIran’s foreign minister has made oblique threats against countries that host U.S. forces, which include Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait. Iran’s mission to the United Nations warned in a statement this month that “should any country render assistance to the aggressor, it shall likewise be deemed an accomplice and a legitimate target.”The economic fallout could be devastating.Israel has told the United States that it will not attack Iran’s nuclear or oil facilities in its expected attack. Even so, that assurance does not preclude Israel from taking aim at Iran’s oil installations in any future rounds of escalation, and the fallout could be immensely destabilizing for the global economy.Though highly unlikely, an Israeli strike on Iran’s oil facilities could prompt Iran or its proxies to target refineries in Saudi Arabia or the U.A.E. Another remote scenario that analysts fear is Iran threatening the passage of tankers through the Strait of Hormuz, through which oil produced in the Persian Gulf is shipped to the world.A shock to the global oil supply could lead to surging gas prices, dampen hiring and investment and push economies toward recession. The reverberations would be particularly damaging for poorer nations that depend on imported oil.ImageA mural in Palestine Square in Tehran on Wednesday shows photos of hostages in Gaza. The mural says that none of them will be freed after the killing of Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesThere is a lot of room for miscalculation.In past years, the prevailing presumption for Middle East watchers was that both Iran and Israel wanted to avoid direct conflict.This April, Iran’s attack involving more than 300 drones and missiles, in retaliation for Israel’s killing of seven Iranian officials in Syria, shattered that supposition. That surprised Israel, which had miscalculated the severity of Iran’s response, according to U.S. officials. Israel’s measured response at the time appeared to bring the tit for tat to a conclusion well short of war.Israel may now be more willing to risk war with Iran after the barrage earlier this month targeted civilian areas in addition to military ones. The longstanding framework of deterrence appears to have collapsed, leaving each country in danger of misjudging the other’s response and overstepping at each turn.Johnatan ReissReporting from Tel AvivIsrael’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is sending David Barnea, head of Israel’s spy agency, to Qatar on Sunday to meet with William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, and the prime minister of Qatar, according to a statement from Netanyahu's office. The three are expected to discuss ways to resume negotiations with the goal of ending fighting in Gaza. Johnatan ReissReporting from Tel AvivTalks aimed at reaching a cease-fire in the enclave and the release of dozens of hostages held there had stalled.Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken announced that the United States would provide an additional $135 million in humanitarian assistance “for Palestinians in Gaza, in the West Bank as well as in the region.” Speaking during a news conference in Qatar, he said he had been discussing “concrete ideas” for the reconstruction of Gaza during his Middle East trip.

Since Oct. 7, 2023, the U.S. has provided a total of $1.2 billion in humanitarian assistance.Blinken says Gaza talks will resume, but offers no sign Hamas has softened its position.ImageSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Qatar’s foreign minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, in Doha on Thursday.Credit...Nathan Howard/ReutersSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Thursday that U.S. negotiators will return to Qatar “in the coming days” in an effort to revive cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas.But Mr. Blinken and Qatar’s prime minister and foreign minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, signaled little reason to believe that Hamas was more willing to engage in talks since Israel killed its leader, Yahya Sinwar, last week.“We haven’t yet really determined whether Hamas is prepared to engage,” Mr. Blinken said at a joint news conference with Mr. Al Thani in Doha, the capital of Qatar. “The fundamental question is: Is Hamas serious?”U.S. officials had seen Mr. Sinwar as a major obstacle to negotiations, and hoped that since his killing the armed group’s surviving leaders might be more open to making a deal with Israel to end the yearlong war in Gaza and release the dozens of hostages remaining there.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a group representing the families of captives in Gaza, said in a statement on Thursday that it welcomed the resumption of cease-fire talks and hoped that Mr. Sinwar’s death would be the launching point for peace.“We must leverage the last military achievements, particularly the elimination of Sinwar, to secure a single comprehensive deal for all hostages’ return,” the group said.Mr. Blinken traveled to the Middle East this week at President Biden’s request in the hope of jump-starting talks that had been frozen for months.But during their joint news conference, neither Mr. Blinken nor Mr. Al Thani offered any sign that Hamas’s position had softened.Mr. Al Thani said that Qatar had “re-engaged” with Hamas in the week since Mr. Sinwar’s death, via political representatives of the group who maintain an office in Doha, and sensed that Hamas maintains “the same position” as it has since the last formal negotiating proposal it offered months ago. Israel and the United States have rejected that position as unacceptable.Mr. Al Thani added that Egypt was also playing a role in trying to revive the cease-fire talks, saying that “there are ongoing discussions between Egypt and Hamas.” He did not detail the nature of those discussions.Mr. Blinken and Mr. Al Thani, who met for more than an hour before addressing reporters, said they had also spoken at length about how to end Israel’s offensive in Lebanon against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in a way that would ensure Israel’s security.Qatar and Egypt act as intermediaries in the talks because Hamas and Israel do not speak directly to each other, nor does the United States deal directly with Hamas. U.S. officials have said that William J. Burns, director of the C.I.A., will take part in negotiations, as he has in the past.In a statement, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said that David Barnea, the head of the country’s foreign intelligence service, “will depart on Sunday to a meeting in Doha” with Mr. Burns and Mr. Al Thani.Mr. Blinken did not say whether the United States might propose any new positions, but he said that as part of his trip to the Middle East, he had been discussing “concrete ideas” for the reconstruction of Gaza after the war.“This is a moment for every country to decide what role it’s prepared to play and what contributions it could make in moving Gaza from war to peace,” he said.But more urgent, Mr. Blinken said, was the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza, especially with winter approaching. He announced that the United States would provide an additional $135 million in humanitarian assistance “for Palestinians in Gaza, in the West Bank as well as in the region.”Since Oct. 7, 2023, the U.S. has provided a total of $1.2 billion in humanitarian assistance.For months, the Biden administration has pursued a three-phase agreement that would begin with a six-week pause in fighting during which the remaining hostages would be released from Gaza in exchange for Palestinians being held in Israeli prisons. The second phase envisions a permanent cease-fire, and the third provides for a multiyear reconstruction plan for Gaza.U.S. officials said this week that the Biden administration was open to considering fresh proposals, potentially including a shorter pause of less than two weeks in Israel’s offensive, in exchange for the release of just some of the hostages.Mr. Blinken, who previously visited Israel and Saudi Arabia this week, emphasized that ending the war in Gaza requires that “we continue to develop a plan for what follows, so that Israel can withdraw, so that Hamas cannot be constituted and so that the Palestinian people can rebuild their lives, rebuild their futures under Palestinian leadership.”France backs expansion of Lebanon’s army, and will give €100 million to aid displaced Lebanese, Macron says.ImageLebanese military soldiers in Beirut last month.Credit...Wael Hamzeh/EPA, via ShutterstockFrance will support the recruitment of thousands of extra troops for Lebanon’s military and donate around $100 million to support people who have fled their homes because of a war between Israel and the militia group Hezbollah, President Emmanuel Macron of France said Thursday at a conference on Lebanon.Mr. Macron called for a cease-fire and said that Hezbollah, which has fired thousands of drones and missiles at Israel in the past year, should stop its attacks. He also said that Israel’s continuing invasion of Lebanon, launched this month to end Hezbollah’s aggression, was “regrettable” and he appeared to criticize the rationale for Israel’s push.“There has been a lot of talk in recent days of a war of civilizations, or of civilizations that must be defended. I’m not sure you can defend a civilization by sowing barbarism yourself,” he said at the opening of the conference in Paris held to help raise funds for Lebanon.Mr. Macron did not specify exactly how France would support the recruitment of additional troops for Lebanon, whose bitter sectarian divisions and weak central government have helped Hezbollah, a Shiite movement backed by Iran, to gain power.Thursday’s meeting is the latest example of Mr. Macron’s bid to wield influence in Lebanon, a former French mandate. The historical ties, as well as the fact that French is spoken alongside English and Arabic, the official language, have long given Paris a sense of responsibility toward the country. France, for example, is one of the largest contributors of troops to the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon.At the same time, the United States, Israel’s leading backer, remains the region’s most powerful diplomatic force. President Biden’s envoy on the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, Amos Hochstein, visited Beirut this week, and met with Lebanese officials. The State Department said it would send its deputy secretary for management, Richard Verma, to the Paris conference.ImagePresident Emmanuel Macron of France, second from left, beside Lebanon’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, and Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, seated, in Paris on Thursday.Credit...Pool photo by Alain JocardLebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, also called for a cease-fire at the conference and said that Israeli attacks had put 13 Lebanese hospitals out of service. More than 1.2 million people have fled their homes because of the conflict, the United Nations said more than two weeks ago.Mr. Mikati said that his government could deploy additional troops to the south as part of any cease-fire deal. The military, which receives support from the United States, is not a party to the conflict and Israel has said repeatedly that it is at war with Hezbollah, not Lebanon. Still, Lebanon refers to Israel as the enemy and does not have diplomatic ties with the country.Lebanon’s government is largely powerless to rein in Hezbollah or deploy additional troops to the southern border without Hezbollah’s consent. Lebanese officials, including, Mr. Mikati, say that Hezbollah is on board with a nearly 20-year-old U.N. resolution that would allow them to do so, but Hezbollah has not yet publicly said this.The C.I.A.’s website said Lebanon’s military had around 73,000 active troops, but experts say it has been severely weakened by the country’s economic crisis. Israeli forces killed three Lebanese soldiers this week in southern Lebanon. Israel apologized. On Thursday, Lebanon’s military said that another Israeli attack had killed three more of its soldiers in the south.Mr. Macron appealed to the conference to support a plan to recruit at least 6,000 additional soldiers and enable the deployment of at least 8,000 additional soldiers in the south.This is not the first donor conference that Mr. Macron has organized for Lebanon. After a port blast devastated parts of Beirut in 2020, he toured the city before Lebanese politicians did, and held a conference that raised hundreds of millions of dollars.Euan Ward and Ségolène Le Stradic contributed reporting.The Israeli military said it had struck a Hamas command center inside a compound formerly used as a school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza.

Due to the serious risk posed by this threat, the Embassy imposed a travel restriction on Embassy personnel for Arugam Bay effective immediately and until further notice.”Israel’s National Security Council told its citizens to “immediately leave Arugam Bay and the south and west coastal areas of Sri Lanka.” Israel also warned people to avoid public displays of anything that could be identified as Israeli, including clothing with Hebrew writing or religious symbols, and to avoid gathering in groups.Britain also updated its travel advisory for Sri Lanka, citing a heightened terrorist threat. “Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals such as hotels, tourist sites and places of worship,” the travel advice stated.The police in Sri Lanka had already increased security measures in Colombo, the capital, as well as in Ella and Weligama, popular destinations for Israeli tourists, a police spokesman said during an earlier news conference. One of the reasons for the heightened security, he added, was that some tourists had set up temporary prayer halls because of a Jewish holiday.Pamodi Waravita contributed reporting from Sri Lanka.In Doha, Secretary Blinken said that “what we really have to determine is whether Hamas is prepared to engage,” suggesting that crucial question remains unclear following Israel’s killing of the group’s leader, Yahya Sinwar, last week. U.S. officials have said they hope the death of Sinwar, who was seen as a chief obstacle to an agreement, might create a new opening for talks.Al Thani said that Qatar’s government has “re-engaged” with Hamas via the group’s political office in Doha after Sinwar’s death. “Until now there is no clarity on what will be the way forward,” he said, adding that Qatari officials sense that the group has not softened its position.Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said he expects that U.S. and Qatari negotiators who have been seeking a Gaza cease-fire and hostage release agreement “will be getting together in the coming days.” Negotiations have been stalled for months. Blinken, who was speaking at a news conference with Qatar’s foreign minister, did not immediately say whether he has seen any new reason to be hopeful about the talks. Qatar serves as an intermediary in the talks involving Israel and Hamas.ImageCredit...Pool photo by Nathan HowardQatar’s foreign minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said that negotiators from Israel will also be coming to Doha to “discuss the means for a breakthrough” in cease-fire talks.

It was not clear when the attack occurred.Israel’s military said it was looking into whether its forces had “accidentally harmed” Lebanese soldiers while conducting raids in the area against Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group. It said in a statement that it “does not intentionally target soldiers of the Lebanese army,” and added: “The incident is under review, and any lessons will be learned.”Lebanon’s military is not a party to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed armed group whose military assets dwarf those of the country’s government.But Lebanese troops have increasingly been caught in the crossfire: Thursday was at least the fourth time this month that Israeli troops had killed Lebanese soldiers amid their fight against Hezbollah. This week, the Israeli military apologized over the deaths of three other Lebanese soldiers, saying that it was “not operating against the Lebanese army.”As Israeli troops engage in a weekslong ground invasion of southern Lebanon, the Israeli military has kept up aerial bombardment across the country, in particular in the Dahiya, a densely populated urban area near Beirut where Hezbollah holds sway.ImageA destroyed building after an overnight Israeli strike near Beirut on Thursday.Credit...Anwar Amro/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe Israeli military said Thursday that overnight strikes in the area had targeted “civilian buildings in the heart of populated areas” that Hezbollah had used to manufacture or store weapons, adding that it had issued evacuation orders for residents of the buildings.The Lebanese television channel al-Mayadeen, which is broadly viewed as pro-Iran and pro-Hezbollah, said that one of its offices was hit. Video broadcast by the channel showed the concrete shell of a building surrounded by shattered glass and twisted metal.Al-Mayadeen said the Israeli military had not issued a warning before striking its offices, which the channel’s employees had vacated at the start of Israel’s invasion. There were no reports of injuries. It said in a statement that it “holds the Israeli occupation responsible for targeting a well-known media office belonging to a prominent news channel.”Gaza’s main emergency service says it has ‘completely ceased’ rescue operations in the north.ImageDisplaced Palestinians in northern Gaza on Tuesday.Credit...Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersThe main emergency service in Gaza has said it has ceased all rescue operations in the northern part of the territory amid a renewed Israeli offensive in the area.Scores of Palestinians have been killed since Israel stepped up military operations in northern Gaza this month, saying it was trying to eliminate a regrouped Hamas presence there. Roughly 400,000 people remain in northern Gaza, according to the United Nations, and many have been trapped in their ruined neighborhoods by Israeli airstrikes.Palestinian Civil Defense, the emergency service, has been responding to the scenes of attacks to treat the wounded and try to pull people from rubble. But on Wednesday night, it said its work in northern Gaza had “completely ceased.”“The situation has become catastrophic,” it said in a statement on Telegram. “The residents there are left without humanitarian services.”The statement said three of its rescue workers had been injured by an Israeli drone strike and that five others had been detained by Israeli forces. It added that Israeli tanks had shelled the only fire truck operating in northern Gaza.The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.United Nations officials have expressed alarm about the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza, and said the Israeli authorities have denied aid workers’ requests to help find survivors in the aftermath of Israeli strikes.Gloria Lazic, an aid worker with the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said on social media this week that requests by the agency to help people trapped under rubble in the northern town of Jabaliya had been “repeatedly denied by the Israeli authorities.”Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the main U.N. agency for Palestinians, said much the same in a social media post the same day, writing that “in northern Gaza, people are just waiting to die.”Rawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting.At the Lebanon aid conference in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron of France announced that his government will donate 100 million euros, or about $108 million, for emergency support for displaced Lebanese people. The United Nations has said that at least a million people in Lebanon — around a fifth of the population — have fled their homes amid Israeli attacks against Hezbollah.ImageCredit...Pool photo by Alain JocardSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken has arrived in Doha, Qatar, for the third day of his Middle East swing. After meeting with Qatari leaders to discuss Gaza and other matters, he will head to London for meetings tomorrow with more Arab officials.ImageCredit...Pool photo by Nathan HowardPresident Emmanuel Macron of France opened an international conference on Lebanon by calling for a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah. He said that the armed group should immediately stop its attacks toward Israel, and called Israel’s invasion of the southern part of Lebanon a matter of “regret.” The French government has organized the conference in Paris to help raise financial support for Lebanon, a former colony.Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, also called for a cease-fire and said that Israeli attacks had put 13 Lebanese hospitals out of service. He said his government could deploy additional troops from the Lebanese Army — which is not a party to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict — to the southern part of the country as part of a cease-fire deal.Israel accuses six Al Jazeera reporters of belonging to Palestinian militant groups.ImageAn Israeli military vehicle last month outside the building that houses Al Jazeera’s office in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.Credit...Mohamad Torokman/ReutersThe Israeli military on Wednesday accused six Al Jazeera reporters based in Gaza of being fighters in Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the latest escalation in Israel’s ongoing feud with the Arabic-language broadcaster backed by Qatar.The Israeli military distributed what it said were documents seized from Gaza that showed membership lists, phone directories and salary slips for members of the Qassam Brigades and the Al-Quds Brigades, the armed wings of the two groups. The lists included names matching those of the Al Jazeera reporters.Al Jazeera strongly denied the accusations, which it said were based on “fabricated evidence” and followed a long history of Israeli hostility toward the network. The authenticity and accuracy of the documents could not be immediately confirmed.The accusations against the six journalists were only the latest chapter in Israel’s campaign against Al Jazeera. The organization’s Arabic-language service is widely seen in Israel as being close to Hamas, and critics have accused the network of amplifying the armed group’s perspective.The channel’s correspondents are also some of the few remaining reporters on the ground in Gaza to document the devastating impact of Israel’s operations there. Israel has largely barred the international press from entering the enclave except on closely monitored tours accompanied by the Israeli military.In its statement, Al Jazeera called the accusations “a blatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region, thereby obscuring the harsh realities of the war from audiences worldwide.”Since the beginning of the war in Gaza, Israel has taken steps to crack down on Al Jazeera, including passing a new security law that it used to shutter many of the network’s operations in the country.Press freedom advocates have criticized Israel’s measures against the news organization, calling them a serious threat to journalistic independence. They also argue that the law used to curb its activities sets a concerning precedent that could be used to prevent other international media organizations from operating in Israel.The Committee to Protect Journalists, a press freedom monitor, said in a statement following the latest accusations that Israel had “repeatedly made similar unproven claims without producing credible evidence.”The journalists named by Israel on Wednesday included Anas al-Sharif and Hossam Shabat, two of the last reporters in northern Gaza, where Israeli forces have launched a renewed military operation in recent days to oust what they call a Hamas insurgency. At least one of the journalists, Mr. Shabat, wrote posts on social media praising Hamas, and uploaded photos of himself wearing the green-and-white scarf of its student movement.On Wednesday, Mr. Shabat said in a social media post that the Israeli accusations were intended to turn him and his colleagues into “killable targets.”In late July, Israel killed Ismail al-Ghoul, an Al Jazeera reporter in Gaza, in an airstrike, claiming that he was a member of Hamas’s military wing. Al Jazeera rejected the allegation as “baseless.” A cameraman, Rami al-Rifee, was also killed in the strike; the Israeli military did not accuse him of being a militant.Two months later, Israeli soldiers raided the channel’s offices in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and ordered them closed for at least 45 days.",
