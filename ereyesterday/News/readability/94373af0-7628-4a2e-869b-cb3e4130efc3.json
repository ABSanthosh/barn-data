PIX11 News wanted to get to the bottom of the report.Authorities confirmed a drone came down in a residential area in Pequannock Township in Morris County Thursday night. FBI updates public on mysterious drones flying over New Jersey “The investigation revealed the drone to be a hobby or toy type drone, not a large commercial or military grade drone,” the Pequannock Township Police Department posted on Facebook.In Hillsborough in Somerset County, several police agencies responded to the Lowe’s parking lot Thursday night and Friday morning for a report of a drone down into power lines. A search of the area yielded negative results.Mysterious drones have been spotted flying through the sky over the past few weeks. New Jersey residents have described the sightings as “unnerving” and “creepy,” and they want an explanation.On Friday, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy asked the Biden administration to allocate more resources to an ongoing investigation into the drone sightings reported in the state.Murphy and other officials said there is no evidence that the drones threaten national security or public safety.The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security released a joint statement Thursday regarding the reported drone sightings. Other state and federal agencies involved in the investigation have not corroborated any reported sightings with electronic detection.Officials also said there have been no confirmed sightings in restricted airspace.Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use. However, they are subject to local and FAA regulations and flight restrictions, and operators must be FAA-certified.Witnesses said the drones they have seen in New Jersey appear larger than those typically used by hobbyists.Matthew Euzarraga is a multimedia journalist from El Paso, Texas.
