The technology is often used in products such as laptops and PCs. SK Hynix, Micron Technology and Samsung Electronics are the three top manufacturers of HBM chips.The strong fourth-quarter numbers conclude a year that saw the company reach record yearly revenue, exceeding the previous high in 2022 by over 21 trillion won. Meanwhile, operating profit, beat a record set in 2018 during a \"super boom\" in the semiconductor industry.",
