Security forces responded swiftly, overpowering the attackers. According to a report by the Associated Press, roads leading to the complex were immediately blocked, with tanks deployed on the streets. Civilians fled the area, with police setting up checkpoints across the city centre.According to government spokesperson and Foreign Minister Abderaman Koulamallah, the situation is now “completely under control.” In a video flanked by soldiers, he assured citizens that the attempted destabilisation had been thwarted.The attack follows a contentious general election held less than two weeks earlier. While the government described the polls as a milestone towards civilian rule, opposition groups alleged widespread fraud and voter suppression.Chad, a landlocked country in northern Africa, is under military rule and frequently faces attacks from the jihadist group Boko Haram in the Lake Chad region.It has recently ended a military accord with former colonial power France and has faced accusations that it was interfering in the conflict ravaging neighbouring Sudan.
