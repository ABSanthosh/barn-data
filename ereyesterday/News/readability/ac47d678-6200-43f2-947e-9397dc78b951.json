  "text": "Admiral Samuel Paparo, head of the US Indo-Pacific Command, raised alarms on Thursday about China’s intensified military presence around Taiwan, suggesting that recent maneuvers are far more serious than standard drills. \"With military pressure against Taiwan increasing by 300%, China's increasingly aggressive actions near Taiwan are not just exercises, they are rehearsals,\" Paparo said while addressing the Senate Armed Services Committee. He described China’s strategic shift as part of a broader modernization effort that threatens not only Taiwan but also US interests and allies across the region. \"China's unprecedented aggression and military modernization poses a serious threat to the homeland, our allies and our partners,\" he emphasized, calling attention to the growing regional instability provoked by Beijing’s actions. While Taiwan considers itself an independent, sovereign nation, it is still officially recognized as part of China under the \"One China\" policy — a stance maintained by the United Nations, the US, and China itself. However, tensions continue to rise as Beijing steps up efforts to \"reunify\" Taiwan with the mainland, a goal that both Washington and Taipei have warned would upset the balance in the Indo-Pacific.U.S. Indo- Pacific Commander Reveals Deep Insights Into US Strategies To Contain China!The admiral pointed out that rather than cowing Taipei into submission, China's aggressive posture is having the opposite effect. \"While the [People’s Liberation Army] PLA attempts to intimidate the people of Taiwan and demonstrate coercive capabilities, these actions are backfiring, drawing increased global attention and accelerating Taiwan's own defense preparations,\" he said. Beyond the Taiwan Strait, Paparo also cautioned lawmakers about the broader implications of China’s accelerating military production. “China's outproducing the United States in air missile, maritime and space capability and accelerating these,\" he stated. He offered a stark comparison, noting that the Chinese military is building fighter jets at a rate 1.2 times that of the United States and is also outpacing the US in the production of naval vessels, advanced missiles, and space technologies. “I remain confident in our deterrence posture, but the trajectory must change,” Paparo concluded, signaling an urgent call for US defense innovation and readiness.",
