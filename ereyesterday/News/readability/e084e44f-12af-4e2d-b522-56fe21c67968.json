Putin of Russia amid escalating attacks between Russia and Ukraine, even as their officials have been engaged in direct talks.In a photo distributed by Russian state media, President Vladimir V. Putin holds a video meeting with government officials on Wednesday at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence outside Moscow.Credit...Gavriil Grigorov/SputnikJune 4, 2025Updated 5:31 p.m. ETAfter Russia launched more than 1,000 drones per week at military and civilian targets in Ukraine in recent months, including more than 300 in a single night last week, Ukraine mounted an audacious drone attack on Russian strategic bomber bases on Sunday.Now President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has told President Trump that Russia would retaliate for the strikes on its bombers, Mr. Trump said on Wednesday, after their first conversation since the attack on Sunday, apparently dimming already faint hopes for a cease-fire.“President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields,” Mr. Trump said in a statement on social media.Ukraine and Russia have been negotiating at Mr. Trump’s urging, and said Wednesday that they would continue to meet, but Mr. Trump made no mention of the Russian leader’s refusal to agree to the White House cease-fire proposal that Ukraine accepted weeks ago. Mr. Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine lashed out at each other on Wednesday, each accusing the other of sabotaging peace prospects with escalating attacks.Mr. Trump described his call with the Russian leader, which lasted more than an hour, as a “good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.”Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin foreign policy aide who briefed reporters on the call, did not say whether Mr. Putin had discussed retaliation. But he described Ukraine’s government and its actions, including apparent attacks on railroads over the weekend, as “terrorist,” disregarding that Russia initiated the war with its 2022 full-scale invasion and that in recent weeks it has stepped up its regular bombardment of Ukrainian cities and civilians.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
