  "text": "International students make up more than a quarter of Harvard’s total student body, and the largest share of them come from China, the university says.So when President Donald Trump abruptly revoked Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students, a move that a judge has temporarily blocked, China’s government was among the first to respond.“China-U.S. cooperation in education benefits both sides,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a news briefing Friday.“China has always opposed politicizing cooperation in education,” she said. “The U.S.’s relevant actions will only damage its image and international credibility.”Harvard is a particularly coveted place for Chinese students to land, but students from China are well represented in colleges across the United States. During the 2023-24 academic year, Chinese students made up a quarter of all 1.1 million international students in the U.S., making China the second-leading place of origin, according to Department of Homeland Security figures. There were also more than 5,600 students from Hong Kong in the same year.On Friday, as Harvard filed a lawsuit over the Trump administration’s decision on foreign students, a university in Hong Kong said it would welcome current international undergraduates and postgraduates at Harvard, in addition to students with confirmed offers, to either transfer or enroll in its degree programs.“We are prepared to welcome Harvard students into our community, offering them the resources and vibrant environment needed to thrive in their fields,” Guo Yike, the provost of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said in a statement.Jessica Ho, a higher-education counselor at an international school in Hong Kong, said in a telephone interview Friday that the latest news had caused anxiety among parents and students.“I have parents texting me, saying: ‘What should we do? Should we now focus back to U.K. or Canada, or maybe now apply for schools in Hong Kong, even start a very late application to Hong Kong University?’ So parents’ anxiety is surging.”Students who are set to apply to universities next year are also concerned, she added.“Since January until yesterday, when the Harvard news came out, there were withdrawals from the early decisions, lots of emails from parents worrying about student visa applications,” Ho said.A federal judge in Massachusetts granted a temporary order Friday blocking the ban. But the future of international enrollment at Harvard remains unsettled for students around the world.Among those left uncertain is the heir to Belgium’s throne, Princess Elisabeth, who just completed her first year of graduate school in public policy.Another British student recently admitted to a master’s program at Harvard was on a flight when the news broke. The student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, had just booked travel and housing for the next chapter in his life, and he was feeling optimistic.“I spent the latter half of the plane journey talking about how lucky I felt,” he said. “And literally the first thing I saw when I landed was people sharing the news with me and asking if it would affect me.”The student said he’d turned down highly paid job offers to matriculate at Harvard. If he can’t attend Harvard, he fears he’ll face prolonged unemployment, and he has no backup housing arrangements. But his biggest concern is missing out on the master’s program.“Losing a dream opportunity that I’d worked incredibly hard for and been over the moon in getting — that’s the most emotionally challenging thing,” he said.The Trump administration’s decision on Harvard was the latest development affecting U.S. higher education and international students. On Thursday, a federal judge in California blocked a move to revoke the visas of thousands of international students and scholars, part of the administration’s efforts to crack down on what it describes as antisemitism on campuses amid pro-Palestinian protests.Chris R. Glass, a professor at Boston College focusing on international students, wrote in an email Friday that the immediate impact of the Harvard decision “is catastrophic uncertainty. Current international students face an impossible choice: abandon their research, experiments, and degree programs to transfer elsewhere, or risk losing legal status.”“Critically, international students comprise 59% of Harvard Kennedy School, 40% of the School of Public Health, and 35% of Harvard Business School. Entire graduate programs could effectively cease to exist or be dramatically altered,” Glass wrote.“We’re not just losing students; we’re losing the presumption that American higher education represents intellectual freedom. That’s a reputation that, once lost, may take generations to rebuild — if it can be rebuilt at all.”As Harvard’s international students await the outcome of the school’s lawsuit against the Trump administration, other students abroad are reconsidering their aspirations to study in the U.S. in the near future.“I really, really want to study in the U.S.,” said Arthur Li, a master’s student from China studying risk disaster and resilience at University College London, adding that he was particularly interested in PhD studies there because of the U.S.’s academic reputation and funding for research.“But under current circumstances, the only thing I can do is wait for another four years,” he said.",
