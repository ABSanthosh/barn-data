  "text": "LAS VEGAS (KLAS) – A Las Vegas man killed on his way to work, marks the second motorcycle death in a week in Clark County.Family and friends identified Jordon Dodder, 37, as the motorcyclist in Wednesday morning’s crash.“People need to wake up, pay attention to the roads, to the signs,” Jennifer Breeden, a friend, said.Dodder was described as an amazing father, a devoted partner, and a proud veteran. The 37-year-old’s life was tragically cut short when he was killed by a car that police said ran a stop sign.“Not well at all,” Kathleen Brown said of how her sister was doing. “He was her person. He completed her. They were perfect together.”Brown flew into Las Vegas to support her sister Kelly and her four nieces and nephews during this tragic time.Family and friends identified Jordon Dodder, 37, as the motorcyclist in Wednesday morning’s crash. (KLAS)“She was packing their lunches and getting ready, and she got a phone call from someone that he works with that drove past the accident site, and he said he thought it was Jordon’s bike,” Brown said. Deadly crash closes intersection in Spring Valley Officers responded Wednesday at around 5:30 a.m. to a crash on Russell and Lindell roads.According to the Las Vegas Metro Police Department, Dodder was driving his 2013 Harley Davidson west on Russell Road when a car hit him at the intersection of Lindell Road.Police said the car failed to stop at the stop sign and the driver of that vehicle reportedly didn’t show signs of impairment.Breeden and Jasmine Roofe started a GoFundMe for Kelly Dodder. They’ve been friends with her for about 30 years.“When you’re behind the wheel, that is such a massive weapon, that people don’t realize can just take your life like that,” Breeden said.Kelly Dodder teaches at Mannion Middle School and was awarded Educator of the Year for CCSD 10 years ago. To their friends, both Kelly and Jordon were dedicated to each other.“You can tell by how much they loved each other – they were really and really in love,” Jasmine Roofe said of her friends.It is unclear at the moment if the driver who hit Jordon Dodder will face charges.There have been 52 fatal crashes in the Las Vegas Metro Police Department’s jurisdiction so far this year. At this same time last year, there were 48 fatalities.Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.
