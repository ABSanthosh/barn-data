It had 183,323 employees as of December 31, 2024, according to a filing in February.Among other major job cuts, Facebook-parent Meta laid off about 5% of its \"lowest performers\" in January, while pushing ahead with the expedited hiring of machine learning engineers.Microsoft also trimmed 650 jobs in its Xbox unit in September. Amazon laid off employees in several units, including communications, while Apple eliminated about 100 roles in its digital services group last year, according to media reports.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",
