  "text": "File photo: Prince Harry (Picture credit: AP)Prince Harry’s ties with the royal family have reportedly hit rock bottom, with insiders claiming that neither King Charles nor other senior royals trust him or his wife, Meghan Markle.A close source cited by news outlet Page Six said, “I genuinely think nobody trusts him and that’s the bottom line. The royal family has major trust issues with him… maybe there’s room to forgive, but they won’t forget.”The growing estrangement was made starker after King Charles allegedly refused to meet Harry during his visit to the UK in April for the Invictus Games’ 10th anniversary. “Harry messaged Charles and he never heard back. He wanted to talk to his dad about security stuff then, but his dad wouldn’t speak to him,” the source said.Harry, 40, recently lost a Court of Appeal challenge over the UK government’s decision to strip him of publicly funded security. Reacting to the ruling, Harry said in an interview given to BBC News that he “can’t see a world” in which he would bring Meghan and their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, back to Britain. He added, “Charles won’t speak to me because of this security stuff… there have been so many disagreements between myself and some of my family.”The duke’s remarks about King Charles’s health also stirred outrage. Speaking to the BBC, he said he didn’t “know how much longer” his father has to live. Royal biographer Hugo Vickers wwas quoted by Page Six saying, “It was disgraceful to talk about Charles’s health… how does he know anything about it if he’s not talking to him?”Vickers said Harry’s actions echoed past royal missteps: “Charles is, of course, right not to trust him… Harry is hopeless in that respect.” He also criticised Harry for airing family matters publicly, saying, “Enough with the ‘me, me, me’ complaints. The king has got enough on his plate.”Adding further fuel to the fire, Harry’s BBC interview also included hints at a darker conspiracy, suggesting unnamed individuals may want “history to repeat itself” — a reference to Princess Diana’s death. Harry said, “Through the disclosure process, I’ve discovered that some people do want history to repeat itself, which is pretty dark.”When pressed to name those involved, he replied, “I’m not going to share that at this point. I know all the names of the people that were involved in this process.” He also claimed the royal family conspired with foreign governments to leave his family vulnerable, stating, “Not only did they decide to remove my security, but they also signalled to every single government around the world not to protect us.”Critics have accused Harry of using the security issue as a justification to stay away from future royal events, including potential funerals. Vickers remarked, “Harry should be begging his father for forgiveness… and it should be done quietly, not on TV. But he won’t. Because he’s so stupid, he’s basically blown it.”",
