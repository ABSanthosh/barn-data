It came a day after Israeli forces withdrew from the north’s only operational hospital after a days-long raid. Israel claimed Kamal Adwan Hospital was being used by Hamas as a base.Live coverage contributors 10Israeli parliament votes to ban UNRWA within Israel and sever tiesReturn to menuIsrael's parliament passed two laws Oct. 28 that severely restrict the work of UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees. (Video: Reuters)The backlash against Israeli laws that severely restrict the activities and privileges of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees deepened Tuesday, as aid groups and officials from around the world warned that they would worsen an already desperate humanitarian crisis in Gaza.The laws, which Israel’s parliament passed late Monday in defiance of appeals from the United States and other allies to not do so, prevent any activity by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) — the main humanitarian aid provider in Gaza — on Israeli territory and ban state authorities from contact with it.“What happened last night is absolutely outrageous,” Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, told reporters Tuesday, and the impact “on the people who depend for their sheer survival on UNRWA is going to be very, very big.”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to work with international partners in the 90 days before the legislation takes effect to ensure that aid gets to civilians in Gaza “in a way that does not threaten Israel’s security.”But U.N. Secretary General António Guterres warned that the laws, which would probably prevent UNRWA from doing its work in Gaza, will have “devastating consequences.” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said on X that they represent “nothing less than collective punishment.”No U.N. agencies or outside groups are able to fill UNRWA’s role, Touma said, and the U.N. General Assembly would need to approve any changes to the agency’s mandate.The Biden administration this month warned Israel that it must increase the amount of aid it is allowing into Gaza or risk losing U.S. weapons funding. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters Tuesday that the United States was “deeply troubled” by the legislation and that there “could be consequences under U.S. law.”Melanie Joly, Canada’s foreign minister, told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday that the laws set a “dangerous precedent.”A group of international organizations and charities known as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification warned Tuesday that the risk of famine persists across Gaza and that Israel’s offensive in the north has intensified fears that “this worst-case scenario may materialize.”Israel has accused UNRWA of employing people with ties to Hamas and called for it to be disbanded. The agency in January fired about a dozen staff members accused of taking part in the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. An independent review in April found that Israel had not provided sufficient evidence for its claims, but the review called on the agency to implement more robust vetting of staff to ensure neutrality.Suhad Bishara, legal adviser for Adalah, a law center that advocates for Palestinian and minority rights in Israel, said that the group sent a letter to Israel’s parliament arguing that the legislation violates international laws.Backers of the laws in Israel “are taking advantage of the situation in Gaza and the allegations of some UNRWA staff to pass this law while their aims are rather political,” Bishara said.At least 93 killed in Israeli strike in north Gaza, health official saysReturn to menuAt least 93 people, including 25 children, were killed in an Israeli strike on a residential building in northern Gaza, rescuers and medical officials said Tuesday. The attack appeared to be the deadliest in the area since Israeli troops resumed a military offensive there this month.Mahmoud Basal, spokesman for Gaza’s civil defense, said that the strike on the five-story building in Beit Lahia was reported at 4:20 a.m. local time. About 300 people who had been displaced by a strike on a neighboring building had taken shelter there. “We expect the numbers to rise much higher, and with every minute we receive more news about search-and-rescue operations there,” Basal told The Washington Post. “The situation is very difficult and cannot be described in words.”The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that it was “aware of reports that civilians were harmed” in the strike and was looking into the matter.“We emphasize that the area was evacuated by the IDF and it is currently an active combat zone,” the IDF said in a statement.State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday that the United States had asked the Israeli government about the strike but had not yet received a “full explanation” about what happened.“We are deeply concerned by the loss of civilian life in this incident,” he said at a news conference Tuesday. “This was a horrifying incident with a horrifying result.”Israel renewed military operations in northern Gaza in early October with the stated aim of stopping Hamas from regrouping there. Basal told The Post on Monday that nearly 1,000 people have died in northern Gaza this month.Gaza’s civil defense agency, which conducts search-and-rescue operations, said it had been forced to effectively stop its work in the area because of threats from the Israeli military.Lior Soroka contributed to this report.Hezbollah names new leader one month after Nasrallah killingReturn to menuHezbollah announced Tuesday its choice to succeed Hasan Nasrallah, who led the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant and political group for three decades before his assassination in an Israeli strike last month.The group said in a social media statement that members elected Naim Qassem, Nasrallah’s former deputy, as Hezbollah’s new secretary general. Qassem said after Nasrallah’s killing that the group was prepared for a “long” battle with Israel.Gaza-based militant groups Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad congratulated Hezbollah on its new leader in separate statements.Israel has devastated Hezbollah’s senior leadership since ramping up its attacks in Lebanon in mid-September. Last week, Israel confirmed that Hashem Safieddine, who was widely expected to become the group’s next leader, was killed in an Israeli attack in Beirut’s southern suburbs weeks earlier.U.S. officials push for cease-fire, hostage swap in renewed talksReturn to menuThe Biden administration is continuing its push for a cease-fire deal and hostage swap after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, with talks in Doha, Qatar, on Monday.David Barnea, the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, returned to Israel on Monday after meeting with CIA Director William J. Burns and Qatar’s ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, to discuss a “a new unified framework” for a deal “that integrates previous proposals,” according to a statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office.Discussions between mediators and Hamas “in the coming days” are to “assess the feasibility of talks,” according to the statement.Negotiations have been deadlocked for months, and hostages’ families have accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prioritizing his own political survival and victory against Hamas over a deal that would bring their loved ones home.On Sunday, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi announced that he had proposed a deal for a two-day cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. He said four Hamas-held hostages would be released if all parties agreed to it, Egyptian state newspaper Al-Ahram reported.Israel’s Knesset, or parliament, opened its winter session on Monday. Netanyahu told his right-wing Likud party that Israel had not yet received a proposal for the release of four hostages in return for a 48-hour cease-fire in Gaza.“If such a proposal had been raised, the PM would have accepted it immediately,” his office said in a post on social media late Monday.Families separated by Israel’s war in Gaza fear they will never reuniteReturn to menuMohammed al-Waheidi never met his baby boy.The 40-year-old is trapped in southern Gaza. His wife, Ruaa al-Saqa, 32, is stuck in the besieged north. Oct. 13 marked one year apart for the couple; Oct. 18 would have been their son Noah’s first birthday. He died in August of a heart defect, his parents said.“I did not witness your birth nor was I able to attend your final farewell, as every moment with you was an unfulfilled dream,” Waheidi wrote in a last letter to Noah, which he shared with The Washington Post.More than a year into Israel’s war to oust Hamas, many Palestinian families remain divided by the military’s strategic Netzarim Corridor, which cuts the Gaza Strip in half. In the early days of the conflict, parents, husbands and wives made snap decisions about where to run, never expecting the fighting to last so long. Now, some fear their separation could be permanent.Israeli forces control all movement in and out of Gaza, as well as within the enclave. Last year, the military forced more than a million Palestinians living in the north to move south, where they crowded into tent cities along the Egyptian border. When troops then stormed into the city of Rafah, families fled again, many to a desolate stretch of coastline called Mawasi, or to more central areas, but were blocked by Israel from returning to the north.For those who never left, the situation has grown more and more desperate. The United Nations estimates 400,000 people still live in the north’s bombed-out cities and refugee camps. About half are believed to be children. The return of Palestinian families to these communities is a key Hamas demand in stalled cease-fire negotiations.This is an excerpt from a full story.",
