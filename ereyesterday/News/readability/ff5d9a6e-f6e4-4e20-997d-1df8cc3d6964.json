  "text": "Prince William and Princess of Wales, Kate Middleton’s three children — Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, showed just how close they are during this year’s Trooping the Colour ceremony.While the event is meant to honour King Charles’ official birthday, it was seven-year-old Prince Louis who charmed royal watchers with his playful energy and sweet bond with his older siblings.Riding in a carriage alongside their mother, the young royals were greeted with loud cheers from the crowds lining the Mall. Beaming and waving to onlookers, George, 11, Charlotte, 10, and Louis, 7, delighted fans with their warm smiles and visible sibling camaraderie.As their carriage moved past a sea of waving Union Jacks, Prince George briefly covered his eyes, taking a quiet moment to himself. His younger brother, Prince Louis, quickly copied the gesture with a cheeky grin.Cameras caught the heartwarming moment as George smiled back at Louis, who burst into laughter. Later, the two brothers were seen sharing a lighthearted chat. According to a lip reader, Louis turned to George for advice during the parade, highlighting the close bond between the royal siblings.A lip reader told The Sun that during a brief chat, Louis turned to his brother and asked, “Should I wave?” George smiled and replied, “It’s up to you, I can’t believe how sunny it is.”Louis responded sweetly, “Let’s do it together!” The brothers then waved to the crowd in unison, joined by Princess Charlotte and their mother on the opposite side.Prince George and Prince Louis looked dapper in matching suits, white shirts, and bold red ties as they joined the royal procession during the historic celebration.Later, as the royal family gathered on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the Royal Air Force flypast, Princess Kate gave her son a quick but firm reminder during the national anthem. Kate said, “National anthem. Louis, stand,” lip reader Jeremy Freeman told the Mirror. The young prince promptly straightened up, standing at attention beside King Charles, Queen Camilla, and his siblings.Prince William took part in the parade on horseback, riding alongside Princess Anne and the Duke of Edinburgh, while his children enjoyed the pageantry from the carriage.",
