  "text": "US Vice President JD Vance warned that Europe risks “civilisational suicide” if it fails to tighten border controls, further stating that, “If migrants come from other countries who are incompatible with Germany, Germany will kill itself.”“Too many countries are unable or unwilling to control their borders,” said Vance during a Thursday interview on Fox News' The Ingraham Angle with host Laura Ingraham, highlighting the increasing challenges European nations face in managing migration.He further expressed concern about European authorities limiting citizens' freedom of expression, particularly when they protest against immigration-related issues stating that: \"Europe is threatened with civilisational suicide. They are either unable or unwilling to control their borders. What we're seeing now, their attempts to resist that, that's good, that's the right thing to do.\"“But you also see them beginning to restrict the free speech of their own citizens, even as those citizens protest things like invasions across borders. [It was such protests] that led to the election of Donald Trump and a number of European leaders,” Vance added.Europe is ‘At Risk’ of ‘Engaging in Civilizational Suicide’: A Dire Warning from JD VanceThe Vice President also voiced serious concerns regarding Europe's immigration policies and increasing restrictions on citizens' rights, describing it as a critical issue for the continent's future.“If you have a country like Germany and billions migrants come from other countries that are totally culturally incompatible with Germany, Germany will kill itself,” he said, “I hope that doesn’t happen, as I love Germany and want it to thrive,” he added.The situation Vance discusses originated in autumn 2015, when the EU experienced a substantial increase in refugees and unauthorised immigrants from North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. European Union Asylum Agency (EUAA) data shows that Germany received 25% of all EU asylum applications in the first half of 2024.Vance further reaffirmed the administration's commitment to enforcing Trump's immigration policies, emphasising its dedication to stricter border control measures.He reported significant achievements in border security, citing a reduction exceeding 95% in border crossings since Trump's January inauguration. With border matters largely addressed, the administration is now prioritising deportations, stating \"We're building that capacity up.\"Vance criticised former President Biden's administration for inadequate funding of detention facilities and weakening Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), creating operational challenges for Trump's team.He commended Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and \"border czar\" Tom Homan for implementing voluntary departure initiatives.“We’re going to encourage a lot of people to self-deport. We don’t have to knock on your door. Before that happens, why don’t you get on a plane and go home yourself?” Vance added.",
