To Anastasiia’s young cousins, Kostiantyn and Illia, Israel offered a refuge from the Russian drones and missiles that pounded Ukraine nightly.So the family — Mariia, the three children and their grandmother — had settled in Bat Yam, a suburb of Tel Aviv.In the end, war caught up with them.On June 15, an Iranian missile strike on a residential building in Bat Yam killed all five family members, as Israel and Iran engaged in escalating air assaults. The news reverberated through Ukraine, stirring grief and outrage.The deaths are an intersection, in human terms, of two wars until now connected mostly by geopolitics and arms deals. Iran was a key supplier of attack drones to Russia in the first year of its Ukraine invasion, and Moscow has long backed Tehran’s regime.Beyond geopolitics, the deaths carried a cruel irony. The family was killed by war in the very country they believed would shield them from it, with its powerful air defense system that Ukraine has long envied.“I really thought they’d be safe,” said Artem Buryk, Anastasiia’s father and Mariia’s ex-partner. “I never thought they’d go to Israel to escape war — and find it there.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
