  "text": "Senior Biden administration officials met Thursday with Israel’s prime minister and defense minister in an effort to secure a cease-fire in Lebanon as Israel’s strikes on its northern neighbor continued.Amos Hochstein, the White House envoy for Lebanon, and Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and Africa, were working toward a deal that would allow residents of southern Lebanon and northern Israel to return their homes, said a U.S. official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic discussions.They also discussed efforts for the release of the hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza, the official said. Hochstein was on his way back to Washington following the meetings, said another U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic discussions.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Biden officials that Israel’s priority was to “thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon, in a manner that will return our residents securely to their homes,” according to a statement from the prime minister’s office. Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern Israel have forced residents there to evacuate.Lebanon’s prime minister, Najib Mikati, said in a televised interview Wednesday he had been skeptical that a cease-fire could be reached before the U.S. election, but that after speaking with Hochstein shortly before the interview, he believed that “maybe we can reach a cease-fire in the next few days.” He also said that Hezbollah had agreed to “separate the Lebanese front from Gaza,” referring to Hezbollah’s longtime condition that the group would agree to a truce in Lebanon only after a cease-fire was reached in the Gaza Strip.Mikati’s optimistic assessment contrasted with comments made by Hezbollah’s new leader, Naim Qassem, who said in a speech Wednesday that there was not yet a cease-fire proposal “that Israel agrees to and that is open for us to discuss.” People familiar with the negotiations over the last few months, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said Hezbollah had agreed to a cease-fire before an Israeli strike killed its former leader, Hasan Nasrallah, in late September.Separately, William J. Burns, director of the CIA, met in Cairo on Thursday with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi. The two discussed “efforts to achieve de-escalation in the Gaza Strip” and “ways to advance negotiations toward a cease-fire and the exchange of captives,” Sisi’s office said in a statement.A member of Hamas’s political bureau stated that the group had recently received multiple cease-fire proposals, all of which were rejected. The Hamas official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly, said, “Hamas’s position is firm, the demands are clear, and none of the proposals include a final cease-fire or a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.”He said there was “no room for partial solutions,” adding that Hamas’s conditions were “a full cessation of hostilities, the return of displaced persons to northern Gaza, the withdrawal of occupying forces, a clear reconstruction plan and a fair prisoner exchange.”A spokesman for the Israeli prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the proposals.",
