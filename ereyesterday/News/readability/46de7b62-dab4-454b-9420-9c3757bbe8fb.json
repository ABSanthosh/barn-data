Fourteen months into the war, he still sleeps on the grounds of St. Porphyrius, the ancient Greek Orthodox church in Gaza City where an Israeli airstrike last year killed his three children.“This year, we will conduct our religious rites and that’s it,” Mr. Souri, 47, said. “We’re still in mourning and far too sad to celebrate, or do anything except to pray for peace.”Since the beginning of the war, hundreds of Palestinian Christians have huddled in two churches in Gaza City: St. Porphyrius and the Holy Family Church, a Catholic parish. They have remained in the sanctuaries despite an Israeli military campaign that has laid waste to much of the city.ImageGood Friday Mass at the Holy Family Church in Gaza City, in March.Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBut some now say the community may be in danger of losing its 1,600-year foothold in the territory.
