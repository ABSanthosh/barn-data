  "text": "Containers at the Port of Vancouver in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, Feb. 28, 2025.Ethan Cairns/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesChina on Saturday announced retaliatory tariffs on some Canadian agricultural goods, hitting back after Ottawa slapped import duties on Chinese-made electric vehicles and steel and aluminum products.Beijing said a 100% tariff would be imposed on Canadian rapeseed oil, oil cakes and peas, while a 25% levy would be placed on aquatic products and pork originating in Canada.The tariffs are scheduled to come into force from March 20, according to a statement from China's Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council. The measures come amid a brewing global trade war, following several tariff announcements by the U.S., China, Canada and Mexico in recent months. Canada imposed 100% import tariffs on Chinese-made EVs from Oct. 1 last year, following in the footsteps of the U.S. and the European Union over concerns related to unfair competition. Ottawa also applied a 25% tariff on imports of steel and aluminum products from China, which came into effect from Oct. 15.\"Canada's unilateral imposition of tariffs disregards objective facts and World Trade Organization rules, is a typical trade protectionist practice, constitutes a discriminatory measure against China, seriously infringes on China's legitimate rights and interests, and undermines China-Canada economic and trade relations,\" China's customs authorities said in a statement on a Saturday, according to a Google translation.",
