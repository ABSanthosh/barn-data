  "text": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem has decided to end temporary humanitarian protections for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans who sought refuge in the United States in the past few years, putting them at imminent risk of being forced to return to the autocratic regime they left behind in South America.Noem wrote that conditions in Venezuela “no longer” met the criteria for its citizens to qualify for temporary protected status, which was set to expire in April for those who became eligible for it in 2023, according to a copy of the unpublished notice that DHS released Sunday.The Biden administration had extended their protections through the fall of 2026, citing extreme poverty, and economic and political crises. But the Trump administration quickly reversed that decision, and now the group that received temporary protection in 2023 could lose it 60 days after the notice is officially published in the Federal Register. Officials did not say when it could publish.Noem also determined that allowing Venezuelans to live and work in the United States is “contrary to the national interest,” she said, citing gang activity — though criminals are generally ineligible for temporary protection — as well as the cost to cities such as New York to shelter migrants and other concerns.Noem acknowledged that Venezuela is still struggling with many of the issues that the Biden administration raised, but she said there were “notable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime.”“In particular, the Secretary has determined it is contrary to the national interest to permit the covered Venezuelan nationals to remain temporarily in the United States,” the notice said. The New York Times first reported on the protection revocations.Ending protections for Venezuelans is a marked shift for the Trump administration, which granted them reprieves from deportation during his first term, and Noem’s decision is expected to face legal challenges. Her announcement comes a day after President Trump said the government of Nicolás Maduro would accept the return of Venezuelans.Trump has vowed to carry out mass deportations and his administration launched with a blitz of immigration arrests nationwide. Trump officials emphasize that criminals are their top priority for removal but say that anyone in the United States illegally could be deported.Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is on a tour of Latin America, lobbied intensively for the temporary protections as a U.S. senator, writing in 2022 that it would be a “very real death sentence” to force Venezuelans to return home.Rubio referred questions to DHS last week after Noem reversed the Biden administration’s extension of protections for Venezuelans.In one of the last acts of his first term, Trump granted Venezuelans permission to stay in the United States because of the “catastrophic” conditions in their homeland.Political support for Venezuelans waned, however, after the slaying last year of a Georgia nursing student by a man from Venezuela with a criminal history, including shoplifting.A House investigation into the man’s immigration status found that he had crossed the border illegally and sought asylum, but did not find that he had temporary protected status. Trump repeatedly referred to the murder on the campaign trail and he recently signed into law the Laken Riley Act, expanding mandatory detention for immigrants arrested for theft-related crimes.Human rights organizations, immigration lawyers and politicians condemned Noem’s decision Sunday, given the continuing emergencies in Venezuela, including shortages of food, water and electricity, and political crackdowns against Maduro opponents.“There is bipartisan agreement that TPS recipients from Venezuela shouldn’t be forced to return to extremely dangerous conditions,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nevada) said in a statement Sunday. “Nothing about Venezuela’s communist regime has changed since 2023, and taking away these protections for hardworking families doesn’t make our country any safer.”Wilfredo Allen, a South Florida immigration attorney, said Noem’s decision was “shocking” given that Trump withdrew diplomatic personnel from Venezuela in 2019 and has maintained sanctions against the country.Ahilan Arulanantham, a University of California-Los Angeles law professor who led the lawsuit that blocked Trump from terminating protections for Haitians and other groups during his first term, said Noem’s actions are “plainly illegal.”Venezuelans are the largest group by far in the United States with temporary protected status, a humanitarian program created under a 1990 law for people from countries destabilized by war, a natural disaster or another emergency.Soon before leaving office, Biden’s Department of Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, extended protections for up to 600,000 Venezuelans through October 2026.He had granted them temporary protected status in 2021 and 2023. The 2023 group’s protections were set to expire on April 2, while the 2021 group’s status will expire on Sept. 10.Critics of the TPS program have long argued that repeat extensions flout the temporary intent of the law. Most of those who apply don’t otherwise qualify for legal status, and on his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order saying that the program should be “limited in scope.”Immigrants from 17 countries have the protection, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers the program. Before he left office, Mayorkas expanded protections for about 85 percent of those enrolled in the program, including El Salvador, Ukraine and Sudan.Protections for other countries, such as Honduras, are set to expire in the coming months.In her analysis, Noem said TPS allowed a “significant population” of Venezuelans with no clear path to a lawful immigration status into the United States, and said extending temporary protections could encourage more to arrive.Abby Maxman, president and chief executive of Oxfam America, said TPS recipients are already integrated into communities across the United States, and needed to work in health care, construction and farming.“Revoking TPS is not only inhumane but also economically disastrous,” she said in a statement, calling the move “a direct attack on families and communities who have sought safety and stability in the United States.”Mariana Alfaro contributed to this report.",
