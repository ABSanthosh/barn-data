Despite this tragedy, they still lost a child. They still lost a member of their family,\" Barnes said. \"It is certain that they have probably more questions than anyone because they knew her. They lived with her and so we wanted to get an account from them of what kind of child she was.\"Her father is being questioned by investigators, Barnes said. He said he didn’t know whether the mother had been questioned, noting that she’s been out of town.PHOTO: Neighbors say this photo, posted to Facebook in November 2023, shows Madison, Wisconsin, shooting suspect Natalie (Samantha) Rupnow.
