Tesla also said some workers wouldn't follow the adjusted schedule, and those workers would be notified separately.It's unclear why Tesla has temporarily changed the scheduling for the Cybertruck assembly line.Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment from BI.Factory workers on the Cybertruck line said their schedule had been inconsistent since late October. Four workers told BI that several times after arriving at work, they'd either been sent home or given additional training exercises or cleaning duties to fill their scheduled work hours.At least one worker expressed frustration with the schedule changes.\"When I started at Tesla you could expect to get overtime pay, now I feel lucky to get 40 hours,\" said the worker on the Cybertruck line, who'd been with the company for several years.When Tesla began deliveries of the Cybertruck last year, more than 2 million reservations were recorded in a tally, Electrek reported.There have been signs that demand for the product may have begun to wane. The carmaker shortened the shifts for workers on its Cybertruck production line in April, according to a memo viewed by BI at the time. Several reservation holders who were late to reserve the Cybertruck have reported receiving delivery of the vehicle — a sign that Tesla may be going through its reservation list faster than expected. After Tesla unveiled the pricing for the vehicle last year, several reservation holders told BI they didn't plan to order the vehicle.Do you work for Tesla or have a tip?
