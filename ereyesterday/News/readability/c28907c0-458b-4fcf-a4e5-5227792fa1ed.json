Not only was the incursion into Kursk a signature operation that boosted morale and embarrassed President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, but holding territory in Russia gave Ukraine a potential bargaining chip in any peace negotiations. Pulling out could weaken its bargaining position at a moment when President Trump is trying to force through settlement talks.Ukrainian forces first swept across the border last summer in an unexpected assault, overrunning unprepared Russian positions and securing a bridgehead of some 200 square miles around the Russian town of Sudzha, which sits about six miles from the border.It was the first time that a foreign army had crossed into Russian territory since World War II.Military analysts remain divided on whether the surprise decision to carry out an offensive into Russian territory served a useful purpose or was a strategic mistake.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
