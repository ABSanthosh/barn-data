The two men spoke for about half an hour just before a summit of Gulf leaders in Saudi Arabia, a White House official said.Mr. Trump told Mr. al-Shara that “he has a tremendous opportunity to do something historic in his country,” according to a summary of the meeting from the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt. The president also urged Mr. al-Shara to take steps to normalize Syria’s relations with Israel, which have long been hostile, and to tell “all foreign terrorists to leave” the country, the summary said.Mr. Trump met Mr. al-Shara at the invitation of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, who took part in the meeting.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, which backed the insurgency that brought Mr. al-Shara to power, joined by phone. Prince Mohammed and Mr. Erdogan had both urged Mr. Trump to lift the sanctions on Syria, and they praised the move in the meeting on Wednesday, with the crown prince describing it as “courageous,” according to the White House summary.ImagePresident Trump and members of his cabinet at a summit with Gulf leaders in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Wednesday.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesThank you for your patience while we verify access.
