  "text": "Israeli troops withdrew from the southern Lebanese town of Naqoura on Monday as U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein traveled to Beirut and chaired a meeting of the committee tasked with monitoring the ceasefire amid growing accusations from both sides of major violations of the deal.“The Israeli military started its withdrawal from Naqoura … and back into Israel proper today, south of the Blue Line,” Hochstein told reporters, referring to the U.N.-demarcated boundary between the two countries. “These withdrawals will continue until all Israeli forces are out of Lebanon completely, and as the Lebanese army continues to deploy into the south.”Israel did not immediately comment on the withdrawal.Israel Defense Forces troops did not advance into Naqoura until after the ceasefire came into effect, a Lebanese army official confirmed to The Washington Post. Lebanese state media reported IDF troops and tanks carrying out an incursion into Naqoura on Dec. 16.The withdrawal marked the third area that Israeli troops have withdrawn from, allowing the Lebanese army to deploy since the ceasefire came into effect on Nov. 27. The IDF is still holding positions in about 60 areas of Lebanon, with just three weeks remaining until the Jan. 26 deadline for it to have fully withdrawn from the country.Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has accused the IDF of “stalling” its withdrawal from southern Lebanon, while the IDF has said it is due to the Lebanese army not being ready to fully deploy.Since the ceasefire began, Israel has continued to launch airstrikes, carry out detonations and bulldozing operations on buildings across southern Lebanon on a daily basis, and advance into areas it did not reach during the fighting as it continues its operations to dismantle Hezbollah. While it says it is in line with and enforcing the agreement, Lebanese and Hezbollah officials have accused Israel of violating the deal hundreds of times.Here’s what else to knowTwo IDF soldiers were killed during fighting in the northern Gaza Strip on Monday, the Israeli military said. Two others were “severely injured” and evacuated for treatment.At least 49 people were killed and 75 injured by Israeli attacks in Gaza in the past 24 hours, the enclave’s Health Ministry said Monday morning. The IDF said it attacked a purported Hamas command center in the humanitarian zone of Khan Younis on Sunday.The U.S. Treasury announced Monday a six-month period during which restrictions would be lifted on some transactions in Syria. The order is meant to ensure that U.S. sanctions “do not impede essential services and continuity of governance functions across Syria” as the country rebuilds.At least 45,854 people have been killed in Gaza and 109,139 injured since the October 2023 Hamas attack, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, including more than 300 soldiers. It says 390 soldiers have been killed in its military operation in Gaza.Live coverage contributors 4Gunmen open fire on bus in West Bank, killing three IsraelisReturn to menuGunmen opened fire on a bus and surrounding vehicles in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Monday, killing three Israelis and wounding eight others, according to Israel’s military and emergency services.The Israel Defense Forces said it was “pursuing the terrorists” who carried out the attack near the Palestinian village of Funduq. Aliza Reiss, 73, and Rachel Cohen, 73, both residents of the Kedumim settlement in the northern West Bank, were killed, according to local officials. Elad Yaakov Winkelstein, 35, a police officer, was also slain, police said.It was not immediately clear who carried out Monday’s attack. The IDF has not named any suspects. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group based in Gaza, praised the attack as a “heroic response to the ongoing crimes and war of extermination committed by the occupation against our people” but did not claim responsibility.Defense Minister Israel Katz said he instructed the IDF to “act forcefully in every location to which the murderers’ tracks lead,” adding that “anyone who follows Hamas’s path in Gaza and enables or sponsors murder and harm against Jews will pay a heavy price.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to “reach the despicable murderers and hold them … accountable.”Violence has spiked in the West Bank since Israel declared war in Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack. At least 818 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or settlers in the West Bank since the Gaza war began, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. In the same period, Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank have killed at least 25 people, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has reported.Israeli and Palestinian media reported Monday evening that some Israeli settlers staged retaliatory raids in response to the shooting.This is an excerpt from a full story.Syria’s new foreign minister, on diplomatic tour, urges U.S. to lift sanctionsReturn to menuThe foreign minister of Syria’s new interim government, Asaad al-Shibani, reiterated on Sunday a plea of the rebels turned statesmen that the decade-long U.S. sanctions on the country be lifted, as an economically broken Syria tries to rebuild.Shibani’s comments to reporters came after he met with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in Doha, in his second foreign trip since rebels ousted Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad on Dec. 8.“These sanctions constitute a barrier and an obstacle to the rapid recovery and development of the Syrian people,” Shibani said in comments aired on Arab television networks. “We reiterate our calls for the United States to lift these sanctions, which have now become against the Syrian people rather than what they previously were: imposed sanctions on the Assad regime.”Shibani traveled to Saudi Arabia last week and was headed to the United Arab Emirates on Monday to present his government’s plans for the war-wracked country. Shibani is also expected to visit Jordan later this week.The flurry of regional diplomacy comes as preparations continue for a landmark national conference that is intended to bring together all parts of Syria’s disparate political, religious and ethnic spectrum. While no date has been set, it will be viewed as a key test as to how inclusive the new rebel leaders will be.Fair inclusion of all groups — from religious minorities to women and U.S.-backed Kurdish forces — are being presented to the new leaders as a key demand for unlocking international support. On a visit to Damascus on Friday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the European Union would condition the lifting of sanctions on the political process moving forward.Shibani told reporters in Doha that Syria would “enjoy very good relations with the region” in comparison to the Assad government.‘Chaos’ and ‘no hygiene equipment’ at Gaza hospitals, U.N. aid officer saysReturn to menuAid workers and humanitarian organizations continue to describe devastating conditions in the besieged Gaza Strip, sounding the alarm over chronic food shortages, deadly Israeli strikes and a nearly collapsed medical system in the north, where only one hospital remained functional as of this past week, according to U.N. officials.Louise Wateridge, a senior emergency officer for the U.N. agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), speaking to Britain’s Channel 4 News, recounted chaos and devastation she witnessed at Nasser Hospital after an Israeli strike on the humanitarian zone of al-Mawasi, stating that similar scenes unfold after nearly every such attack.“It’s chaos. There is blood on the floor, there is no hygiene equipment, doctors are trying to mop up the blood with water — there’s spreading infection,” she told Channel 4. “I’ve had a woman scream at me in absolute despair and horror because her son was killed in a strike in the so-called humanitarian zone, her daughter was lying on the bed next to her, paralyzed, and she’s screaming at us because she said, ‘The Israelis told us to move here because it was safe,’” she added.“In the next room, there’s a toddler who has lost two limbs with no parents, and this is just on repeat. This is what we see after every incident,” she said.About 7 percent of Gaza’s population has been killed or injured since the start of the conflict in October 2023, according to the United Nations. The World Health Organization has verified 654 attacks on health-care facilities, which have resulted in 886 deaths.Rik Peeperkorn, a doctor and WHO representative for the West Bank and Gaza, said late last week at a U.N. Security Council meeting that Gaza’s health sector was being “systematically dismantled and pushed to the breaking point,” warning that more than 12,000 people were on waiting lists to seek urgent medical treatment abroad and that only 16 out of 36 hospitals in the Strip remained partially functional.“Hospitals have become battlegrounds, rending them out of service and depriving those in need of lifesaving care,” he said.Middle East conflict The Israel-Gaza war has gone on for over a year, and tensions have spilled into the surrounding Middle East region.The war: On Oct. 7, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. We’re tracking how many hostages remain in Gaza. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.Cease-fire: Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah agreed to a cease-fire deal in November 2024, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities. Here’s what to know about the deal’s terms and how it will be enforced.Hezbollah: Hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, a militant organization backed by Iran, have escalated over the past year, leading to an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon. Israel’s airstrikes into Lebanon have grown more intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel’s founding.Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including President Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations’ cease-fire resolutions.Monitoring the status of hostages still in Gaza after Hamas’s attackAssad defends escape from Syria, blames ‘terrorist onslaught’ in first statementWar’s ebb in Lebanon leaves devastation and uncertain future",
