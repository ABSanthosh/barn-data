  "text": "The United States may see the first edition of 'steroid Olympics' as the controversial sporting event managed to pool double-digit million dollar from investors like Donald Trump Jr.According to a report by the New York Post, president of the Enhanced Games, Australian businessman Aron D’Souza said that the funding round has been closed. He, however declined to provide additional details on the fundraising.“Getting the Trump name behind the Enhanced Games was a monumental effort,” D’Souza told The Post.“This is now a very American project,” he added.The first edition of the Enhanced Games will include events like track, swimming, weight lifting, “combat” and gymnastics, and will likely take place later this year in a “warm” US city conducive to winter months, New York Post reported.D'Souza contends that the International Olympic Committee opposes the Enhanced Games due to concerns about competition.The event organisers will implement comprehensive medical assessments, including cardiac and brain imaging and heart rhythm monitoring, as stated on their website.\"The IOC has never had competition, and they're very threatened by that,\" D'Souza said, describing them as \"legacy incumbents that have a giant, multi-billion dollar, century-long monopoly.\"D'Souza anticipates better alignment with the Trump administration, particularly with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new Health and Human Services secretary, who acknowledges using testosterone replacement therapy.“We wouldn’t have hosted the games in the United States if Biden was elected,” he said.“Silicon Valley CEOs were by and large all Democrats until this election, and it was because of the Biden administration’s deep, deep antagonism towards innovation and technology,” he added.\"He's in his 70s and he's doing pull-ups and going to the gym every day in a way that Joe Biden never could,\" D'Souza remarked.The venture has attracted prominent investors, including crypto investor Balaji Srinivasan and German billionaire Angermayer, who specialises in biotech and psychedelics investments.Thiel, the PayPal and Palantir Technologies co-founder, is also involved. His previous notable involvement includes funding Hulk Hogan's successful lawsuit against Gawker, which D'Souza managed.D'Souza, who has invested significantly and admits to using performance enhancers, argues that alcohol poses greater risks, citing a 15-year-old study.He criticises the Olympics' association with what he considers harmful substances.\"The two drugs...are fast food and processed food, and those have done more damage to public health than any other substance in the totality of human history,\" he said Currently, only retired Australian Olympic swimmer James Magnussen has publicly expressed interest, following a $1.5 million offer to break the 50-metre freestyle record.\"If they put up $1m for the 50 freestyle world record, I will come on board as their first athlete,\" he stated on a sports podcast, adding, \"I'll juice to the gills and I'll break it in six months.\"",
