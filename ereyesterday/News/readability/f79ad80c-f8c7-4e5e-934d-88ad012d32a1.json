  "text": "Here are the latest developments.The Israeli government is not expected to vote on the cease-fire deal with Hamas until at least Friday, Israeli officials said, after last-minute disputes with Hamas and rifts over the agreement emerged inside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition.On Thursday night, Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s hard-line national security minister, threatened to resign and remove his party from the Israeli government if the cabinet voted to approve the provisional cease-fire deal. He offered to rejoin Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition should Israel resume its war against Hamas.“This deal would effectively erase the achievements of the war,” said Mr. Ben-Gvir, adding that the cease-fire would leave Hamas in power in Gaza.While Mr. Ben-Gvir’s threat could destabilize Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition at a critical time, it was unlikely to scuttle the cease-fire deal, which would also free hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners in Israel. Mr. Netanyahu would still command a majority of 62 seats in the 120-member Parliament.Opposition lawmakers have pledged to support Mr. Netanyahu’s push for a cease-fire if more hard-line allies leave the coalition. “This is more important than all the differences of opinion that there have ever been between us,” said Yair Lapid, the leader of the parliamentary opposition.Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said earlier on Thursday that he remained confident that the deal would go into effect as planned on Sunday. But it was still unclear when exactly the Israeli cabinet would meet.After President Biden and other mediators announced on Wednesday that Israeli and Hamas negotiators in Qatar had reached a cease-fire deal to stop the fighting and free hostages held in Gaza, the hitches on Thursday underscored the volatility of the truce and prompted fears of further delays.The Biden administration said that its team was continuing to work with Israeli officials and mediators to settle the remaining details.During a news conference in Washington on Thursday, Mr. Blinken called the cease-fire agreement “a moment for historic possibility for the region and well beyond.” Despite the late snags in the cease-fire agreement, Mr. Blinken added, “I am confident and I fully expect that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday.”Mediators hope the deal — which would begin with a 42-day truce and the release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners — will ultimately end the war that began with the Hamas-led attack in October 2023 in which 1,200 people in Israel were killed and 250 taken hostage. The subsequent Israeli military campaign has killed tens of thousands of Gazans and forced nearly the entire population of the enclave to flee their homes.Here’s what else to know:The first phase: The cease-fire deal would begin with an initial phase lasting six weeks. It would involve the release of 33 hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and allow the entry into Gaza of 600 trucks carrying humanitarian relief daily, according to a copy of the agreement obtained by The New York Times.Cautious hope: Many Gazans reacted with wary hope mixed with sadness, exhaustion and fear. “How can we ever rebuild?” asked Suzanne Abu Daqqa, who lives near the southern city of Khan Younis. “Where will we even begin?” In Israel, the joy and relief that families of hostages expressed has been matched with anxiety that many could be left behind.A diminished Hamas: The nearly uninterrupted fighting in Gaza has left the militant group severely battered, with many of its military commanders killed, including its longtime leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar.Angry about a potential cease-fire in Gaza, far-right protesters block roads in Israel.ImageProtesters disrupting traffic in Jerusalem on Thursday.Credit...Peter van Agtmael for The New York TimesImageProtestors using rocks to block roads in Jerusalem on Thursday.Credit...Peter van Agtmael for The New York TimesImageDemonstrators gathered with fake blood on their hands on Thursday during a protest of the cease-fire deal.Credit...Peter van Agtmael for The New York TimesHundreds of far-right demonstrators blocked roads in Jerusalem on Thursday in protest of the provisional cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas.The demonstrators were seeking to pressure the Israeli government to reject the agreement, which would begin with a 42-day truce and the release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Israel’s cabinet must still vote on the deal, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s hard-line national security minister, threatened to resign and remove his party from the Israeli government if the cabinet voted to approve the provisional cease-fire deal.The protesters said they supported freeing hostages, but they were worried that the agreement undermined Israel’s ability to remove Hamas from power in Gaza.ImageThe Israeli border police clearing protesters of the proposed cease-fire deal in Jerusalem on Thursday.Credit...Peter van Agtmael for The New York TimesImageDemonstrators blocked traffic in Jerusalem for hours on Thursday.Credit...Peter van Agtmael for The New York Times“I feel betrayed by the state of Israel,” said Efrat Ashkenazi-Hershkovitz, 50, whose brother died fighting in Gaza. “This deal will free people with blood on their hands,” she added, referring to the Palestinian prisoners expected to be released by Israel under the agreement.For hours, the demonstrators, some teenagers, disrupted traffic in Jerusalem. They threw rocks onto highways, and clashed with police officers attempting to clear them.In the evening, a few hundred demonstrators gathered at a central junction near the Israeli parliament, where they displayed an exhibition of cardboard coffins draped in Israeli flags.One demonstrator, Eliav Turjman, a rabbi from Yeruham, Israel, said the Hostages Families Forum — the lobby representing the families of the hostages that has pushed for a cease-fire and hostage release deal — “appealed to Israelis’ hearts instead of their reason, which would dictate that we should occupy Gaza and expel its residents.”In a message directed at Prime Minister Netanyahu, Yair Lapid, Israel’s opposition leader, said members of the opposition would block any attempt to take down the Israeli leader’s government so that a deal to free hostages can be carried out. “This is more important than all the differences of opinion that there have ever been between us,” he said in a statement.Itamar Ben-Gvir made the announcement in a news conference broadcast live, flanked by his party’s lawmakers. His Jewish Power party holds six seats in the 120-seat Parliament, and if the party resigns, as promised, it would reduce the government’s parliamentary majority from 68 to a razor-thin majority of 62. He said his party would offer to rejoin the government should it resume war against Hamas.ImageCredit...Ohad Zwigenberg/Associated PressItamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s far-right minister for national security, announced that his party would resign from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition should the cabinet approve the cease-fire deal. The move threatens to destabilize the government at a critical time but should not, in and of itself, prevent the Gaza deal from moving ahead.Blinken is shouted down over Gaza as he insists cease-fire deal is on track.Videotranscripttranscript‘Why Aren’t You in the Hague’: Blinken Heckled at News ConferenceU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was heckled as he delivered remarks about the Gaza cease-fire deal.“Finally, I just wanted to share this morning —” Off-camera: “Get your hands off me.

We’ll have an opportunity to take questions in a few minutes.” “What‘s the point of the May 31 statement to block the I.C.J. orders? You blocked the I.C.J. orders.” “Please, sir, respect the process. Thank you.” “Respect the process.

Criminal — why aren’t you in The Hague? Why aren’t you in The Hague? Why aren’t you in The Hague?”U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was heckled as he delivered remarks about the Gaza cease-fire deal.In a dramatic show of the anger over American support for Israel’s war in Gaza, a farewell news conference by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken was interrupted by two pro-Palestinian journalists who accused him of enabling “genocide.”One shouted, “Criminal! Why aren’t you in The Hague?” as security officers carried him from the State Department briefing room.Another reporter was ejected from the room at the start of a rare appearance there by Mr. Blinken, who had come to summarize his four-year tenure and take final questions from reporters.At the news conference, Mr. Blinken said that, despite reports of last-minute snags, he was “confident” that the cease-fire deal reached this week by Hamas and Israel would begin to be carried out on Sunday as planned.Mr. Blinken otherwise covered largely familiar subject matter as he fielded questions largely focused on criticism of the Biden administration’s continued supply of weapons to Israel as Palestinian casualties mounted, with Mr. Blinken noting that Hamas embedded itself among civilians. “Some people say we did too much to restrain Israel,” he said. “Others say we did too much to enable.”But the news conference was most memorable for the outbursts that punctured Mr. Blinken’s opening remarks, the likes of which, Aaron David Miller, a former longtime diplomat, said on X he had never seen.The man picked up from his seat and carried away by several security officers was Sam Husseini, who identifies himself online as “an independent journalist and writer who has been piercing through the establishment’s falsifications for 25 years” and is known for his confrontational questions at department briefings.The other reporter was Max Blumenthal, a prominent left-wing journalist and fierce critic of Israeli policies, who asked Mr. Blinken, “How does it feel to have your legacy be genocide?”Then, referring to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, he added, “You waved the white flag before Netanyahu!”Such invective is by now all too familiar to Mr. Blinken, who most recently was shouted down and called a war criminal by protesters during remarks he gave on Gaza at a Washington think tank this week. In each case Mr. Blinken was largely unfazed, and continued his remarks once calm had returned to the room.Israeli Border Police cleared protesters against the proposed cease-fire deal from a highway in Jerusalem on Thursday. ImageCredit...Peter van Agtmael for The New York TimesImageCredit...Peter van Agtmael for The New York TimesJohnatan ReissReporting from Tel AvivAryeh Deri, a senior member of the Israeli coalition, told a meeting of his ultra-Orthodox Shas party that he had been informed that the disagreements with Hamas over the cease-fire and hostage release deal had been resolved. He said that a formal announcement would be made soon. There was no immediate confirmation by other Israeli officials.Asked about perceptions that the Biden administration “gave Israel a pass” on violations of human rights law, Blinken says that the way Hamas embeds itself among civilians makes such determinations “incredibly complicated.” “We continue to assess it,” he said, adding,“if we have any conclusions that we can draw in the time that remains,” they will be announced.In an unusually chaotic moment at the State Department, two people were removed from a press room briefing after angrily shouting that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken was a “criminal” responsible for “genocide” in Gaza. Blinken, who was delivering summary remarks about his tenure, remained largely unfazed and said that he would soon be taking questions. It was initially unclear who the men were.Videotranscripttranscript‘Why Aren’t You in the Hague’: Blinken Heckled at News ConferenceU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was heckled as he delivered remarks about the Gaza cease-fire deal.“Finally, I just wanted to share this morning —” Off-camera: “Get your hands off me.

Blinken said there were two immediate imperatives: fully carrying out the cease-fire deal and finalizing a plan that provides for Gaza’s transitional governance, security and reconstruction and that ensures that the halt in fighting will endure.He added: “It’s going to take tremendous effort, political courage, compromise, to realize that possibility, to try to ensure the gains that have been achieved over the past 15 months at enormous, excruciating costs are actually enduring.”Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said at a news briefing this morning that he expected the cease-fire agreement to go into effect on Sunday. “As President Biden said yesterday, after more than 400 days of struggle, a day of success has arrived.”News AnalysisNetanyahu faces a political crisis over the Gaza cease-fire deal.ImagePrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at the district court in Tel Aviv in December. He is on trial on corruption charges amid the war in Gaza.Credit...Pool photo by Stoyan NenovThe Gaza cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas had yet to be ratified by Israel’s government on Thursday, but the battle over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s political future has already begun.Hours after the deal was announced, Mr. Netanyahu was facing an internal rebellion from far-right partners in his governing coalition on whose support he depends to remain in power.Itamar Ben-Gvir, the minister for national security, announced on Thursday night that his ultranationalist Jewish Power party would resign from Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition should the cabinet approve the cease-fire deal.The move threatened to destabilize the government at a critical time even though it would not, in and of itself, prevent the Gaza deal from moving ahead. A majority in the cabinet is in favor of the cease-fire agreement, and it is expected to be approved even without the votes of Jewish Power and another far-right party in the coalition, Religious Zionism. Led by Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, Religious Zionism also vehemently opposes the deal.Jewish Power holds six seats in the 120-seat Parliament, and if the party resigns, as promised, it would reduce the government’s parliamentary majority to a razor-thin majority of 62 from 68. Mr. Ben-Gvir said his party would offer to rejoin the government should it resume war against Hamas.Mr. Smotrich, whose party holds seven seats, has threatened to quit the government at a later stage if Mr. Netanyahu proceeds from the first phase of the cease-fire agreement, which calls for a six-week truce, to a permanent one.ImageProtesting against the proposed cease-fire deal in Jerusalem on Thursday.Credit...Peter van Agtmael for The New York TimesMr. Netanyahu may have a fateful choice to make in the politically precarious weeks ahead: maintain his parliamentary majority by resuming the fight against Hamas in Gaza or risk the collapse of the coalition halfway through its four-year term and gamble on an early election.After more than 15 months of devastating war, and with President-elect Donald J. Trump about to assume office on Monday, some analysts say that ending the conflict in Gaza is a better option for the Israeli leader.“Elections are about a story,” said Moshe Klughaft, an Israeli strategic adviser and international political campaign manager who has advised Mr. Netanyahu in the past, adding that, in the event of an election, Mr. Netanyahu’s next story will be one of “war and peace.”The first phase of the deal is expected to start on Sunday and last six weeks, during which Hamas is supposed to release 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and Israeli troops are supposed to redeploy east, away from populated areas of Gaza.If carried out, the second phase, over another six weeks, would see the rest of the hostages return home — some alive, some dead — and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.The hostages’ families have pleaded with Mr. Netanyahu to put politics aside and complete the cease-fire deal. Mr. Trump has made it clear that he wants the war, prompted by the Hamas-led terrorist assault on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, to end.The first Trump administration brokered the normalization of diplomatic ties between Israel and three Arab countries. Israelis are now eyeing the prospect of a grander bargain leading to formal ties with Saudi Arabia in Mr. Trump’s next term, an arrangement that would strengthen the regional axis against Israel’s archenemy, Iran.Mr. Klughaft, the strategist, said he believed there was “more chance that Mr. Netanyahu will choose Saudi Arabia and elections over Smotrich and continuing the war.”Mr. Ben-Gvir and Mr. Smotrich want the war in Gaza to go on until Hamas is eliminated. Their hope is for the Israeli military to rule in the Palestinian enclave to eventually pave the way for Jewish settlements there.Mr. Ben-Gvir has described the deal as an Israeli “surrender” to Hamas and called in a video statement for Mr. Smotrich to help him make up the numbers to thwart it by resigning together from the government. Neither has the power to bring down the government alone.ImageItamar Ben-Gvir, left, the minister for national security, in Jerusalem on Thursday. He has described the deal as an Israeli “surrender” to Hamas.Credit...Oren Ben Hakoon/ReutersMr. Ben-Gvir had already proved to be an unreliable and troublesome coalition partner. Demanding wage hikes for the police, he refused to support the government in passing a crucial piece of legislation last month, forcing Mr. Netanyahu to leave his hospital bed as he was recovering from prostate surgery and vote in the assembly to make sure the law passed.Mr. Netanyahu has held frequent and lengthy meetings with Mr. Smotrich in recent days to persuade him to remain in the coalition. After three hours of talks between Mr. Smotrich and his party’s lawmakers on Thursday, the party issued an ultimatum demanding a promise from Mr. Netanyahu that he would resume the war against Hamas immediately after the first six-week cease-fire as a condition for Mr. Smotrich’s staying in government.Mr. Netanyahu, meanwhile, held off convening the cabinet for a vote to ratify the deal, citing last-minute disputes with Hamas over the details.Mr. Netanyahu is battling corruption charges in a lengthy trial and risks facing a public reckoning once the war ends for the military and policy failures in the run-up to Hamas’s 2023 attack. Given the circumstances, some analysts believe that he will opt to scupper the second phase of the deal, if Hamas doesn’t do so first, to keep his coalition intact.“Netanyahu wants to stay in power,” said Gayil Talshir, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “It doesn’t make any sense for him to go to elections that he might not win. He wants another two years leading the government.”Mr. Netanyahu could yet reach understandings with Mr. Smotrich. Even if the finance minister joins Mr. Ben-Gvir in leaving the coalition, Mr. Netanyahu could, at least for a while, hang on as head a minority government. Opposition party leaders say they will provide Mr. Netanyahu with a political safety net for the sake of peace.In any event, the government is likely to survive until the end of the first phase of the deal, said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan research group in Jerusalem.But Mr. Netanyahu may have to decide between his parliamentary majority and his relationship with the incoming administration in Washington, with Mr. Trump and Saudi Arabia perhaps offering him the opportunity to burnish his legacy.“I think his mind is already in the next big move,” Mr. Plesner said of Mr. Netanyahu, adding, “If he has to choose between an intimate relationship with the Trump administration and Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, he’ll opt for Trump.”American and Israeli officials have said that the deal reached this week is very similar to the proposal that President Biden outlined last May.ImageIsraelis in Tel Aviv checking for news updates about the hostages on Thursday.Credit...Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York TimesCritics of Mr. Netanyahu’s government, including many of the families of 98 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza, have long accused the prime minister of sabotaging past efforts to reach a deal in order to preserve his coalition.Mr. Ben-Gvir seemingly confirmed those suspicions in his video statement this week, asserting that he and Mr. Smotrich had used their political leverage to thwart a similar deal “time after time” over the past year.Mr. Netanyahu and his loyalists have blamed Hamas for past failures to reach a deal.Many Israelis and hostage families say they support a deal that will bring all the hostages home. They include Rachel Goldberg-Polin and Jon Polin, the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a dual American-Israeli citizen whose name appeared in the original list of hostages to be freed in the first phase of a deal last year, but who was killed along with five other hostages last August by their captors in a tunnel in Gaza.“It is imperative that this process is completed, and all 98 hostages are returned to their families,” they wrote in a statement welcoming the deal on Thursday. “It is also time for the innocent civilians of Gaza to be relieved of the suffering they have endured.”Hamas officials did not respond to a request for comment on the specific Israeli claims that the deal was being held up by Hamas demands over the Egyptian border and prisoners release. Earlier on Thursday, a senior Hamas official said the group was still committed to the agreement.Among the last-minute disagreements are changes to how Israeli forces would deploy along Gaza’s border with Egypt during the truce, said Omer Dostri, the prime minister’s spokesman. Netanyahu has argued that control of the border zone is critical to stop the flow of weapons to Hamas. Hamas is also demanding the release of “certain terrorists” unacceptable to Israel, Dostri added.A cease-fire should mean more aid for Gaza, but getting it to people in need may still be hard.ImagePalestinians gathering to receive food aid in Deir al Balah in the central Gaza Strip on Thursday.Credit...Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesA cease-fire deal in Gaza would offer a chance to address some of the suffering of its population, aid workers said on Thursday, but they cautioned there is no guarantee that the opportunity will be translated into help for the hundreds of thousands of people in need.Civilians across much of Gaza face severe malnutrition, and in the territory’s north, conditions border on famine, according to the United Nations. Almost all of Gaza’s population of 2.2 million has been displaced from their homes, many to makeshift camps along a coastal strip, where clean water and bathrooms are scarce. The enclave’s health and education sectors, as well as its economy, have been decimated by Israeli airstrikes during 15 months of war.Many factors will need to come together to address the situation, but the most important is the restoration of security, in part so aid convoys can safely reach those who need help, the humanitarian officials said.“This is a moment of hope and opportunity,” said Tom Fletcher, the United Nations under secretary general for humanitarian affairs. Aid agencies have mobilized supplies in preparation for a cease-fire, he said. But he added: “We should be under no illusions how tough it will still be to get support to survivors. The stakes could not be higher.”The provisional deal between Israel and Hamas, which involves the release of 33 hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and allows the daily entry of 600 trucks carrying humanitarian aid, would make a start on the provision of relief.Before the conflict, around 500 trucks a day arrived in Gaza, largely through the main crossing at Kerem Shalom, consisting of both humanitarian aid and commercial supplies for sale. In recent months, the daily number has dwindled to less than one-fifth of that — a major factor in the hunger crisis.ImageTrucks carrying medical aid arriving at a warehouse in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on Monday.Credit...Bashar Taleb/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAlong with the free aid deliveries to help people in immediate need, it will be important to restart commercial deliveries of food, as well as diesel and cooking oil, to reanimate Gaza’s economy, according to Juliette Touma, director of communications for the main U.N. agency that provides aid to Palestinians, known as UNRWA.To enable more aid to get in, the inspection system that Israel has imposed will need to be relaxed and more crossings will have to be opened, according to Amande Bazerolle, the emergency coordinator in Gaza for the medical aid charity Doctors Without Borders.Scaling up the amount of food should also undercut the looting that has impeded aid deliveries in recent weeks, particularly if the expectation grows within Gaza that the increased supply will be sustained, she said. Looting has been a particular problem in Gaza as a consequence of the war — in one instance in November, armed and organized men stripped a convoy of around 100 trucks of its supplies.“If there is more aid entering, the impact of the looting will be reduced because the market value of the goods will go down,” Ms. Bazerolle said.The thefts reflect desperation for food, but also the security vacuum in Gaza caused by Israeli attacks on Hamas and the fact that no organization has been set up to replace the group as a governing force in the territory.In one sign of international readiness to start addressing some of the enclave’s needs, the U.N.’s World Food Program said on Thursday that it had 80,000 tons of food positioned outside Gaza or on its way in, enough to feed a million people.“The cease-fire brings hope, but we need unrestricted movement of humanitarian teams and supplies to reach those in need,” it said on social media.In another sign, the European Commission on Thursday announced a new aid package for Gaza worth 120 million euros, or around $123 million.The uncertainties include whether aid convoys will be able to travel from Kerem Shalom in south Gaza up roads to the north, where the needs are most acute. Aid workers say these convoys have been frequently blocked by the Israeli authorities at checkpoints within the enclave on security grounds. Some have also been hit by shells or gunfire.It is also unclear whether UNRWA will be able to play a central role in the recovery of Gaza given that Israel’s Parliament passed a law in October banning the agency from working in Israel or with its government. The legislation is set to come into effect later this month. Israel has argued that UNRWA aids Hamas, the militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and starting the war. The United Nations denies those accusations.UNRWA’s mandate comes from the U.N. General Assembly, and no other international agency is as well equipped with workers, trucks, warehouses and other facilities to deliver aid to Gaza at scale, according to aid experts.“Our priority must be to ease the tremendous suffering caused by this conflict,” António Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, told reporters at the United Nations on Wednesday. “It is imperative that this cease-fire removes the significant security and political obstacles to delivering aid across Gaza.”Hiba Yazbek contributed reporting.Omer Dostri, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said it was unlikely that members of the cabinet would convene on Thursday to approve the provisional cease-fire agreement, claiming Israel was waiting for Hamas to back off new demands. “There isn’t any agreement at the moment,” Dostri said in a text message. “Therefore, there’s no cabinet meeting.”In responses to Israel’s claims of new demands, Hamas has said it it was committed to the agreement announced by mediators on Wednesday. Even though negotiators for Israel and Hamas reached a provisional agreement, they have continued to discuss some details through mediators.The Israeli military said it struck approximately 50 targets across the Gaza Strip over the past day. It said it killed a Hamas militant who took part in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, and struck additional Hamas and Islamic Jihad targets. Gaza’s health ministry said earlier on Thursday that Israeli strikes in the territory had killed 81 people and injured nearly 200 others over the previous 24 hours. Gazan officials do not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths.VideoCreditCredit...AFPTVNatan OdenheimerReporting from JerusalemDozens of far-right Israeli demonstrators blocked a main highway in Jerusalem to protest the cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas.

That concern was underscored on Thursday by continued fighting, and a statement from the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel saying that several details in the agreement remained unresolved, holding up a vote by Israel’s cabinet on whether to formally ratify the deal.ImageMourning Palestinian journalist Ahmed Al-Shayah on Thursday after he was killed during an Israeli strike the night before in Khan Younis.Credit...Bashar Taleb/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“I wish I could say I am happy,” said Fadia Nassar, a 43-year-old from northern Gaza who has been displaced to the southern city of Khan Younis. The deal, she said, could “collapse for any reason.”“My heart is broken,” said Ms. Nassar, who like many in Gaza had lost her house. “I will probably stay in a tent; hundreds of thousands will end up in tents.”Suzanne Abu Daqqa, who lives in a suburb near Khan Younis, also said she had mixed feelings at the news of a cease-fire deal. She said she was thrilled at the prospect of an end to the fighting, which had left her and her family “constantly terrified of being bombed.”But she remained anxious and uncertain about the future after the war, which had leveled much of Gaza. “How can we ever rebuild?” she said. “Where will we even begin?”After hearing the news of the agreement, Aseel Mutier, 22, from Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, said, “Honestly, I feel numb.”She lost her 16-year-old brother during the war when he went out to buy supplies with their mother, she said, and her family was displaced eight times, repeatedly leaving and returning to their home. Last week, she said, an Israeli airstrike destroyed their house while they were sheltering at a relative’s home.“We are just waiting for Sunday,” the day the cease-fire is supposed to begin, Ms. Mutier said. “We don’t know what will happen between now and then.”On Wednesday night as the news of a prospective announcement began pouring in, Ghada al-Kurd, a 37-year-old from northern Gaza, said she would need time to absorb the scope of what had happened. “The feeling of sadness will surface because we have yet to fully comprehend what happened to us over the last 15 months,” she said.ImageDestroyed buildings in Khan Younis on Wednesday.Credit...Bashar Taleb/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMs. al-Kurd, who lost several family members during the war and was displaced repeatedly, said that she, like most Gazans, “did not yet have the opportunity to mourn our loved ones and relatives who were killed.” But, she said, “We also feel happy that we could finally return to the north, even if we’re returning to destroyed homes.”Nizar Hammad, 31, also lost his home in Gaza City and has been displaced eight times since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023. “It’s undoubtedly a good feeling to hear about the cease-fire,” he said, “but when I think about life after the war, I think about the suffering that will continue. The scale of destruction and loss is enormous.”He said there was no housing, no schools and no hospitals. “We need a moment to address the psychological trauma we’ve endured,” he said.Aaron Boxerman and Adam Rasgon contributed reporting from Jerusalem, Abu Bakr Bashir from London and Rawan Sheikh Ahmad from Haifa, Israel.The White House said U.S. officials were aware of the concerns raised by the Israeli government on Thursday and were working to overcome them. “We’re confident that we’ll be able to solve these last minute issues and get it moving,” John Kirby, the spokesman for the National Security Council, told NBC.Deadly strikes in Gaza continue despite the announcement of a cease-fire deal.ImagePalestinians on Thursday at Al Ahli Arab hospital carrying the bodies of people killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza City the night before.Credit...Omar Al-Qattaa/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesDespite the announcement of a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas, deadly strikes in Gaza have continued.Gaza’s health ministry said on Thursday morning that at least eight Israeli attacks in the territory had killed 81 people and injured nearly 200 others over the previous 24 hours.The Palestinian Civil Defense, an emergency service organization, said that Israeli strikes had killed at least 77 people since the deal was announced. The claims could not be independently verified.The Israeli military said in a statement on Thursday that it had struck about 50 targets across the Gaza Strip over the past day.The targets included militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, their compounds, weapons storage and manufacturing sites and launch and observation posts, the military said, adding that “numerous steps” were taken to prevent civilian harm before the strikes.“The reality in the strip remains very difficult and catastrophic,” said Mahmoud Basal, spokesman for the rescue and emergency service.Rawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting.Rawan Sheikh AhmadReporting from Haifa, IsraelThe World Food Program said it had 80,000 tons of food waiting outside Gaza or en route, enough to feed more than a million people. But it stressed the need for unrestricted access to allow humanitarian teams and supplies to reach those in need. Aid agencies have complained that Israeli restrictions on shipments into Gaza have prevented them from alleviating the suffering there.A delegation from the European mission that once monitored operations at the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza will come to Cairo next week to help implement the cease-fire agreement, the Egyptian government said in a statement. It said the delegation would work toward reopening the Gaza side of the crossing, which has been closed since Israel invaded the city of Rafah in Gaza last spring amid arguments over who should manage and secure the crossing.

Instead, it has been left to fight Israel almost entirely alone. Its allies have been decimated in Lebanon, toppled in Syria and weakened in Iran. The Houthis in Yemen have only managed to inflict occasional rocket and drone attacks, most of which Israel has intercepted.Despite its isolation, however, Hamas remains the dominant Palestinian power in Gaza even after 15 months of Israeli bombardment, holding sway in displacement camps and refusing to surrender. Although many Palestinians have criticized the group’s decision to carry out the October 2023 attack — unleashing a war that has killed tens of thousands of Gazans and reduced cities to rubble — it has faced relatively little popular unrest.Hamas has celebrated the provisional cease-fire agreement announced on Wednesday as an “accomplishment,” but its future role in Gaza remains uncertain.The deal calls for an eventual “cessation of military operations and hostilities permanently,” but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has repeatedly suggested that he will resume attacking Hamas after some hostages held by militants are released.Yet if the full, multistage agreement is carried out, it could allow Hamas to rebuild its ironclad control over Gaza, or at least allow it to maintain an influential role in the territory. Analysts connected to Hamas believe that Israel will struggle to resume the war in the face of international pressure, and that Hamas will play an important role in the future of Gaza.“Hamas will be present in every detail in Gaza,” said Ibrahim Madhoun, an analyst close to the militant group who is based in Turkey. “Trying to bypass Hamas will be like burying your head in the sand.”Mr. Madhoun acknowledged that Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, had suffered losses, but said it was still “standing on solid ground” and had recruited new people to replace those killed. Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, said this week that American officials had assessed that Hamas has brought in almost as many new fighters as it has lost in the war.ImageMembers of the Al-Qassam Brigades carry the body of the Hamas leader Saeed Ataallah Ali, who was killed along with his wife and their two daughters, Zainab and Fatima Saeed Ali, in Tripoli, Lebanon, in October.Credit...Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York TimesRearming will likely be more challenging for Hamas, which has used up many of its munitions and has no easy way to resupply stockpiles, especially given that its signature external supporters have been so severely weakened.But if Israel decides to return to war, it could continue to weaken the group, taking out its new commanders and targeting what remains of its government.Under such a scenario, Israel could find itself moving toward occupying Gaza, which may “cut off Hamas but antagonize everyone else in the public,” said Tamer Qarmout, a professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies.Some former Israeli security officials argued that the agreement leaves Hamas on stable footing regardless of whether Israel returns to the war.“Hamas earned a lot of points with this deal,” said Michael Milshtein, a former military intelligence analyst specializing in Palestinian affairs. “They got the two things that they’ve been demanding all along written into the agreement: the end of the fighting and an Israeli withdrawal.”And if Israel restarts the conflict, it will be entering “a war of attrition that has no light at the end of the tunnel,” Mr. Milshtein said. “Hamas is ready to drag Israel back into the mud of Gaza.”Still, Hamas will likely need to offer some compromises if it wants enough aid to rebuild Gaza to flow into the territory. Until now, Hamas leaders have expressed readiness to give up civilian governance in Gaza, but without dismantling its military wing — a dynamic that analysts have said would be similar to Hezbollah’s role in Lebanon before Israel battered it. “I think everyone, including Hamas, understands that solving the people’s problems requires Hamas to stay away from the forefront,” Mr. Qarmout said, adding that it needed to reach an agreement with the internationally accepted Palestinian Authority to share power. While Hamas supporters have conceded the October 2023 attack caused enormous suffering for Palestinians, they have refused to express regret about the assault that left 1,200 people dead, mainly civilians. They have highlighted how Israel’s ensuing bombardment of Gaza has revived worldwide interest in the Palestinian cause and dented Israel’s reputation.Saudi Arabia, which had been drawing close to sealing diplomatic ties with Israel before the war, has presented Palestinian statehood as a prerequisite for a deal.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, are wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court. And the state is accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice. Israel strongly denies both charges, but its international reputation has been tarnished like never before.“Before the war, no one was following what happened in Palestine,” said Fouad Khuffash, an analyst close to Hamas who is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. “Now, everybody is watching,” he added.In a speech on Wednesday, Khalil al-Hayya, Hamas’s top negotiator, called the October attack “a military accomplishment” that would remain “a source of pride for our people.”For many civilians, a future with both Israel and Hamas in the picture is bleak. “We’re talking about a people stuck between a state ready to act with total brutality and a group ready to provoke that state to act with brutality,” said Akram Atallah, a Palestinian columnist from Gaza.Patrick Kingsley and Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting to this article.Since the killing of Hamas’s longtime leader, his brother and others have stepped in.ImageA mural of the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Tehran, Iran, in October. He was killed by Israeli troops.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesThe younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who was killed by Israel in October, has emerged as a key commander in Gaza, where the Palestinian militant group has mounted a determined insurgency against the Israeli military’s 15-month-long campaign to uproot it.In order to secure a cease-fire agreement, Hamas negotiators in Doha, Qatar, had to obtain the consent of the group’s remaining military commanders inside Gaza, including the brother, Mohammed Sinwar. They are in hiding and eager to avoid the reach of Israeli intelligence, so communication between them and the negotiators has been slow.Mr. Sinwar, originally from the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, is believed to hold a major role in directing the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s armed wing, military analysts familiar with the group said.While officially the commander of Hamas’s Khan Younis brigade, Mr. Sinwar holds outsized stature because of his association with his older brother. Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s longtime leader, was one of the main masterminds of the attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that prompted the war in Gaza.The resulting Israeli military campaign has devastated the Gaza Strip. It has also greatly weakened Hamas’s fighting capabilities, killing thousands of fighters, eliminating key commanders and destroying parts of its underground warren of tunnels.Hamas has not formally replaced Yahya Sinwar since his death at the hands of Israeli troops in October, nor has it replaced Mohammad Deif, the Qassam Brigades leader whom Israel says it also killed last year. Instead, a council of Hamas leaders who live abroad now oversee the group’s affairs.Inside Gaza, no one commander has fully taken Mr. Deif’s place, said a Palestinian security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. Mr. Sinwar mostly commands fighters in the south, while working with other militant leaders, like Izz al-Din al-Haddad, who command the north, the official said.But despite the many blows it has taken, Hamas has nonetheless continued to fight, inflicting losses on Israeli soldiers. It has even managed to bring fresh fighters into its ranks, Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, said this week.“We assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost,” Mr. Blinken said in a speech the day before negotiators reached the cease-fire deal in Qatar. “That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war.”Rawan Sheikh AhmadReporting from Haifa, IsraelThe European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, described the cease-fire agreement as “the hope the region desperately needed.” But she added that the humanitarian situation in Gaza remained grim. She announced that Europe would provide $123 million in aid this year, along with in-kind aid such as food shipments, to support Gazans.Ramy Nasr, 44, a displaced Gazan who is sheltering with his wife and children in Gaza City, says he is eager to return to the city of Jabaliya after a cease-fire so he can bury his siblings and their families, who were killed in a strike in October. He says their bodies have been under the rubble since then. Six of his relatives were killed that day. Nasr, seen here with his family in a photo from November, is not sure if his house still stands, or if he will be able to dig out the bodies.Less than half the 250 hostages taken from Israel in 2023 remain in Gaza.ImageFamilies and supporters of Israeli hostages demonstrating outside the Israeli Parliament in Jerusalem on Tuesday.Credit...Ronen Zvulun/ReutersWhen Hamas led the Oct. 7, 2023, raids into Israel, killing about 1,200 people, about 250 people were taken into Gaza as hostages, including citizens of Israel, the United States, Britain, Mexico, Thailand and other countries.Among the captives were the bodies of 37 people killed in the attack, Israeli officials said. Now, about 100 hostages, living and dead, are still being held in the enclave, officials say.The cease-fire deal announced on Wednesday between Israel and Hamas would begin with an initial phase lasting six weeks, and involve the release of 33 hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The agreement requires Hamas to release three female hostages on Day 1, four more on Day 7 and 26 more over the next five weeks, according to a copy of the document obtained by The New York Times. The deal still has to be formally ratified by Israel’s cabinet.Here’s a closer look at the hostage situation in Gaza.How many hostages have already been released?Early in the war, Hamas released four hostages — two Israeli-American women, Judith Raanan, then 59, and her daughter, Natalie Raanan, then 17, and two Israeli women, Nurit Cooper, then 79, and Yocheved Lifshitz, then 85, citing humanitarian reasons. More than 100 hostages were freed in November 2023 during a staggered truce between Israel and Hamas. In exchange, about 240 Palestinians held in Israel were released.How many hostages have been rescued?Eight hostages have been freed in Israeli military operations, including one in the first month of the war, when the military rescued one soldier, Pvt. Ori Megidish, then 19, who had been abducted from her base.In February 2024, a military operation in the southern Gazan city of Rafah freed two hostages: Fernando Simon Marman, then 60, and Louis Har, then 70.ImageA photo released by the Israeli military showed two freed hostages, Fernando Simon Marman, right, and Louis Har, second from left, reuniting with their families in Israel in February last year.Credit...Israeli military, via Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIn June, the Israeli military freed four people kidnapped from the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023: Noa Argamani, then 26; Almog Meir Jan, then 22; Andrey Kozlov, then 27; and Shlomi Ziv, then 41. Ms. Argamani’s case received outsize attention after viral footage showed her being taken into Gaza on the back of a motorcycle as she cried out in desperation. About 100 Palestinians were killed during the operation, according to the Israeli authorities, but officials in Gaza put the death toll at more than 270, including 64 children. (Neither toll distinguished between civilians and combatants.)In August, the Israeli military rescued Farhan al-Qadi, then 52, a member of Israel’s Bedouin Arab minority, in an operation that killed at least 20 Gazans, local authorities said.How many hostages have died?Of the 250 hostages, about three dozen were presumed dead early in the war, according to the Israeli authorities.Some of their bodies have since been found in Gaza and repatriated, while other captives initially believed to be alive were subsequently declared killed.The discoveries have raised questions about the extent to which intense Israeli military operations targeting Hamas have also endangered the captives.The Israeli military has killed several hostages in error. In December 2023, the military said its soldiers had mistakenly shot and killed three hostages who fled their captors in Gaza: Yotam Haim, 28, and Alon Shamriz, 26, who were taken from Kibbutz Kfar Aza; and Samer Talalka, 24, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Am while at work.ImageThe Israeli military identified Alon Shamriz, Yotam Haim and Samer Talalka as the three hostages mistakenly killed by Israeli troops in Gaza in December 2023.Credit...Hostages and Missing Families Forum/via ReutersLast July, Israel’s military retrieved the bodies of five hostages — two soldiers and three civilians, ages 20 to 56. They were found in a tunnel shaft in southern Gaza.Israeli officials said the captives were killed during the October 2023 attack and their bodies taken as bargaining chips. The next month, Israeli forces said they had recovered the bodies of six hostages in a Gaza tunnel.In September, the Israeli military recovered the bodies of another six hostages, ages 23 to 40, who it said had been killed in captivity. Among them was Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an Israeli-American whose parents spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August.In March, the family of Itay Chen — a 19-year-old American born in Israel who was serving in the Israeli military — said it had learned he was killed on Oct. 7, 2023.In December, the family of Omer Neutra, 21, an Israeli-American serving in the Israeli military, said it had learned he, too, was killed that October. His parents spoke at the Republican National Convention in July.This month, the Israeli military said Youssef and Hamza Ziyadne were dead. Youssef Ziyadne, 53, was taken hostage from a kibbutz with three of his children, including his 23-year-old son Hamza and two teenagers, Bilal and Aisha, who were freed during the truce in November 2023. The family is part of Israel’s Bedouin Arab minority.How many hostages are Americans?Secretary of State Antony J.

The official, Izzat al-Rishq, said Hamas remained committed to the deal announced by mediators. The office of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said Israel would not convene its cabinet to vote on the cease-fire agreement for now, citing last-minute disputes with Hamas. The Palestinian group did not immediately comment.Netanyahu’s office said that Hamas had backed out of parts of the cease-fire deal, without saying what they were. It added that the cabinet would not meet to discuss the agreement until Israel had been notified that Hamas had accepted “all elements.”Negotiators continued to work on the final details of the agreement overnight, including the identities of which Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange for hostages in Gaza.Some of Netanyahu’s hard-line coalition allies have said they opposed the cease-fire, calling it an effective surrender to Hamas. If they left the government in protest, that could weaken Netanyahu’s grip on power.",
