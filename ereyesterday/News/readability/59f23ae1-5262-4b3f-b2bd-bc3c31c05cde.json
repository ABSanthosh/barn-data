  "text": "US President-elect Donald Trump has endorsed Jimmy Patronis, Florida’s former chief financial officer (CFO), to take over Matt Gaetz’s seat in Congress, as reported by the Independent. Gaetz stepped down after facing allegations of sexual misconduct and a federal investigation into sex trafficking. He also withdrew his bid to become Trump’s attorney general, calling the controversy a distraction.Endorsement of Jimmy PatronisTrump took to Truth Social to praise Jimmy Patronis as a “fourth-generation Floridian” and a dedicated ally to the MAGA movement.“Jimmy Patronis, chief financial officer for the Great State of Florida, has done a tremendous job as CFO, where he also serves as the State’s Fire Marshal, and as an important member of the Florida Cabinet. I hear that Jimmy is now considering launching a campaign for Congress in Florida's 1st Congressional District!” Trump wrote.“A fourth-generation Floridian from the beautiful Panhandle, and owner of an iconic seafood restaurant, Jimmy has been a wonderful friend to me, and to MAGA. As your next Congressman, Jimmy would work tirelessly alongside of me to Grow our Economy, Secure our Border, Stop Migrant Crime, Strengthen our Incredible Military/Vets, Restore American Energy DOMINANCE, and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment,” he added.“Should he decide to enter this Race, Jimmy Patronis has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, JIMMY, RUN!” Trump concluded, putting his full weight behind Patronis.In response, Patronis stepped down as CFO on Monday and declared his intention to run for Florida’s 1st district seat. On X (formerly Twitter), he said, “Put me to work, Mr. President. @realDonaldTrump I am here to serve.” Florida governor Ron DeSantis announced the dates for the special election to fill Gaetz’s seat. The primary is set for January 28, with the final election on April 1.Patronis, a Panama City-based restaurateur and Trump loyalist, has held public office since 2017. Earlier this year, he backed the “Freedom Fighters Fund,” a proposed bill aimed at aiding Floridians, including Trump, facing legal battles. The legislation, however, was shelved following opposition from DeSantis.Within hours of stepping down, Patronis announced his candidacy for Florida’s Congressional District 1, which covers parts of Escambia, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, and Walton counties.Why did Gaetz stepped down?Gaetz, 42, resigned earlier this month amid allegations of sexual misconduct and drug use, just as the House Ethics Committee was set to release a “highly damaging” report on its investigation. Although Gaetz denied the allegations, he described them as a “smear” and called the confirmation process for his attorney general nomination a “distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.”Despite his resignation, the Ethics Committee has not released its report, citing the conclusion of its investigation. Former Trump adviser John Bolton called Gaetz the “worst cabinet-level appointment in history.”Gaetz’s withdrawal paved the way for Trump to nominate Pam Bondi, a former Florida attorney general, as his pick for attorney general. Meanwhile, Gaetz has yet to announce his next career move.As Patronis steps into the political spotlight, he brings with him a reputation as a loyal Trump ally eager to carry forward the MAGA agenda.",
