  "text": "The Israeli military on Thursday claimed that the third body sent by Hamas was not that of Shiri Bibas, the mother of youngest Israeli hostages Ariel and Kfir.According to Times of Israel, the military informed that Ariel and Kfir Bibas were ”brutally murdered” by terrorists in November 2023, Ariel was 4-years-old and Kfir was 10-months-old when they were murdered.“This is a very serious violation by the Hamas terrorist organization, which is required by the agreement to return four dead hostages,” IDF said. “We demand that Hamas return Shiri home along with all of our hostages,” it added.According to IDF, while each casket bore the victim's photograph, Hamas had deliberately switched the names on the coffins containing Kfir and Ariel Bibas' remains. The adult victims' coffins were marked with October 7, 2023 - the date of their violent abduction by Hamas militants from their homes.The terror organisation displayed the four coffins on a stage, backed by an unsettling mural showing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with blood and fangs, alongside the victims' images and propaganda text.Thursday morning's handover ceremony featured propaganda posters and celebrations, contrary to the International Committee of the Red Cross's request for a respectful transfer. Two missiles were positioned near the coffins, bearing the text \"They were killed by USA bombs,\" New York Post. Hamas has agreed to release six living hostages on Saturday, exceeding the negotiated three, in exchange for expedited Gaza aid. Following Saturday's exchange, Hamas is expected to return four more bodies next week, completing phase one of the ceasefire agreement, which stipulated the release of 33 hostages. The first phase concludes on March 2, with subsequent phases aimed at securing the freedom of 59 remaining hostages and establishing a lasting peace agreement.",
