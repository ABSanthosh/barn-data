  "text": "Fourteen people were killed and about 750 injured in a massive explosion at a port in southern Iran on Saturday, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported. Iranian officials declared a public health emergency and warned of airborne toxic pollutants.The explosion rocked the Shahid Rajaee port in the southern city of Bandar Abbas. In video of the disaster published by the BBC, an enormous fiery plume can be seen erupting into a bigger, darker pillar of smoke.The cause of the explosion is not yet clear. President Masoud Pezeshkian described it as an “accident” and the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency said “recklessness in storing flammable material” had been discussed as a possibility. Authorities did not suggest terrorism or a military strike.Schools in the region are to be closed temporarily because of pollution from the explosion, and people have been asked not to leave their homes, according to state media. Local officials warned people to close their windows against the possible spread of “ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide.” They advised vulnerable people to wear masks.Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, expressed “deep regret and sympathy for the victims” and said he had ordered an investigation into the “accident.” In a statement on X, he said he dispatched Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni to the region.Pezeshkian called for all available resources to be mobilized to help those injured in the blast.The explosion happened against the backdrop of preliminary talks between the United States and Iran over Tehran’s nuclear program. The sides met for four hours in Oman on Saturday and described the talks as positive.Niha Masih contributed to this report.",
