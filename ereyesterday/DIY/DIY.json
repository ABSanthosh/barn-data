    "description": "Ray-Ban's partnership with Meta keeps getting smarter — literally. The latest Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses aren't just about looking cool — they're packing upgraded tech, including the Meta glasses v12 update, faster performance, and surprisingly solid battery life.

    "description": "For decades, Super Bowl ads have been used as a launching platform for new products, devices, and even technologies. In Super Bowl LIX, it took center stage in the exploding AI space. Until now, the tech crowd has ravenously ingested much of the most pertinent AI news. The innovators and early adopters are way ahead, but the Super Bowl creates a captive commercial-loving audience of 130 million normal people. With OpenAI, Meta, and Google all taking the opportunity to push artificial intelligence to the populace, they all took interest through very different approaches. Here's a look at the AI-driven Super Bowl ads that made waves, what they promised, and how audiences reacted. AI-powered Super Bowl ads: Who showed what?OpenAI: The Information AgeWhat it showed: The ad featured black-and-white visuals in constant motion, walking through humanity's many developments, from tools and fire all the way through to generative AI.
