    "description": "One of the coolest aesthetic features of iMessage is its animated message effects. If you're like many users, you might even have discovered them by accident, where wishing your friend a \"Happy Birthday!\" or congratulating them on a promotion unexpectedly flooded your screen with balloons or confetti. Apple's iMessage effects first appeared in iOS 10 and still work perfectly in the most current iOS, iPadOS, and macOS versions. While Apple has only formally mentioned a few code words and phrases that automatically trigger these effects, I've compiled a massive list of all the hidden triggers I could find through research and trial and error ‚Äî with over 50 languages included.

    "description": "Apple just released iOS 18.3, its latest software update for iPhone, on January 27 ‚Äî after 42 days of beta testing. While it's not as feature-packed as the previous updates for iOS 18.2 and iOS 18.1 were, there are still a few important changes you'll want to know about. Aside from the return of a critical Calculator feature, most of the changes in iOS 18.3 apply to iPhone models that support Apple Intelligence. Those would be the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and all iPhone 16 models. The new emoji from Unicode 16 are also missing from this update but are expected to arrive with iOS 18.4. Note: Many of these features and changes also apply to iPads running iPadOS 18.3 and Macs running macOS Sequoia 15.3.
