    "description": "Why are there no official Star Wars emoji in the Unicode Standard? We've got the Vulcan Salute from Star Trek, so where's the force choke hand gesture?! While you may never see Star Wars officially invade your emoji keyboard, there are ways to send Star Wars emoji and stickers to your friends in your favorite chat app. What are Star Wars emoji?First, before you start spamming your conversations with Baby Yoda and Darth Vader, know that none of these are official emoji.

And if you happen to be reading on May 4, may the 4th be with you. Seasoned denizens of the galaxy far, far away have been trading ASCII X‑wings since dial‑up. Today, iOS gives us far cleaner weapons: Disney‑licensed sticker packs, emoji‑like cutouts you can lift straight from Photos, and a few other sneaky Force tricks.
