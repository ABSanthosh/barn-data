    "description": "In an era where cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, knowing whether a website is secure is more important than ever. Apple has finally addressed a long-standing limitation in Safari for iPhone and iPad, allowing us to view SSL/TLS certificate details in iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 — something we could already do on macOS for over a decade. A long-awaited feature for Safari on iOS and iPadOSUntil now, Safari on iPhone and iPad lacked a way to inspect a website's security certificate beyond the simple lock icon in the address bar.

Even Safari on Mac has supported certificate lookup for over a decade. With iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4, Apple introduces a long-awaited feature that finally lets us see in-depth security details of a website's connection directly within Safari. This update is a significant step forward in improving transparency and...more",
