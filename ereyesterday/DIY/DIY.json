    "description": "Safari has a hidden feature for your iPhone that will change how you share, receive, and interact with links — and barely anyone knows about it. The feature works on the latest iOS software, as well as the latest iPadOS and macOS versions. Still, you won't find any information about it in Safari's app or settings, so it's pretty hidden if you haven't seen it by accident yet. What does it do? It lets you share a link to specific words or phrases on almost any webpage — automatically highlighting them when someone opens it. Whether you're quoting a source, pointing out a key section in a long article, or referencing something ultra-specific, Safari now supports a clever URL trick that makes it effortless.
