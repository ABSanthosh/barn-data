    "description": "If you started your ethical hacking journey with our recommended Raspberry Pi 3 B+ setup, it's time to consider upgrading your beginner's ethical hacking kit to the Raspberry Pi 5 for even better performance and capabilities. After a nearly four-year hiatus, Kody Kinzie returns as the host of Null Byte's popular YouTube channel, where he walks you through everything you need to get started with the Raspberry Pi 5. Compared to the Raspberry Pi 3 B+, the Raspberry Pi 5 gives you all of these upgrades: a 2.4 GHz quad-core processor that's three to four times faster, way more RAM (2 GB, 4 GB, 8 GB, or 16 GB), a faster microSD card slot, Bluetooth 5.0, gigabit ethernet with high-speed PoE+ support, a PCI Express slot for additional expansion, a UART header for serial communication, an on/off button, dual 4K display support at 60 Hz, a built-in real-time clock (RTC), and more.

Whether you're creating stickers from still images, emoji, Live Photos, or Genmoji, iOS, iPadOS, and macOS make it easy to customize your collection. But when it's time to clean things up and remove stickers that no longer fit your style, knowing how to manage and delete them efficiently is just as important. You can create stickers from almost anything — emoji, still subjects in regular images, animated objects from Live Photos, and even stickers sent to you by others. With Apple Intelligence in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia 15, you can now generate custom Genmoji stickers with generative AI. Plus, Memoji Stickers and third-party sticker packs add even more variety.
