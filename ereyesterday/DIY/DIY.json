    "link": "https://next.reality.news/news/next-gen-eye-tracking-breakthrough/",
    "description": "Picture this: Your AR glasses open apps just by looking at them. Your VR headset adjusts the image based on where your eyes focus. Your car knows when you're getting drowsy and nudges you awake. These aren't far-off fantasies — they're potential real-world uses of eye-tracking tech. And thanks to a new breakthrough at the University of Arizona, we may be a lot closer to all of it. Eye tracking is poised to become the next major interface between humans and machines. But for it to really work, it needs to be fast, accurate, and almost invisible. And as with any technology that tracks our behavior and biology, it also needs to be secure and privacy-conscious. That's where this new research comes in. Read: AR vs. VR: A Simple Guide to Augmented and Virtual Reality What you need to know about eye trackingToday's eye tracking tech is limited — most systems only measure around a dozen data points, which isn't enough for truly precise interaction in VR, AR, or driver-assist systems....more",

    "description": "How will the new tariffs impact VR and AR? In short, they'll likely make headsets more expensive, slow down production, and force some serious changes in how these devices are made and sold. What you need to know: VR and tariffsNew tariffs are already active — The US raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, and China responded with 84% tariffs on US goods. Most countries are affected, not just China. Headsets are about to get pricier — Components for VR/AR devices are heavily globalized, and tariffs will likely drive up production costs and retail prices. Mid-tier hardware is most at risk — Budget and premium devices may survive, but the $400–$800 segment could shrink or stall out. Yesterday, the US raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%. This morning, China hit back with an 84% tariff on US goods. But this isn't just a geopolitical chess match — these moves are aimed squarely at the electronics supply chain, and that includes nearly everything inside your favorite immersive...more",
