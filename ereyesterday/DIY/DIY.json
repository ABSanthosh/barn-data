    "description": "For decades, Super Bowl ads have been used as a launching platform for new products, devices, and even technologies. In Super Bowl LIX, it took center stage in the exploding AI space. Until now, the tech crowd has ravenously ingested much of the most pertinent AI news. The innovators and early adopters are way ahead, but the Super Bowl creates a captive commercial-loving audience of 130 million normal people.
