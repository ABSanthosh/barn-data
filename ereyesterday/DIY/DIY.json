    "description": "The iOS 18.5 update is now out for iPhones, landing on May 12 with a tidy bundle of convenience tweaks sprinkled across Apple's core apps and settings. It isn't a headline‑grabbing release like last time, but the update still shaves steps off everyday tasks, surfaces helpful info where you need it, and quietly prepares your device for what's coming next. Mail finally gets an in‑app switch for Contact Photos, so you can toggle avatars without diving into Settings, while Back Tap once again flashes a confirmation banner to let you know your double‑ or triple‑tap was recognized. A fresh Pride wallpaper joins the collection just in time for Pride Month, and the TV app's new \"Buy with iPhone\" option makes it easier to purchase movies or shows on third‑party streaming devices using Face ID. Apple has also reorganized its AppleCare \u0026 Warranty section and mirrored coverage details in the Apple Account pane, added carrier‑powered satellite tools for the...more",

    "description": "Lasagna, that layered, creamy baked pasta dish, is a lovely comfort food that's great for a crowd. But if you've ever made it, you know you're usually left with some leftover lasagna noodles. (Although that's always better than the frustration of running out of noodles while you're still making a traditional lasagna.) Still, what do you do when you're left with a bowlful of the wide ribbons? Guess what? There's no rule that you can only use lasagna noodles to make a layered pasta dish. Those frilly wide noodles are good in soups, salads, and almost any other pasta recipe you can dream up. All you need to do is slice them into the width and shape you wish, and you have a blank canvas to season and dress up any way you wish. I like to cook the lasagna noodles first before slicing them. Although the 'broken lasagna' pieces look rustically delicious, it's hard to cook the pasta correctly if you don't break it up into a uniform size.
