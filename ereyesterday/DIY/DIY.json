While some updates, like the new Scenes feature, are prominent, others are more subtle but just as powerful. This incredible app's versatile features work equally well on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

The updates cater to a wide range of users, from casual planners to professional teams working on large projects. Freeform's improvements also beautifully integrate with other Apple ecosystem features, including iCloud, Siri, and Apple Intelligence.
