    "description": "Editing out unwanted objects, people, and distractions from your photos just got a lot easier on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Before, you would have to use apps like Google Photos or Snapseed to erase background distractions or perform spot healing, but it's now a native feature in Apple's Photos app for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Apple's built-in distraction eraser in Photos — called Clean Up — first appeared on Oct. 28, 2024, with the release of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1. However, it only works on devices that support Apple Intelligence. For iPhone, that means the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, or any iPhone 16 series model. For iPad, it works on the iPad mini (A17 Pro) and any iPad model with an M1 chip or newer. Your Mac will also need an M1 chip or newer.

    "description": "Flagship earbuds like Apple's AirPods Pro, Sony's WF‑1000XM5, Jabra's Elite 10, and Soundcore's Liberty 4 Pro sound fantastic, but they come with equally premium price tags. Luckily, there are plenty of stellar alternatives that won't gut your wallet. Spend less than $100, and you can still land punchy audio, rock‑solid active noise canceling (ANC), and marathon battery life without feeling like you settled. Below, we start with our overall winner and count down to number five, covering specs, pros and cons, and the exclusive, standout features that separate each pair from the pack. Each model stands out for different strengths, so you can zero in on the perfect balance of price and performance without sacrificing the features that matter most to you.
