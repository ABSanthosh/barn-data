    "description": "You can lock practically any app on your iPhone or iPad behind biometric or passcode protection. And we're not talking about using any funky workarounds. There's now an official Apple way to protect sensitive apps and their data. It even safeguards your personal information, keeping it out of sight across the system. You can even hide apps, making it harder for others to know they're there. Almost any iPhone or iPad app can be locked behind Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode, and some of these lockable apps can also be hidden. To use this security feature, your iPhone or iPad needs to be running at least iOS 18 or iPadOS 18, respectively.

    "description": "Apple Notes may not have all the bells and whistles that a more powerful word processor like Apple Pages has, but this simple text editor has plenty of helpful features that make it more than just a basic note-taking app. One of these features gives you the ability to highlight text and change font colors, giving you another way to make important details stand out. To highlight text in your notes, your iPhone, iPad, or Mac needs to be running at least iOS 18, iPadOS 18, or macOS Sequoia 15, respectively. Highlighting in Notes is not yet compatible with the iCloud.com version of the app. That means you won't even be able to see highlighted notes on iCloud.com (so don't freak out if some of your highlights aren't appearing in the web app).
