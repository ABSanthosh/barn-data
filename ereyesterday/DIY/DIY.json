    "description": "Apple is expanding its Food topic in Apple News into a full-blown section with recipes, restaurant reviews, kitchen tips, and more with the upcoming iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 software updates. The new Food section will be exclusive to Apple News+ subscribers, but nonsubscribers can still view select stories and recipes. Apple News+ Food will hit the Apple News app on iPhone and iPad in April when the iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 updates are released to the public. Until then, you can test the new Food section as a beta user if you're comfortable running beta software on your devices. Apple News+ Food is currently unavailable on macOS Sequoia 15.4, and whether Apple intends to add it at a future date is unknown. To start, you'll find recipes from notable food publishers such as Allrecipes, Bon Appétit, Food \u0026 Wine, Good Food, Serious Eats, and EatingWell, and more will likely come in future updates.

    "description": "Apple's iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 have been out since September, but more features are coming, such as new emoji from Unicode 16, and you can test them after installing a beta build for iOS 18.4 or iPadOS 18.4. Apple Intelligence debuted on iOS and iPadOS 18.1 and expanded on iOS and iPadOS 18.2 and iOS and iPadOS 18.3, but iOS and iPadOS 18.4 will likely improve Apple Intelligence features even more. But there will also likely be new features and changes beyond Apple Intelligence you'll want to try out. The iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 betas were first available to registered developers on June 10 and to Apple Beta Software Program users on July 15. While stable iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 versions were released to everyone on Sept. 16, Apple continues beta testing 18.x versions. iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 were released on Oct. 28. iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2 were released on Dec. 11. iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 were released on Jan. 27. iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 are currently in testing.
