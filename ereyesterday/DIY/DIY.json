    "description": "Over time, your Android phone or tablet has likely connected to dozens of Wi-Fi networks — and it remembers every single one. Whether it's a hotspot at home, school, work, the gym, a coffee shop, a relative's apartment — or even from a friend's phone — each time you type in a Wi-Fi password, your Android device saves it for safekeeping and easy access later. The trouble comes when you want to actually see the password for one of the networks you've connected to before. Perhaps you want to connect a second device to a saved wireless access point, or maybe you're with a friend who wants to log in to the same hotspot. If you can't get the password from the source, you might think to check your Android phone or tablet for the credentials — but looking at the stored Wi-Fi network in your settings won't always show the password in plain text, depending on your device, Android version, and/or Android skin.

    "description": "Speech-to-text technology can be seen on your iPhone in various places, from the Dictation tool to Apple's new behind-the-scenes, auto-created transcripts for podcast episodes. Your iPhone also has some pretty impressive text-to-speech capabilities. With them, your iPhone can read webpages, documents, or whatever text is on the screen out loud to you — only some of these tools aren't easy to find. Sure, you can listen to free audio stories in Apple News or subscribe to hear audio versions of select News+ stories. And there are plenty of audiobooks available in the Books app. And you can use third-party apps to read pretty much anything that you need, likely at a price. Some apps even work in Messages, so you can dictate in your own language and spit text out in a different one. There's a shortcut that can even help you with that. You can also use the Translate app to speak entered or translated text. Don't Miss: Make Siri Say Whatever You Want Every Time You Connect Your iPhone to a...more",
