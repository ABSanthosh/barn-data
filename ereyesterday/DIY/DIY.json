    "description": "Editing out unwanted objects, people, and distractions from your photos just got a lot easier on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Before, you would have to use apps like Google Photos or Snapseed to erase background distractions or perform spot healing, but it's now a native feature in Apple's Photos app for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Apple's built-in distraction eraser in Photos — called Clean Up — is available on iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 and later, all released on Oct. 28.
