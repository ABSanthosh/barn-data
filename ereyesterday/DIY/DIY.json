With Apple's latest update, your recent searches appear front and center whenever you open a new tab or tap into the address bar. In iOS 18.4, Safari automatically shows a list of your recent search queries when you perform a query from an empty search field.

If someone else grabs your iPhone — even momentarily — they could see what you've been looking up in regular non-private browsing sessions. Thankfully, you can clear the list quickly or shut the feature off for good. This behavior shows up most clearly when you open a new tab to the start page and tap the address bar, but it's not limited to that.
