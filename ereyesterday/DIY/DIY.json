    "description": "There's an ongoing debate about whether or not it's safe or even desirable to rinse meat before cooking it. Many fall into the anti-rinsing camp, saying that it's not effective at dislodging bacteria, especially on poultry, as we've discussed before. Meanwhile, some argue that rinsing certain meats, like bacon, can rinse away excess surface salt and may reduce shrinkage — though evidence is strictly anecdotal. Washing meat with a gentle acid: a cultural practice, not a safety guaranteeIn many West Indian and Caribbean kitchens, it's a common practice to rinse chicken and fish with a mild acid like lemon, lime, or vinegar prior to cooking. For example, Haitian stewed chicken (poule en sauce) is prepared by washing the chicken with sour orange juice or vinegar before cooking.

    "description": "With Apple's Photos app, you no longer need a third-party tool on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to blur or pixelate faces in your photos, helping you safeguard identities when sharing online. Introduced in iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1, the Photos app has a built-in Clean Up tool that can remove and intelligently replace unwanted and distracting elements in photos, such as photobombers, imperfections, embarrassing objects, and other details you don't want anyone else to see. But it also has a hidden superpower: it can pixelate people's faces with a safety filter. Don't Miss: How to Remove Unwanted Objects, People, and Distractions in Photos on Your iPhone, iPad, or Mac To use the new safety filter in Photos, you'll need to be running the latest software, but you'll also need a device that supports Apple Intelligence — the backbone of the new privacy filter.
