My mom bought me a glass display case for the unicorns, but I remember it cost a pretty penny. But what if you could find a simple, affordable way to solve this dusty dilemma? This IKEA hack from @cozynar showcases how to turn the popular SANNAHED frame into a stylish display case. I love this idea because of its simplicity, low cost, and short tool list. All you need is a utility knife. If you’re new to DIY, this is a great starter project, and it’s versatile. The hacker uses it for their Sylvanian Families collection, but you could use it for any type of mini figures or collectibles. What You’ll Need One SANNAHED 9 ¾” x 9 ¾” frame Mat knife or utility knife Transform the SANNAHED Frame Into a Dust-Free Sylvanian Families Display 1. Take Apart the Frame Remove the back of the frame and the protective film from the front plastic. Take out the square insert, and remove the matting. You won’t need the matting for this project, so feel free to save it for another fun DIY creation. 2. Turn the Square Insert Into Shelves The primary focus of this hack is the square insert, which becomes the shelves for your figurines. Cut the insert into four pieces (a commenter suggests using a craft knife to cut at the corner seams). According to another, the insert pulls apart easily. 3. Set Up Your New SANNAHED Display Box Replace the plastic front. Then, slide one insert back into place on the interior side of the frame. The other pieces are for your shelves. You’ll likely only use two, depending on the size of your collectibles. Less Dusting? Yes, Please Personally, my husband and son both suffer from major dust allergies, so the less dust, the better. Plus, I hate dusting, so anytime I see a way to lighten my chore list, I get excited. If you have a small collection that you love to display, but you’re tired of the perpetual layer of dust, give this hack a try. To keep your figures upright as you replace the backing or you decide to hang the frame, use a little mounting putty. A small piece on the bottom of each one should help secure it to the shelf. Make It Your Own This hack has over 149,000 likes. I can see why. I mean, it’s not only a neat idea, but it’s quick and easy and a bargain. Since all you need to create one display case is one SANNAHED frame, the cost remains an affordable 9.99 plus tax. The other reason this DIY project is so well-received is because it’s a breeze to adapt it to your personal preferences. The SANNAHED comes in several colors, and it’s also available in a larger 19 ¾” x 19 ¾”. One commenter suggested adding an extra step, saying, “Hear me out: this but with a cute background and maybe some fake grass or fabric on the shelves.” Others quickly chimed in with their enthusiastic responses, recommending colorful backdrops, painting the shelves, and making themed surroundings for whatever you plan to display. Many people mentioned wanting to use this hack to create a special case for their LEGO minifigs. This was exactly what I first thought of when I saw it because my son has minifigs coming out of his ears. What would you use it for?
