And that's exactly what one of my favorite—and one of the best—private email and VPN providers is set to deliver to anyone using iOS. Proton Set to Lower Its Prices After Court Ruling Proton, developers of the excellent Proton Mail, Proton Pass, and Proton VPN, has revealed that it will drop its subscription prices for iOS users. It follows the outcome of an enormous court case involving Apple and Epic Games, in which Apple was meant to halt uncompetitive practices that allowed it to levy extra charges on subscribers. Andy Yen, founder and CEO of Proton, has noted that this is finally a chance for the company to cut costs for its subscribers, and could potentially drop prices by up to 30 percent—a huge win for the millions of iOS users worldwide. In addition, Yen noted that the Apple ruling could also have a major impact on inflation in the US. Proton told TechRadar that the price changes will come into force in the US only as there are different rules in place in the EU. Indeed, Proton \"implore the EU to follow suit and actually force Apple's hand.\" You Don't Have to Subscribe Through the App Store Here's the rub: you don't need to subscribe to Proton's privacy-focused apps through the App Store. It's always been much cheaper to head to Proton directly and subscribe, then sign into your respective Proton accounts. The biggest difference is that now, subscribing to Proton (and other subscription services) through the App Store won't cost any more than subscribing through the service website. It's a proper price match that, let's face it, should have always been the case. So, if you've been wondering about subscribing to Proton—now is your chance.",
