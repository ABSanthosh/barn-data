Whether it’s aging, injury, or a sudden change in mobility, life has a way of throwing curveballs that make everyday routines unexpectedly difficult. I’m currently helping my parents adapt their bathroom for better accessibility, and I’m reminded how even simple tasks, like stepping into a tub, can turn into daily hurdles. But here’s the twist: solutions don’t have to sacrifice style for safety. IKEA’s new BÄSINGEN series proves that thoughtful, inclusive design can look good and work hard. With six sleek, supportive products, they offer support in the bathroom and beyond. IKEA BÄSINGEN Line Equips Homes For Change One of the primary aims of the BÄSINGEN line is to help people maintain or regain their independence at home.  Wâtte Zijlstra, Product Design Developer, IKEA of Sweden AB, says, “There are many people who experience impactful and common circumstantial changes that can make something as simple as taking a shower challenging.” Unfortunately, the typical home isn’t equipped for these changes, so most people need to make adjustments. Zijlstra continues, “The starting point for BÄSINGEN was a clear need for specific product functions. Then, we widened our scope through design to ensure the products are for the many, as BÄSINGEN is created to support anyone in their daily life.’’ The items in the BÄSINGEN series feature multiple functions and a durable, sturdy design. The main focus was on delivering safety in the bathroom. However, once designers knew they were checking the safety boxes, they expanded on their ideas to make the BÄSINGEN appealing to a broader audience. Sure, you can get similar safety devices elsewhere, but IKEA also focused on aesthetics. After all, why shouldn’t your home look amazing and be safe at the same time? Every decision was made with careful intention to blend form and function together seamlessly. For example, the dark anthracite color is sophisticated and beautiful, but even it has a functional purpose — it makes the products more visible. “BÄSINGEN is designed to help customers create a comfortable experience. The products were created to bring great functionality together with a beautiful design, as they have a minimalistic expression that is rooted in our Scandinavian design tradition. BÄSINGEN should blend in regardless of your style and shouldn’t be something you need to put away or hide,” says Sarah Fager, Senior Designer, IKEA of Sweden AB. A Closer Look at the IKEA BÄSINGEN Products The BÄSINGEN line features two different step stools with rails, a toilet roll holder, a shower stool, a shower shelf, and a towel rail. The products offer safety and style, helping you navigate life’s hurdles, whether they’re temporary or permanent. 1. BÄSINGEN Shower Chair Photo Credit: BÄSINGEN Shower Chair | IKEA.com When it’s too hard or tiring to stand in the shower, the BÄSINGEN Shower Chair comes to the rescue. It features sturdy, steel construction and non-slip feet to keep it in place on wet floors. The armrests add extra support and make it much easier to stand and sit. The smart design also features holes in the seat so water doesn’t collect. 2. BÄSINGEN 2-Step Stool Photo Credit: BÄSINGEN 2-Step Stool | IKEA.com Struggling to reach items tucked away in high places? This BÄSINGEN Stepstool has two steps ready to take you to new heights. The easy-grip rail on the side offers support and doubles as a towel holder. Plus, it makes it easier to move the stool as needed. You can also mount the rail on the right or the left, adding adaptability. The steps have a non-slip surface, and non-skid feet keep the stool steady. The stool has a maximum load of 220 pounds. 3. BÄSINGEN Toilet Roll Holder Photo Credit: BÄSINGEN Toilet Roll Holder | IKEA.com The BÄSINGEN Toilet Roll Holder isn’t just for your toilet paper. It also gives you something to grab hold of when you’re getting on or off the toilet. (Make sure to secure it into a stud and use proper fasteners.) The rounded design means you won’t need to worry about painful pokes from sharp edges. I also love how there are hidden screws to maintain an elevated sense of style, and there’s a handy shelf on top. (Who doesn’t need a place for their phone when they’re taking care of business?) 4. BÄSINGEN Towel Rail Photo Credit: BÄSINGEN Towel Rail | IKEA.com A common add-on in a bathroom is a towel bar, but there’s nothing common about the BÄSINGEN Towel Rail. It blends an attractive look with tons of functionality. Not only does it hold your towels, but it also acts as an impromptu grab bar, giving you extra stability when installed properly. IKEA cautions to contact a professional if you’re unsure about installation, which should be made, “in accordance with valid local building and plumbing regulations.” 5. BÄSINGEN Step Stool With Handrail Photo Credit: BÄSINGEN Step Stool With Handrail | IKEA.com Finding it tricky to get in and out of the tub? Sometimes, all you need is a little boost and something that helps you stand your ground. That’s where the BÄSINGEN Step Stool shines. It has a max load of 220 pounds and a low step with a non-slip surface that gives you that little leg-up you need. Store your towel within easy reach on the handrail, which keeps you steady while the non-skid feet hold the stool in place. If you have a vanity that’s on legs, you can slide the slim step underneath when you’re not using it. It’s a great way to free up more floor space and have some extra room to maneuver.  Photo Credit: BÄSINGEN Step Stool With Handrail | IKEA.com 6. BÄSINGEN Shower Shelf Photo Credit: BÄSINGEN Shower Shelf | IKEA.com Pretty much everyone needs some storage in their shower. The BÄSINGEN Shower Shelf checks this box and gives you a comfortable, sturdy handle when you need extra stability. The shelf has holes to let water drain and features curved edges for safety (and they look good). As with the towel rail and toilet roll holder, make sure to install the shelf properly since it’s doubling as a support handle. Beyond the Bathroom Photo Credit: BÄSINGEN 2-Step Stool | IKEA.com Although the primary focus was designing products to provide safety in slippery, tight spaces, like bathrooms, the BÄSINGEN line looks good anywhere. 1. In the kitchen: Use the step stool to reach upper cabinets in the kitchen or make it easy for the kids to help with dishes. 2. At the entrance: Add the shower shelf by your front door to hold keys and for extra support as you remove muddy rain boots. 3. Resting spots: Place the shower chair anywhere you need a quick place to sit and rest. No matter what comes your way, these pieces provide a helping hand wherever you need it most.",
