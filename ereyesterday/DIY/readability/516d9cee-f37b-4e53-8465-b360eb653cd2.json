The bed looks like a cozy nook (which can be made even more relaxed by closing the curtains) with a built-in shelf that’s lined with the room’s wallpaper. We love the wavy details!Olive and her two sisters have a playroom, so Faye admits that their bedrooms are spaces to focus on the quieter parts of life, like reading, which happens to be one of Olive’s favorite things to do. “I’m totally in love with her custom bed, and she agrees, but her favorite spot is the cozy corner where we put her shelves and chair,” Faye shares. “She spends a lot of time reading there and snuggling with her kitties.”The bedroom proves that an amalgamation of vibrant patterns and colors doesn’t mean a room will feel overwhelming. It’s quite the opposite — it’s super cozy. To see more of their relaxing house, visit the full home tour on Apartment Therapy.",
