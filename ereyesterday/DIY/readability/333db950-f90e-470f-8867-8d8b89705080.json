This year, elevate your holiday season with a grown-up twist on the classic Advent calendar.While looking for Christmas countdown ideas, I came across these 3 brilliant Advent calendars by Magdalena Wöckinger, a talented interior designer and digital creator known as @menawox on Instagram. Her unique Advent calendars are a departure from the usual chocolate-filled treats, brightly-themed designs, bringing in a subtle, classy spin to the traditional Christmas countdown. 1. A Heartwarming Advent Calendar for Adults IKEA KOMPLEMENT Multi-use Hanger | Photo Credit: IKEA.com Using IKEA KOMPLEMENT multi-use hangers and VINTERFINT Christmas ornaments, Magdalena created a calendar that focuses on fostering connection and mindfulness during the festive period. “I created an Advent calendar using Christmas ornaments, filling each one with a loving message, a voucher, or a prompt for mindfulness during Advent,” Magdalena explains. This creative approach transforms the Advent experience from a daily treat into a moment of reflection and togetherness. Magdalena shares the how-to: “I inserted the wire ends of the ornament caps into the small paper rolls, and as soon as you remove the caps, the paper scroll is automatically pulled out.” Each ornament is then tied to the IKEA KOMPLEMENT hanger. You may need more than one hanger if you want an ornament for each day leading up to Christmas. The calendar not only serves its purpose during Advent but can also become part of the Christmas decorations. “You can either reattach the ornaments to the caps after opening them or hang them directly on the Christmas tree if it’s already up,” Magdalena suggests.

A Subtle Advent Calendar For The Minimalist IKEA LUSTIGT Wall Shelf | Photo Credit: IKEA.com While IKEA created this compact wall shelf for mini-figures, Magdalena re-imagined it as an enchanting tree-shaped Advent calendar. To create this piece, Magdalena assembled the LUSTIGT shelf and cleverly cut it into a tree shape. She then placed 24 small kraft paper boxes, each numbered with wooden digits to represent the days of Advent, on the shelves. The beauty of this Advent calendar lies in its simplicity and versatility. As Magdalena suggests, you can keep it minimalist with the natural look of the kraft paper boxes, or you can opt for a more vibrant approach by using colorful boxes or decorations to suit your personal style. Magdalena shares, “I love how simple this Advent calendar looks, but you could also make it super colorful if you wanted to.” 3. A Reusable Advent Calendar For The Organized One IKEA MOPPE mini chest of drawers | Photo Credit: IKEA.com “Currently, I use the small MOPPE drawers to sort all kinds of odds and ends, but that can be cleared out quickly,” Magdalena explains how last year’s Advent calendar served other purposes throughout the year. “I might just decorate and fill it a little differently this year,” she adds. Magdalena used two MOPPE mini-storage chests as the foundation. She stained the birch a deeper shade, giving the plain drawers a richer hue to fit the season. Magdalena then glued wooden numbers on the drawers, and some drawers with more than one number. After placing the chests on the mantel. Magdalena decorated the top of the MOPPE chests with an assortment of small decorations, such as miniature trees and houses. To add a touch of sparkle and warmth, she incorporated string lights, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Then the last step is simply to fill the drawers with small gifts and treats. As we eagerly await the arrival of Christmas, Magdalena’s Advent calendar hack offers a delightful way to mark each passing day. Whether you choose to fill the boxes with small treats, heartfelt messages, or tiny treasures, this calendar is sure to add a touch of magic to your holiday season.",
