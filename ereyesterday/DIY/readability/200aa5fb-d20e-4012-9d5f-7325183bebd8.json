While the clamp is handy for certain setups, what if you don’t want to attach it to your desk? Or your workspace just doesn’t have an edge to clamp onto? IKEA hacker Andrew felt that pain, and his research led him to a simple but seriously effective workaround: a DIY weighted stand for the TERTIAL lamp – a solid base that lets the lamp stand, wherever you want it. The Problem: Where’s My TERTIAL Lamp Stand? The IKEA TERTIAL lamp used to have a version with a standing base. But that version seems to have gone the way of the dodo. So what gives if you love the shape of the TERTIAL lamp but want it as a freestanding light for your craft corner, reading nook, or kitchen counter? Andrew found a way out. “I was disappointed that the weighted base was no longer available. I don’t really like the desk clamp, although it is quite functional.” “I lamented about this with a friend, who had several TERTIAL lamps with bases, and some newer ones without. Since I own a 3D printer, every problem must be solved with 3D printing, and this was no exception.” The Hack: TERTIAL Lamp with a 5kg Weight Plate Stand What You’ll Need: IKEA TERTIAL lamp 5kg weight plate (Check your local sporting goods store, or grab a secondhand one to save some coin) 3D printed base centre (Get it free from Thingiverse – credit to creator Petr Ptacek aka Fogl for sharing this clever design.) Rubber mallet Optional: EVA foam sheet, glue, candle wax Step-by-Step: Turning a Gym Weight into a Lamp Stand Photo Credit: Andrew E. 1. Print the base centre Head to Thingiverse and download the STL file. Fire up your 3D printer and print it out. It should fit snugly into the centre of your 5kg weight plate. If it’s too loose or tight, tweak the OpenSCAD source file and reprint. 2. Fit the base centre into the weight plate Use a rubber mallet to gently but firmly insert the 3D printed piece into the middle hole of the plate. It should feel very secure—no wobbles allowed. 3. Add grip (optional but recommended) Cut a circle of EVA foam and glue it underneath the weight plate. This stops it from sliding and saves your desk from scuffs. 4. Insert the TERTIAL peg Push the lamp’s base peg into the centre hole of your printed insert. If it feels tight, a little wax will help it slide in smoothly. 5. Ta-da! A standing TERTIAL lamp without a clamp You now have a fully mobile, totally freestanding lamp with zero damage to your furniture. Spray paint the weight to match your lamp. Give Your TERTIAL a Leg to Stand On Photo Credit: Andrew E. “I’m almost embarrassed to publish this hack as it’s extremely simple,” says Andrew. “However, someone designed (the 3D plug) and tested it, and I tried it and it worked. I’m very happy with it, so I decided to tell someone else.” Thanks, Andrew, for sharing the hack! Frankly, the best hacks are often the simplest ones. You can probably pull it off in under an hour (printing time aside), and the total cost is minimal (Andrew says it cost him pennies for filament) if you already have access to a printer. Plus, there’s something satisfying about reusing an old gym weight that’s been collecting dust. (Who knew it had such luminous potential?) If you don’t have one lying around, check out this one. If you’ve been frustrated by the clamp-only design of IKEA’s beloved task lamp, this weighted TERTIAL lamp base hack is your answer. It’s functional, stable, and dare we say … kinda cool-looking?
