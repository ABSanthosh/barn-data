  "text": "Most people glue their eyes to their TV or screen when watching a movie or TV show. But for me, having a second screen on-hand helps enrich the experience—and it's time you gave it a go. I Read Through the Plot Before Diving In (Sometimes) Many hate spoilers, especially as they ruin the suspense and thrill if you've patiently waited for a movie, season, or episode. However, I welcome them, as I get even more excited to see the action unfold before my eyes. This is also probably why I usually browse the internet for spoilers, background, and even the entire plot of the movie or show I'm about to watch. That way, I am prepared for what I'm about to see, completely understand what's happening, and can even dig deeper into the story. So, before starting a season or while trailers are playing in the cinema, I'll go through Wikipedia or even check out spoilers on Reddit to find more information on what I'm about to watch. Finding the Backstory of a Character Makes Me Understand Them Better Some shows and movies have complex characters with convoluted backstories. To help me understand their actions, I usually look for the backstory of a character I'm interested in. By reading canon biographies, Wikipedia pages, and even fan theories, I get to dive deep into the character's history, personality, and other traits. For example, I just rewatched the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, Dead Men Tell No Tales, and I wanted to know more about the film's main antagonist, Armando Salazar. The movie showed how Captain Jack Sparrow outsmarted him, but I wanted to know more. So, I hit pause, pulled out my phone, and searched for his information on the Pirates of the Caribbean Fandom Wiki page. From there, I discovered that pirates killed his family and that he quickly rose through the ranks after joining the Spanish Royal Navy. The page also shared personality and traits, where the actor portraying him said that Salazar was like a wounded bull, explaining his ruthlessness in the film. I Can Look Up References and Other Information While I'm pretty aware of pop culture, there are a few times when a film character casually drops a reference to another movie, a quote, or even a historical event. So, if a character mentions something unfamiliar, I sometimes research it on my phone to ensure I don't miss anything. This is especially useful when I watch niche shows like Billions. In one scene, one of the main characters was playing a card game called Netrunner. So, I researched online what that game was and found that it was a collectible card game set in the dystopian future and was designed by the same person who created the Magic: The Gathering cards. This tidbit of information introduced me to a new game and showed how much of a nerd that character was despite being the Chief Investment Officer of a multi-billion-dollar hedge fund. It was a major departure from their initial portrayal as a highly logical and calculating person (though it fits the description in other ways!). Going Through Previous Episode Summaries Helps Me Find Context Some people prefer binge-watching a TV series or film franchise. Unfortunately, I do not have that time, so I must limit myself to watching one episode per week or so. Because quite some time has passed since I last watched the show, I often need a refresher to ensure I do not get confused with what's happening in the episode I'm watching. But instead of watching the recap often shown at the start, I instead just look for info online. This is so much easier if I'm watching on Prime Video, as its AI recaps ensure I never miss a plot point. But even if I'm on Netflix, Apple TV, or Disney+, I go online and read through the summary of the previous movie or episode to avoid getting lost. Related 9 Secret Amazon Prime Video Features You May Have Missed Do you know everything that Amazon Prime Video offers? Perhaps not! Here are all the best features of Prime Video you shouldn't overlook. It Helps Me Find the Next Movie or Show to Catch After I finish a movie, I always check out some of its actors. For example, I just finished watching A Minecraft Movie, and the actor playing Natalie caught my eye—I knew I'd seen her before, but I couldn't place where. So, I went online and searched for the movie's cast and found that she was played by Emma Myers, who was also on the Netflix TV series Wednesday. Because of that, it's now on my list of TV shows to see, lined up after I finish Billions and The Pitt. Using my phone while watching my favorite shows and movies actually improves my viewing experience, as I learn more about the film, its characters, and its actors. However, I only do that when I'm watching alone. That way, I don't disturb anyone who may not be as interested or invested as I am. This is especially true in cinemas, where my phone's bright screen will distract the people around me.",
