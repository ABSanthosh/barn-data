By cleverly combining the ÖMSESIDIG and BASTUA lanterns, she added a charming and playful piece to her festive decor.The best thing about this DIY Snowman is its simplicity. As Patricia mentions, “This IKEA hack is super easy and fun to make, even the little ones in the house can participate.” While Frosty may not be at his peak popularity, a snowman — especially one that lights up — will always be a hit with the kids. I can’t imagine a better festive craft to get the little ones involved, leading up to Christmas. DIY Snowman Paper Lantern Hack Patricia begins her Snowman creation by using two paper lanterns from IKEA. The larger of the two, the ÖMSESIDIG has a wire frame that props up the lantern into its full, round shape. For the smaller BASTUA lantern, Patricia forgoes the included light and instead uses thin sticks to help the lantern maintain its spherical form. With the two lanterns now ready, she glues them together with hot glue, stacking the smaller lantern atop the larger one to create the Snowman’s body shape. Once that’s done, the fun begins. Dressing Up The Snowman To bring Frosty to life, Patricia added Christmas lights inside the lamps, allowing it to double as a light bulb when night falls. “I love how it turned out,” she exclaims. “I didn’t stick the hat, so we can turn the lights on and off whenever we want,” she explains.Dressing up the Snowman is an opportunity to get creative with materials easily found at home or in local markets. Patricia suggests, “To dress up the snowman you can use an old scarf. The eyes and nose are made of felt we found at bazaars.” She also glued on three large buttons down the center of the lantern, to add a classic Snowman detail to her creation.To finish her Snowman hack, Patricia wrapped a garland of greens, poinsettias, and pine cones around the base. How to Make a “Carrot” Nose To create a charming and recognizable facial feature for your Snowman, take a cue from the beloved character Olaf from the movie Frozen. Begin by cutting a triangular shape from a piece of orange felt, making sure the base of the triangle is wide enough to accommodate rolling.Roll the felt, starting from the base and working your way up to the point, forming a cone shape that resembles a carrot. Secure the seam of the cone with a small amount of glue to maintain its shape. Once the glue has dried, attach the felt carrot to the center of the Snowman’s head, creating a distinctive nose just like that of the lovable Olaf. The result is a delightful decoration that brings a smile to everyone’s face. As Patricia sums up, “As you can see, super simple.” Snowman Craft With Paper Lanterns While the ÖMSESIDIG and BASTUA lanterns from IKEA are no longer available, crafting this charming paper lantern Snowman is still possible with some substitutions. The REGOLIT, another paper lantern from IKEA, serves as an excellent alternative to the ÖMSESIDIG. With its generous 17″ diameter, the REGOLIT provides a sturdy and round base for the Snowman’s body.As for the head, we’ll need to explore options beyond IKEA. Fortunately, sellers on Amazon offer a variety of paper lanterns in various sizes that can work perfectly for this project. By sourcing a smaller, round paper lantern from Amazon or a similar retailer, we can create a well-proportioned head for our Snowman.So, do you want to build a snowman? Head to IKEA and pick up a few lanterns for this easy DIY snowman project.",
