From shopping recommendations and summarizing YouTube videos to planning your next trip, Gemini can be a great help with many of your daily tasks. 5 Add Images to Your Prompt While Google Gemini excels at answering text-based queries, sometimes words alone aren't enough to convey what you're looking for. If you're trying to identify an object, analyze a complex diagram, or find design inspiration, adding an image to your prompt can help provide valuable context and lead to a more precise and relevant response. You can add an image from your camera or gallery along with your query, and Gemini will analyze it to generate useful insights. For example, you can upload a picture of a product to identify it, share a photo of a math problem for step-by-step solutions, or submit an image of a product to receive shopping recommendations. 4 Ask About What’s on Your Screen With Gemini on Android, you can ask the AI assistant to check what’s on your screen and ask questions about it. For instance, if you're reading an article in Chrome, you can ask Gemini to summarize key points, provide additional context, or even verify facts. Gemini can also analyze images on your screen. So when viewing a photo, it can identify objects and landmarks instantly. This is much more convenient than using Google Lens, as Gemini provides direct answers and even allows you to ask follow-up questions. Further, if you’re watching a long YouTube video, you can ask Gemini to summarize it for you or even ask specific questions. This is great for quickly understanding lengthy content without having to watch the entire video. 3 Access Information From Your Google Apps One of Google Gemini's standout features is its seamless integration with Google Workspace apps. By enabling Gemini extensions, you can ask Gemini to retrieve information from apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, and more. This way, you can interact with your Google apps without opening them. Need a quick summary of your unread emails? Just ask Gemini. Want to know when your next meeting is? Gemini can check your calendar and provide the details instantly. You can even ask Gemini to proofread a Google Docs document or find information from your notes in Google Keep—all with a simple text prompt. If you’re into Google’s suite of apps, this feature alone is the reason to use Gemini over ChatGPT. 2 Use Gemini to Plan Your Next Trip Gemini's integration with Google apps extends beyond Workspace tools—it also works seamlessly with Google Maps, Google Hotels, and Google Flights, making travel planning effortless. To get started, you need to enable Google Flights, Google Hotels, and Google Maps toggles in the Gemini Extensions menu. Once activated, you can ask Gemini to find flight prices, check hotel availability, or determine the best route from the airport to your destination. If you’re exploring a new city, you can use its Google Maps integration to find the nearest restaurants, must-visit attractions, or scenic routes for a road trip. One major advantage of using Gemini for trip planning is that you can ask other related questions while doing all this. For example, you can check the weather at your destination and even get packing suggestions based on the forecast. 1 Talk With Gemini Gemini Live is one of the best AI chatbot voice modes that allows you to have natural, free-flowing conversations instead of typing your queries. All you have to do is tap the Live button in the Gemini app and start talking. You can then ask about a recent football game, get anniversary gift ideas, or even brainstorm creative projects—all without lifting a finger. It's almost like chatting with a helpful friend who always has the right answer. The best part? Gemini keeps the conversation going even in the background, so you can continue talking to it while using other apps. You can even lock your phone and continue talking without interruption, making it a truly hands-free and seamless experience. All in all, Gemini offers several useful features that can genuinely enhance your daily life. Plus, all these features are available for free—so why not make the most of them? Try these tools out and see how they can boost your productivity.",
