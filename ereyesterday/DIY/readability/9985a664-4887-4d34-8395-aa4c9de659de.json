  "text": "Computer Mouse Tips Sign in to your MUO account Danny Maiorca/MUO Quick Links Editing Photos and Videos Is Much Easier I Can Use My Mouse on Multiple Devices My Wireless Mouse Doesn't Make a Noise When I Use It The Wireless Mouse Feels More Comfortable in My Hands Are you tired of your computer trackpad not highlighting what you want, moving too fast, or not feeling too comfortable? Switching to a wireless mouse might be a good idea. I made that decision, and I'm never going back. 1 Editing Photos and Videos Is Much Easier I edit thousands of photos each month and delve into video editing, so my hands must be comfortable. However, my trackpad sometimes overdid important edits, such as using the Tone Curve tool in Lightroom, which significantly impacted the appearance of my visuals. Danny Maiorca/MUO The trackpad also felt uncomfortable during prolonged editing sessions, prompting me to look for an alternative. Buying a laptop stand exacerbated this, as editing with the trackpad became nearly impossible. Since switching to a wireless mouse, my hands have felt much better. 2 I Can Use My Mouse on Multiple Devices Besides using my iPad to access Lightroom for mobile, I also use my device for research (during which I like highlighting a lot). Using these tools with my touch screen is tedious. My wireless mouse easily connects to my MacBook and iPad via Bluetooth, meaning I can browse precisely how I want to. I do not miss accidentally highlighting too much or too little text on my tablet. Danny Maiorca/MUO Many wireless keyboards are also compatible across multiple operating systems. While I probably won't give up my MacBook for a Windows laptop, knowing that I can move my wireless mouse across is at least comforting. 3 My Wireless Mouse Doesn't Make a Noise When I Use It I was initially concerned that my wireless mouse would be noisier than a laptop's trackpad, but I've been pleasantly surprised. While I can slightly hear my mouse when moving it around on the mousepad, it's otherwise silent. In contrast, I can always hear my hand moving across my computer trackpad. It sounds like a hand gliding across metal, which can sometimes be distracting. While the trackpad's clicking sound is admittedly nice, I much prefer the sound of silence. 4 The Wireless Mouse Feels More Comfortable in My Hands My wrists often hurt after using my trackpad for extended periods, and I sometimes feel my hands burning a bit after resting them on the side of my computer. However, I don't have either of these problems with a wireless mouse. I love how the mouse naturally fits my hand shape. Moreover, the clickable buttons on the side are much better than right-clicking on a Mac and pressing the Control button. Danny Maiorca/MUO My wireless mouse also feels consistently good, regardless of whether my MacBook is on its laptop stand or desk. Conversely, the trackpad felt increasingly uncomfortable at an elevated level. Before buying my wireless mouse in 2024, I hadn't used a computer mouse of any kind for seven years. While I'm accustomed to scrolling on a Mac, I forgot how much easier it is to go up and down a webpage with a mouse. I'm happy I can now use the scroll wheel to navigate a website. Trackpads are ideal for jumping from top to bottom (and vice versa), but I always find them jumpy when scrolling slowly. This was despite customizing my Mac trackpad speed. Admittedly, it took me a while to learn how to quickly scroll and highlight when connected to my computer. This wasn't an issue on my iPad. Nonetheless, I'm still happier with my mouse now. 6 I Have Better Posture I've been writing online for almost 13 years, and in 2024, I realized that my old computer use had affected my posture. So, I bought a wireless mouse to see if I could fix these issues (or at least prevent them from occurring in the future). My suspicions so far have been proven right. Whereas I had to lean over to navigate on my trackpad, I generally sit up straighter when using my wireless mouse. I can also move my mouse the exact distance that feels comfortable from my body. After switching to a wireless mouse, I cannot see myself ever using a trackpad to navigate my computer again. The wireless mouse is better ergonomically, and scrolling is much easier. It's also nice that I can use it with my iPad.",

This was despite customizing my Mac trackpad speed.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAdmittedly, it took me a while to learn how to quickly scroll and highlight when connected to my computer.

Whereas I had to lean over to navigate on my trackpad, I generally sit up straighter when using my wireless mouse. I can also move my mouse the exact distance that feels comfortable from my body.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAfter switching to a wireless mouse, I cannot see myself ever using a trackpad to navigate my computer again.
