  "text": "Sign in to your MUO account Microsoft is finally closing one of the last remaining ways to skip creating an official Microsoft Account while setting up a new Windows 11 PC. However, there is still a way of replacing it—but it won't be long until Microsoft removes that, too. Microsoft Removes the Microsoft Account Creation Workaround Since Windows 11 version 22H2 launched in February 2023, Microsoft has forced users to create a Microsoft Account during setup. While many folks prefer a local account, which doesn't require an internet connection, Microsoft now insists that you create an online account to finish the installation. Of course, not everyone wants to use an online account with Windows 11, which is why there are several ways to install Windows 11 without an internet connection. However, now Microsoft is closing one of the most popular and easiest methods, which was to input the command \"bypassnro\" during installation. Inputting the command during the Windows setup process allowed you to skip the internet connection process, thus allowing the creation of a local account. However, a Windows 11 Insider Preview blog posted on March 28, 2025, revealed the company is removing this functionality once and for all. We’re removing the bypassnro.cmd script from the build to enhance security and user experience of Windows 11. This change ensures that all users exit setup with internet connectivity and a Microsoft Account. Once this Windows Insider build rolls out to the main Windows 11 version, the \"bypassnro\" workaround will be removed. There Are Still Microsoft Account Installation Workarounds (For Now) Now, don't despair. There is still a way to avoid the Microsoft Account creation process when setting up a new Windows 11 PC. Currently, you can reactivate the bypass by entering the following command during the installation process: reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\OOBE /v BypassNRO /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f shutdown /r /t 0 During installation, when you reach the Let's connect you to a network screen, press Shift + F10 to launch the Command Prompt and enter the command. You should be able to complete the installation without creating a Microsoft Account. Of course, there is no guarantee that Microsoft will allow this workaround to exist for long. Given its strong push toward stopping you from booting Windows 11 with a local account, it's likely this workaround will be removed before long. Furthermore, as the removal of the \"bypassnro\" bypass method is currently rolling out to the Windows Insider Preview build, it's not currently in the mainstream Windows 11 installation process. So, for now, you can still use it—at least, you can for the coming weeks.",

PC.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there is still a way of replacing it—but it won\u0026#39;t be long until Microsoft removes that, too.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"microsoft-removes-the-microsoft-account-creation-workaround\"\u003e\n                        Microsoft Removes the Microsoft Account Creation Workaround\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Windows 11 version 22H2 launched in February 2023, Microsoft has forced users to create a Microsoft Account during setup. While many folks prefer a local account, which doesn\u0026#39;t require an internet connection, Microsoft now insists that you create an online account to finish the installation.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, not everyone wants to use an online account with Windows 11, which is why there are several ways to \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-set-up-without-internet-connection/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einstall Windows 11 without an internet connection\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, now Microsoft is closing one of the most popular and easiest methods, which was to input the command \u0026#34;bypassnro\u0026#34; during installation. Inputting the command during the Windows setup process allowed you to skip the internet connection process, thus allowing the creation of a local account.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a \u003ca href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/03/28/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26200-5516-dev-channel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWindows 11 Insider Preview blog\u003c/a\u003e posted on March 28, 2025, revealed the company is removing this functionality once and for all.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n                        \n\u003cp\u003eWe’re removing the bypassnro.cmd script from the build to enhance security and user experience of Windows 11.

There is still a way to avoid the Microsoft Account creation process when setting up a new Windows 11 PC. Currently, you can reactivate the bypass by entering the following command during the installation process:\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n                        \n\u003cp\u003ereg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\OOBE /v BypassNRO /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f shutdown /r /t 0\u003c/p\u003e    \n            \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring installation, when you reach the \u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0026#39;s connect you to a network \u003c/strong\u003escreen, press \u003cstrong\u003eShift + F10\u003c/strong\u003e to launch the \u003cstrong\u003eCommand Prompt \u003c/strong\u003eand enter the command. You should be able to complete the installation without creating a Microsoft Account.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there is no guarantee that Microsoft will allow this workaround to exist for long. Given its strong push toward stopping you from booting Windows 11 with a local account, it\u0026#39;s likely this workaround will be removed before long.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, as the removal of the \u0026#34;bypassnro\u0026#34; bypass method is currently rolling out to the Windows Insider Preview build, it\u0026#39;s not currently in the mainstream Windows 11 installation process. So, for now, you can still use it—at least, you can for the coming weeks.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
