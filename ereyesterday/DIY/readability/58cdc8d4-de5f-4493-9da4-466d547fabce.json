But before you dust off that old, rusty grill from the depths of your storage, let us introduce you to the STRANDÖN Grill. It’s compact, cute, folds up neatly, and—dare we say—kind of adorable? And rumor has it, it’s on its way out. Yes, this summer-ready, charcoal-powered grill is on a “last chance to buy” situation in IKEA USA, at least the green version. (I spotted identical blue versions with “new” tags in other IKEA markets.) The IKEA STRANDÖN Portable Grill — BBQ anywhere IKEA STRANDÖN Grill | IKEA.com If you’re looking for a simple, easy-to-carry grill for summer cookouts, the STRANDÖN Grill is worth a look. It’s lightweight—just under 7 pounds—and folds up neatly, making it ideal for small outdoor spaces or taking along to the park, beach, or a friend’s backyard. Despite its compact size, the STRANDÖN has a 9.5-inch cooking surface, which is great for grilling a few burgers, hot dogs, or even some veggies or fish. The strategically placed vents ensure optimal airflow, resulting in higher temperatures and faster cooking times. Say hello to perfectly cooked burgers! The grill includes a wire stand to prevent direct contact with flammable surfaces. Plus, the design ensures that small food items won’t fall into the coals, reducing flare-ups and keeping your food intact. It’s built with stainless steel for durability, and the enamel-coated steel parts help make cleanup quicker and easier. Looks matter too, and this grill doesn’t disappoint. It comes in two understated but stylish colors—charcoal green and the new version in blue. 5-star Reviews for the STRANDÖN Grill And it’s not just us saying that. As one reviewer says, it’s the “best small grill we’ve ever used!” He praises the size (“small enough to be portable, big enough to cook for our family of 3”), build quality (“very solid, not overly heavy”), and ease of use, from setup to cooking and cleaning. He also notes it’s a great value for the quality, adding that other grills they tried were cheaper, but not nearly as usable. His only wish? A lid—though he’s found using a kitchen pot lid does the trick just fine. Another reviewer had plenty to say too: “I always hated having to fire up a large grill when I’m cooking just a couple of burgers. I love the size of this one, and the fact that it has its own storage container that fits neatly in my KOLBJÖRN cabinet outside.” They did note the price felt a bit high, but appreciated the convenience and smart design. Limited Stock Alert! The STRANDÖN Grill is part of IKEA’s limited edition series. Currently priced at $59.99 for the charcoal green, it’s an affordable addition to your summer essentials.
