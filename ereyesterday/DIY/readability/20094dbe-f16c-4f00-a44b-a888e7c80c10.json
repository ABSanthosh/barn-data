All you need now is a good website or app with all the guitar chords and lyrics to your favorite songs. 1 Ultimate Guitar Ultimate Guitar benefits from a huge community of guitarists who contribute chords and tabs to the website with over one million songs. You will also find several different versions of the songs to practice with, too. Search for songs using the track name or artist, or click the chord button in the search bar to search for particular chords. That way, if you're new to guitar, it's super easy to find songs you can already play by searching for the chords you already know. Users can rate the guitar chords and tabs out of five, making it clear which version is the best. Ultimate Guitar also offers a subscription for $39.99 per year, including access to guitar and music theory lessons, the ability to transpose songs to a different key, and the option to simplify more complex chords. Ultimate Guitar also allows users to post short videos, called Shots, on the app. You can look at the most popular recent guitar chords and tabs or browse the top 100 tabs of all time to start learning some classics. Opening a tab will show you the chords and their diagrams, as well as the song lyrics and where to play a chord in the song. When you're ready to play, click the Auto-scroll button at the bottom of the screen to start your jam session. Download: Ultimate Guitar: Chords and Tabs for iOS | Android (Free, subscription available) 2 AZ Chords AZChords is a fantastic and free website that offers thousands of popular songs with guitar chords. You can sort artists alphabetically, check out trending artists on the home page, and see the latest updates to song tabs for recent songs like I Love You, I'm Sorry by Gracie Abrams. When you click on a song, AZChords will display the lyrics and chords corresponding to a specific lyric or part of the song. You can click on the chord name highlighted in blue to look at where to place your fingers on the guitar, too. For example, the entry for APT. by Rosé and Bruno Mars includes the list of chords used next to the lyrics. At the bottom, the entry also includes notes about the strumming pattern, general chord progressions, and common mistakes people may encounter when playing this song! 3 Chordify Sometimes, you want to learn a particular song even if you don't know how it goes that well. Chordify is perfect for those situations. This website features a super clean interface with large chord diagrams that update as the song plays in real time. Hit the play button and grab your guitar. Chordify loads a YouTube video in the corner and starts playing the actual recording. The display in the center of the screen shows a square box for each bar and tells you when to change to the next chord. If anything, it's all a little bit too simple. There's no information about strumming patterns, and Chordify doesn't offer alternate chord fingerings, even if the song needs them. There are no lyrics, either, but it's a great place to get started. Also, if you sign up for a yearly subscription for $27, you can unlock tools to change the tempo, volume, and pitch of the song as you play along with it. Download: Chordify for iOS | Android (Free, subscription available) 4 Songsterr Songsterr provides an in-depth look at sheet music and chords for those proficient in reading music. With a premium subscription to Songsterr at $9.99 per month, you can unlock original audio that will play along with the sheet music, change the tempo, and even play back individual sections on a loop to keep practicing. This website syncs with a YouTube version of the song, so you can listen while you play along. You can even transpose the song to different keys for free. Clicking on a specific part of the song will also sync up with the YouTube video. This is helpful if you're stuck on a certain part of the song and want to practice. Songsterr is much more advanced than just the lyrics and chords in the above options, so it may take some getting used to if you're a music novice. If you want, find the best audio interface to record yourself with so you can review your performance afterward. Download: Songsterr for iOS | Android (Free, subscription available) 5 Chordie At Chordie, you can search for the song name, artist, lyrics, or chords you want to play. It doesn't have as big a catalog of free guitar chords as Ultimate Guitar, but Chordie presents chords and lyrics in a super clean interface. Chordie is built from another community of guitarists who contribute their time to uploading guitar chords and lyrics to different songs. What's nice about Chordie is there's only one version of each song, so you don't need to work through five bad versions first. When you open a song on Chordie, the chords you need are displayed in the top-right corner. You don't need to flip through a guitar book every time you forget how to play an F chord when you can just scroll back to the top of the page. Chordie also gives you simple tools to change the font size, transpose to a different key, adjust the chords based on your capo placement, and auto-scroll while you play along. The clean interface includes a tab section for important riffs, as well. 6 E-Chords The E-Chords home page features video lessons, new tabs, tutorials, and highlighted blogs. Search for songs, artists, or lyrics to find the free guitar chords you're looking for. You can then open them up onto a clean page with lots of useful tools running down the left side. There are video lessons available for free, too. You can customize how the songs look by choosing simplified chords, changing the color of links, and even clicking and dragging chords to where you want them beside the lyrics. Hover your mouse over a chord name above the lyrics to see how to play it. The verses and choruses are separated, making it easy to learn the structure of a song with just a quick glance. All the chords you need are listed at the bottom of the page as well, so spend a moment there to learn the song before you get started. There are great customization options, as well. You can use the tools on the left of the screen to set your scroll speed, change the font size, change the color, or simplify the chords to your liking. 7 YouTube YouTube is a classic for all great DIY, how-to, and other video-based learning endeavors. There are a multitude of video tutorials for popular songs. A quick YouTube search for a song will pull up a variety of different video tutorials. Some videos have accompanying chord charts, while others just have a person playing the guitar and showing you how to place your fingers on the guitar. YouTube is a great alternative resource to written guides because creators can demonstrate proper strum patterns, tempo, and other twists to make any given song sound more like the original. There are some great websites if you're looking to learn the basics of playing guitar through lessons, too. Download: YouTube for iOS | Android (Free, subscription available) You've got an entire world of popular songs to learn the guitar chords and lyrics for, and you can do it all for free. Whether you learn best by reading or watching, all of these websites and apps are great tools to have in your musical toolbox.",

What\u0026#39;s nice about Chordie is there\u0026#39;s only one version of each song, so you don\u0026#39;t need to work through five bad versions first.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhen you open a song on Chordie, the chords you need are displayed in the top-right corner.

The clean interface includes a tab section for important riffs, as well.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"e-chords\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e6 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n
