  "text": "Quick Links Chrome has been my go-to browser for years. While it comes packed with features, it still lacks some functionalities other browsers offer. To compensate, I often rely on third-party extensions, which pose potential risks. Here are some features I’d love to see natively integrated into Chrome. 1 Ad Blocker Google Chrome lacks a built-in ad blocker, and there's a clear reason for that—Google's business model heavily depends on advertising revenue, which reached $264 billion in 2024, according to Statista. A look at its ad revenue growth over the years makes it evident why Chrome, with its 66% market share, avoids adding an ad blocker—it would directly impact its core business. That said, the absence of a native ad-blocking feature doesn’t mean ads can't be blocked. Like many users, I rely on third-party ad-blocking extensions to get the job done. However, these extensions can pose privacy risks. A built-in ad blocker would eliminate the need for third-party solutions, but would Google willingly undercut its revenue stream? The chances are less likely. Browsers like Brave and Opera have built-in ad blockers, so it would be great to see Chrome follow suit. Related 2 A Built-In VPN Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have become vital for securing our internet connection, bypassing regional restrictions, and safeguarding data. Since Chrome doesn’t have a built-in VPN, I have to rely on third-party VPN services through extensions, which, like any extension, come with potential privacy risks. Also, these services often come with a paid subscription, which strains my finances. Justin Duino / How-To Geek Unlike an ad blocker, which could disrupt Google's revenue model, adding a VPN may not significantly impact revenue, although it could involve some infrastructure expenses. Google had previously offered a VPN service called \"VPN by Google One,\" but it was discontinued. Having a built-in VPN in Chrome would be a good addition. Browsers like Opera and Brave offer built-in VPNs. Brave’s VPN requires a paid subscription, whereas Opera’s VPN is available for free. 3 A Split-Screen Mode Split-screen mode allows you to divide your screen into multiple sections—two, three, or even four—and keep different apps in each. This can improve productivity, but Chrome doesn’t offer this feature natively. As a workaround, you can resize browser windows manually, use third-party extensions, or rely on Windows’ built-in Snap Layouts feature, which I often use. Michael Bizzaco / How-To Geek However, integrating this feature into the browser would make multitasking even smoother. Luckily, as reported by Android Police, Google is working on adding this functionality, so it’s one of my wishes that’s likely to come true soon. I’ll finally be able to take notes in Google Docs while browsing, compare documents, keep multiple web apps open side by side, and more. 4 A Better Reader Mode While Chrome offers a basic Reader Mode that removes distractions like ads and navigation bars, there’s room for improvement. Currently, it opens articles in a sidebar rather than an entire window, which can be distracting. Additionally, it doesn’t display images, making it harder to understand the content. If Chrome allows us to open Reader Mode in a separate window—similar to Opera—it can make focusing on the content much easier. Additionally, while Chrome offers some customization options, it could benefit from features like content highlighting, note-taking, and more personalization tools to improve the reading experience. Related How to Use Google Chrome's Hidden Reader Mode Google Chrome has a built-in reader mode, but it's not enabled by default. Here's how to get it. 5 Unit Conversion One challenge I often face when shopping online is manually changing the store’s default currency to see prices in my local currency—if the option is available. Similarly, when I need to convert measurements into different units, I have to leave the site and do it separately using an app or Google search. I was surprised that Opera offers a built-in feature that lets you convert measurements just by highlighting them. If Chrome introduces a similar feature, it can save us extra searches, making online shopping and research more convenient. This would be especially useful for students, professionals, and anyone who frequently works with different measurement systems. Integrating this feature into the Reader Mode could also make it easier to convert values without leaving the page. Related How to Use the Measurement Converter in Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook Don't waste time manually converting measurements in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Just enable the built-in Measurement Converter and you’re set. 6 A Crypto Wallet A crypto wallet allows us to store, send, and receive cryptocurrency. While Chrome is my default browser, I always keep the Brave browser installed on my device solely for its built-in crypto wallet. This eliminates the need for third-party extensions like MetaMask and Phantom, which have security risks. Jason Montoya / How-To Geek With crypto becoming more mainstream, I’d love to see Chrome introduce this feature. A wallet backed by Google could offer better protection against scams, allowing users to securely make payments and interact with blockchain-based apps. Plus, Google could let users sync wallet data across devices, making asset management even more convenient. Adding these features to Chrome would eliminate the need for workarounds like extensions or switching browsers. While some of the above additions may become a reality, others, like an ad blocker, might take time or never happen. Still, I hope Google continues to bring us the best features.",
