  "text": "ChatGPT Sign in to your MUO account Have you ever wanted to turn ChatGPT into a witty, opinionated, and poetic chatbot? Now you can. OpenAI is making it easier to give the chatbot a number of custom traits. A new UI for ChatGPT’s custom instructions menu is rolling out to ChatGPT.com and the Windows desktop app. It will arrive to the mobile and Mac desktop ChatGPT apps in the next few weeks. In the revamped menu, you can now customize what ChatGPT should call you and provide information about your profession. You can also select from traits ChatGPT should have. Those include chatty, witty, opinionated, straight shooting, Gen Z, and others. It’s also possible to describe exactly what you want from the chatbot, like “Use a formal and professional tone.” You can also provide additional information that ChatGPT should know about you. In the menu, the new UI says “Introduce yourself to get better, more personalized responses.” I was able to access the menu, and you can also choose what tools to use with GPT-4—Web Search, DALL-E, Code, and Canvas. A Better ChatGPT Experience ChatGPT continues to add additional features and customization options to improve the overall experience. Earlier this week, OpenAI started to roll out a feature allowing users to schedule reminders and to-dos directly from ChatGPT. You can set a one-time request or something that reoccurs. The new Tasks beta feature is now available to any level of subscriber. You can only have a maximum of 10 active tasks running at the same time. OpenAI is reportedly planning more powerful agents for ChatGPT this year. In December 2024, OpenAI added the video creator Sora, which allows you to create a video from just a chat prompt. While ChatGPT continues to get better, it surprisingly still stumbles over these simple questions.",
