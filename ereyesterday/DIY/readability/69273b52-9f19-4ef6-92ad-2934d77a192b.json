For example, our den doubles as a guest room thanks to a sofa bed, and my home office becomes a dining room courtesy of a convertible table. Another popular combo is a shared guest room and home office. A good home office needs storage, and a guest room needs, well, a bed. But a bed in an office? That’s one you don’t usually see. A sofa sleeper delivers a logical solution, and this hack’s creator (Algarve Interior Design Blending Beauty With Purpose) took it a step further. They created a wall full of built-ins using IKEA HEMNES bookcases and 3-drawer chests. A sleeper sofa in the center provides a comfy place to chat with clients by day and a cozy place for guests at night. It’s a tiny guest room that doubles as my office when there are no visitors. When clients come over, I simply pull the sofa out by an inch, and we can comfortably enjoy our tea together. It’s all HEMNES!” What You’ll Need 4 IKEA HEMNES bookcases (35 3/8” x 77 ½”) 2 IKEA HEMNES 3-drawer chests (42 ½” x 37 ¾”) 12-foot x 14 5/8” board ¾” to 1” thick Trim White acrylic Wood glue Clamps Sandpaper Basics – screw gun, drill, screws, saw, tape measure, pencil IKEA HEMNES Pieces Make A Sophisticated Home Office-Guest Room Combo 1. Assemble and Prep the HEMNES Units Photo Credit: Algarve Interior Design Blending Beauty With Purpose Put together the HEMNES bookcases and chests according to IKEA instructions. However, don’t put on the tops of the chests until step two. Leave the movable shelves out for the time being; you can place those once you’re done. The creator chose to leave the backs off the bookcases. You also need to cut off the legs so the bottoms of the bookcases are level. 2. Make the Base Photo Credit: Algarve Interior Design Blending Beauty With Purpose Position the chests where you want them on the wall, making sure you have the right placement. The edges of the outermost bookcases should be flush with the outside edges of the dressers. Trim the 12-foot board to rest across the chests, even with the edges. Make the necessary adjustments and paint the board to match the HEMNES units. This board supports the two central shelving units. She says, “When you’re lying on the sofa, it (the underside of the bookshelves) looks like a single, seamless piece of built-in furniture.” 3. Position the Bookcases Place the bookcases side-by-side across the base and join them together using wood glue and clamps, reinforcing with screws. Attach them to the base and make sure everything is secure. Use the appropriate hardware to attach the shelves and chests to the wall (IKEA usually includes anchor hardware with the product). (If you’re only using a board below the two center bookcases, trim out a notch on each chest to accommodate, and make sure the board is the same thickness as the dresser tops.) 4. Place Shelves and Add Trim After getting your built-ins in place, install the shelves as desired. Fill holes with white acrylic, and close gaps on the sides and top using white-painted trim. Stand back and marvel at your amazing accomplishment. Don’t Forget the Couch! (And Pay Attention to the Size) Photo Credit: Algarve Interior Design Blending Beauty With Purpose Of course, the whole point of this hack was to create a spot for guests in the home office. Therefore, a pull-out sofa bed was key. The creator said IKEA didn’t have enough of the right-size couch beds, so they found one on Amazon. But whatever sofa you choose, make sure you have a good idea of the size before you start building out your shelves. You aren’t locked into these specific dimensions, which is the whole point of a custom build, right? The Beauty of Custom DIYs HEMNES has narrower bookcases and chests available in a variety of configurations and sizes. You’ll also find matching accessories, cabinets, and doors to customize your setup even further. So, if you’re working with a smaller footprint or looking for a slightly different style, explore the range—you’re sure to find a combination that fits your space and sparks new office guest room ideas. Creating custom-looking built-ins from affordable IKEA pieces is one of the most popular hacks out there. Many DIYers turn to HEMNES and the classic BILLY bookcase to bring their guest room office combo ideas to life. It’s an easy way to get a high-end look without the designer price tag. What do you think? Could this setup work in your home?
