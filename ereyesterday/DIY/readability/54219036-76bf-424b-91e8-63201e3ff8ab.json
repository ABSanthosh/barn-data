  "text": "Sign in to your MUO account Meta is finally taking on OpenAI and ChatGPT—with the launch of a standalone Meta AI app. While Meta AI mirrors what's on offer from ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI chatbots, it does have a few handy tricks up its sleeve to help it stand out from the crowd. If you use Meta products, you've likely already interacted with its chatbot. After all, you can use Meta AI on Instagram and Facebook and chat with it on WhatsApp. Now, Meta has revealed that you can access Meta AI within a standalone app. Meta AI is powered by Llama 4, which is capable of more conversational and personalized responses, which Meta claims can \"help you solve problems, navigate your daily questions, and better understand the world around you.\" So, what exactly sets it apart from other AI chatbots? Well, like ChatGPT, you can ask Meta AI to remember things about you and tailor its responses based on these details. But that's only one part of it. Meta AI can also draw on information you've shared on Meta platforms over the years. For now, this feature is only available to users in the US and Canada, but it might expand to other regions soon. While the goal is to make your interactions with Meta AI feel more relevant and familiar, I can't help but wonder at what point AI products like these blur the lines between being helpful and just plain intrusive. If you can look past this, there are a few fun features to explore. I enjoyed the Discover tab, which showcases select prompts from other users. You can \"remix\" them to make something of your own and even like/comment under the posts. There's a social element to this, which feels a little different from what we've come to experience with other AI apps. Furthermore, if you live in the US, Canada, New Zealand, or Australia, you can start interacting with Meta AI via voice conversations alone. Meta claims that the technology that powers this experience is trained in conversational dialogue, making the back-and-forth feel more natural and fluid. Also interesting is that Meta's smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, are also receiving an upgrade as part of the standalone app rollout. On LinkedIn, Ray-Ban Meta Glasses Product Lead David Woodland explained that the glasses and app will receive deeper integrations, allowing the smart glasses to have better vision and analysis than before. I can't say I'm overly keen to try yet another chatbot, and I also find it quite unnerving that Meta AI can generate responses based on information I've shared on my profiles across different Meta platforms. But if those privacy issues don't faze you, and you genuinely enjoy using Meta products, Meta AI's standalone app might be worth trying out. This is the first version of Meta's standalone AI app, so some features have limited availability, and you may encounter occasional technical issues. However, your experience with the app will likely improve over time.",

OpenAI and ChatGPT—with the launch of a standalone Meta AI app. While Meta AI mirrors what\u0026#39;s on offer from ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI chatbots, it does have a few handy tricks up its sleeve to help it stand out from the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf you use Meta products, you\u0026#39;ve likely already interacted with its chatbot. After all, you can \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/meta-ai-instagram-facebook-should-you-use/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003euse Meta AI on Instagram and Facebook\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-chat-with-meta-ai-on-whatsapp/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echat with it on WhatsApp.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eNow, \u003ca href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/introducing-meta-ai-app-new-way-access-ai-assistant/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMeta has revealed\u003c/a\u003e that you can access Meta AI within a standalone app. \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/best-llama-4-ai-model-features/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMeta AI is powered by Llama 4\u003c/a\u003e, which is capable of more conversational and personalized responses, which Meta claims can \u0026#34;help you solve problems, navigate your daily questions, and better understand the world around you.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSo, what exactly sets it apart from other AI chatbots? Well, like ChatGPT, you can ask Meta AI to remember things about you and tailor its responses based on these details. But that\u0026#39;s only one part of it. Meta AI can also draw on information you\u0026#39;ve shared on Meta platforms over the years. For now, this feature is only available to users in the US and Canada, but it might expand to other regions soon.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhile the goal is to make your interactions with Meta AI feel more relevant and familiar, I can\u0026#39;t help but wonder at what point AI products like these blur the lines between being helpful and just plain intrusive.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you can look past this, there are a few fun features to explore. I enjoyed the Discover tab, which showcases select prompts from other users. You can \u0026#34;remix\u0026#34; them to make something of your own and even like/comment under the posts. There\u0026#39;s a social element to this, which feels a little different from what we\u0026#39;ve come to experience with other AI apps.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, if you live in the US, Canada, New Zealand, or Australia, you can start interacting with Meta AI via voice conversations alone. Meta claims that the technology that powers this experience is trained in conversational dialogue, making the back-and-forth feel more natural and fluid.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAlso interesting is that Meta\u0026#39;s smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, are also receiving an upgrade as part of the standalone app rollout. On \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7323031351308275712/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLinkedIn\u003c/a\u003e, Ray-Ban Meta Glasses Product Lead David Woodland explained that the glasses and app will receive deeper integrations, allowing the smart glasses to have better vision and analysis than before.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0026#39;t say I\u0026#39;m overly keen to try yet another chatbot, and I also find it quite unnerving that Meta AI can generate responses based on information I\u0026#39;ve shared on my profiles across different Meta platforms. But if those privacy issues don\u0026#39;t faze you, and you genuinely enjoy using Meta products, Meta AI\u0026#39;s standalone app might be worth trying out. This is the first version of Meta\u0026#39;s standalone AI app, so some features have limited availability, and you may encounter occasional technical issues. However, your experience with the app will likely improve over time.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                            \n    \n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
