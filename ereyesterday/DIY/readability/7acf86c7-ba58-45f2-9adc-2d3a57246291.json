  "text": "Skip to content Let’s think of the last time you sent data without wires. We’re not talking WiFi here, but plain optical signals. Free-space optical communication, or FSO, is an interesting and easy way to transmit signals through light beams. Forget expensive lasers or commercial-grade equipment; this video by [W1VLF] offers a simple and cheap entry point for anyone with a curiosity for DIY tech. Inspired by a video on weak signal sources for optical experiments, this project uses everyday components like a TV remote-control infrared LED and a photo diode. The goal is simply to establish optical communication across distances for under $10. Click through the break to see more… The heart of this setup is a basic pulse-width modulator driving the LED. Pair it with a photo diode for reception, and voilà—light beams become data carriers. Add a lens for focus, and you’ll instantly see the dramatic signal gain. LEDs from remote controls are surprisingly effective. For more precision, swap to narrow-beam LEDs or use filtered photo diodes to block ambient noise from sunlight or fluorescent lights. It’s delightfully simple yet endlessly tweakable. [W1VLF]’s advice: start small, but don’t stop there—enthusiasts have built entire FSO networks to link rural areas! If you’re intrigued, [W1VLF] has more videos to explore. Want to dig deeper into the history of optical communications?  We’ve got that!  Once you advance, share your tips and thoughts in the comments below to help others get set up.",
