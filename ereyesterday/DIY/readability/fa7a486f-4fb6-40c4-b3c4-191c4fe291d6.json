All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterArchitect and designer Sophia Boccard, who owns 35 Agave Co. with her husband, contractor Socrates Figueroa, has worked on several homes throughout Mexico, and often develops fond feelings about the spaces. However, one home in particular, Casa Viva in Mazatlán, Mexico, completely pulled at her heartstrings. The home was built in the 1920s, and the original kitchen was situated in the back of the house, though Sophia says it wasn’t a place to gather. “Termite-infested cabinets and decades of disrepair made it clear: This kitchen needed new life, and we felt the house was nudging us to relocate it to the front, where it would be the heart of the home,” she reflects. Sophia and Socrates chose a new location for the kitchen, which was closer to the back patio. However, the new space was cramped and closed in by several walls and doors. They wanted to open up the new space and use simple, clean elements to make it feel spacious and airy with “subtle Mexican flair,” Sophia says (like with the blue backsplash from Lux Mosaic). Although the kitchen’s new location had its quirks, Sophia knew the expansive window would drench the room in natural light. Plus, the plan to put the new sink in front of the window was perfect for people to look out onto the lush patio, tying together the interior and exterior spaces. Sophia and Socrates worked with professionals to create the new room, which included demolishing the old kitchen and installing fixtures and appliances in the new kitchen, rerouting the pipes and electricity, and installing the cabinets. They opted for a waterfall edge kitchen island and sealed concrete floors. The entire project took around three months to finish and cost around $25,000. “I absolutely love the openness,” Sophia explains. “My favorite feature is how the window area blends seamlessly into the kitchen layout — it’s like the outdoors have a permanent seat at the table.”After seeing the finished room, it’s no surprise that Sophia had second thoughts about selling the home. “I never actually lived in it, but I fell in love with the house during the renovation process,” Sophia says. “After pouring so much of my blood, sweat, and tears into it, I regretted selling it. The connection was real.”“What makes this kitchen stand out is its simplicity. People often expect bold, bright colors in Mexican homes, but we opted for a design that proves less is more,” Sophia explains. “The natural wood tones paired with a beautiful blue backsplash bring depth and warmth, breaking away from the typical Talavera tile look.” If you want to see another makeover the couple worked on in Mexico, check out the mint cabinets that revived this “closed-in” kitchen.",
