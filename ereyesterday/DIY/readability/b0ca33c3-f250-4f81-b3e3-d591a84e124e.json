All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: New Africa/ShutterstockThere are certain thrills that come with being a DIYer. There’s the excitement of planning a new project, thinking of all the fresh ways to bring style to a space. There’s the satisfaction of pulling up painter’s tape to reveal a perfectly crisp line. And there’s the happiness that comes from knowing that you pulled it all off yourself — with, you know, plenty of bumps along the way. But what about the thrill of the hunt? DIYers are experts at scoring a good deal, from sifting through secondhand shops to turning IKEA basics into spectacular dupes. “The beauty of DIY projects is that you’re saving because you’re not paying for labor,” says designer and DIYer Galey Alix. “Secondly, if you find something secondhand, or even build it from scratch, you now have another layer of savings. The challenging part is figuring out when to buy brand-new and when to purchase secondhand.”Part of maximizing your budget is determining when to spend versus save. And while this give-and-take may fluctuate depending on your specific goals, there are a few materials that will consistently keep money in your pocket while underscoring your covetable style. Below, six experienced DIYers share the seven items they’d never buy new, and where you have the best luck at sourcing them. Ornate Picture FramesWell-crafted picture frames are a staple of a cozy aesthetic, but buying them new —especially if you’re looking for timeless flourishes — can be expensive. That’s why YouTuber and designer Alexandra Gater recommends thrifting picture frames.“I’ve found so many incredible picture frames at thrift stores, which add so much character,” she says. “I love the idea of these frames hanging on century-old plaster walls, bearing the weight of countless secrets. I recommend popping a modern art piece into a gilded, ornate frame. Your gallery wall will instantly look sophisticated!”Coffee-Table BooksOversized books are a cornerstone of coffee-table vignettes, but untouched ones don’t come cheap. “Most of these books run anywhere from $20 to $150 when first purchased,” Alix says. To stretch her budget, Alix goes to thrift stores to search for titles, but you could likely do the same thing at garage and estate sales. They may not be fresh off the presses, but they usually set her back about $5 a piece instead. “What’s even better is that because most people don’t read through coffee-table books the way they do novels, these are often untouched and in perfect condition,” she adds. “If the book cover has worn edges, I just remove the outside cover and use the hard cover, and it still looks great.”Credit: Heather ShilanCandlesBrand-new candles can be a common impulse buy, particularly if you’re cruising aisles seasonally, but don’t be tempted! Influencer and DIYer Christina Clericuzio says plenty of candles are up for grabs at thrift shops, and you can do a lot of different projects with the wax.“I’ll take them home, melt them down, and mold them into different shapes,” she notes. “I’ve also melted them down and put them into thrifted glassware, too!” Mental note: Scan the glassware shelves before checking out. Credit: Ingrid Balabanova/ShutterstockDishware and FlatwareIf hosting more dinner parties is in your plans, or you simply want to create a gallery wall of dishware in your dining area, then don’t head to the nearest box store. “It is so easy to find great dishware sets secondhand, especially fine china,” says DIYer Renee Bruner. “They’re often rarely used, in great condition, made from high-quality materials, and offered at a steep discount. Same goes for flatware. I dreamed of having solid brass flatware for my kitchen, but buying new would have cost me hundreds for a full set. I found a 33-piece vintage set on eBay for just $58.” Another place to look? Estate sales. Wood Furniture You might be swayed by the idea of white-glove delivery service for a brand-new wood furnishing to enter your home, but DIYer Drew Scott of Lone Fox says your money is better spent on a like-minded vintage option (and friends or movers can help put it into place). “If you have $350 to spend on a dining table, you’ll almost always get a higher-quality, better-made, and more solid table by choosing vintage,” he says. “At that price point, a new table will likely be made of particle board or some form of fake wood. Plus, I love the patina of worn wood!” Scott recommends looking through Facebook Marketplace, antique stores, and flea markets for the best finds. Light Fixtures Sure, you can find countless light fixtures without breaking the bank. But for DIYer Imani Keal, that’s not entirely the point — displaying her unique style is.  “’I’ve had so many great vintage light fixtures, I might not ever buy a brand-new one again. After a recent trip to Copenhagen, I brought back four light fixtures and a lamp, which thanks to the help from a local electrician, I was able to install in my apartment,” she says. “Not only are these so beautiful and fun, I got all of them for under $600, including shipping.” Keal notes that going this route does involve hiring a pro, but you don’t have to travel far to find the fixture. Antique shops will likely be your best bet, but you never know what you might uncover at a thrift shop or garage sale.",
