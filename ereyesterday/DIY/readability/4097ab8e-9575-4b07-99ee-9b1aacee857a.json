All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterYou’ve probably heard the term “landlord special” — aka when a building owner gives everything a (not always neatly applied) coat of neutral or white paint before a new tenant moves in. It’s an apt descriptor for Lowe Saddler’s kitchen when she first moved into her apartment.“Every single thing had been spray painted white — and I do mean everything,” Lowe says. This includes the cabinet hardware and hinges, the tile backsplash, the windows (those were painted shut), and the light switches, “which had to have years’ worth of old paint layers caked on,” Lowe adds.“I love my landlord and am very grateful to have such an understanding one, but the kitchen was definitely giving ‘landlord special.’” Lowe did love the natural light and the ceiling trim, and thanks to a lenient landlord, some DIY savvy, and a boyfriend (Melvin Diaz, who has the same DIY savvy), Lowe transformed her apartment kitchen. “A lot of this kitchen makeover was relatively affordable — mostly because I bought everything over the span of a few years,” Lowe says. The rental cabinets got an upgrade. Although Lowe truthfully wishes she could have ripped out all of kitchen cabinets and started with a blank slate, she made the ones she had work — with some modifications. She painted the lower cabinets and inky green-black (Clare’s Current Mood). “The existing cabinets had to be prepped and painstakingly painted, and I still ended up with so many drips and flaws. I can even see the drips from older paint jobs that predated me, but I just tell myself that it’s old home charm.”She also ripped out part of an upper cabinet on the righthand side of the kitchen (and sealed and painted it back, with a shelf) to make room for a vintage china cabinet, and she says the cabinet demo was the scariest part of the project. Peel-and-stick products came to the rescue. Lowe upgraded the painted-over backsplash with white and orange peel-and-stick tile that wasn’t technically intended to be checkerboard-patterned, Lowe just arranged it that way. “The tiles don’t mess up the paint if you take them off the wall,” she says. “I triple-checked before adding them all around the kitchen.” And she plans to add even more! Lowe’s tiles are from Smart Tiles, and you can usually snag them for sale on Wayfair, she advises.A couple of other renter-friendly swaps Lowe made were to the light fixtures and the faucet. “The original boob lights can go right back where they belong, as I saved all the parts; any nail and screw holes can be filled in,” she says.The renter incorporated vintage touches throughout.Lowe also incorporated vintage finds that add more prep surfaces and storage, and she recommends shopping secondhand for your home. “My vintage wooden hutch is from Facebook Marketplace, as is the marble island that’s in front of the French windows in the back half of the kitchen,” Lowe says. “More than half of my fancy glassware, fun dinner plates, and large servingwares are thrifted also.” The window treatments are budget-savvy. The most cost-effective additions are the curtains, which are made from simple cloth napkins and small curtain rods. “I was shocked to see how much real cafe curtains cost, so a DIY was the only choice for me,” Lowe says. “Eventually, I’d like to have romantic lace curtains, maybe as a window valance, but we’ll see if I can thrift something that looks like what I’m picturing in my head.”Her project total came to $1,221, excluding the $1,200 fridge — her first purchase for the kitchen, and the biggest splurge.“I know some people don’t think it’s worth it to invest in a rental, but if your happiness is worth it (and you spend a lot of time at home), a room makeover is such a good idea,” Lowe says. “I decided to make a change because I really wanted to feel comfortable in my kitchen. The last apartment I rented was so awful; I never stepped foot in there. But now I’m on a journey to cook more and use Uber Eats a little less. I knew I’d never be able to accomplish either of those goals if my kitchen continued to feel like a tiny old cave. Now I actually enjoy walking into the kitchen. It feels 10 times cozier.”Editor’s note: Lowe is based in Los Angeles. Apartment Therapy has been in communication with her, and she was not severely impacted by the wildfires. Others impacted by the disaster have had to evacuate and many have lost their homes, communities, and businesses. Here are nine ways to help those in need right now by donating time, money or resources. Lowe also personally recommends WalkGood LA and Dream Center.",
