All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterThere are lots of ways to use wallpaper in a space; you can cover all of the walls, one of the walls, or even just a section of the wall. In this dining room makeover, Pamela Mountjoy (@pamela_mountjoy) cleverly places wallpaper within picture frame moulding to give her dining room a new boho-meets-beachy look. It’s a major improvement from the “no personality, plain walls” before.First came paint and moulding. Pamela had the design vision, but she hired a contractor to help with her dining room makeover. “If you can DIY, I would do that,” Pamela says. “I’m just not that handy and overthink everything. I wanted professionals to help.” She used painter’s tape to indicate where she wanted picture frame molding and paneling to go in the dining room. “I had the paneling go as high as our window and the bigger panels be as wide as the wallpaper,” she says. She also hired painters to paint the lower half of the room light blue (Backdrop’s The Early Stuff) and the upper half of the room a paler blue, almost white (Backdrop’s On Tour). Pamela says choosing the paint colors was actually easier than expected; she looked at recommended swatches on the website where she got her wallpaper.Next came multicolored wallpaper. Pamela’s best decorating advice? Room transformations happen over time. “We didn’t buy everything all at once,” she says. “We have had our dining table and console for 10 years. We bought the chandelier, mirror, and chairs throughout the past four years. … Once we saved up the money, we did the wallpaper, paint, and paneling.”And she loves the way it all came together. “It was in my head forever, and now I can be in the space just how I imagined it,” she says.",
