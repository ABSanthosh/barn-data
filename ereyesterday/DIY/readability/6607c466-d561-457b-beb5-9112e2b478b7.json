Or what if it’s movie night and you’re stuck in the middle, with no coffee table in sight? Then you might want to check out this behind-the-sofa console from Kate Hewitt (@our_bears_home) made from IKEA LACK shelves. If your couch floats (in other words, it’s not against a wall), the area behind it can seem lifeless and empty if you have a lot of space there. A console table solves the issue of filling the void and also gives you a place for your cuppa. I looked up affordable sofa tables and found that most of them were at least $200 to $250. Kate’s hack delivers a substantial-looking, sleek console table complete with a bottom shelf for added storage for about $90. But is it the right fit for your sofa and style? Check out how she does it, and see what you think. What You’ll Need 3 IKEA LACK shelves (74 ¾” x10 ¼ ” or  43 ¼”  x 10 ¼”, depending on your sofa)  Sliding compound saw or circular saw 8 L-brackets and screws Tape measure Pencil Drill/Screw gun Turn IKEA LACK Shelves Into a Sleek Sofa Console Table 1. Make the Sides Cut one of the LACK shelves in two to make the sides of the console. The measurement depends on how tall you want the table. 2. Attach the Sides Use the brackets to attach the sides to the LACK shelf you’re using for the top. The shelf should rest atop the sides, covering up the cut edges. Position the finished edges toward the floor for a sturdier standing surface. Kate uses two brackets on each side. 3. Add the Bottom Shelf Measure the remaining LACK shelf and cut it to fit between the two sides. Attach it using brackets a little ways from the bottom. This lower shelf provides extra storage and display space but also adds support. That’s it! After completing your new sofa table, dress it up with your favorite decor or add a couple of baskets on the bottom for storage. No Unsightly Cords With This Clever Console Hack A lamp is a popular addition to a sofa table. After all, snuggling up on the couch with a good book is a great way to relax. But what about the ugly electrical cords? Kate addresses this dilemma in the comments.  She had an outlet installed in the floor under the sofa. However, nowadays, you can also find some decent options for rechargeable lamps and bulbs. Finding the Right Dimensions for Your IKEA Sofa Table The average sofa height is approximately 35 inches, however, it can be much shorter, especially if you favor a low-profile look. If you simply cut the third shelf in half, your console table would end up slightly taller than 37 inches. More than likely, this number makes it too tall for your couch. Therefore, measure your sofa height and plan to trim down the shelf so your finished table is even with the top of your sofa or within one inch below it. Likewise, measure the length of your sofa to get the LACK shelves of the appropriate size. Typically, a sofa table should be roughly two-thirds the length of your sofa to maintain a balanced look. Therefore, if you have a shorter sofa or a loveseat, the 43 ¼”  x 10 ¼  is likely your best option. On the other hand, if you have a long sofa, say over 80 inches, go with the longer LACK shelves. Then, you can measure and cut them down to size as needed. The depth of the LACK shelves (10 ¼”) creates a slim console, so it’s a good fit for narrow spaces. Let’s Talk About Those Brackets A few commenters had questions about Kate’s brackets. Primarily asking, are they enough to keep the table together since the shelves are hollow? As @sarahm1084 points out, “It’s just the honeycomb cardboard filler, you see it briefly on the cut ends. There is a lot of faith holding those screws in rather than anything solid.” Lori Graham (@loriinstagraham) suggested the table might need support in the middle, to which the hacker agreed, responding that she was considering adding some. Others don’t like the exposed brackets. However, since the inside of the shelves is honeycomb, trying to do a hidden type of screw might not be possible. What would you do with this hack to keep the brackets out of sight or downplay them? Or would you try a different sofa table hack?
