Here’s what you can do: make your own cozy dog car seat cover using a simple IKEA rug. Alissa, parent to two adorable pups, shows us how to whip up a pet-friendly seat cover in under 5 minutes. It’s washable, stays put, and looks way cuter than many store-bought options. Whether you’re a DIYer, an IKEA hacker, or just a pet parent who wants to keep your car clean, you’re gonna love this one. Why This DIY Hack Just Works Well, the IKEA DRÖMSLOTT rug is kind of perfect for the job. It has a rubber underside that helps it stay in place when your pup hops in. Plus, it’s got that soft, cozy texture dogs love, but light enough to toss in the washing machine. Even better, when your pet isn’t riding with you, you can just flip it over the back of the seat. No mess, no fuss. Honestly, it’s one of those “why didn’t I think of that?” hacks. What You’ll Need DRÖMSLOTT Dog-shaped Rug | Photo Credit: IKEA.com Here’s what you’ll want to grab before you start: 1 IKEA DRÖMSLOTT rug for one seat cover (any similar washable rug will also work) Grommet kit (find it at craft or hardware stores) Long shoelaces, paracord, or any sturdy string Sharp scissors Can’t get a grommet kit? Try sewing elastic bands to the sides of the rug—they’ll easily stretch over the seat for a snug fit. Bonus tip: If you’ve got more than one car, grab a couple rugs and make extras. You’ll be glad you did. Let’s Make Your Dog Seat Cover This DIY is honestly so easy. Here’s the step-by-step: 1. Cut the holes Photo Credit: Alissa Use your scissors to carefully snip small holes in the corners of the rug to fit the grommets. 2. Add your grommets Follow the instructions on your grommet kit to secure the metal rings on the rugs. It takes seconds and ensures the rugs won’t tear. 3. Thread the cords Photo Credit: Alissa Loop your shoelace or paracord through the grommets and tie it securely around your car seat’s headrest. That’s it. You’re done. You now have a custom pet car seat cover that looks good and works hard. Want to Level It Up? Photo Credit: Alissa Once you’ve made your basic seat cover, here are a few fun ways to make it even better: Add a waterproof liner underneath for rainy-day adventures. Use bright-colored cords or shoelaces to add a pop of color. Sew or stick on a pocket for treats, leashes, or waste bags. Dog Car Seat Cover Care And when you’re not using it? I just hang them around the back of the seat when I have human travelers in these seats instead,” Alissa tells us.  Or fold it up and stash it in the trunk. It’s easy to keep clean too, as the rug is machine washable. Throw it in the washer, set at warm 104°F (40°C), every week or so (or, you know, whenever it starts to smell like dog). FAQs on DIY dog car seat cover 1. Can I use a different IKEA rug for this? Absolutely! Just make sure it’s washable and not too bulky. DRÖMSLOTT is a great pick because it’s the perfect weight, size and well, shaped like a dog. 2. Is this safe for road trips? The rubber underside helps it stay in place. If you want extra grip, add some Velcro or a non-slip pad underneath. 3. How often should I wash it? Depends on how messy your pup is. Once a week is a solid routine, but you can stretch it out if your dog is on the cleaner side. 4. Will it fit in any car? Pretty much. The cord setup is super flexible, so you can adjust it to fit your car seat’s headrest, no matter what kind of ride you drive. 5. Can I make one for my cat or other pets? Yep! If your cat likes car rides (some do!), or if you travel with other animals, this works just as well. 6. Too lazy to make one? Buy a dog seat car cover on Amazon. Here are a few great picks. Tried this hack? Got ideas for customizing it? I’d love to hear how your DIY dog car seat cover turned out. Drop a comment below or tag us on Instagram @ikeahackersofficial.
