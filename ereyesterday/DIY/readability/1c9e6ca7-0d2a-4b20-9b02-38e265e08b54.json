  "text": "Quick Links Remote for Hisense Smart TV CodeMatics Media Solutions Universal TV Remote Control Kore (The Official Kodi Remote) Vsray Technology Universal TV Remote Control You don't necessarily need a TV remote to control your television. If you lost the remote (again) or just like having a backup, your Android phone or iPhone can easily act as a second TV remote—provided you're using an app that works with your home devices, set-top boxes, and more. 1 Amazon Fire TV Remote If you only need a remote app for your Amazon Fire TV device, you should check out the official offering. Not only is it handy for controlling the Fire TV with voice and touchpad controls, but there's also a text entry tool. You won't have to go through the trouble of typing every web address or YouTube search query using the Fire TV's on-screen keyboard. The app displays all your Fire TV apps in a single list for quick launching, too. And don't worry if you have multiple Fire TVs; the remote app makes it easy to switch between different units. There are all sorts of tips and tricks to make navigation easier on Fire TV that you can combine with the simplicity of this remote. Download: Amazon Fire TV Remote for Android | iOS (Free) 2 Roku Like the other big players in the streaming sector, Roku offers a mobile version of its physical TV remote. It's a godsend when your Roku remote decides to grow legs and take off, and it's just as fully-featured as its physical cousins. For example, there are on-screen buttons for Netflix, the Roku Channel, Disney+, and more. You can adjust the volume, pause and play media, and even fast-forward and rewind. Another handy feature is the ability to privately listen to movies and TV shows by connecting headphones to your device. You can also cast content directly from your Android or iOS device using the mobile app. Additionally, both voice search and the touchscreen keyboard make it easy to get the most out of the Roku mobile app. Download: Roku for Android | iOS (Free) 3 Remote for Hisense Smart TV If you have a Hisense smart TV, this Android-only app uses the same aesthetic as the physical remote but in a clean, intuitive digital form. That means you get access to the red, green, yellow, and blue buttons, as well as shortcut buttons for Netflix and YouTube, on-screen menus, and input selections. You have the option to customize your remote's appearance and controls, such as mouse, joystick, and touch inputs. Additionally, you can choose from a list of digital remote controls, possibly matching your digital remote with your physical remote. It also supports a variety of smart TVs from other manufacturers, not just Hisense, which you can utilize by connecting the app to your smart TV using a pairing code. If you are using a Hisense TV, keep in mind the app only works with TVs that support IR connectivity and your phone (or tablet) must have an IR blaster. Download: Hisense Smart TV Remote for Android (Free; in-app purchases available) For a more universal choice, the CodeMatics Media Solutions's Universal TV Remote Control app has a lot of options and isn't limited to a handful of brands. You can adjust the volume, numberpad, digital D-pad, channel list, and the red, green, blue, and yellow buttons. Additionally, choosing a specific brand—say Sony—won't just give you one remote, but several to choose from. This ensures you have a digital TV remote that works for your model. It even has the option to pick smart TV remotes or IR TV remotes. While it is ad-supported, it isn't particularly annoying—at least not enough to be worth buying a subscription or its lifetime license. Download: CodeMatics Universal TV Remote for Android | iOS (Free; in-app purchases available) 5 Lean Remote Lean Remote is one of the most-used and most-reliable universal remote apps on Android. The best part of this one is the flexibility. In addition to your TV, you can also use it to control Android TV boxes, Roku boxes, air conditioning units, soundbars, DVD players, and other smart gadgets around your home. It supports both Wi-Fi and IR devices. As with some of the other apps, you'll need to pair it with your smart TV to get started. The app is ad-supported but unlike the Hisense remote app, there is no way to remove them. Download: Lean Remote for Android (Free) 6 Kore (The Official Kodi Remote) If you have the Kodi media center installed on your smart TV or set-top box, you can use this official app to control playback and interact with the various on-screen menus. Some of the app's standout features include the ability to connect to multiple Kodi installations on different devices, easy playlist management, and artwork displays. There's also a way to flick between saved media and any TV channels you run through Kodi, plus support for Kodi's DVR/PVR feature. If that's not enough to smooth out navigation, there are also many tips and tricks to using your Kodi remote from the comfort of your couch! Download: Kore for Android | iOS (Free) 7 Yatse Yatse is designed as a remote control app for Kodi, but it also works with Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, and your local hard drive's files. Once again, it is only available on Android devices. Except for Kodi, you'll need to sign up for the premium version to connect to other cloud servers. You can use the remote to stream content from your app of choice directly to UPnP, AirPlay, Chromecast, Fire TV, Roku, and smart TV devices. Features include an internal audio player with gapless playback, support for multiple codecs, a way to program custom commands, voice commands, and various themes. Download: Yatse for Android (Free; in-app purchases available) 8 Vsray Technology Universal TV Remote Control This great choice has an exhausting list of brands you can connect to, like Samsung, Sony, and Vizio—though most will ask you to watch a short ad before the remote is unlocked for good. You also get two remote options: Wi-Fi and IR. And if you'd rather mirror content to your smart TV, you can do that, too. Best of all, this remote control gives the ability to add multiple remotes and switch between them with the tap of a finger. Download: Vsray Technology Universal Remote for Android (Free; in-app purchases available) With so many smart TV remote apps available, it's easy to have a substitute when you inevitably lose the physical remote. More importantly, most of the best ones are compatible with Android and iOS, so not even your choice of mobile OS will stop you from enjoying your favorite streaming services and channels.",
