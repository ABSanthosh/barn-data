Pauline, a creative DIYer from Utrecht, The Netherlands, came up with a brilliant solution: wooden lids for IKEA TROFAST containers that double as interactive play plates for Playmobil fun. How did she come up with this idea? Photo Credit: Pauline “I made a drawer under my kid’s bed to store Playmobil. The roll-out drawer contains several TROFAST containers. Since the storage is under the bed, we wanted something to cover the containers, but we did not like the plastic TROFAST lids from IKEA,” says Pauline. Photo Credit: Pauline “We decided to use the leftover plywood I had from making the storage system. After painting and drilling some holes, the lids now also double as ground plates/base plates for playing,” she adds. Here’s how she transformed basic storage into a playful and practical setup. DIY Playmobil Storage Boxes With Ground Plates for Playing Materials \u0026 Tools IKEA Items: TROFAST containers Optional: TROFAST plastic lid (used as a tracing template) Other Materials: 15mm thick plywood (or thinner) Acrylic paint Tools Needed: Jigsaw or router with a template bit Drill ⌀ 3 mm drill bit ⌀ 8 mm or 8.1 mm drill bit Step-by-Step Playmobile Storage Box Hack Photo Credit: Pauline 1. Tracing the Lid Pauline began by using a standard plastic TROFAST lid to trace the shape onto a sheet of plywood. For those without a lid on hand, measuring the top of the container works just as well. 2. Cutting the Shape Photo Credit: Pauline The outline was roughly cut with a jigsaw, then refined using a router with a template bit, following the plastic lid as a guide. This method gave her clean, repeatable results. No router? No problem. A jigsaw alone will do the trick; just smooth the edges with sandpaper. 3. Adding a Side Grip Instead of the usual center hole in the TROFAST lid, Pauline opted for a side cut-out as a handle, allowing for more play surface. This made the lids easier for kids to lift and gave the design a cleaner look. 4. Creating More Play Bases Once the first wooden lid fit well, she used it as a template to trace and cut additional ones. 5. Painting the Lids With Playmobil Playscapes After construction, it was time for the fun part: painting! Pauline and her kids spent an afternoon decorating the lids with scenery: grassy fields, lakes, roads, and whatever sparked their imagination. It turned out to be a wonderful bonding activity, and the results were both adorable and functional. Let the acrylic paint fully dry before moving on to the next step. 6. Drilling Holes for Playmobil Accessories Photo Credit: Pauline To make the lids interactive, she drilled holes that allow Playmobil pieces to be added and removed: 3 mm holes are great for small accessories like plants or fences 8 mm (or ideally 8.1 mm) holes fit larger items like trees and signs This little customization turned the lids into modular playboards. The kids can easily plug in or pull out pieces as they play. Anything she would have done differently? Pauline shared a few tips she’d keep in mind for next time: Improve the fit: The plastic TROFAST lid is a tad small. “For wooden or other alternative lids, you could add 1 or 2 mm along the edges. This would give it a better, more secure fit on the TROFAST box,” she explains. Use thinner plywood: The 15mm plywood she used was available at home but is a bit chunky. “As a lid, this is on the thick side (it also sticks out a bit above the top edge of the containers). You could go way thinner,” Pauline adds. That said, if you want to use the lids double-sided (with holes on both faces), 15mm is about the minimum to prevent the holes from overlapping. Use an 8.1 mm drill bit: While 8 mm holes work, they’re quite snug. Slightly larger holes make it easier to insert and remove Playmobil parts. Why We Love This Hack This project is a win on multiple levels. It’s creative play, smart storage, and family time all rolled into one. Pauline’s kids love their customized Playmobil boards, and cleanup is now as simple as popping the lid back onto the TROFAST bin. Have you made a similar TROFAST hack? We want to see it!
