  "text": "Anker Anker Prime Thunderbolt 5 Docking Station This Anker dock comes with Thunderbolt 5 support, which means that it can drive up to two 8K displays at the same time, and it can also deliver up to 140W of power for fast charging basically anything. Thunderbolt 5 is a relatively new tech, but it packs some insane speed gains, and if your hardware supports it, gadgets using it can be a great addition to any laptop or computer. Anker recently released a Thunderbolt 5 dock, but you can already score a significant discount. The Anker Prime Thunderbolt 5 Docking Station, which we recently covered, is available at a $399.99 price point. That's rather steep for some people, and understandably so. Right now, though, if you use the code ANKERHOWTOGEEK2025 during checkout, you can score a whopping 22% off this dock. This will bring the price down to a much more palatable $312—a no-brainer considering that this has Thunderbolt 5 and it's an extremely versatile dock that gives you a whole ton of connectivity options. This dock features a wide and versatile array of ports, including USB-C, USB-A, HDMI 2.1, and DisplayPort 2.1. This docking station supports up to 8K resolution for both Windows (10/11) and macOS (15 or later) systems, so if you want to drive a powerful monitor off your laptop or your Thunderbolt-enabled PC, this will do the trick just fine. Its biggest selling point is the fact that it supports Thunderbolt 5. It gives this dock a bidirectional bandwidth of 80 Gbps, doubling the speeds we had with Thunderbolt 4, and it can boost to 120 Gbps for video-intensive tasks. This allows for connecting multiple high-resolution displays, including up to two 8K displays at 60Hz or three 4K displays at 144Hz. Thunderbolt 5 also supports a whopping 240W of power delivery, though this dock can do up to 140W, which is still pretty good. Related Thunderbolt 5 Will Support 120 Gbps, Coming in 2024 Intel revealed more details about its new Thunderbolt 5 standard. Remember that you'll need to use our code during checkout if you want to claim these savings. It's one of the best Thunderbolt 5 docks available right now, and with an $88 price drop, it's hard to pass on it. This deal will last until June 16th, so act quickly!",

Anker recently released a Thunderbolt 5 dock, but you can already score a significant discount.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe Anker Prime Thunderbolt 5 Docking Station, \u003ca href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/anker-new-thunderbolt-5-dock-so-many-ports/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewhich we recently covered\u003c/a\u003e, is available at a $399.99 price point. That\u0026#39;s rather steep for some people, and understandably so. Right now, though, if you use the code \u003cstrong\u003eANKERHOWTOGEEK2025\u003c/strong\u003e during checkout, you can score a whopping 22% off this dock. This will bring the price down to a much more palatable $312—a no-brainer considering that this has Thunderbolt 5 and it\u0026#39;s an extremely versatile dock that gives you a whole ton of connectivity options.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThis dock features a wide and versatile array of ports, including USB-C, USB-A, HDMI 2.1, and DisplayPort 2.1. This docking station supports up to 8K resolution for both Windows (10/11) and macOS (15 or later) systems, so if you want to drive a powerful monitor off your laptop or your Thunderbolt-enabled PC, this will do the trick just fine. Its biggest selling point is the fact that it supports Thunderbolt 5. It gives this dock a bidirectional bandwidth of 80 Gbps, doubling the speeds we had with Thunderbolt 4, and it can boost to 120 Gbps for video-intensive tasks. This allows for connecting multiple high-resolution displays, including up to two 8K displays at 60Hz or three 4K displays at 144Hz. Thunderbolt 5 also supports a whopping 240W of power delivery, though this dock can do up to 140W, which is still pretty good.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n
