Simply tossing them in the bin exposes you and your family to identity theft and financial fraud. But, there are steps you can take to sanitize your devices before you get rid of them. 1 First, Back Up Your Important Data Before you start sanitizing your smart home device, you need to first review the data stored in it and decide what you want to keep, like photos, medical records, family videos, or important documents. You can transfer these to a new device or save them to a secure cloud drive. If you decide to store the data in an external storage, make sure the external storage is kept in a secure spot in your home or an area that people won’t easily access. External storage devices should also be kept in a protective case and placed in a cool, dry place, away from direct heat or sunlight. Related What Is Data Backup? 5 Ways to Back Up Your Files Your important files could be stolen, held to ransom, or simply lost. How can you stop that from happening? Backing up your data is the key. 2 Disconnect The Device From Your Accounts Check the device for any storage media attached to it like flash drives, memory cards/microSD cards that contain your data. Also, make sure that your data is removed from these external storage devices if you decide to dispose of it or reuse it. Another important thing to do is to disconnect this device from your accounts. You should regularly audit the devices connected to your apps—some old devices you don’t use anymore may be left lingering in the recognized/connected device section of the app. Review all device permissions or access and remove all devices that you no longer use. Unlinking the device or revoking its permissions prevents backdoor access to your network. Related How I Secure the Smart Devices in My Home Your smart home devices make life easier, but don't forget to secure them against hackers. 3 Factory Reset Your Device A factory reset removes sensitive information stored in the device like Wi-Fi passwords, username and account passwords, credit card details, addresses, and other types of data that can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, and cyberattacks. For instance, some contain data like the pre-shared key (PSK) that can give threat actors access to your home network. Other sensitive and personal information, including photos or medical records, can also be used to blackmail you. For some devices, a factory reset or hard reset involves just pushing a button on the device for a few seconds; others would require you to do this using the device’s dedicated app. Check the user manual and follow the steps carefully to ensure you do this successfully. 4 Follow Local Electronic Waste Disposal Guidelines Electronic wastes are more dangerous than you think. When electronics are simply tossed in the trash, they end up in landfills where they release toxic substances like lead and mercury that can seep deep into the soil and groundwater. This is why local governments have electronic waste disposal guidelines that meet international standards. Some cities collect unwanted electronics for free to ensure that they don’t end up in landfills. Residents are just required to bring the devices to a drop-off location. However, cities can't ensure the complete destruction of data in the device, so you're advised to sanitize them before you drop them off. If you're going to dispose of smart home devices in bulk, especially those that contain other people’s data, you ask vendors for a certificate of data destruction. This assures clients that the data in the devices has been permanently destroyed according to local privacy laws and regulations. As we regularly upgrade and replace our devices, electronic waste disposal has become a regular task. Unlike most other waste, however, devices contain harmful substances that can poison the environment—on top of a wealth of sensitive data that puts you at risk of cyberattacks and fraud if these land in the wrong hands. So, it’s important to follow these guidelines to mitigate the risks.",

When electronics are simply tossed in the trash, they end up in landfills where they release toxic substances like lead and mercury that can seep deep into the soil and groundwater. This is why local governments have electronic waste disposal guidelines that meet international standards.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSome cities collect unwanted electronics for free to ensure that they don’t end up in landfills. Residents are just required to bring the devices to a drop-off location. However, cities can\u0026#39;t ensure the complete destruction of data in the device, so you\u0026#39;re advised to sanitize them before you drop them off.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re going to dispose of smart home devices in bulk, especially those that contain other people’s data, you ask vendors for a certificate of data destruction. This assures clients that the data in the devices has been permanently destroyed according to local privacy laws and regulations.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAs we regularly upgrade and replace our devices, electronic waste disposal has become a regular task. Unlike most other waste, however, devices contain harmful substances that can poison the environment—on top of a wealth of sensitive data that puts you at risk of cyberattacks and fraud if these land in the wrong hands. So, it’s important to follow these guidelines to mitigate the risks.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
