Premium consumer electronics company TCL CSOT unveiled its latest innovations at the 2025 SID Display Week, the annual global summit for innovation in the display industry. TCL CSOT has consistently pushed boundaries with its cutting-edge intelligent displays, and the newest additions to its LCD, OLED, and MLED product lineups are no exception. From TCL CSOT’s industry-first inkjet printing OLED to its latest breakthroughs in MLED technology, the brand had a full spectrum of impressive products and new technologies to share at this year’s show. Visionary Leadership at the Forefront of Innovation Behind the scenes at TCL CSOT, the company’s focus has been trained on creating the industry’s most exciting and future-forward innovations while upholding its commitment to a more intelligent and environmentally conscious display era. The award-winning Dr. Weiran Cao is at the helm of TCL CSOT’s Display Technology Innovation Center, keeping the brand’s focus at the confluence of scientific rigor and commercial foresight. TCL CSOT’s headline-grabbing presence at this year’s SID Display Week was in large part due to Dr. Cao’s team’s ability to balance its envelope-pushing R\u0026D work with commercially viable products. “Over the years, I’ve learned to evaluate innovation not only by its novelty but by how it integrates with real-world manufacturing, cost models, and user expectations,” explains Dr. Cao. “Being a leader at TCL CSOT has taught me to merge long-term vision with short-cycle product demands—to build platforms that are both future-facing and production-ready.” With its newest technology, Dr. Cao says the company is poised to shape the next chapter of display innovation, marking 2025 as a major tipping point. “Printed displays will change how we think about screen integration—not just on phones and TVs, but across every smart surface in daily life,” says Cao. “With IJP OLED and QD-EL, we can design displays that are thinner, more flexible, and more sustainable. Our vision is to make printed displays as scalable and ubiquitous as printed newspapers once were—customized, compact, and everywhere.” APEX Platform: A Blueprint for the Next Display Era TCL CSOT For TCL CSOT to be a true leader in the display industry, Dr. Cao and his team dedicate themselves to exploring the interface between research excellence and real-world application. “We run an integrated model where advanced research is guided by practical commercialization goals,” says Dr. Cao. “For example, when developing our oxide IJP OLED notebook panel, we aligned material research, circuit design, and substrate optimization to meet both visual performance targets and power efficiency needs. This approach allows us to compress development timelines without compromising innovation.” This mission of exploring the future while developing in reality is borne out by its APEX platform, which is held up by four pillars: Amazing display experience; Protective for your vision health; Eco-Friendly and sustainable; and X, representing the future and unbridled imagination. Among the most impressive new display products from this high-end innovation platform being showcased at SID 2025 were: World’s Highest Image Quality LCD TV Display (98\"): This 98-inch large-screen LCD TV has an ultra-wide 178-degree viewing angle and is powered by a proprietary RGB Mini-LED backlight system. World’s First Natural-Spectrum Slim Pad Display (12.1\"): This natural-spectrum 12.1-inch pad display has more than double the natural-light ratio of conventional displays. World’s First Mass Production CUP OLED Notebook Display (14\"): This 14-inch notebook display features an industry-leading 98% screen-to-body ratio made possible through TCL CSOT’s proprietary Camera Under Panel (CUP) technology. World’s First Lowest Power Consumption PLP OLED Mobile Display (6.96\"): This mobile display boasts a 45% reduction in EL power consumption through advanced panel design and a next-generation high-transmittance color filter. World’s Lowest Power LTPO Notebook Display (14.5\"): This LTPO panel transitions seamlessly from 0.3Hz to 120Hz depending on user activity. In static content scenarios, it enables a deep sleep state, effectively doubling battery life. World’s Narrowest Splicing Dual-Curved Display (23.6\"): This dual-curved 23.6-inch display was designed for next-generation automotive cockpits. The Rise of Inkjet Printing OLED: From Concept to Commercial Family TCL CSOT TCL CSOT put the spotlight on its “family bucket,” the industry’s first full inkjet printing OLED (IJP OLED) lineup, reinforcing its leadership in this space. This full-spectrum portfolio includes smartphones, tablets, laptops, rollable displays, and TVs—a first for any manufacturer. According to Dr. Cao, inkjet printing offers unique advantages in flexibility, material efficiency, and scalability. “IJP is not just a manufacturing alternative—it’s a catalyst for more sustainable, high-performance, and design-adaptive displays,” he explains, adding that it will be critical to the future of display technology. From debuting the world’s first IJP OLED mobile display (6.5”) and the 4K 120Hz IJP OLED 27-inch monitor display to the first-ever 14-inch oxide IJP OLED notebook panel, TCL CSOT’s full-category lineup of IJP OLED displays demonstrates the brand’s unmatched capabilities in scaling this technology. MLED Mastery: Breakthroughs at Every Scale TCL CSOT TCL CSOT continues to push the boundaries and explore the limits and scalability of MLED technology. Its latest MLED innovations range from the ultra-small 0.05-inch micro LED display to the opposite end of the spectrum, with a massive 219-inch, 36:9-ratio screen. The highlights from TCL CSOT’s 2025 SID display included: World’s Smallest Micro LED Display: A 0.05-inch silicon-based display with 5080 PPI, over 4 million nits brightness, and low power usage ( Ultra-Large 219-inch Display: A 36:9 aspect ratio screen with 5760×1440 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and over 98% DCI-P3 color accuracy—ideal for immersive signage and entertainment. Ultra-Bright Automotive Display: A 14.3-inch PHUD with over 45,000 nits brightness, high contrast, and wide field of view, designed for in-vehicle windshield integration to enhance safety and visibility. Transparent Display: An 8.42-inch transparent Micro LED with 5,000 nits brightness and borderless integration, ideal for interactive and AI-powered display scenarios. A Turning Point in Display Innovation When asked what excites him most about the future of printed displays, Dr. Cao is quick to point out that there are changes coming, and TCL CSOT is paving the way for the industry. “TCL CSOT is leading this transformation. Our vision is to make printed displays as scalable and ubiquitous as printed newspapers once were—customized, compact, and everywhere,” he says. “Printed displays will change how we think about screen integration—not just on phones and TVs, but across every smart surface in daily life. With IJP OLED and QD-EL, we can design displays that are thinner, more flexible, and more sustainable.” If TCL CSOT’s showcase at the 2025 SID Display Week is any indication of what’s to come, the future looks promising, with more rollable screens, AI integration, and new ways to integrate smart screens and surfaces into our everyday lives. “What was once a lab concept is now moving into the supply chain,” hints Cao. We’re already looking forward to being wowed by TCL CSOT’s innovations at next year’s summit.",

Our vision is to make printed displays as scalable and ubiquitous as printed newspapers once were—customized, compact, and everywhere,” he says. “Printed displays will change how we think about screen integration—not just on phones and TVs, but across every smart surface in daily life. With IJP OLED and QD-EL, we can design displays that are thinner, more flexible, and more sustainable.”\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf TCL CSOT’s showcase at the 2025 SID Display Week is any indication of what’s to come, the future looks promising, with more rollable screens, AI integration, and new ways to integrate smart screens and surfaces into our everyday lives. “What was once a lab concept is now moving into the supply chain,” hints Cao. We’re already looking forward to being wowed by TCL CSOT’s innovations at next year’s summit.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
