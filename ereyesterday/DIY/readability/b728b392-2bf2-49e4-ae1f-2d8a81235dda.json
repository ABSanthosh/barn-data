All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.The second I feel a slight breeze in the air, I’m ready for cozy season — think: thick sweaters, warm blankets, and gorgeous fireplaces.

I love looking through our fireplace before and afters for inspiration because so many of them aren’t just gorgeous — they’re also really affordable and totally doable within the span of a weekend.One of my favorite fireplace makeovers was published just last year: a dated 1970s fireplace that was transformed into a living room scene-stealer. The DIYer behind the redo wanted to create a mantel (all the better to display fall decor) and give the fireplace some much-needed character and charm.Take a look at what she created! This fireplace now looks so sophisticated and luxurious with a new paneled wood surround, a decor-ready mantel, and box molding above. And get ready for the best part: It cost only $400. Yes, really! Sticking to a DIY makeover kept costs low, and the only materials needed were various cuts of plywood and trim, as well as paint.I think what makes this fireplace look extra special is the paneling on the front of the hearth, which makes the whole fireplace look cohesive. It’s a smart trick to steal if you’re planning to make over your own fireplace! The rich color — a neutral putty — melts in with the color of the remaining exposed brick, making this fireplace look like it was meant to be rather than a later addition.This stunning makeover impressed me when it was published, and even today, I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s the perfect example of a relatively low-cost DIY making a huge impact on a space!",
