  "text": "Sign in to your How-To Geek account Kubuntu Focus, the company selling PCs built specifically for desktop Linux, has just released the NX Gen 3 PC. It’s a small desktop computer powered by Intel’s latest Core Ultra 7 hardware and Kubuntu Linux. This PC is an updated version of the company’s Focus NX computer, which somewhat resembles an Apple Mac Mini or ASUS NUC PC. It’s a compact desktop measuring 4.6 x 4.4 x 15 inches (117 x 112 x 37 mm), with a metal body, plastic top, and the same heat sink design as Intel’s Cyber Canyon NUC computers. The main upgrade here is the processor, which is now available in two options: an Intel Core Ultra 7 255H or an Intel Core Ultra 5 225H. Both CPUs are 15th-generation models with a 40W TDP, but the Ultra 7 has more cores/threads, better integrated graphics, and slightly faster clock speeds. Kubuntu Focus also uses dual-channel RAM for the best possible performance. The rest of the hardware is impressive, too. You get two Thunderbolt 4 ports, several USB Type-A and USB Type-C connections, HDMI, Wi-Fi 7, 2.5G Ethernet LAN, Bluetooth 5.4, and two M.2 slots for drives. You can open the PC with one standard Phillips screw to replace or upgrade components—a far cry from Apple’s non-upgradable Mac Mini. You can connect up to four 4K monitors at one time, using the two DisplayPort 2.1 outputs over USB-C and two HDMI 2.1 ports simultaneously. As with all the company’s computers, this ships with Kubuntu 24.04 LTS out of the box, paired with a few utilities for controlling the system and learning how to use desktop Linux. Any other modern Linux distribution should work just as well, though. Windows is not an officially-supported operating system, but it should work after hunting down any missing drivers. If you occasionally need to dual-boot Windows, it might be a good idea to use one of the M.2 drive slots just for a Windows SSD, and keep your regular Linux installation on the base drive. Related 5 More Linux-First Mini PCs for Your Next Open Source Project Mini PCs are awesome because of their versatility, and when you marry them with an open-source operating system like Linux, the possibilities are endless. But why install Linux manually when you can skip the image writing and get dedicated support by buying Linux-first? Kubuntu Focus said in a press release, “Like prior generations, the third-generation NX is rated for constant operation and includes cable-routing and VESA-monitor-mount brackets. Every system is built to order, with the customer’s selection of CPU, RAM, disks, optional encryption, YubiKey, and warranty. Ground shipping is free within the continental US and Canada.” You can buy the Kubuntu Focus NX Gen 3 today from the company’s online store, with a starting price of $895. That’s definitely more expensive than most Mac Mini configurations or NUC desktops, but you’re getting the best Linux support possible and high-end hardware. Source: Kubuntu Focus",

Both CPUs are 15th-generation models with a 40W TDP, but the Ultra 7 has more cores/threads, better integrated graphics, and slightly faster clock speeds. Kubuntu Focus also uses dual-channel RAM for the best possible performance.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe rest of the hardware is impressive, too. You get two Thunderbolt 4 ports, several USB Type-A and USB Type-C connections, HDMI, Wi-Fi 7, 2.5G Ethernet LAN, Bluetooth 5.4, and two M.2 slots for drives. You can open the PC with one standard Phillips screw to replace or upgrade components—a far cry from Apple’s non-upgradable Mac Mini. You can connect up to four 4K monitors at one time, using the two DisplayPort 2.1 outputs over USB-C and two HDMI 2.1 ports simultaneously.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAs with all the company’s computers, this ships with Kubuntu 24.04 LTS out of the box, paired with a few utilities for controlling the system and learning how to use desktop Linux. Any other modern Linux distribution should work just as well, though. Windows is not an officially-supported operating system, but it should work after hunting down any missing drivers. If you occasionally need to dual-boot Windows, it might be a good idea to use one of the M.2 drive slots just for a Windows SSD, and keep your regular Linux installation on the base drive.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n                        \n                \n    \n                                        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n
