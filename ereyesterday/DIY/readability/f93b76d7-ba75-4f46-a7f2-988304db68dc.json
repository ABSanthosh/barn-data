  "text": "Corbin Davenport / How-To Geek Patriot P400 2TB Internal SSD Patriot P400 NVMe SSD offers PCIe Gen4 speeds up to 7000MB/s read. It's a great option for a PS5 console, featuring a graphene heatsink and ticking all the right boxes otherwise. The PlayStation 5 currently comes with 1 TB of storage, while the PlayStation 5 Pro has 2 TB. If you bought the original PS5, you have only 825GB. Not great. It has rarely been this cheap to add an extra 2TB to your console, though. If you've been looking to add extra storage to your PlayStation 5 console, right now you can buy a 2 TB Patriot SSD that meets all of the specifications needed by the PS5 for just $102.99. It's typically $119.07, making for a great deal on a really good SSD. The Patriot P400 is an NVMe SSD with support for PCI Express 4.0 connectivity. PCI Express 5.0 is cool and a huge upgrade, but 4.0 is still fine for most people, and more importantly, it's fine for the PS5 and most gaming PCs. It boasts impressive sequential read speeds of up to 7,000MB/s and write speeds of up to 4,800MB/s, so it's a good choice for storing games and keep loading screens and performance as quick and snappy as it should be. It has a high-efficiency graphene heatshield for optimal thermal management, end-to-end data path protection, SmartECC technology, and thermal throttling to prevent overheating and maintain performance. Related The Best PS5 SSDs of 2024 Need to increase your PS5 storage? These are the best SSDs to get right now. Even if you don't own a PS5, this is still a great option for a Gen 4 NVMe SSD. It has amazing performance for the price, and 2 TB of storage—it's not the biggest SSD on the market, but it's good enough. Make sure to get yours while this deal lasts. It's not a huge discount, but it's a hard-to-beat price for a really good SSD.",

PCI Express 5.0 is cool and a huge upgrade, but 4.0 is still fine for most people, and more importantly, it\u0026#39;s fine for the PS5 and most gaming PCs. It boasts impressive sequential read speeds of up to 7,000MB/s and write speeds of up to 4,800MB/s, so it\u0026#39;s a good choice for storing games and keep loading screens and performance as quick and snappy as it should be. It has a high-efficiency graphene heatshield for optimal thermal management, end-to-end data path protection, SmartECC technology, and thermal throttling to prevent overheating and maintain
