Süreyya Tuncer of @sues_daily took a simple IKEA MOSSLANDA picture ledge and turned it into an affordable curtain pelmet. I’ve come across lots of picture ledge hacks over the years but this is the first time I’ve seen it used this way. It’s a straightforward repurposing of the ledge yet this simple twist made a stark difference.Süreyya said it best: “It’s a tiny bit of work, but mega effect!” Here’s how she did it. What You’ll Need: IKEA MOSSLANDA Picture Ledges Screws and wall anchors (if necessary) Drill Miter Saw Level Measuring tape IKEA Picture Ledge Curtain Pelmet Hack Measure Your Space: Start by measuring the area where you plan to install the curtain pelmet. This will help you determine how many MOSSLANDA ledges you’ll need. The MOSSLANDA picture ledge is available in two lengths: 21 3/4″ and 45 1/4″. Calculate your space with these lengths to get your most cost-effective option. Prepare the Ledge: If necessary, paint or finish the MOSSLANDA picture ledge to match your decor. Süreyya chose the white picture ledge for her project, but you can also opt for other finishes such as black, oak effect or walnut. Price will vary depending on the finish. Flip It Around: Süreyya’s hack involved flipping the ledge upside down. This allows the previous underside of the MOSSLANDA shelf to hang down, providing a cover for the curtain fixtures. Install the Ledge: Position the picture ledge above the curtain rails and use a pencil to mark the spots for the screws. Remove the ledge and drill holes into the ceiling at the marked locations. If necessary, insert wall plugs. Then, slide the picture ledge in and secure it in place with screws. You can add a few more screws along the length of the ledge for added security, if necessary. Repeat: Continue adding picture ledges along the curtain rail until the end. If the ledge is too long for your space, simply measure the excess and cut it to the desired length. Enjoy Your New Look: The MOSSLANDA picture ledge should now hang down like a curtain pelmet, concealing the curtain fixtures behind it. Süreyya is thrilled over her simple hack that packs a punch. Her followers feel the same, liking her reel over 25,000 times. “I love projects like this,” she shares, “because everyone can do it.” Personalize The Hack Looking at Süreyya’s DIY curtain pelmet hack, I also spot an opportunity to elevate the design even further. By adding a strip of remote-controlled LED lights along the inside lip of the MOSSLANDA, you can instantly create a luxurious ambiance in the room. A simple addition that adds a warm, inviting glow to the space.If your space leans more vintage, consider adding trim to the MOSSLANDA pelmet for a more ornate cornice window box effect.Fabric is also a popular addition to curtain boxes. Staple or glue fabric to the front of the pelmet to achieve a charming farmhouse style.For the kid’s room, attach a scalloped plywood front to the pelmet for a touch of whimsy.",
