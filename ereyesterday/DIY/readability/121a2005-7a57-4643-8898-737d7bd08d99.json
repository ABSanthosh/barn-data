  "text": "Mozilla Firefox Sign in to your MUO account Mozilla Mozilla has had to clarify some of the language used in the new terms of use for Firefox. This came after some users heavily criticized the overly broad language surrounding the collection and use of user data. Mozilla Introduces Misunderstood Terms of Use This week saw Mozilla introduce a terms of use and an updated privacy notice for its Firefox browser. Unfortunately, not everyone welcomed the updates, and instead, criticized some of the language used. In particular, this section: “When you upload or input information through Firefox, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use that information to help you navigate, experience, and interact with online content as you indicate with your use of Firefox.” Critics such as Brendan Eich pointed out that this language seemed to be overly broad, meaning it could allow Mozilla to use your data in unwelcome ways. With some suggesting that it could see Mozilla provide data for AI. The language does indeed appear to be overly broad and open to interpretation. And that is a problem when you're required to agree to these terms of use to use Firefox. Meaning that you have to trust that your data is not going to be used against your will. Mozilla Clarifies What the Language Really Means Thankfully, Mozilla was quick to respond to the backlash, and clarify what the language in the terms of use and privacy notice actually mean. It updated the original blog post with the following clarification: \"We need a license to allow us to make some of the basic functionality of Firefox possible. Without it, we couldn’t use information typed into Firefox, for example. It does NOT give us ownership of your data or a right to use it for anything other than what is described in the Privacy Notice.\" Further to this, a Mozilla spokesperson also told TechCrunch that \"these changes are not driven by a desire by Mozilla to use people’s data for AI or sell it to advertisers.\" Which, if taken at face value, is pretty clear. Related AI Tools Are Running Out of Training Data, but There Are 6 Solutions AIs will run out of good-quality data by 2026, so how else can we help these tools grow and thrive? As a free and open-source web browser, Firefox has always been viewed as a good option for those not keen on using products by the big companies. However, as Firefox has a market share of just 2.54 percent now, way behind Google Chrome (on 67 percent), Safari (on 17.95 percent), and Microsoft Edge (on 5.2 percent), Mozilla isn't the force it once was.",

Unfortunately, not everyone welcomed the updates, and instead, criticized some of the language used. In particular, this section:\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n                        \n\u003cp\u003e“When you upload or input information through Firefox, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use that information to help you navigate, experience, and interact with online content as you indicate with your use of Firefox.”\u003c/p\u003e    \n            \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCritics such as Brendan Eich pointed out that this language seemed to be overly broad, meaning it could allow Mozilla to use your data in unwelcome ways. With some suggesting that it could see Mozilla provide data for AI.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe language does indeed appear to be overly broad and open to interpretation. And that is a problem when you\u0026#39;re required to agree to these terms of use to use Firefox. Meaning that you have to trust that your data is not going to be used against your will.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"mozilla-clarifies-what-the-language-really-means\"\u003e\n                        Mozilla Clarifies What the Language Really Means\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, Mozilla was quick to respond to the backlash, and clarify what the language in the terms of use and privacy notice actually mean.
