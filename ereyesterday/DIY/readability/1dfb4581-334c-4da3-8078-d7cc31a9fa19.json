Now, I’m trying to decide where to use this hack from Aden Zig. Wang @adenwang, which uses the SKÅDIS pegboard system to turn an unused gap into functional storage. Aden wanted to maximize the slim gap between his washing machine and the wall. It was just wasted space, and he knew there was potential there. Sure, there are narrow pull-out shelves and similar items, but even those can be too bulky or wide for extra-skinny spaces. Since Aden was facing a tight squeeze, he opted for a slim sliding pegboard solution using the large SKÅDIS panels. What You’ll Need 2 IKEA SKÅDIS pegboard panels (Aden used two white 30” x 22” panels) 1 pair of soft-close drawer slides Wing nuts Screws Washers  Wall anchors (for 50lb and appropriate for your wall type) Mending plates (Aden points out that you can get these from IKEA, but he opted for something stronger.) Any SKÅDIS accessories you choose Laser level Basics — drill, screw gun Angle attachment for the drill if working in a tight space Adding Slim Storage With SKÅDIS Pegboard Organizers Photo Credit: Aden Zig. Wang @adenwang | Instagram 1. Connect the SKÅDIS Panels Use mending plates to put the two pegboard panels together. Aden opted to get his connectors elsewhere, but IKEA does offer special connectors for the SKÅDIS panels. If you choose to get yours somewhere else, make sure to get screw caps (or use the one from the SKÅDIS connectors — they’re only $2). 2. Mount Sliders on the Wall and Panels Choose drawer slides that are long enough to slide your storage panel out as far as you need to. IKEA has soft-close drawer slides, but they may or may not be the length you need. If not, you can pick some up online or at your local home improvement store. Attach the drawer slides to the wall. Aden said a laser level and an angle attachment for his drill made mounting the drawer slides onto the wall much easier. (In fact, many commenters were drooling over the angle attachment — I have to admit, I kind of want one too.) Use appropriate anchors for your wall and opt for ones with a hefty weight limit (at least 50 pounds). Line up the slides and attach them to the SKÅDIS panels, one on each. 3. Position the Pegboard and Accessories as You Wish Slide your new pegboard wall into place, and make sure everything works smoothly. Then, it’s time for the really fun part — organizing your sliding pegboard! Choose the accessories you want based on what you plan to store on your panels. There are baskets, shelves, bins, hooks, so tons of options waiting for you to put them to use. How Much Does This Hack Cost? The SKÅDIS panels are about $28 apiece, then the accessories range from a few bucks each to $10 or $12 for multipacks. You could spend roughly $50 to $60 on all of the hardware. Depending on how you choose to accessorize, expect to pay between $115 and $150 on this hack. Possible Variations for Your Slim Pull-Out Storage A couple of commenters wondered why Aden stopped at only two panels, and he responded that adding another was his next step. This is just one example of how you could tweak this hack to make it your own, depending on your available space and needs. You could use more or fewer panels, go with the smaller SKÅDIS panels instead, or pick a different color. The panels come in white, black, or natural wood. What do you think? Would you keep the hack as-is, or are there a few things you’d change to make it work better in your home? Follow Aden Zig. Wang @adenwang to discover more cool hacks and space-saving DIYs. If you have a tight space you need to fit with more storage, here’s the hack in action. But the SKÅDIS opens the door to all sorts of clever organizing solutions, from creating a standing divider to fitting a sofa armrest with storage.
