  "text": "Entertainment Sign in to your MUO account TikTok If you're addicted to scrolling endlessly through TikTok videos on the mobile app, you might want to check out the web app too. Because TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has given the TikTok web app a major overhaul. TikTok Redesigns Its Web App in the Style of YouTube TikTok's future in the US may still be in doubt, but that hasn't stopped ByteDance from trying to improve the experience. Specifically, the experience of using the web app located at TikTok.com. Related TikTok Is Available to Download in the US Again... for Now TikTok is back, baby. But its longterm future in the US is far from assured. According to a post on the TikTok Newsroom, the web app updates deliver \"an easy-to-use and engaging viewing experience,\" allowing you to \"enjoy your favorite content on desktop.\" The key updates are: A modular design that has repositioned the navigation bar and reduced distractions in order to provide a more immersive viewing experience. The ability for game streamers to go live in either portrait or landscape mode. Which gives desktop users a full-screen horizontal view. A floating mini-player that's only available on desktop inside the Chrome browser. This keeps TikTok videos playing above other windows. A new Collections feature that allows you to organize your favorite categories into custom categories. Making it easier to revisit later. Cody Puckett, Product Manager at TikTok, welcomed the new desktop app by saying: \"Our users interact with TikTok in many different ways, which is why we’re excited to introduce these web app updates. By enhancing our desktop capabilities, we aim to bring TikTok's handheld magic on desktop, providing an engaging experience with greater flexibility so you can enjoy TikTok anytime, anywhere. As TikTok evolves, we remain committed to innovating for our community and ensuring the platform is accessible for all.\" The most noticeable thing for me is how similar the new TikTok desktop UI looks to YouTube. While there are some obvious differences, such as the single vertical layout, the experience feels very similar. And that's a good thing, in my opinion. It's Mobile-First, but This Proves That Desktop Matters TikTok is adamant that it's still a mobile-first platform, but these updates to the web app at least prove that ByteDance isn't ignoring desktop users. And having used the web app to test out the new features, I enjoyed the experience. Related Using TikTok on desktop is a little strange given that all the videos appear in portrait mode, but it still works surprisingly well. The new layout and features are now available globally to anyone visiting TikTok.com.",
