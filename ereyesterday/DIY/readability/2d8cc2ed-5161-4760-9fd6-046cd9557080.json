From overlooked settings to everyday habits, these common pitfalls could be undermining your entire Android experience. 1 Skipping Face Unlock and Extend Unlock Features Although most Android phones feature reliable in-display fingerprint sensors, skipping face unlock could mean missing out on added convenience. Face unlock is just as secure as fingerprint unlock and comes in handy when you can't use the fingerprint sensor due to wet or occupied hands or even when you're wearing gloves. Extend Unlock (formerly known as Smart Lock) is another feature you should enable. It keeps your device unlocked in trusted environments, such as at home, holding your phone, or connected to devices like a smartwatch or car. This eliminates the need to constantly unlock your phone whenever you want to interact with it. 2 Settling for the 60 Hz Refresh Rate Even if you've splurged on a flagship Android device, your phone's display is likely still set to the default 60Hz refresh rate, primarily to conserve battery life. While this may seem practical, you're missing out on a smoother, more fluid experience—something you may have paid extra for. Scrolling, gaming, or swiping through apps feels significantly more fluid and responsive at 90Hz or 120Hz compared to the default 60Hz. If your device supports a higher refresh rate, be sure to enable it—especially during fast-paced activities like gaming—to fully enjoy your Android phone's offerings. 3 Not Taking Advantage of Dual Apps Do you often switch between multiple WhatsApp, Facebook, or Instagram accounts? With most Android phones supporting Dual Apps (or App Cloning), you no longer have to do that. You can use your phone's Dual Apps feature to install two separate instances of the same app. This feature is especially useful if you manage both personal and work accounts. If you have a phone from Samsung, Xiaomi, or OnePlus, the app duplication option isin the Settings app. Others may need to rely on third-party apps to do this. 4 Ignoring Battery Protection Features As your Android phone’s battery ages, its ability to hold a charge diminishes. However, enabling battery protection features can help slow down this process. Doing so ensures your phone stops charging once it reaches 80%, preventing overcharging and prolonging battery health. Adaptive Charging is another helpful feature for those who tend to leave their phones plugged in overnight. It analyzes your usage patterns and slowly charges your phone from 80% to 100%, ensuring a full charge just before you typically unplug your device. 5 Skipping Digital Wellbeing Setup If you often find yourself doomscrolling or engaging in non-productive activities on your phone, setting up Digital Wellbeing can help. This built-in feature lets you track and limit your screen time, set app timers, and activate Focus Mode to minimize distractions. It also includes a handy Bedtime Mode that automatically turns on grayscale and mutes all notifications, alerts, and calls. Additionally, if you're a parent setting up an Android phone or tablet for your kids, Digital Wellbeing offers parental control options to set restrictions and limits to manage your child's screen time effectively. 6 Overlooking Personalized Ringtones and Notification Sounds Assigning unique ringtones to your favorite contacts is an easy way to identify who’s calling without even glancing at the screen. It may seem like a minor tweak, but personalizing ringtones for key people—like your spouse, boss, or frequent contacts—can be useful when your phone is tucked away in a pocket or another room. Similarly, you can customize notification alerts for apps. This way, when a notification arrives, you can easily identify whether it's an important Slack message that needs immediate attention or a less urgent Instagram alert that can wait. 7 Using the Default Quick Settings Layout You likely use the Quick Settings panel multiple times a day, so why not optimize it to better suit your needs? You can add shortcuts for your most-used features, making them more accessible with just a swipe. For example, you can add the New Note button for jotting down quick ideas, the TV Remote for controlling your TV, or the Scan QR Code button for easy scanning. You can even rearrange these buttons to prioritize the features you access most to save time and avoid excessive swiping. 8 Not Enabling Notification History By default, your Android phone only shows recent notifications, and once you clear them, they’re gone. However, enabling the Notification History feature can help review past notifications, even if they were dismissed. This can be a lifesaver if you accidentally swipe away an important alert without reading it. Additionally, it can help you view those deleted WhatsApp messages that the sender may have unsent. 9 Missing Out on Split-Screen and PiP Mode If there’s one useful multitasking feature Android offers but iPhones lack, it's split-screen mode. This feature lets you make the most of your phone's large screen and use two apps simultaneously. You can, for example, use this to check your calendar while taking notes or read an article while texting someone. Similarly, certain apps also support Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode, which allows you to watch content in a small, resizable window while using other apps. This way, you can watch YouTube videos or keep an eye on Google Maps navigation while using other apps on your phone. Although the Developer Options menu on Android isn't meant for everyday users, it's worth exploring. This hidden menu contains several useful features that can significantly enhance your overall experience. For example, if your Android phone is older and feels sluggish, adjusting the animation scale can make it feel more responsive. The Force Dark Mode option also allows you to enable dark mode across nearly all apps, even those that don't natively support it. These are just a couple of examples, but there are several other Developer Options worth checking out on your Android. Since most of the features mentioned above aren't enabled by default on Android devices, they are often overlooked. However, taking a moment to activate them can significantly enhance your Android experience. So, be sure to give them a try!",
