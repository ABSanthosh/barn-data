Matteo found himself in this dilemma: a basement with no obvious place to stow a bicycle. The solution? A clever IKEA hack using two FLISAT wall shelves — made for children’s books — now repurposed as a simple, wall-mounted bike support system. Materials Used: Photo Credit: Matteo 2 FLISAT wall shelves 4 wall anchors 1 wall-mounted pedal support Unfortunately, the FLISAT wall shelf seems to be discontinued in some IKEA markets. Check secondhand places like FB marketplace for used ones. Alternatively, the BEKVÄM spice rack may be repurposed for this hack as well. DIY Bike Rack Wall Mounted Shelf Before, empty basement wall | Photo Credit: Matteo Begin by flipping the FLISAT shelf on its head. Each shelf is mounted upside-down on the wall, using two wall anchors apiece. Positioned in this orientation, the shelves become sturdy ledges for the bike’s wheels. The solid pine construction of the FLISAT shelf provides just the right amount of strength without overwhelming the wall with bulk. Photo Credit: Matteo Next, install a pedal support at the appropriate height and position to cradle the bike’s pedal. This stabilizes the bike laterally and prevents it from swinging or shifting. Why It Works Photo Credit: Matteo This conversion is more than just a spatial fix; it’s a thoughtful use of vertical real estate. By elevating the bike off the ground, floor space is freed for other storage needs or simply for easier movement around the basement. The arrangement is simple and visually clean. The rod along the FLISAT shelf provides a rail to hang helmets and other biking accessories. A Very Affordable Wall-Mounted Bike Rack This project isn’t just smart; it’s affordable. The materials were already on hand, the FLISAT shelves repurposed from earlier use. No custom carpentry, no special tools, and no excess spending. Matteo says, “This bike rack wall-mounted system helped save space while keeping cycling accessories better organized. Best of all, the cost of the hack was minimal.” You may also like these Bike Rack Hacks",
