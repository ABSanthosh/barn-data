  "text": "Worried your information might be floating around the dark web? You're not alone. Fortunately, these free tools can quickly reveal if your data has been leaked or sold by data brokers, so you can take action before it's too late. 5 Have I Been Pwned Have I Been Pwned is one of the best and most trusted sites for checking if your data has been exposed in a breach. The site allows you to search for your email address or phone number against a massive database of known breaches. For example, as of this writing, the site's database contains records on nearly 900 websites that have been breached, comprising a vast dataset of almost 15 billion breached accounts. The site is easy to use and doesn't require you to sign up for anything. Just plug in your email address or phone number and tap the Pwned button to check. If your information appears, Have I Been Pwned will inform you exactly which breaches or data dumps it was found in and what types of data (such as passwords, date of birth, and social media profiles) were compromised. You can also set up dark web alerts, which will notify you if your email address appears in future breaches. And even better, Have I Been Pwned offers a password search tool, helping you discover if any of your current passwords have been leaked. 4 CyberNews Personal Data Leak Checker CyberNews, a popular media outlet for cybersecurity-related news, provides a free tool for checking if your information has been compromised and is on the dark web. Like Have I Been Pwned, the tool scans its extensive database of leaked records to see if your data has been exposed. To check, enter your email address or phone number and hit the Check now button. If your email or phone number is found in any public data breaches, the tool will display the names of the data leaks or data dumps, although it does not provide more detailed information about each, unlike Have I Been Pwned. If you're concerned that some of your passwords may have been leaked, CyberNews offers a separate tool called Leaked Password Checker for your use. However, as long as your phone number or email has been found, you must take the necessary steps to protect your account after a data breach. Otherwise, you risk falling victim to account takeover, identity fraud, and other threats. 3 Mozilla Monitor Mozilla Monitor is a tool provided by the makers of the Firefox browser that you can use to find out if your data has been exposed. It provides a detailed report that includes when and where the breach happened and what types of information were affected, like passwords or phone numbers. The service relies on Have I Been Pwned's database as its breach source, and you must first create an account. However, don't write it off just yet. Mozilla Monitor offers a few perks that aren't available on Have I Been Pwned, or that would otherwise require additional setup. First, it provides actionable steps for you to take after each data breach for safety. It also automatically sends you breach alerts and gives you the option to include up to five emails for monitoring. You can also add your personal details, like your name, date of birth, city, and state, for monitoring. Checking if your data has been compromised is free, but Mozilla has a premium option if you want your data removed from data broker sites on the dark web. 2 F‑Secure Identity Theft Checker F‑Secure Identity Theft Checker is another solid alternative. Powered by cybersecurity experts at F‑Secure, it instantly scans your email against known data breaches and shows you how many times your information has been leaked. But what makes this tool unique is that it additionally sends a detailed breach report to your email, outlining what breaches or data dumps your data was found in, when it was discovered, and what specific information may have been exposed, such as your email, password, name, date of birth, and more. You can perform as many checks as you want, and the service doesn't force you to sign up or log in to check if your data is on the dark web. 1 AmIBreached AmIBreached is an extensive tool for searching if your information is on the dark web. Developed by cybersecurity company Cyble, AmIBreached boasts one of the most extensive dark web monitoring services with over 183 billion records. You can search for your information on the dark web for free, without needing an account. The key downside is that you'll need to sign up for a detailed report and actionable steps on how to protect yourself. Having an account also gives you the tool's so-called Cyber Threat Risk Score, which is based on the number of times your data has been discovered on the dark web and the number of times your password, contact, and card details have been breached. AmIBreached is free to use, but if you require additional features, you'll need to pay for them. These five free tools offer quick, hassle-free scans to help you check if your information is available on the dark web. You can use them to perform regular checks, and even better, some offer active monitoring to alert you the moment your data is discovered.",
