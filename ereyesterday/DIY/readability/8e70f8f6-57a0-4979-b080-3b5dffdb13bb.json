All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterWhen Anna and Colin Bruton reached out to Shaolin Low of Studio Shaolin in Hawai’i, they wanted to reimagine a few rooms in their home but were most focused on the kitchen. “It was cramped, the storage was not optimized, and, quite frankly, it was just ugly,” the couple says. “We wanted to change it to make it feel bigger, allow for more and better storage, and change the feel.” Shaolin agreed, explaining that the original builder-grade cabinetry was falling apart and that even though the room was on the smaller side, the existing cabinetry didn’t help maximize the space. The kitchen, clad in white, gray, and black, felt “really dated,” Shaolin says. Anna and Colin wanted to infuse the space with color. “The design inspiration was functionality and comfort,” the couple shares. “The goal was to make the space usable while also making it feel homey and comfortable. We knew we would eventually rent the place out, so creating a space that felt like ours but could easily be used by anyone was the goal.”Shaolin says the main objective in the renovation was to make the “dead spaces” in the existing kitchen more functional. In two of the corners, they installed a pull-out trash can, a blind corner optimizer, and a lazy Susan. A slimmer refrigerator was installed to give them a few more inches of space there, too. Next, it was time to dive into the room’s new color palette. “The sage green cabinets and dusty rose backsplash were chosen to add a pop of color and playfulness to the space,” Shaolin says. “The rest of her finishes around the home were neutral, so this gave us an opportunity to really have fun.” Shaolin installed brass plumbing, which adds visual intrigue to the green and rose-colored kitchen. For texture they added reclaimed-wood-and-marble hardware and oak floating shelves, which are one of the couple’s favorite elements. (They look great while adding a ton of extra storage.) Even though the kitchen wasn’t expanded, Shaolin created a far more functional space. The drop counter was removed and replaced with ample cabinetry and a pantry with rolling shelves. “I also love the blind corner optimizers. The kitchen is still small, and adding those in provides much-needed storage space,” the couple shares. The kitchen renovation took around a month to complete, and Shaolin says it cost somewhere between $60,000 and $75,000. “I love that it feels modern without feeling boring,” Shaolin says. “This kitchen has a simple, timeless feel to it where it’s modern with a splash of fun. I love that it’s super functional while also being pretty. Our client loved every aspect of it and felt like cooking in her kitchen now was a joy where everything had its place and use.”This post originally appeared on The Kitchn.
