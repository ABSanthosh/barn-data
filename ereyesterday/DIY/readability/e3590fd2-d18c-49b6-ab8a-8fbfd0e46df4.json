  "text": "Microsoft’s Copilot is quickly becoming one of the best options available if you’re looking to tap AI prowess without paying a dime. Copilot Voice and Think Deeper Are Now Free With No Limits The company now offers unlimited access to Copilot Voice and Think Deeper for all users. Copilot Voice allows you to talk with the AI chatbot. You can use it for a number of situations, like preparing for a job interview or even practicing a conversation in a new language. Think Deeper is powered by OpenAI’s o1, the company’s most powerful model. You can use it to tackle more complex questions or tasks. Microsoft shared an example prompt to try Think Deeper’s capabilities: Compare the best electric cars. I usually prioritize design and comfort, and I want to feel like my purchase is ‘future-proof’. Make a novel scoring system to help me with my assessment. When using Think Deeper, be prepared to wait a few seconds for a response. Copilot Voice is available on the Copilot smartphone app for iPhone or Android and at copilot.microsoft.com. But you’ll need to head to the Copilot site to access Think Deeper. To activate Think Deeper, choose the icon next to the microphone button. Microsoft previously gave free users access to both Copliot Voice and Think Deeper with some limitations. If you subscribe to the $20 monthly Copilot Pro option, you will still receive preferred access to the latest models during peak usage, early access to AI experimental features, and use of Copilot in Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Copilot in Word can help you write from scratch and much more. A Spectacular Deal Copilot is now the place to go if you’re looking to access some of the best AI available without any limits. Think Deeper uses the same advanced technology that’s only available to ChatGPT subscribers on the $20/month Plus plan or the $200/month Pro option. While Pro subscribers enjoy unlimited access to o1, Plus users still face some limitations. Copilot Voice is also a great way to use AI and is much easier than typing. While I've previously stuck with ChatGPT, I'll definitely make sure to try out Think Deeper on Copilot without having to worry about any rate limitations.",
