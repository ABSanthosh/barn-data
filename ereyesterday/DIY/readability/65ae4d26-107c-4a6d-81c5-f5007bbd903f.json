Change the Charging Sound on Your iPhone There are three methods you can use to change your iPhone's charging sound. You can choose to use a whole song, a part of a song, or text that Siri will say every time you charge your iPhone. These tips work no matter how you charge your iPhone. Before we begin, it's important to note that you cannot literally change your iPhone's charging sound. The new sound is just another sound that plays after the default sound. However, if you continue reading, we'll show you a shortcut to mute the default sound so that all you hear when you plug and unplug your phone is your custom sound. To change the charging sound on iOS, you'll need to use the built-in Shortcuts app. There are many handy iPhone automations you can create in the Shortcuts app, and changing the plug-in sound of your iPhone is just one of them. You can re-install the Shortcuts app from the App Store if you accidentally uninstalled it. After you've downloaded the Shortcuts app, launch it and follow the steps below: Select the Automation tab and tap New Automation. Scroll down and tap Charger. Tap the Is Connected option. If you also want a customized sound to play whenever you unplug your phone, select the Is Disconnected option as well. Tap the Run Immediately option below it so that the automation runs without needing approval. Tap Next in the top-right corner of the screen. Change Your iPhone's Charging Sound to a Song From Apple Music If you downloaded a song from Apple Music and you want your iPhone to play the full song every time you plug in your phone, follow the steps below: Tap New Blank Automation. Select Play Music. Tap the grayed-out Music text, then select a song from your Apple Music library. Once you pick a song, the Library pop-up will close, and the gray Music text will be replaced by the song title. Tap the arrow next to the song title and set Shuffle to Off and Repeat to None. Tap Done in the top-right corner of the screen. Change Your iPhone's Charging Sound to a Short Audio Clip You can use a short audio clip if you don't want to change your iPhone charging sound to a full song. It can be one to three seconds long, but it has to be in a format that Apple can read, such as MP3, AIFF, or WAV. You may need to convert a file from MP4 to MP3 or any other suitable format before using it for your iPhone's charging sound. After downloading the sound, it's time to create the first automation action to set your custom charging sound. First, copy the audio clip to the clipboard by opening it in the Files app and tapping Share in the screen's bottom-left corner. In the Share menu, tap Copy. Open the Shortcuts app and follow the steps above to create an automation based on connecting or disconnecting the charger. Then, follow these steps: Select the Play Sound action. Tap the arrow next to the Play sound action, tap Choose Variable, and select Clipboard in the menu. Tap Done in the top-right corner of the screen. Depending on how you set up the automation, the audio clip should play when you plug in or disconnect your phone from power. Change Your iPhone's Charging Sound to Siri-Spoken Text If you don't have a specific audio clip for when you plug in your iPhone, you can make Siri say something instead. Follow the steps to create the automation above, then when you reach the Add Action page: Search Speak Text in the Shortcuts search bar and add it to the actions list. In the Speak action, tap Text and type what you want Siri to say when you plug in or unplug your phone. Think of creative, fun phrases to get the ultimate cool effect. For example, you can create an automation that makes Siri say \"Burp\" when you charge your iPhone. You can also change Siri's pitch, speed, language, and voice by tapping the arrow for more options. When you're done entering the word or phrase, tap Done in the top-right corner. How to Mute Your iPhone's Default Charging Sound Unfortunately, the only way to turn off the default charging sound is to put your iPhone in Silent Mode. You can do this on older iPhones by using the switch on the left side of your iPhone. Newer iPhones have the Action button, which will turn your phone to silence by default. While silent mode won't play the default charging sound, you'll still be left with a buzz or vibration when it's plugged in. You can turn this off in Settings \u003e Sounds \u0026 Haptics. Scroll to the bottom of the list and turn off System Haptics. Remember that when you put your iPhone in Silent mode and disable System Haptics, your iPhone will not ring for incoming calls or messages. So, you'll need to remember to turn off silent mode when you're finished charging your phone. Alternatively, you can set up a shortcut to turn your phone back to Ring when disconnected from the Charger. Open the Shortcuts app and select Automation at the bottom. Tap the + sign in the top-right corner and select Charger. Choose Is Disconnected (ensure Connected is toggled off) and tap Run Immediately. Tap New Blank Automation, then Controls, and select Set Silent Mode. Ensure the On option is toggled to Off and tap Done. Now anytime you take your phone off the charger, it will automatically disable Silent Mode and turn your Ringer back on, so you don't have to remember to. Changing the charging sound on your iPhone is a fun little tweak, even if it isn't as deep as some might like. Newer versions of iOS include even more customization options to help make your iPhone feel more unique and personal.",
