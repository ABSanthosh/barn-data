Known for their vibrant green tropical fronds, they are beginner friendly as they can tolerate lower light conditions and are also known for their air-purifying abilities. They are pretty low maintenance and add an attractive touch of green to any space. The Parlor Palm (botanical name Chamaedorea elegans) originally comes from Central America (native to the rainforests of southern Mexico and Guatemala), but it has become a popular indoor plant here in the United States. They can grow up to 6 feet indoors and live for decades in a house as an indoor tree, and when thriving outside, can grow up to a mature size of 16 feet tall. While these evergreen plants are not true lilies (from the Spathiphyllum species), most peace lilies can grow to be between 1-4′ wide and come from the tropical regions of Central and South America. They are a member of the Araceae family and as long as they get enough light, they will produce elegant white blooms starting in the early summer and may continue to bloom throughout the year. These tropical plants are not happy in the cold, so they can only be grown outside in a warmer and more humid climate like in USDA Zones 10-12. We’ll show you how to keep these popular indoor palms happy with the right climate and care.

Why are they called Parlor Palms? Parlor Palms were first popularized in the Victorian era and get their name from their smaller size because when grown indoors they can fit into your “parlor” (a fancy old-time name for a living or sitting room) better than a larger tropical variety. They have thin trunks that grow grouped together full of delicate green fronds that create a beautiful lush foliage and are one of the best types of palms for beginners.

You’ll want to give your Parlor Palm a good full drink when you do water it, but let it dry out in between waterings. You can stick your finger in the top inch of soil to check how damp the soil is and wait until it feels mostly dry before watering again (try every 1-2 weeks to start and see if your plant responds well to that). Parlor Palms enjoy moist soil but are susceptible to root rot from overwatering, so make sure the planter you use has drainage holes to release excess water and don’t let the plant sit in standing water if there’s water in the draining tray. Using a well-draining potting mix also is crucial in guiding extra water away from the roots. Under watering can also effect Parlor Palm foliage, so keep an eye on the leaves as they will start to wither when it needs some water. So if your plant fronds start shriveling about a week after watering, then you’ll start to get an idea of how often to water. You’ll have to water more often if your plant is near brighter light conditions, and less in lower light spots. Parlor Palms are sensitive to tap water, so if you can’t use distilled, filtered, or rainwater, then let your tap water sit out overnight and that will allow the chlorine to dissipate. How much sunlight do Parlor Palms need? While they are considered to be a “low light plant,” the Parlor Palm’s natural habitat provides dappled light that is filtered through the rainforest canopy of trees. While Parlor Palms enjoy medium to bright indirect sunlight, they are a good plant to choose for low light areas as they can also do well in low indirect light (sun exposure from a north-facing window can be ideal.) You’ll also want to dust your fronds occasionally as too much dust on the plant’s leaves can inhibit photosynthesis. Rotate the plant every so often as well so the plant’s shape grows evenly and check the underside for pests. Avoid direct sunlight on the plant as that can scorch their leaves. Should I fertilize Parlor Palms? Parlor Palms don’t need much fertilizer, but you can use a slow-release fertilizer applied sparingly at a much smaller dose than instructed to fertilize through the growing season (spring and summer) every other month. Skip feeding your plant during the fall and winter months. Potting and Repotting Parlor Palm plants Parlor Palms are a slow growing variety, so if you repot into a slightly larger pot every two years, you shouldn’t have issues with the plant becoming root bound. Choose a pot that is only about 2″ bigger than the current size as too big a pot will hold too much moisture for the plant and promote root rot. While it’s best to re-pot during the growing months of the year (spring and summer), repotting can be done at any time of the year. You’ll want an acidic to neutral good soil that combines drainage and moisture retention or you can buy more all-purpose potting soil and add in some peat moss, sand, or perlite for extra drainage. Peat moss to promote soil drainage Organic pearlite to enhance drainage All-purpose potting mix for plants T Temperature and humidity for Parlor Palms Ideal indoor temperatures for Parlor Palms are between 65°F and 75°F and you’ll want to keep them away from vents and cold drafts from doors or windows. If you keep a potted plant outside, make sure to bring it in once temperatures dip into the 50°s. Being a tropical plant, peace lilies enjoy medium humidity levels, although they can usually thrive with average humidity in a home. If you want to raise the humidity in your home, you can use a humidifier nearby or place the plant on top of gravel on a tray and then pour some water into the gravel (which will create humidity around the plant as it evaporates). Just make sure the water level is below the gravel so the plant is not sitting directly in water. Plants that enjoy humidity usually are happy in a bathroom as long as there is adequate light in the space. Pruning Parlor Palms Parlor Palms are slow growers, and while you can cut off fronds that have dried out or turned yellow or brown, it’s not necessary to prune your Parlor Palm. Propagating Parlor Palms While there are lots of plants than can be propagated (see this plant propagation post for more details), the Parlor Palm is actually not one that we recommend you propagate at home. The plants are grown in clumps for aesthetic reasons but don’t grow that way in nature. Division of the roots into two plants will put the plant under a lot of stress that it may not survive, and they cannot be grown for a stem or leaf cutting. As they are generally propagated from seed by professionals, it’s recommended to simply buy a new plant if you want to add more Parlor Palms to your home. If you want to give division a try with your Parlor Palm and hope for the best, you can follow these steps below: Gently remove the Parlor Plant from its pot. Use a sterile cutting tool to cut the root ball in half, making sure each side has healthy looking roots. Plant each section into a pot just a little bigger than the plant with fresh potting soil to fill in gaps. Water as needed making sure to let soil dry out between waterings and place in bright indirect light between 65°F and 75°F until roots are established. Common varieties of Parlor Palms: ‘Chamaedorea elegans ‘Bella’‘: The most popular indoor variety, dense, vibrant green fronds grow from thin arched stems and clusters of tiny yellow flowers can appear after years of growth. ‘Chamaedorea erumpens’: Native to Guatemala and Honduras, this is a bamboo palm with smooth green leaves than can grow up to 8 feel tall. ‘C. hooperiana’: This variety is a large genus of Central and South American palms and has large dramatic leaves and is a much faster grower. Diagnosing common problems Brown leaf tips: Brown leaves could be from under watering, so make sure that your top inch of soil is just drying out before watering again. Your tips can also brown from low humidity, so try a humidifier or a tray of pebbles and water under your plant base. Yellow leaves: Usually a sign of overwatering but can also happen from lack of enough light. Check your watering schedule and soil dampness to see if watering is the cause or move to a spot with more indirect bright light your home. Pests: Small pests like spider mites, aphids, mealybugs, whitefly, and scale can be common pests for Parlor Palms, but you can wipe off the leaves with mild soap and water and then spray with an insecticidal soap to keep insects away. Red spider mites or mealy bugs can first be dislodged with a damp cloth if caught early. Fungal Infections: Plant diseases like fungal leaf spots can occur from root rot and overwatering, so if you spot fungal growth, remove the affected leaves. Stem Cankers: As these are tricky to treat, you can try to prune off affected areas, but it’s possible that the plant won’t be able to bounce back. Frequently Asked QuestionsAre Parlor Palms toxic to pets or kids? No! Thankfully, the parlor palm is nontoxic to pets and humans. While it is nontoxic, if eaten in large quantities, ingestion can cause some stomach upset, so nibbling on the plant should still be avoided. Do Parlor Palms clean the air? Yes, Parlor Palms have air-purifying qualities and they are on on NASA’s list of top air-cleaning plants because they remove formaldehyde, benzene and carbon monoxide from the air.",

You can stick your finger in the top inch of soil to check how damp the soil is and wait until it feels mostly dry before watering again (try every 1-2 weeks to start and see if your plant responds well to that). Parlor Palms enjoy moist soil but are susceptible to root rot from overwatering, so make sure the \u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/3Qe3eyT\"\u003eplanter you use has drainage holes \u003c/a\u003eto release excess water and don’t let the plant sit in standing water if there’s water in the draining tray. Using a well-draining potting mix also is crucial in guiding extra water away from the roots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnder watering can also effect Parlor Palm foliage, so keep an eye on the leaves as they will start to wither when it needs some water. So if your plant fronds start shriveling about a week after watering, then you’ll start to get an idea of how often to water. You’ll have to water more often if your plant is near brighter light conditions, and less in lower light spots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eParlor Palms are sensitive to tap water, so if you can’t use distilled, filtered, or rainwater, then let your tap water sit out overnight and that will allow the chlorine to dissipate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-how-much-sunlight-do-parlor-palms-need\"\u003eHow much sunlight do Parlor Palms need?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile they are considered to be a “low light plant,” the Parlor Palm’s natural habitat provides dappled light that is filtered through the rainforest canopy of trees. While Parlor Palms enjoy medium to bright indirect sunlight, they are a good plant to choose for low light areas as they can also do well in low indirect light (sun exposure from a north-facing window can be ideal.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll also want to dust your fronds occasionally as too much dust on the plant’s leaves can inhibit photosynthesis. Rotate the plant every so often as well so the plant’s shape grows evenly and check the underside for pests. Avoid direct sunlight on the plant as that can scorch their leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-should-i-fertilize-parlor-palms\"\u003eShould I fertilize Parlor Palms?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eParlor Palms don’t need much fertilizer, but you can use a  \u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/4ib0Xlw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"\u003eslow-release fertilizer\u003c/a\u003e applied sparingly at a much smaller dose than instructed to fertilize through the growing season (spring and summer) every other month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSkip feeding your plant during the fall and winter months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" data-pin-url=\"https://abeautifulmess.com/grow-and-care-for-parlor-palms/?tp_image_id=135041\" data-pin-title=\"how to care for parlor palms\" src=\"https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4.jpg\" alt=\"leaves of a parlor palm\" srcset=\"https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4.jpg 1333w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-67x100.jpg 67w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-40x60.jpg 40w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-730x1095.jpg 730w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-700x1050.jpg 700w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-550x825.jpg 550w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-156x234.jpg 156w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 730px, (min-width: 1080px) 650px, (min-width: 1024px) 630px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%201333%202000\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4.jpg 1333w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-67x100.jpg 67w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-40x60.jpg 40w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-730x1095.jpg 730w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-700x1050.jpg 700w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-550x825.jpg 550w, https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4-156x234.jpg 156w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://abeautifulmess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/care-for-parlor-palms-1-4.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-potting-and-repotting-parlor-palm-plants\"\u003ePotting and Repotting Parlor Palm plants\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eParlor Palms are a slow growing variety, so if you repot into a slightly larger pot every two years, you shouldn’t have issues with the plant becoming root bound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eChoose a pot that is only about 2″ bigger than the current size as too big a pot will hold too much moisture for the plant and promote root rot.
