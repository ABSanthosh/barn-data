One space where this concept works beautifully is the bedroom. These New Additions Make A Bedroom Refresh Easier Than Ever Your bedroom should be a place that refreshes your spirit, relaxes you but also rejuvenates you. Everything from the furniture to the accessories should come together to create a seamless, stylish space that makes you feel at peace. With spring around the corner, IKEA decided to celebrate with a bright, playful collection of new bedroom products. 1. TÄRNKULLEN Queen Upholstered Bed Frame Photo Credit: TÄRNKULLEN Upholstered Bed Frame | IKEA.com The bed is undoubtedly the focal point of the bedroom, so I feel it’s a top priority when it comes to creating a relaxing space. It’s also essential that your bed stays clean, and anything that makes that easier is a win in my book.One of the beautiful things about the TÄRNKULLEN upholstered bed, besides its simple, elegant appearance, is its removable cover. Slip it off the frame and toss it in the wash so your bed’s always fresh. Working with a tight budget? See how to make your own upholstered bed frame. 2. Add Softness With STENFRÖ Sheers Photo Credit: STENFRÖ Sheer Curtains | IKEA.com It’s important to have privacy in a bedroom, but I also love waking up to beautiful sunlight streaming through the window. IKEA’s new STENFRÖ sheers soften bright sunlight, filtering the rays as they bathe your bedroom in a warm, cheerful glow. Plus, you still get privacy without having to shut out the sun. It’s a win-win, and these sweet, subtle window treatments also work well with other curtains if you prefer a layered look. You can also dial up the sophistication factor with this clever cornice board DIY made from IKEA picture ledges. 3. Let There Be Light Photo Credit: BÄCKNATE Pendant Lamp Shade | IKEA.com I like my bedroom as dark as possible when I want to sleep, but that doesn’t mean lighting should be an afterthought. The right light can make or break a room. Choose poorly, and you’ll strain your eyes as you read in bed or when you pick out a fabulous ensemble for the day.However, lighting choices that are too harsh zap a bedroom of its cozy, relaxing vibe. The paper-like BÄCKNATE pendant shade is a statement piece that diffuses light to give your bedroom a soft glow. There’s also the matching BÄCKNATE table lamp to add a little bedside beauty. 4. Fresh Spring-Inspired Textiles Photo Credit: FÄLTGRÄSMOTT Duvet Cover and Pillowcase | IKEA.com A running theme throughout IKEA’s latest product launches is a bright, cheery color palette. I love the vibrant and playful hues on the pillows, duvets, comforters, and more. They make me feel happy and calm, and they certainly turn your bedroom into a space that says, “Good morning, Sunshine.”Make waves with the SVALSTJÄRTAR duvet cover and pillowcase or go floral with the FÄLTGRÄSMOTT bedding set. Mix and match patterns and experiment with different combinations using various cushion covers to add texture, softness, and warmth to your bedroom. 5. Mirror, Mirror, on the Wall Photo Credit: DVÄRGSYREN Mirror | IKEA.com The new DVÄRGSYREN mirror delivers a no-frills, no-fuss style that works well with many design schemes. Hang two side-by-side to fill a larger wall space or play around with the two different sizes in various configurations. The frame is deep enough to double as a shelf for small essentials, adding an extra dash of organization to your bedroom retreat. IKEA Bedroom Favorites That Are Always a Good Idea Great style isn’t all about what’s new. Some of my favorite pieces in my home I scored at second-hand shops or I’ve had them for years. One of my absolute favorite light fixtures is an IKEA find that I picked up roughly 20 years ago, (before I even had a home to hang it in).  Therefore, don’t think you need to go out and buy all the latest designs and products to create your dream space. Pairing IKEA’s latest additions with these enduring favorites gives you all the things you need for a stunning and sweet bedroom retreat. 1. HEMNES 8-Drawer Dresser Photo Credit: HEMNES 8-Drawer Dresser | IKEA.com The best-selling HEMNES dresser has been an IKEA staple for years. I remember seeing it decades ago when I would stroll through the Round Rock, TX, IKEA every time I would visit family in Austin.The HEMNES features a straightforward style that allows it to blend seamlessly with multiple design looks. It boasts ample storage, perfect for keeping clothes and other items tucked out of sight. But sticking with an old favorite doesn’t mean you need to keep the same look. Check out these hacks to give your HEMNES a glow-up or a sleek mid-century facelift. 2. A Nightstand With Good Bedside Manner Photo Credit: OLDERDALEN Nightstand | IKEA.com The OLDERDALEN nightstand is cute and practical, paying homage to Scandinavian craftsmanship with its sturdy design. The fresh colors pair well with IKEA’s new spring-inspired palette, and the dual-level top makes it a good fit for multiple bed heights.I appreciate the closed storage this table offers. After all, there are certain things you like to keep near your bed, but you don’t necessarily want in plain sight. I also love the opening in the back for cords and charging cables.  3. The TOLKNING Bench Provides Storage and Seating Photo Credit: TOLKNING Bench | IKEA.com We added a bench at the foot of our bed a few years ago, and I love it. It gives us a spot to put on shoes or to sit after the bed is made. But the one thing our bench doesn’t have is storage. When we’re ready to replace it, I want something like the TOLKNING bench. It offers storage but still has an open, airy design. The handmade rattan keeps the overall look light and natural while also adding another layer of texture to the room. 4. Stay Organized With the BRIMNES Wardrobe Photo Credit: BRIMNES Wardrobe | IKEA.com Many IKEA lovers turn to the PAX system when they need a wardrobe solution. It’s understandable. I designed a custom PAX in my first house (and miss it so much), and the PAX is also one of IKEA’s most-searched products. However, don’t discount the other excellent storage options, like the popular BRIMNES wardrobe.One of the upsides to the BRIMNES is it comes ready-to-go with a clothes rod, shelves, and mirror. Want a more customized solution? Use this hack to add drawers to the BRIMNES and get more organizing power. 5. Use Baskets for Soft Storage Photo Credit: TJABBIG Basket | IKEA.com I gravitate to storage containers without lids for most of the items I need to access daily. I don’t like wasting time opening and closing boxes and bins, so open-top solutions are often my go-to. (I find I’m more likely to put things away, too, when it’s easier to do.) When creating a cozy bedroom retreat, softer storage solutions help maintain a comfortable ambiance. The TJABBIG basket comes in different sizes and offers ample space for accessories, a spare throw, slippers, and more. The braided, unbleached cotton is the perfect natural complement to a refreshing bedroom. Plus, it looks chic and stylish, so it’s no problem if you decide to keep them out in the open. Something Old, Something New, and Reimagined Favorites for a Fresh Bedroom Redo As you can see, mixing a few new pieces with your faithful favorites is a great way to fashion a stunning new bedroom without buying everything brand-new. Classics offer storage and function along with style, and fresh pieces provide beautiful bedroom essentials. But sticking with a few existing items doesn’t mean they have to look the same as when you first brought them home. Reimagine existing furniture and accessories into something new or give a tired piece a mini-makeover with a fresh coat of paint or new hardware. Our IKEA bedroom hacks are a great place to find inspiration and ideas. With a little creativity and loving care, you’ll enjoy several new-to-you pieces that make your bedroom extra special.",
