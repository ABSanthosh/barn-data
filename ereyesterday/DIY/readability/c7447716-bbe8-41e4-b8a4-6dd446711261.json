  "text": "Live Streaming Sign in to your MUO account Jordan Gloor/MakeUseOf Quick Links With how accessible streaming platforms are, it's no surprise that you can get live TV channels now. You could be binging your favorite show, only to pop in a moment later to see your favorite sports team play. 1 Hulu + Live TV Hulu + Live TV is quite an extensive package, so much so that it's arguably the ideal choice if you have a family with diverse tastes. Not only are you getting access to Hulu, you get a subscription to Disney+ and ESPN+. Just having Hulu and Disney+ bundled is a good deal, but ESPN+, too? It's even sweeter. That's just the first half, though. The second half of the deal is a long list of over 95 live channels, including news, sports, and entertainment. For example, there's ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, CNN, Cartoon Network, BET, FX, NFL Network, FS1 and FS2, Lifetime, PBS and PBS Kids, Nickelodeon, Paramount, and more. In addition, you have access to DVR features and unlimited cloud storage for said content. Even if you know you're going to miss your favorite show, you can record it ahead of time. 2 Peacock If you're a deal-hunter, Peacock is one of the cheapest ways to jump into a streaming service and get live TV channels at the same time, despite Peacock raising its prices. Even with Premium Plus—the no-ads subscription—it's just $14 monthly. However, if you're a student or teacher, you can get it for a fraction of the price ($3 and $4, respectively). In terms of content, we're talking Hallmark, NBC, Sky News, TODAY All Day, NBC Sports, Premier League TV, WWE, GolfPass, NFL Wild Card, Nascar, IMSA, and even Sunday Night Football. Of course, Peacock is a streaming platform, and there's also a bunch of content to stream; in fact, it's the home of The Office, and who doesn't love binging that? 3 YouTube TV While DirecTV may have more channels than YouTube TV, the latter is by no means a slouch. In fact, it's on par with Fubo, which has over 100 live TV channels to pick from. What YouTube TV has over the other streaming services here is customization, and it has a lengthy 21-day trial period. For starters, just the base plan has over 140 live TV channels, including the very relaxing Zen Channel. It includes a mix of major news channels and entertainment, like CBS, MSNBC, Cartoon Network, Disney, Sports Network, ESPN News, and many more. YouTube TV has ESPN, FS1 and FS2, and CNBC Gold, too. The real kicker is the add-ons, where you can dig into more niche live TV channels, such as Sports Plus, Spanish Plus, Filipino Plus, and the Spanish Plan. That'll give you access to channels like AcornTV, BET+, Cinemax, Gaia, NFL Redzone, and Curiosity Stream. 4 DirecTV DirecTV is what you want to lean into if you don't want to be left out of anything, more or less. There are four packages—Entertainment, Choice, Ultimate, and Premier—and each one adds more and more channels, from 90+ to 185+. It's an embarrassment of channels. Even with the cheapest plan, you're still gaining access to FX, Disney, CNN, HGTV, ESPN (and ESPN2), as well as local channels and the Sports Pack. However, if you want regional sports networks, you'll get more from Choice and onward. That'll add channels like Bally Sports, NBA TV, and ESPNews. The Ultimate plan offers the most, of course, like NHL Network and STARZ Encore, but regardless of your subscription, you can also tack on extra channels, just like you can with YouTube TV. It's one of the few streaming platforms (on this list) that offer international channels, like Cine Mexicano. It gives a good bit of wiggle room if, say, you just want the Entertainment plan with a few added sports or movie channels thrown in. 5 Fubo Fubo should be your main consideration if you want to emphasize sports. You get access to MLB, NHL, NBA, and NFL and can catch up on the happenings in the leagues via ESPN. Fubo offers add-ons, too. There's NFL Redzone, Sports Plus, NBA League Pass, Adventure Plus, and International Sports Plus if you also enjoy soccer. More importantly, if Fubo airs channels your teams are playing, you'll be able to DVR the games for later. Fubo has plenty of popular live television channels outside of sports, too. For the kids, there's Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., and Disney. You can kick back with music channels like MTV, VH1, and CMT. One channel that does stand out as a bit of an oddball is Crunchyroll. It's a welcome site if you happen to enjoy anime. Regardless of your choice, one of these streaming platforms will be the perfect fit. Fubo is heavy on sports; DirecTV offers the most; YouTube TV is easily customizable; Peacock is affordable, and Hulu + Live TV has multiple streaming platforms wrapped into one. It's best to make a list of the channels you can't live without, then go from there.",

There are four packages—Entertainment, Choice, Ultimate, and Premier—and each one adds more and more channels, from 90+ to 185+. It\u0026#39;s an embarrassment of channels.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eEven with the cheapest plan, you\u0026#39;re still gaining access to FX, Disney, CNN, HGTV, ESPN (and ESPN2), as well as local channels and the Sports Pack. However, if you want regional sports networks, you\u0026#39;ll get more from Choice and onward. That\u0026#39;ll add channels like Bally Sports, NBA TV, and ESPNews.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe Ultimate plan offers the most, of course, like NHL Network and STARZ Encore, but regardless of your subscription, you can also tack on extra channels, just like you can with YouTube TV. It\u0026#39;s one of the few streaming platforms (on this list) that offer international channels, like Cine Mexicano. It gives a good bit of wiggle room if, say, you just want the Entertainment plan with a few added sports or movie channels thrown in.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"fubo\"\u003e\n

There\u0026#39;s NFL Redzone, Sports Plus, NBA League Pass, Adventure Plus, and International Sports Plus if you also enjoy soccer. More importantly, if Fubo airs channels your teams are playing, you\u0026#39;ll be able to DVR the games for later.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFubo has plenty of popular live television channels outside of sports, too. For the kids, there\u0026#39;s Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., and Disney. You can kick back with music channels like MTV, VH1, and CMT. One channel that does stand out as a bit of an oddball is Crunchyroll. It\u0026#39;s a welcome site if you happen to enjoy anime.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of your choice, one of these streaming platforms will be the perfect fit. Fubo is heavy on sports; DirecTV offers the most; YouTube TV is easily customizable; Peacock is affordable, and Hulu + Live TV has multiple streaming platforms wrapped into one. It\u0026#39;s best to make a list of the channels you can\u0026#39;t live without, then go from there.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n        \n\n\n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
