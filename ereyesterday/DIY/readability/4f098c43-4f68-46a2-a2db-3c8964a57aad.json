  "text": "Good news for us, our Florida home was not damaged in Hurricane Milton which surprised us since the storm passed directly over Sarasota. We were prepared for the worst but relieved that our home was okay. I watched the news all week nervous about the impacts to the place we’ve come to love so much, and I was saddened to read about the devastation caused to the community. One thing I’ve learned about Floridians is they are resilient, they waste no time cleaning up and rebuilding. Currently, our home is rented to a family displaced by the storms so we’re fortunate to be able to make it available. I’ve taken a few weeks off from posting because I’ve been engaging in the seven types of rest, and I’ve also had my focus elsewhere (good news that I’ll share soon). I didn’t want to feel overwhelmed so I paused projects and mid week articles during the past few weeks. I do look forward to sharing inspiring spaces or interesting articles in the weekend roundup and I know many of you look forward to it too. Favorite links from the week: The Fixer Upper lake house remodel part one and part two. This elegant home in Toronto with minimal tasteful decor. The soft palette in this Scandinavian inspired home. This California desert home captures modern hacienda style. Everything you want to know about limewash paint. I don’t agree with these interior design “mistakes”, do you? This DIY copper patina wreath is so pretty. Charming: these Dowager Countess quote napkins. I’m loving all of these smoked glass pieces this season. Why do we name tropical storms and hurricanes? There’s a scientific relationship between kindness and intelligence. October glimmers.",
