  "text": "Google Labs Sign in to your MUO account If you're sick and tired of having to actually read breaking news and interesting articles on Google Search and Discover, you'll be pleased to learn that you may not need to anymore. Instead, you can just listen to a five-minute podcast distilling your feed down to its core. Google Launches AI Podcasts for a Daily Listen As first reported by 9to5Google, Google Labs' latest experiment is an AI podcast called Daily Listen. This personalized podcast featuring two AI hosts will distill the subjects of the day that you're interested in down to a short podcast. The idea will be familiar to anyone who has listened to NotebookLM's Audio Overview feature, which creates a podcast out of whatever sources of information you feed it. And this is essentially the same idea, but with your Search and Discover habits feeding the podcast. You'll need to opt in to the Daily Listen experiment by enabling it under Search Labs in the top-left corner of the Google app. It's available in the US from today on both Android and iOS. Once you have opted in, Daily Listen will appear in the carousel below the Search bar at the top of the Google app. Once clicked, the podcast will play, with a transcript helping you follow along. You'll also find links to the stories, allowing you to explore the topics discussed more deeply. Will We Still Need Real Podcasters in the Future? Google's AI podcasts are surprisingly good. And even if you can't access the Daily Listen experiment at the moment, you can get a taste of the technology by trying NotebookLM's Audio Overview feature. Which begs the question: Are we even going to need real podcasters in the future? And by \"real,\" I mean living, breathing humans. Right now, the technology is impressive but nowhere near refined enough to cover different genres. Essentially, all these do at the moment is absorb information and then regurgitate it in the form of a podcast. Which means there's a lack of personality, and zero humor to speak of. However, artificial intelligence is improving all the time, and if some personality and the ability to riff on a subject is introduced at some point in the future, then Joe Rogan and his ilk may need to watch their backs.",

Google Search and Discover, you\u0026#39;ll be pleased to learn that you may not need to anymore. Instead, you can just listen to a five-minute podcast distilling your feed down to its core.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"google-launches-ai-podcasts-for-a-daily-listen\"\u003e\n                        Google Launches AI Podcasts for a Daily Listen\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs first reported by \u003ca href=\"https://9to5google.com/2025/01/08/google-discover-daily-listen/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e9to5Google\u003c/a\u003e, Google Labs\u0026#39; latest experiment is an AI podcast called Daily Listen. This personalized podcast featuring two AI hosts will distill the subjects of the day that you\u0026#39;re interested in down to a short podcast.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe idea will be familiar to anyone who has listened to \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/notebooklm-ai-podcasts-from-notes/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNotebookLM\u0026#39;s Audio Overview feature\u003c/a\u003e, which creates a podcast out of whatever sources of information you feed it. And this is essentially the same idea, but with your Search and Discover habits feeding the podcast.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026#39;ll need to opt in to the Daily Listen experiment by enabling it under \u003cstrong\u003eSearch Labs\u003c/strong\u003e in the top-left corner of the Google app. It\u0026#39;s available in the US from today on both Android and iOS.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you have opted in, Daily Listen will appear in the carousel below the Search bar at the top of the Google app. Once clicked, the podcast will play, with a transcript helping you follow along. You\u0026#39;ll also find links to the stories, allowing you to explore the topics discussed more deeply.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"will-we-still-need-real-podcasters-in-the-future\"\u003e\n                        Will We Still Need Real Podcasters in the Future?\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoogle\u0026#39;s AI podcasts are surprisingly good. And even if you can\u0026#39;t access the Daily Listen experiment at the moment, you can get a taste of the technology by trying NotebookLM\u0026#39;s Audio Overview feature.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhich begs the question: Are we even going to need real podcasters in the future? And by \u0026#34;real,\u0026#34; I mean living, breathing humans.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eRight now, the technology is impressive but nowhere near refined enough to cover different genres. Essentially, all these do at the moment is absorb information and then regurgitate it in the form of a podcast. Which means there\u0026#39;s a lack of personality, and zero humor to speak of.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-trends-2025/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eartificial intelligence is improving all the time\u003c/a\u003e, and if some personality and the ability to riff on a subject is introduced at some point in the future, then Joe Rogan and his ilk may need to watch their backs.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n        \n\n\n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
