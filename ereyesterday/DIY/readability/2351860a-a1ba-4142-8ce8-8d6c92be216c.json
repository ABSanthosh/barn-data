  "text": "Walmart Onn 4K Pro $44.73 $50 Save $5.27 The onn 4K Pro Streaming Device features hands-free voice control with  Google Assistant ,  4K Ultra HD resolution , and  Dolby Atmos/Dolby Vision . It has a  Quad-core Cortex-A55 CPU , Mali-G31 MP2 GPU, 3GB RAM, and 32GB storage. Walmart's Onn 4K Pro streaming device launched last year as a combination Nest speaker and Google TV streaming box. At only $50, it was already a great deal, but it just hit a price that makes it even harder to ignore. The Onn 4K Pro is currently on sale for $44.73, which is 10% off the usual price. That may not seem like much, but any discount on this already budget-friendly streamer is worth noting. In the 14 months since the device was released, this is only the second time it’s been discounted. The last sale saw it drop to $39, but we have no idea how long it will be before that happens again. So, what exactly are you getting for your money? The Onn 4K Pro boasts 4K UHD resolution, along with support for Dolby Audio and Dolby Vision, giving you a nice one-two punch for a solid audio-visual experience. It's powered by a quad-core Cortex-A55 CPU and Mali-G31 MP2 GPU, paired with a generous 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Related One of its standout features is hands-free voice control with Google Assistant (soon to be Gemini). You can literally sit on your couch and just tell your TV to play your favorite show without needing to find the remote (which is also easy, thanks to its handy remote finder function). Speaking of the remote, it's backlit, which is a small but significant detail that makes late-night streaming much more enjoyable. Connectivity is steady with Wi-Fi 6 ensuring speedy and reliable streaming, Google Cast built-in for streaming content from your phone or tablet, and even a USB 3.0 port for expandable storage. This means you can hook up external drives for even more media when you don't have an internet connection. If you've been looking to upgrade your streaming setup or simply want a capable, affordable device that offers a lot of bang for your buck, the Onn 4K Pro at this price is definitely worth considering. I can personally vouch for the Onn 4K Pro, as I’ve been using it as my main streaming device since it was released last year. You won’t regret it. Source: AFTVnews",

You can literally sit on your couch and just tell your TV to play your favorite show without needing to find the remote (which is also easy, thanks to its handy remote finder function). Speaking of the remote, it\u0026#39;s backlit, which is a small but significant detail that makes late-night streaming much more enjoyable.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eConnectivity is steady with Wi-Fi 6 ensuring speedy and reliable streaming, Google Cast built-in for streaming content from your phone or tablet, and even a USB 3.0 port for expandable storage. This means you can hook up external drives for even more media when you don\u0026#39;t have an internet connection.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;ve been looking to upgrade your streaming setup or simply want a capable, affordable device that offers a lot of bang for your buck, the Onn 4K Pro at this price is definitely worth considering. I can personally vouch for the Onn 4K Pro, as I’ve been using it as my main streaming device since it was released last year.
