Focus on business applications with AI cores \u0026 ray tracing units, not really optimized for gaming. \"Project Battlematrix\" offers a workstation platform supporting up to 8 Arc Pro B60 GPUs for AI processing. While most of us buy graphics cards for gaming, there are graphics cards for other purposes as well. NVIDIA has its Quadro range, and AMD's serious range is sold as the Radeon PRO series. Intel has been in the graphics business for two generations now, and the company is finally branching out that second gen into other non-gaming applications. Intel made a slew of announcements at Computex 2025 today, but the most important one is the addition of new GPUs that aren't just meant for gaming. The company is expanding its Arc Pro family with the new Intel Arc Pro B60 and Intel Arc Pro B50 GPUs. These are built upon the advanced Xe2 architecture that the rest of Intel's Arc B-series GPUs use. The Intel Arc Pro B60 will feature a substantial 24 gigabytes (GB) of memory, while the B50 will offer 16 GB—still pretty decent, as both feature more VRAM than Intel's current top-of-the-line Intel Arc B580 GPU. As a fun fact, Intel seems to have completely forgotten to announce a B770, so the B580 will continue being the higher-end one for the foreseeable future. Related It's Time to Start Taking Intel GPUs Seriously Thanks to lower prices and better drivers, Intel Arc GPUs are finally worth considering. The Arc Pro B60 and B50 GPUs come equipped with Intel Xe Matrix Extensions (XMX) AI cores and ray tracing units. Technically, these can play games just like regular Arc cards can, but they're meant more for business purposes than anything. Unlike the consumer-focused Arc gaming cards, the Pro series prioritizes stability, reliability, and performance in professional applications. These go into workstations, servers, and are meant for \"serious\" work. They can play games, but they're not as optimized for gaming as the consumer-grade Arc cards are, and they're probably a waste of money if you're not buying them for business purposes. Still, it's good to see Intel put effort into its business-grade GPUs. Intel also revealed \"Project Battlematrix,\" a configurable workstation-class platform based on Intel Xeon processors. This system can support up to a whopping eight Intel Arc Pro B60 24GB GPUs, mostly for AI processing purposes, which seems to be something these cards are heavily optimized for. \"The Intel Arc Pro B-Series showcases Intel’s commitment in GPU technology and ecosystem partnerships,” stated Vivian Lien, vice president and general manager of Client Graphics at Intel. She went on to further add that “with Xe2 architecture’s advanced capabilities and a growing software ecosystem, the new Arc Pro GPUs deliver accessibility and scalability to small and medium-sized businesses that have been looking for targeted solutions.” These cards will become available from multiple third-party manufacturers starting next month. No one should buy these for a gaming PC, and you might want to wait on the rest of Intel's B-series consumer-grade Arc GPUs, or just buy whatever's currently on store shelves. Source: Intel",

Technically, these can play games just like regular Arc cards can, but they\u0026#39;re meant more for business purposes than anything. Unlike the consumer-focused Arc gaming cards, the Pro series prioritizes stability, reliability, and performance in professional applications.
