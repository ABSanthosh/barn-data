It's a smaller release, but if you dig into the details, you'll find thoughtful refinements across core apps and settings that help simplify tasks and give you more control.From quick access settings in Mail to faster recovery options in Photos, iOS 18.5 trims a few extra steps from your daily workflow. AppleCare \u0026 Warranty details have also been reorganized, and the Back Tap detection banner returns after disappearing in iOS 18.4. Plus, Apple Wallet may soon support digital car keys for another vehicle brand.While the long-promised Apple Intelligence-powered Siri experience is still absent, iOS 18.5 continues laying the groundwork with subtle under-the-hood changes. And as usual, many of these features may also appear in iPadOS 18.5 for iPads.Here's a full look at everything new in iOS 18.5 so far.Back Tap triggers detection bannersDuring early versions of the iOS 18.4 beta, the Back Tap feature for iPhone briefly displayed a Double Tap Detected or Triple Tap Detected banner to let you know that the gesture was successful. You could disable the notification via Settings » Accessibility » Touch » Back Tap » Show Banner. While this feature didn't make the cut in iOS 18.4's official release, it's back in iOS 18.5. Mail has an easier way to toggle contact photosThe Mail app has an easier way to show or hide contact photos. Before, you could only set this via Settings » Apps » Mail » Show Contact Photos, but the Show Contact Photos options now appears in the More (•••) menu from any inbox view in Mail. (I've seen some people say online that the Group by Sender option in the same menu when viewing a non-Primary category is new, but I see it on iOS 18.4 and iOS 18.3.2, and it might have been around since iOS 18.2 when the feature was released.) Recover/Delete All shortcuts in Photos for the Recently Deleted albumWhen viewing the Recently Deleted album in the Photos app on iOS 18.4 and earlier, the Filter/View button was the only option at the bottom. To delete or recover all photos, you'd have to tap Select, then More (•••) first. Now, there is a large Recover All button at the bottom near the Filter/View button as well as a Delete All (the trash can icon) button, so you don't need to hit Select first anymore. Changes to AppleCare \u0026 Warranty settingsThe new update makes a few changes in relation to AppleCare coverage. First, go to Settings » General » AppleCare \u0026 Warranty, and you'll see a new banner at the top with a link to learn more about AppleCare coverage. If you have a lot of Apple devices, only some will be visible now, with an option to Show More. And strangely, the footer text mentions devices connected to your \"Apple ID\" instead of \"Apple Account\" like before.Tap on a device, and you'll see a slightly different UI, where the plan name and renewal date are in the same box as the coverage details. This box also shows the device's serial number now. AppleCare info is available in Apple Account settingsIn another AppleCare change, visit Settings » Apple Account and pick a device in the list, and you'll now see an option to view AppleCare or warranty information, which takes you to the new layout discussed above. Digital car key support for XPeng vehiclesA new file in iOS 18.5 reveals digital car key support for XPeng vehicles via Apple Wallet. The XPEV.plist asset, attributed to the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer XPeng, outlines secure communication parameters, signal thresholds for proximity-based unlocking, and certificate infrastructure for pairing and encryption. It includes support for both iPhone and Apple Watch, as well as Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and NFC technologies — hallmarks of Apple's existing Car Key system.While XPeng drivers already have access to Apple CarPlay for infotainment and navigation, they've lacked deeper integration with Apple Wallet. With iOS 18.5 and watchOS 11.5, digital car key functionality would allow iPhone and Apple Watch owners to lock, unlock, and start compatible XPeng vehicles wirelessly — offering a seamless and secure experience directly from their devices.Don't Miss: 70+ iPhone Features in iOS 18.4 — Here's Everything That's New and ChangedCover image and screenshots by Gadget Hacks.",
