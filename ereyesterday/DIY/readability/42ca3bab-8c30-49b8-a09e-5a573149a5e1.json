The store’s latest product launches for 2025 stand behind the gold standard of design: to marry form and function. IKEA also strives to celebrate and reimagine old favorites, like with the FRIHETEN sectional sleeper. A New Look for the IKEA FRIHETEN Photo Credit: FRIHETEN Sleeper Sectional | IKEA.com The FRIHETEN sectional has been on the IKEA roster for a while now. The extremely popular sofa series made its debut in 2015 and was a go-to for many people seeking a comfortable and affordable flexible furniture solution. One of the only drawbacks (according to some) was the limited color line-up. For the longest time, the FRIHETEN sofas came in blue, black, or shades of gray. However, in January 2025, a new color option, faringe brown-orange, joined the FRIHETEN line-up. Does this mean more colors are on the horizon for this IKEA best-seller? Only time will tell. But the coveted functionality of this sleeper is what makes it such a win. The sofa pulls triple duty, providing a comfortable place to sit, extra storage, and a spare bed, and it looks good while doing it. Sectional To Full-Sized Bed In Seconds Photo Credit: FRIHETEN Sleeper Sectional | IKEA.com A sofa sleeper is a staple in many multifunctional rooms, turning a living room or home office into a guest room in seconds. The FRIHETEN sectional offers ample seating and converts to a spacious bed for overnight guests. The bonus is the storage under the seats. There’s extra room to store pillows, blankets, and bedding, which is always a plus when maximizing every inch of space. The FRIHETEN sectional also offers versatility, providing the option to position the chaise on either the couch’s left or right side. Extra Comfort With KLAGSHAMN Hide your sleeper’s accessories in plain sight with the KLAGSHAMN mattress pad and KLAGSHAMN cushion covers. These two products come together to form the KLAGSHAMN back cushion, which works perfectly with the FRIHETEN and delivers added support and comfort. Great Option for Smaller Spaces Photo Credit: FRIHETEN Sleeper Sofa | IKEA.com Even a streamlined sectional like the FRIHETEN may be a bit too ambitious for extra-small spaces. However, you still get the same advantages with the best-selling FRIHETEN sleeper with storage. This is a three-seater sofa that’s ideal for smaller spaces that need to convert to a guest room quickly. The width is roughly two inches smaller, plus you don’t have the added depth of the chaise. Ironically, when opened to a bed, the three-seater takes up slightly more depth, but the difference is miniscule in comparison. Either way, always measure carefully before you buy any new furniture to make sure your new purchase fits well in your home. Sleeper Storage Isn’t Just for Sheets Photo Credit: FRIHETEN Sleeper Sectional | IKEA.com You may assume that the storage in a sofa sleeper is just for extra bedding and pillows. However, if you already have your spare sheets tucked away in a nearby linen closet, then the possibilities become endless. Use the FRIHETEN to store board games, making them easy to grab fast during family game nights. Hide the kid’s toys when company comes over so your living room doesn’t always look like a playroom. Store off-season clothing, throw blankets, or your dog’s toys. Or maybe you want to use the FRIHETEN chaise to craft a cozy book nook? The only caveat would be to pay attention to the weight of what you put inside. The load-bearing abilities of the sleeper unit aren’t necessarily made to hold excessive amounts of weight. Therefore, consider this before you load it up too much. IKEA’s website mentions testing weight limits with people weighing up to 242 pounds. For total weight capacity, other sites mention 600 pounds. Basically, be prudent when choosing what you store, and don’t overload the compartment. There is a 10-year limited warranty on the FRIHETEN, but it’s at IKEA’s discretion. Is the FRIHETEN a Good Fit for You? Photo Credit: FRIHETEN Sleeper Sectional | IKEA.com If you need a space-saving solution that delivers comfort, practicality, and affordability, then the FRIHETEN might be just the couch for you. The new faringe brown-orange color gives new life to an old favorite, without taking away what makes the FRIHETEN special — multi-functionality.
