My daughter the chef is always a big help to me, so Thanksgivings are easier than they were a decade ago when I was chasing littles and cooking for a large group. I buy the brined natural turkey at Trader Joe’s it’s always tasty and saves me so much time because it’s already brined. I’m also completing two holiday crafts between baking and prepping. I’ll also share my simple Thanksgiving tablescape later this week and the holiday crafts when complete! Favorite links from the week: The minimalist neutral holiday decor in this London home is simple and calm. This modern home has the dreamiest laundry room with a folding island. This lakeside home’s kitchen cabinets are the prettiest color. This light and bright summer compound has the most elegant wet bar. Lovers of color and pattern will appreciate this designer’s portfolio. Classic and understated: this neutral and timeless dining space. Hosting during the holidays? Consider including these items for your overnight guests. Designer’s weigh in: the ten things to keep out of your dining room. I bought six of these smoked old fashioned glasses for winter cocktails and love them! Classic Christmas movies to stream (I adore The Bishop’s Wife). Christmas markets around the world. (We’re planning on Germany and France next year!) 31 days of Christmas activities for a festive December. The Lego Botanical Collection now has holiday decorations. Cambridge dictionary’s Word of the Year for 2024.",
