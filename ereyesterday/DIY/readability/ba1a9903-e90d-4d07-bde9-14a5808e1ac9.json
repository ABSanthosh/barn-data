  "text": "Sign in to your MUO account One of the best new iOS features—and one I've long wanted for my Android devices—is finally coming to Android. At long last, your Android device will restart automatically if you don't unlock it for three days, providing a significant security and privacy boost. Google Finally Rolls Out Automatic Device Restart Feature As first reported by 9to5Google, Google is bringing this new security feature to Android in its upcoming Google Play version 25.14 update. According to Google's update notes, the Play services update \"Enables a future optional security feature, which will automatically restart your device if locked for 3 consecutive days.\" It really is a significant security boost. The automatic restart returns your Android device to what's known as a \"Before First Unlock (BFU)\" state. This means your device and its contents are fully encrypted and thus, much more difficult to access should your Android device fall into the wrong hands. Basically, if someone grabs your phone or you forget it, you have a modicum more security than before. However—and I address this in the next section—adjustable time would massively boost the security offered by this feature. Now, while this is great for Android device owners, iOS users have had access to a similar feature since iOS 18.1 (the same iOS update that launched Apple Intelligence). The new Android security feature is very similar to the existing iOS tool. Customization Will Make Automatic Restart More Secure I appreciate a new Android security like the next person, but some extra functionality would be really useful here. For example, three days is a decent amount of time for an automatic restart to secure the device. However, it would be excellent if this was customizable to specific time periods. Reducing the reset period would increase security, allowing you to adjust based on your situation and environment. Another really useful feature is notifications. A notification sent to a linked device that your primary (or whichever) Android device has automatically reset would be supremely useful. It could also be paired with an unlock code, PIN, or biometric on the paired device. Finally, it's currently unclear as to whether this Google Play service update will also apply to other all Android devices. It's certain to appear on smartphones and tablets, but there is no official information regarding Google TV, Wear, and so on. Of course, this is just one Android security feature. There are numerous tips you can use to keep your Android devices safe, which are best used in combination.",

id=\"article-body\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the best new iOS features—and one I\u0026#39;ve long wanted for my Android devices—is finally coming to Android. At long last, your Android device will restart automatically if you don\u0026#39;t unlock it for three days, providing a significant security and privacy boost.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"google-finally-rolls-out-automatic-device-restart-feature\"\u003e\n                        Google Finally Rolls Out Automatic Device Restart Feature\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs first reported by \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/649247/chatgpt-image-library\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e9to5Google\u003c/a\u003e, Google is bringing this new security feature to Android in its upcoming \u003ca href=\"https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoogle Play version 25.14 update\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Google\u0026#39;s update notes, the Play services update \u0026#34;Enables a future optional security feature, which will automatically restart your device if locked for 3 consecutive days.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIt really is a significant security boost. The automatic restart returns your Android device to what\u0026#39;s known as a \u0026#34;Before First Unlock (BFU)\u0026#34; state. This means your device and its contents are fully encrypted and thus, much more difficult to access should your Android device fall into the wrong hands.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eBasically, if someone grabs your phone or you forget it, you have a modicum more security than before. However—and I address this in the next section—adjustable time would massively boost the security offered by this feature.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eNow, while this is great for Android device owners, iOS users have had access to a similar feature since iOS 18.1 (the same \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiOS update that launched Apple Intelligence\u003c/a\u003e). The new Android security feature is very similar to the existing iOS tool.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"customization-will-make-automatic-restart-more-secure\"\u003e\n                        Customization Will Make Automatic Restart More Secure\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI appreciate a new Android security like the next person, but some extra functionality would be really useful here.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFor example, three days is a decent amount of time for an automatic restart to secure the device. However, it would be excellent if this was customizable to specific time periods. Reducing the reset period would increase security, allowing you to adjust based on your situation and environment.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAnother really useful feature is notifications. A notification sent to a linked device that your primary (or whichever) Android device has automatically reset would be supremely useful. It could also be paired with an unlock code, PIN, or biometric on the paired device.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it\u0026#39;s currently unclear as to whether this Google Play service update will also apply to other all Android devices. It\u0026#39;s certain to appear on smartphones and tablets, but there is no official information regarding Google TV, Wear, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, this is just one Android security feature.
