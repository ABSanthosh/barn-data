But what if I told you that your dream of having a beautiful built-in bookcase was only a DIY project away? Mia of @just_a_scandi turns a few BILLY bookcases into a stunning built-in unit complete with firewood storage. IKEA hacks featuring the ever-popular BILLY bookcase have shown countless ways to create a custom masterpiece without a high-end price tag. For Mia, a budget-friendly built-in was the perfect way to put their personal stamp on their new home. The home was built in the early 2000s and had white walls, light floors, and basic materials. It was a clean, minimal look that didn’t really fit their style, so they decided to add a little timeless elegance and character with this IKEA BILLY bookcase hack. The project fits their limited budget and provides a custom, built-in storage area for books and firewood. What You’ll Need 1 IKEA BILLY bookcase (31½” x 79 ½”) 2 IKEA BILLY bookcases (15¾” x 79 ½”) Hardboard (masonite) Baseboard and crown molding Wood glue Screws Filler/Spackle Primer and wall paint LED strip Baking paper (to protect the paint under the firewood) Circular saw Cut and miter saw Screw gun/drill Sandpaper Nail gun Level Tape measure A Timeless Built-In BILLY Bookcase Perfect for Storing Firewood, Books, or Anything Else 1. Plan Your Design The creator devoted a lot of time to the design part of this project, which turned out to be a good idea when it came to the actual build. But they point out that the setup does have a lot of flexibility, admitting that using four 15 ¾” or two 31 ½” BILLY shelves would have worked equally well. Therefore, plan out your design according to your space to figure out the best setup for you. Sketch out ideas and measure carefully to decide on the best configuration before you start making anything. 2. Build the Firewood Storage Mia suggests working backwards when it comes to building the firewood storage piece. To determine the necessary dimensions, consider your ceiling height, the height of the BILLYs, and the size of your baseboards and crown molding. Select a hardboard that has the same thickness as the BILLY bookcases to maintain a uniform look. Build the firewood storage out of the masonite. Add extra walls to the firewood storage to match the extra thickness of where the different BILLYs meet. Mia mentions, “Dividers in the firewood storage were added for aesthetics and structural support.” 3. Assemble and Prep the BILLY Bookcases Put together the BILLY bookcases according to IKEA’s instructions. Patch any unused holes and sand the entire unit to get it ready for painting. Set the BILLY bookcases on top of the firewood storage and attach everything to the wall to secure it in place. 4. Prime and Paint Everything Prime everything with an adhesion primer. Allow the primer to dry, then paint the shelves and firewood storage. Mia opted to paint everything the same color as their walls. However, you could pretty much do anything you want when it comes to color, depending on the look you’re going for. 5. Add Panels for a Built-In Look After painting, add hardboard panels to the sides to finish off the look and give it that built-in feel. The addition of baseboards (that match the rest of the baseboards in your house) and crown molding also contributes to the custom, built-in look. Fill any seams, then paint to create a seamless, smooth finish. 6. Light Things Up With LEDs The hacker used an electrician to add an LED strip at the top of the shelves. However, there are also rechargeable, battery-operated LED strips that could provide the same look if you don’t want to foot the bill for an electrician. A Built-In for Any Budget After buying the BILLY bookshelves and other supplies, you could recreate this hack for about $350 to $500. This is a steal when it comes to custom built-ins (not counting the cost of an electrician). The creator also offers this final tip to keep your creation looking beautiful: “Place baking paper at the bottom of the firewood storage to protect the paint. It’s barely noticeable and easy to replace when needed.” Want to recreate this hack?
