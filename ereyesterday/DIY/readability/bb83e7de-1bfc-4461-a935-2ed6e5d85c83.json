  "text": "Sign in to your MUO account It's fair to say that when Airbnb launched in 2007, it disrupted the vacation industry. All of a sudden, there was an easy way to book a stay in someone's home, all through an app. And now, Airbnb is looking to disrupt the market all over again. Airbnb Services to Make Your Stay Special The first thing that Airbnb is doing is adding services to its offerings. Services are, as the name suggests, services designed to make your stay more special. Airbnb Services include everything from professional chefs to spa treatments, from personal training to hair stylists. The people providing the services are all vetted, and boast an average of 10 years of experience. Prices start at $50, and at launch will be available in 260 cities. Airbnb will be adding new offerings and locations over time. The best part is that you can book a service in your own home, with no need to be staying in an Airbnb at the time. Airbnb Experiences Let You Explore With Locals Next up are Airbnb Experiences, designed to allow you to live like a local. While many of us will have embarked on an excursion or two while on vacation, Airbnb wants to look beyond the standard tour groups. Instead, you'll be able to book experiences with locals who know their cities. There are museum tours, cooking classes, wildlife experiences, and much more. Airbnb Originals will up the game even further, offering the opportunity to share experiences with celebrities including Sabrina Carter and Patrick Mahomes (for a price). Experiences are initially available in 650 cities around the world, with Airbnb promising to add more over time. An All-New Airbnb App Makes It All Accessible The final piece of this puzzle is the all-new Airbnb app that's designed to make it easier to find and book homes, experiences, and services. Given the expansion of its offerings, Airbnb has, according to its press release, rebuilt the app from the ground up. The Explore tab is your gateway to everything Airbnb offers, allowing you to search for homes, experiences, and services. Once you book a trip, you'll see a Trips tab with a detailed itinerary. There's also a redesigned profile page, and a revamped messaging platform. The key here is that Airbnb wants to move beyond just pairing you with hosts with places you may want to stay. Instead, like a hotel would offer, as well as providing your accommodation needs, Airbnb can now provide experiences and services on top of that. Previously, you may have opened the Airbnb app (or one of the Airbnb alternatives) a couple of times a year to search for and book some accomodation for a vacation. However, these changes could make you more likely to check it out regularly to see what is being offered in your area.",

the vacation industry. All of a sudden, there was an easy way to book a stay in someone\u0026#39;s home, all through an app. And now, Airbnb is looking to disrupt the market all over again.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"airbnb-services-to-make-your-stay-special\"\u003e\n                        Airbnb Services to Make Your Stay Special\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing that Airbnb is doing is adding services to its offerings. Services are, as the name suggests, services designed to make your stay more special. Airbnb Services include everything from professional chefs to spa treatments, from personal training to hair stylists.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe people providing the services are all vetted, and boast an average of 10 years of experience. Prices start at $50, and at launch will be available in 260 cities. Airbnb will be adding new offerings and locations over time.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe best part is that you can book a service in your own home, with no need to be staying in an Airbnb at the time.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"airbnb-experiences-let-you-explore-with-locals\"\u003e\n                        Airbnb Experiences Let You Explore With Locals\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eNext up are Airbnb Experiences, designed to allow you to live like a local. While many of us will have embarked on an excursion or two while on vacation, Airbnb wants to look beyond the standard tour groups. Instead, you\u0026#39;ll be able to book experiences with locals who know their cities.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThere are museum tours, cooking classes, wildlife experiences, and much more. Airbnb Originals will up the game even further, offering the opportunity to share experiences with celebrities including Sabrina Carter and Patrick Mahomes (for a price).\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eExperiences are initially available in 650 cities around the world, with Airbnb promising to add more over time.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"an-all-new-airbnb-app-makes-it-all-accessible\"\u003e\n                        An All-New Airbnb App Makes It All Accessible\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final piece of this puzzle is the all-new Airbnb app that\u0026#39;s designed to make it easier to find and book homes, experiences, and services. Given the expansion of its offerings, Airbnb has, according to \u003ca href=\"https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-2025-summer-release/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eits press release\u003c/a\u003e, rebuilt the app from the ground up.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe Explore tab is your gateway to everything Airbnb offers, allowing you to search for homes, experiences, and services. Once you book a trip, you\u0026#39;ll see a Trips tab with a detailed itinerary. There\u0026#39;s also a redesigned profile page, and a revamped messaging platform.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe key here is that Airbnb wants to move beyond just pairing you with hosts with places you may want to stay. Instead, like a hotel would offer, as well as providing your accommodation needs, Airbnb can now provide experiences and services on top of that.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003ePreviously, you may have opened the Airbnb app (or one of \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/best-airbnb-app-alternatives-for-vacation-rentals/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Airbnb alternatives\u003c/a\u003e) a couple of times a year to search for and book some accomodation for a vacation.
