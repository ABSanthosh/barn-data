These cute bookshelves from Sarah Klingenberg @sarahs_scandi_home are just right for a child’s room or nursery. The front-facing covers create a boutique bookstore vibe. Plus, it’s a great way for kids to identify books easily, and it transforms book storage into wall art. We did something similar in my son’s room when he was little (except we used PVC rain gutters — I wish I had seen this hack back then.) But one of my favorite things about this picture ledge hack, besides the cute scalloped edges, is the super short list of items! What You’ll Need (for Two Shelves) 2 MOSSLANDA picture ledges (21 ¾”) 8 BEGRIPA handles (Four 2-packs) Heavy-duty adhesive Super Quick Hack for Sweet Scalloped Shelves 1. Open Your IKEA Products I know, it’s silly to make this a step, but there are so few steps to this hack, I had to! That’s a good thing. So, unwrap your BEGRIPA handles and MOSSLANDA picture ledges. 2. Position and Glue Handles Into Place Test out the fit of the four handles on the ledge, then glue them in place with a heavy-duty adhesive. Sarah advises being more generous with the glue than she was. 3. Hang the Shelves Allow the handles to dry, then hang your cute, new shelves. Use wall anchors if necessary to keep the ledges nice and sturdy. How Much Does This Scalloped Shelf Hack Cost? The MOSSLANDA shelf is $7.99, and a two-pack of BEGRIPA handles is $7. Therefore, if you plan to make two shelves, you’re looking at approximately $44 plus tax. Not bad. Scope out Facebook Marketplace or similar sites for second-hand picture ledges, and you’ll spend even less. I’m always seeing popular IKEA items there. But still, $7.99 keeps the MOSSLANDA super affordable. Check out the hack, and follow Sarah Klingenberg @sarahs_scandi_home for more beautiful ideas and designs. She has several other stunning projects and spaces to inspire you. Mix-and-Match for Different Shelfie Looks The all-white look of Sarah’s shelves is nice and crisp and clean. However, the ledges and handles come in various colors and finishes, so feel free to mix and match different options. Of course, painting is always another way to change things up. You could also follow the same steps using the longer MOSSLANDA ledge and doubling up on the handles. (You’ll have about 4 ¼” leftover, so mark the handle positions before gluing so you can get the spacing even.) Do More With MOSSLANDA ledges Don’t need any book storage? Hang the ledge upside-down for a downward-facing scallop and create stylish display shelves. Use them to show off your favorite collection or fill them with small succulents to create a modified living wall. There are tons of possibilities for the MOSSLANDA ledges. Create an adorable baby closet or a functional charging station that hides away when you don’t need it. What ideas can you come up with?
