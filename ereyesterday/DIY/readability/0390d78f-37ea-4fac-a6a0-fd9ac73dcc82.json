That’s exactly what caught my attention when I stumbled upon this brilliant wall-to-wall desk and storage setup by Amy Wolfe (@foxgloves_and_wolfe). Amy transformed a blank wall into a multifunctional command center using the IKEA TROFAST shelf and wall storage units. The result? A sleek, supersized workspace that delivers a ton of storage and surface space, perfect for everything from homework to hobbies. “My goal was to create a bespoke all-in-one storage and desk solution for my little one to play and do homework,” Amy explains. And all it took was one day for Amy to assemble the units and fasten them to the wall. Mission accomplished! With style and time to spare. What You’ll Need 2 IKEA TROFAST storage combinations (36 ⅝” x 17 ⅜” x 20 ½”) 1 IKEA TROFAST storage shelf (36 ⅝” x 17 ⅜” x 20 ½”) 2 IKEA TROFAST wall storage units  (36 ⅝” x 8 ¼” x 11 ¾”) 8 legs with fixing plates 4 small brackets Wood glue Bin wraps Bin labels Basics — tape measure, drill, screw gun Stud finder Level All-In-One Children’s Table With Storage System 1. Assemble the TROFAST Units (Including Legs) Put together the two wall storage units and two of the TROFAST shelving systems. It’s not necessary to assemble the third shelving system since you’ll only be using the top panel (for the desktop). Add your legs of choice to the two floor shelving units (four legs on each). Amy purchased her furniture legs on Amazon, similar to these wooden legs, which come with fixing plates. You can also select from various sizes if you prefer a shorter or taller desk. 2. Set Up the Bottom Units Position the first shelving unit where you want it on the wall. Lay the top panel (for the desktop) on the floor next to the unit, then position the second shelf. Make sure your layout is how you want it, then secure the first shelf to the wall using the included safety hardware. Attach the desktop using wood glue and basic brackets that screw into the side units and the underside of the desktop. Put one in each corner. Finally, secure the second shelving unit to the wall. 3. Mount the TROFAST Wall Storage Line up the TROFAST wall shelves with the bottom units and mount them at the desired height. Use a stud finder to locate the wall studs, and use appropriate anchors when necessary. 4. Wrap and Label the Bins To jazz up the plain white TROFAST bins, Amy used patterned wraps from Toddle\u0026Play. They have a bunch of different styles and colors that fit the TROFAST bins. (Similar wrappers on Etsy.) To make it easy to find things (and put them away), labels were a must. Amy chose some cute, round birch labels made from Fox \u0026 Bramble UK. (Similar wooden bin labels on Etsy) 5. Finish with a comfy chair Amy originally placed stools under the desk, but later swapped them out for a more comfortable chair—perfect for helping her child settle in for longer stretches of drawing or reading. How long and how much did it cost? Amy said she assembled all the units and attached everything to the wall in one day. The best part is you can recreate the look for under $400, which, for a project of this scale, is a great price.  What was the hardest part about this hack? Anything people should pay special attention to? “Making sure everything was level, as our 300-year-old cottage has wonky walls!” You can see more of the walls and the challenges in Amy’s Insta highlights (title: Little’s Room). Amy advises attaching all the units to the wall to make them extra secure and prevent tipping. (The TROFAST units typically come with straps and hardware for this purpose.) She also cautions to take your time positioning the brackets underneath the desktop so it’s fitted flush to the side storage pieces. Looking back, what would you have done differently? “Done it sooner! It’s really transformed playtime.” Personally, I think it looks amazing and would be up for trying it in our son’s room. I’m no stranger to the TROFAST series. We recently purchased the tiered shelves for LEGO storage. Like Amy, I opted for the natural pine style. So far, no regrets. (Some folks find the bins slip a little, but this hack keeps them put.) My hubby and I have discussed using this series for other home projects, and this one might make the list. Although I’m not quite sure we have the wall space to handle the full size. We could fix that, though, by cutting down the desktop piece in the middle. What do you think? Would this hack make a difference in your home? Would you do anything differently? Let us know in the comments below.
