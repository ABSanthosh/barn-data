  "text": "I've finally done it—sold my smart TV. Now, I'm completely done with smart TVs, and any other TV for that matter, and it could just be time for you to do the same. 8 Too Much Space I've become more of an essentialist over the past few years. I don't think full-on minimalism is the right way for me (at least from a material perspective), but being intentional about what I do with my time—along with the items I own—has been hugely beneficial. I regularly audit my life to determine what is and isn't serving me, and this time, my smart TV made the chopping board. I live in quite a small apartment, and using our space wisely is very important. When I looked at things honestly, I would have needed to remove something else for the TV to continue making sense. I wasn't willing to get rid of my desk or work corner, nor did I want to use the spare room; if I did the latter, I know for a fact my TV would've gathered dust. Digvijay Kumar / MakeUseOf This left me with only one choice that made sense: To get rid of it completely. 7 Mindless Consumption Was Too Easy Ever since reading Digital Minimalism for the first time, I've become much more aware of my digital consumption habits. However, I am far from perfect. I sometimes slip back into my old ways, and often, it creeps up on me over time. Earlier in the year, I became annoyed with how I had let my digital consumption increase beyond what I liked. My screen time rose significantly, and I caught myself trying to fill my spare time with stimulation when sitting still or going for a walk would've been more fulfilling and effective. Jack Mitchell/MakeUseOf For me, having a smart TV was a particular source of mindless consumption. I would often switch on random shows because I wanted to justify having the TV, but in reality, I found those programs boring and almost always a waste of time. To stem the tide and get back to a position of strength, I decided enough was enough. Since then, I've also sought to set firmer boundaries with other devices, which includes deleting all apps with even the slightest risk of me spiraling into overconsumption. 6 I Can Access What I Need From My Tablet For a long time, I had questioned whether I even needed a smart TV. Compared to my iPad, the benefits were minimal. Sure, I could watch shows with others, but I would rather host a nice dinner than mindlessly watch a show I know nobody is actually interested in. If I ever need to watch TV on my own, I'd much rather use my tablet. I can take it everywhere, from my living room to the airport if I'm traveling. When combined with gadgets to stay stress-free during travel, this is a great option to kill time while waiting for a flight. Mahnoor Faisal/MakeUseOf The only reason I even had a smart TV before was because I didn't have a tablet. With the need now eliminated, the choice to keep one would've been based on sunk cost fallacy rather than logic. 5 It Was Another Piece of Tech to Worry About Digital Minimalism applies largely to social media and other online tools, but I also think it's worth adopting a critical approach to technology in general. I don't understand the point in having certain tools just because others do, especially if they add more stress to your life. Combined with my declining use of it anyway, I got fed up with having to worry about my smart TV all the time. Besides more concerns like someone seeing it and wanting to steal it, I also didn't want to deal with software updates or potential digital security threats. Yes, it's important to protect your smart home from hackers. Another issue was having to call a technician or repair the problem myself if it stopped working. In addition to my TV, I already had to worry about my smartphone, Apple Watch, iPad, computer, headphones, and various other gadgets. Rather than adding more to my plate, I felt it was time to eliminate some things. 4 I Wanted More Meaningful Conversations TVs are, in my opinion, a great way to mindlessly consume content while not talking to the other person you're in the room with. I'd argue it's just as sinister as both people scrolling on their smartphones, if not more. Since this didn't feel like the best way to spend time, I decided to take action. When you live with someone, I think it's wise to spend at least some time daily having a conversation with them. You don't need to debate the works of Nietzsche every day, but at least speaking about your days is a good idea. This is even more important if that person is a partner. For me, owning a smart TV stopped me from having those conversations. As a result, I wanted to remove it from my life and make room for more meaningful interactions. 3 I Didn't Use Most Streaming Subscriptions Even before selling my smart TV, I had made a conscious effort to reduce the number of subscriptions I had. Canceling all streaming subscriptions for a few months had numerous beneficial effects for me, such as determining what was actually valuable. Unsurprisingly, I realized the majority were time-fillers and not much more. After auditing my subscriptions, I kept Max and Disney+ (Max is better than Netflix for my needs). However, I did not see the point in keeping live sports subscriptions. My life is full of so many other things that I rarely watch events; instead, I'd rather catch up with the highlights in one go on a Sunday evening. GPT-4o / MakeUseOf I decided I did not need a smart TV or any other subscription, such as YouTube Premium, either. I gave up video gaming a long time ago and no longer have a console, so I couldn't even justify having a TV for those reasons either. 2 No More Keeping Up With the Joneses While we can say \"don't compare yourself to others\" until the cows come home, humans naturally compare themselves to others. It doesn't matter how many books you've read about stoicism or the number of self-esteem affirmations you have shouted at yourself in the mirror. The \"keeping up with the Joneses\" phenomenon took me years to disconnect from. Once I critically assessed why I made the decisions I did, I realized one reason I cared about having a TV was to look successful to others. As soon as I noticed this, I got rid of my smart TV without thinking twice. The same went for every other status symbol in my house, like clothes I didn't actually want. 1 I Wanted Fewer Screens in My Life Nowadays, we have screens everywhere. The checkout till at my grocery store is a self-checkout. We check our phones multiple times daily, and many people also work on computers. I truly believe one key to a good life is to limit the number of screens you have, and I wanted to run this experiment. (Spoiler: It worked.) I looked at my own life and audited everything. All unnecessary screens were removed. My TV was one of those, and I'm much happier without it. Selling my smart TV has been a great decision, and I have zero regrets whatsoever. I have more space in my house and less of an excuse to consume mindlessly. Moreover, I've audited my subscriptions even further; saving money as a byproduct is nice, I must admit.",

I don\u0026#39;t understand the point in having certain tools just because others do, especially if they add more stress to your life.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eCombined with my declining use of it anyway, I got fed up with having to worry about my smart TV all the time. Besides more concerns like someone seeing it and wanting to steal it, I also didn\u0026#39;t want to deal with software updates or potential digital security threats.

In addition to my TV, I already had to worry about my smartphone, Apple Watch, iPad, computer, headphones, and various other gadgets.

I\u0026#39;d argue it\u0026#39;s just as sinister as both people scrolling on their smartphones, if not more. Since this didn\u0026#39;t feel like the best way to spend time, I decided to take action.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eWhen you live with someone, I think it\u0026#39;s wise to spend at least some time daily having a conversation with them. You don\u0026#39;t need to debate the works of Nietzsche every day, but at least speaking about your days is a good idea. This is even more important if that person is a partner.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eFor me, owning a smart TV stopped me from having those conversations.

However, I did not see the point in keeping live sports subscriptions.
