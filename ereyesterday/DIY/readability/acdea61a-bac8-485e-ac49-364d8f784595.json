They’re convenient and functional, and sometimes it’s easy to treat them like an afterthought. But since they’re smaller, they offer a perfect opportunity to have a little fun with your design, show off your style, and make a statement. Smaller pieces, like side tables, present less of a commitment than a huge couch or dining table. Therefore, they’re no-brainers for doing something bold or experimenting with a swanky DIY like Cheryl Brown (@cb_loves_interiors_20) did with this IKEA hack. Cheryl transforms IKEA’s simple BLANDA MATT serving bowls into an elegant, modern round side table. First, I think that anyone who looks at a bowl and sees its potential as a table is extremely artistic and clever. But I also love this hack because of how much it allows the creator to channel their unique creativity and imagination. What You’ll Need 4 IKEA BLANDA MATT bowls (in your desired size) Threaded bar with washers and nuts (optional, but does add stability) Multi-purpose adhesive Drill Wood filler Sandpaper Primer Paint See How BLANDA MATT Bowls Become a Stylish Side Table Photo Credit: Cheryl Brown @cb_loves_interiors_20 | Instagram 1. Stack the Bowls Arrange the bowls into a tower, top-to-bottom, to create the base for your side table. Make sure the edges are lined up correctly, and secure the bowls together using strong glue. Cheryl uses an instant contact adhesive. 2. Provide Extra Stability To add stability to the table, drill a hole through the center and install a threaded bar that reaches through all the bowls. Secure the bar in place with the appropriate nuts. The hacker mentions that the table stands well on its own without the bar. However, she added it upon her husband’s suggestion and now the table is “100% solid.” 3. Fill the Cracks Fill the gaps between where the tops of the bowls meet with some wood filler. Allow it to dry and sand it lightly to make the surface smooth. 4. Prime and Paint Prime and paint the table with your favorite color. Paint it all in one shade or mix it up with a different hue for each bowl. 5. Add the Topper Cheryl used a marble top from H\u0026M. She suggests finding a similar style on Amazon or cutting a circle out of MDF and painting it. Attach the topper with adhesive (try a super glue for multiple surfaces) and allow it to dry before moving the table. Is It Worth It? Photo Credit: Cheryl Brown @cb_loves_interiors_20 | Instagram A few commenters wondered why do the hack when you could likely get a similar table already made for around the same price.  If you opt for the 11” bowls, they run about $25 each, then you need the supplies, so you could pay around $140. If you decide to make a shorter and smaller table with the 8” bowls ($10 apiece) you might spend about $80. However, it’s a good bet that if you’re considering this DIY project, you’re relatively crafty or handy. Maybe you already have some wood filler or leftover primer and paint from your last project. In many cases, you might only need to buy the bowls. Plus, I have to say, I searched for similar tables online and didn’t find anything that looked comparable for under a few hundred. Not to mention, you’re making something that’s your own, turning it into a conversation starter and a meaningful piece for your home. Either way, the majority of people loved the concept, earning it over 133,000 likes. This BLANDA MATT Bowl Hack Serves Up Plenty of Creative Options Making a side table also gives you more control over the finished project. In the case of the BLANDA Matt bowl transformation, you could change the color, the topper material or size, or get even more creative. For example, one commenter, Luca (@lb.lucaballerini) suggested, “What if the top is hinged or something, so you can also store things?” This made me think, what if you filled the top bowl with some beautiful crystals, rocks, succulents, beads, or anything else that floats your boat and used a glass topper? You could also use the smaller BLANDA MATT bowls and a light kit and use this same process to craft a luxe lamp. If you prefer a metal finish, check out how to turn the BLANDA BLANK into a sleek lampshade or sophisticated bowl sink. There are so many possibilities.",
