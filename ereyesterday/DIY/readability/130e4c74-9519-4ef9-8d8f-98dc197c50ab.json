I long wanted a record storage drawer system where I can pull out and flip through the albums as I would in a record store,” explains Kirby. BEFORE (Old record storage) | Photo Credit: Kirby But the record drawers he found were pricey. One of the four-drawer cabinets on Etsy was almost $2,000, and a 6-drawer cabinet neared a staggering $3,000. During their quest for an affordable solution, they discovered Setouchi Kougei, a Japanese furniture maker who showcases KALLAX-compatible drawers for vinyl records. Kirby was impressed and ordered four drawers to fit into a 2 x 2 KALLAX. Want more inspiring IKEA hacks? Sign up for our free weekly newsletter for the latest hacks, ideas, IKEA updates, and more! What You’ll Need 1 IKEA KALLAX 4 KALLAX-compatible drawers (or however many you need for the cubby unit you choose) Furniture legs of choice Basics — drill, screw gun, screws Create a Stylish Storage Solution for Your Vinyl Records Using the KALLAX Photo Credit: Kirby 1. Start With the KALLAX Put together the KALLAX unit according to IKEA instructions. Determine if you want the four-cubby, a larger one, or if you want multiple units that you’ll connect. (Once you have everything in place, it’s recommended to secure it to the wall with the safety hardware — but wait until you add legs.) 2. Order and Add Drawers Order drawers for your KALLAX unit. The drawers come assembled. All you need to do is place them in the KALLAX and screw them into place.  3. Add Furniture Legs Photo Credit: Kirby Furniture legs elevate the unit (both literally and stylistically). Kirby found some basic three-inch legs on Amazon and screwed them into the bottom corners of the KALLAX. They come in so many styles, colors, and heights, so choose the best ones for the look you’re going for. Fun Add-on: Kirby also plans to add some LED strip lights to each drawer, but that’s for a future project. Overall, the hack was a success, and Kirby couldn’t wait to share it, adding, Just wanted to promote the guy’s work as he built a really good and beautiful vinyl record drawer that’s perfect for the KALLAX.” How Much Did This Record Cabinet Hack Cost? Photo Credit: Kirby One of the main motivations for this hack was to get stylish, functional record storage that didn’t wreck the budget. Kirby found the drawers on Etsy, but you can also get them directly from Setouchi’s website. Overall, the project costs about $420 plus tax. Here’s the cost breakdown: 4-cube KALLAX – $54.99 plus tax 4 KALLAX drawers – approx. $350 (including shipping) 4-pack furniture legs – $13 plus tax (varies depending on style and size) KALLAX Is No Stranger to Record Storage Photo Credit: Kirby Plenty of people use the KALLAX to store records. However, many of the hacks hold records sideways, which is fine for some. Other KALLAX hacks keep vinyl front-facing, but might require a bit more effort. Kirby’s hack is a great way to create a stylish storage solution with minimal effort, if you have a little more money to spend. The finished project looks great, functions better than their old storage method, and comes in at a significantly lower price tag than $2,000. Record Storage That Grows With Your Collection Photo Credit: Kirby Each drawer holds about 50 to 60 records, but if you have a larger collection (or as your current one grows), you can expand. Connect another KALLAX or start with a larger unit and get more drawers. Kirby suggested that the 6-cube KALLAX with 6 drawers would be a perfect size, but unfortunately, they only had room for the 4-cubby unit. You could also get an 8 or 9-cube cubby and fit it with a combination of drawers and other KALLAX accessories. Consider the size of your vinyl collection and anything else you want to put on the shelves or in the cubbies when deciding on your final configuration. Adjusting the style is easy, too, with multiple finishes to choose from for the KALLAX and the drawers. To see more of Setouchi Kougei’s drawers in action, check out this video and this one.
