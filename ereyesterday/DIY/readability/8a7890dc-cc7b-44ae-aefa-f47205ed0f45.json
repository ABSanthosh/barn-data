All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.If you’ve wandered down the pillow aisle of any home decor store recently, then you’re likely still recovering from the sticker shock. Throw pillows are pricey, and you may think that means you have to stay married to the ones you have. But as one Instagram user found, you can actually switch out your pillows on a budget. You just have to get a bit crafty.Andrea from Tyson Curates on Instagram used a few pieces of inexpensive thrifted fabric to rework a few existing pillows in her collection, and the result is bespoke, eclectic, and surprisingly chic.“Found this awkward sized vintage fabric, but the pattern was too good to leave,” Andrea wrote over her video. “Have you seen the price of throw pillows? Time to get creative. I saw a DIY where someone tied fabric in a bow, but mine isn’t big enough. Safety pin it is, and I like it! …Nicer than polyester from Amazon, that’s for sure.”To get this look, she simply wrapped a piece of fabric around a small pillow, completely taut, and either tied the ends into a bow at the center of the pillow or knotted and secured them with safety pins. “Love love love!” one person commented on Andrea’s post. “I recently splurged on a throw pillow, and I just recently realized it cost more than the thrifted chair it sits on.”“This is THE answer for random printed vintage fabric I manage to collect because I love it so much!” another person wrote. Andrea responded in the comments, “and then you can remove it and use it for something else later, too!”You probably already have a piece of fabric or an unused tablecloth sitting somewhere in your home that can be used for this project. And you don’t even have to strip the existing throw pillow cover to refresh them — just tie on the new fabric and you’re good to go! Andrea also displayed both of these with the knot or bow on display, but you can flip them over to look more like a traditional throw pillow, too.  If new throw pillows aren’t in your budget or you like to swap out styles seasonally, get creative and give them a refresh for less with this simple no-sew DIY. Plus, as Andrea notes in her Instagram caption, you’ll get to brush up on your gift wrapping skills in the process!",
