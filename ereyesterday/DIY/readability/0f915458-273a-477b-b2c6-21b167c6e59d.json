  "text": "ChatGPT launched in 2022, and yet, three years later, it still doesn't have one of its most requested features: integrated folders. As irritating as OpenAI's refusal to add folders is, there are some excellent ChatGPT folder Chrome extensions you can use instead. 4 ChatGPT Folders If you already have other Chrome extensions for enhancing ChatGPT and only need one more for a folders feature, ChatGPT Folders is the bare-bones extension for you. ChatGPT Folders gives you a very simple way to put your chats into folders. Install the extension, click Create Folder, and give it a name. Then, add your current conversation to the folder by clicking the Add to Folder button. That’s it! There is no long setup process; you can start sorting your chats as soon as you install this extension. The design also stays very clean and matches ChatGPT’s own look, so you won’t feel overwhelmed when you have many other extensions already cluttering your screen. To make it easier to identify folders, ChatGPT Folders has a simple color picker to assign colors to folders. These colors will also be applied to the title tags of each conversation within the ChatGPT sidebar. 3 GPT Folders Looking for something that gives a bit more functionality than ChatGPT Folder? GPT Folders builds on the simple idea of making folders but adds a few handy features to make your life easier. With GPT Folders, you can quickly create folders and move your chats by dragging and dropping them into a folder. An Add to Folder button sits at the top of the screen so that you can save your current chat quickly. This button also allows you to create a new folder instantly if you need one. You can access these folders through GPT Folder’s own sliding sidebar, located at the right of the screen. Aside from organizing your chat conversations, GPT Folders also has a Saved Prompt section where you can store your most-used prompts. Though small, these added functionalities make this extension much more convenient than ChatGPT Folders. 2 Easy Folders Easy Folders is a premium extension (with a free version) that offers a well-polished tool for busy people looking to organize their ChatGPT conversations. It makes chat organization easier, offering more options for organizing folders and prompts. For instance, this extension lets you create subfolders. This means you can set up a small folder system that mirrors how you might organize files on your computer. When you have many chats on different topics, you can group them into main folders and subfolders so that you always know where to find a specific conversation. Easy Folders can also automate the folder creation process for your custom GPTs. With Easy Folders, you can move several chats into one folder or even spread them across different folders in one go. You can also use Easy Folder’s built-in search tools to find conversations by looking for specific words, and once you locate the chat, you can add them to the proper folder. These folders can be colored and even have their own logos for easier identification. With these features, you can quickly organize a month's worth of conversations into folders. Lastly, the Easy Folder prompt manager lets you create, edit, and store your prompts in one place. What's special about this prompt manager is that it allows you to use variables to make your prompt easy to reuse. By simply placing your keyword inside curly braces, Easy Folders will identify it as a variable you can keep changing whenever you use the prompt. If you can pay the $9 monthly subscription, Easy Folders provides a polished tool with a robust set of options, making it a very strong tool for managing conversations and prompts. 1 Superpower ChatGPT Superpower ChatGPT not only organizes your chats but also gives you a whole set of tools to improve your ChatGPT experience. With this extension, you get the Manager menu that houses many advanced tools, including a conversations manager, prompt manager, image gallery, custom instruction profiles, and a GPT store. The conversation manager is where you can create and manage folders. If you need a more detailed system, these folders can be customized with different colors, images, and even subfolders. You can quickly manage bulk conversations by filtering and ticking all the relevant chat conversations before moving them to a folder. Superpower ChatGPT also has many other tools such as a prompt manager that lets you create a series of prompts, save your favorites, and use ready-made templates; an Image Gallery to keep all your images; a GPT Store that offers many tools and models; and Custom Instruction Profiles to adjust ChatGPT for different tasks. Overall, I recommend Superpower ChatGPT if you want lots of features to enhance your ChatGPT productivity. But if you already have a lot of extensions and only want a folder organization tool, try using ChatGPT Folders. Easy Folder is the best if you're willing to pay the premium price, but its free features are also plenty handy. And for everyone else, go with GPT Folders—it's free, easy to use, and has a simple UI.",

These colors will also be applied to the title tags of each conversation within the ChatGPT sidebar.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"gpt-folders\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e3 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            GPT Folders\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gpt-folder-ui.png\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\"\u003e\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gpt-folder-ui.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gpt-folder-ui.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gpt-folder-ui.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gpt-folder-ui.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gpt-folder-ui.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gpt-folder-ui.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gpt-folder-ui.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gpt-folder-ui.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n                \u003cimg width=\"1911\" height=\"943\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Organizing conversations with GPT Folders\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gpt-folder-ui.png\" src=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gpt-folder-ui.png\"/\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n                                    \n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e Looking for something that gives a bit more functionality than ChatGPT Folder?

This means you can set up a small folder system that mirrors how you might organize files on your computer. When you have many chats on different topics, you can group them into main folders and subfolders so that you always know where to find a specific conversation.

These folders can be colored and even have their own logos for easier identification. With these features, you can quickly organize a month\u0026#39;s worth of conversations into folders.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eLastly, the Easy Folder prompt manager lets you create, edit, and store your prompts in one place.

With this extension, you get the Manager menu that houses many advanced tools, including a conversations manager, prompt manager, image gallery, custom instruction profiles, and a GPT store.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe conversation manager is where you can create and manage folders. If you need a more detailed system, these folders can be customized with different colors, images, and even subfolders. You can quickly manage bulk conversations by filtering and ticking all the relevant chat conversations before moving them to a folder.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSuperpower ChatGPT also has many other tools such as a prompt manager that lets you create a series of prompts, save your favorites, and use ready-made templates; an Image Gallery to keep all your images; a GPT Store that offers many tools and models; and Custom Instruction Profiles to adjust ChatGPT for different tasks.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOverall, I recommend Superpower ChatGPT if you want lots of features to enhance your ChatGPT productivity. But if you already have a lot of extensions and only want a folder organization tool, try using ChatGPT Folders. Easy Folder is the best if you\u0026#39;re willing to pay the premium price, but its free features are also plenty handy. And for everyone else, go with GPT Folders—it\u0026#39;s free, easy to use, and has a simple UI.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
