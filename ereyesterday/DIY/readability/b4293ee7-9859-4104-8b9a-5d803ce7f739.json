  "text": "Apple Sign in to your MUO account While not every extended warranty is worth buying, a protection plan for a daily device like a phone or computer is not such a bad idea. While Apple used to sell its pre-paid AppleCare+ plans at retail locations, the company is abandoning that practice in favor of its subscription model. Apple Is Pushing Its AppleCare+ Subscription According to an X post by Bloomberg Chief Correspondent Mark Gurman, Apple will soon be \"dropping\" its multi-year AppleCare+ plan, allowing you to buy two to three years of protection up front, from storefront locations. As the name suggests, AppleCare+ extends your hardware's first-party warranty plan, or AppleCare, that comes free with your purchase. According to Apple Support, most Apple products will come with \"a one-year limited warranty and up to 90 days of complimentary technical support.\" AppleCare+ extends that time for which your Apple product is eligible. This reported change will affect you if you typically purchase Apple products in person, along with a pre-paid AppleCare+ plan. While a multi-year AppleCare+ plan will no longer be available to buy at a physical store, it will still be available on the online store. So, if I want to buy an iPad on Apple's website, I can still add two years of coverage during checkout. However, the option displayed before this two-year, pre-paid plan is a monthly AppleCare+ subscription, which bills separately. Even though the two-year plan at $69 flat will ultimately save me about $15, compared to two years at $3.49/month, it certainly feels enticing to spread the cost out over time. The prices of AppleCare+ plans depend on the product. Down With the OTP (One-Time Purchase) Between the reduction in multi-year coverage options and the arrangement of the Apple website's user interface, it's pretty clear that Apple is pushing the AppleCare+ subscription model. I wouldn't be surprised if Apple did away with the two or three-year deals completely. Frankly, it's the direction most tech services are moving. On the one hand, I don't hate the idea of subscriptions, particularly the flexibility they provide. In the US, most of us are used to paying a monthly premium for health insurance, so paying monthly (or annually) for the health of our hardware sort of makes sense, too. In return, we're covered when disaster strikesâ€”usually. On the other hand, it seems like an easy way for Apple to quietly siphon money while we look the other way. I can't be the only one who loses track of mounting subscriptions. I would venture to guess that most customers who buy two years of AppleCare+ up front don't re-up at the end of their term. Conversely, an AppleCare+ subscriber may hold on to that monthly plan for a long time, either out of comfort or forgetfulness. At the end of the day, AppleCare coverage is a decent product that will suit some people better than others. Whether it's a one-time purchase (OTP) or a subscription, it's best to do some light risk analysis to decide whether you even need AppleCare+ at all. If you, like me, move less gracefully through life, protection plans do typically pay for themselves.",

In the US, most of us are used to paying a monthly premium for health insurance, so paying monthly (or annually) for the health of our hardware sort of makes sense, too. In return, we\u0026#39;re covered when disaster strikesâ€”usually. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, it seems like an easy way for Apple to quietly siphon money while we look the other way. I can\u0026#39;t be the only one who loses track of mounting subscriptions. I would venture to guess that most customers who buy two years of AppleCare+ up front don\u0026#39;t re-up at the end of their term. Conversely, an AppleCare+ subscriber may hold on to that monthly plan for a long time, either out of comfort or forgetfulness. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, AppleCare coverage is a decent product that will suit some people better than others. Whether it\u0026#39;s a one-time purchase (OTP) or a subscription, it\u0026#39;s best to do some light risk analysis to decide whether you even need AppleCare+ at all. If you, like me, move less gracefully through life, protection plans do typically pay for themselves. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
