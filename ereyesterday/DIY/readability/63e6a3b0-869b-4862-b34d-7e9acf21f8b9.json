After years of steadily climbing costs, especially post-COVID due to supply chain issues, it’s a breath of fresh air to see IKEA passing some of these savings back to us. This is fantastic news for us, people who love hacking IKEA furniture. After all, one of the main reasons we DIY is because we want beautiful things on a budget. As we approach the end of 2024, I’m excited to unveil my list of the top 12 IKEA hacks of 2024. Usually, I pick just 10 favorites, but this year, I found myself with 12 incredible hacks that I simply couldn’t leave out. So, I thought, why not share all of them? After all, the more inspiration, the better! Why these IKEA Hacks? What I love most about these hacks is how a little out-of-the-box thinking turns everyday IKEA pieces into one-of-a-kind creations. The final product may not always trigger the algorithm on Instagram or any other social platform but honestly, should we even care about those metrics?IKEAhackers has always been about creating pieces that speak of your unique style and making things work for you. And that’s enough for me. So, let’s get the show on the road. The 12 Best IKEA Hacks of 2024 1. Behind-the-door storage shelf Photo Credit: @corinas.leben Corina’s clever behind-the-door storage shelf makes the most of that often-forgotten space behind the door. This project is about turning that unused area into a functional storage solution.She took four basic IKEA FLISAT wall storage shelves, originally designed for organizing toys and books, and transformed them into practical, slim shelves that fit right behind the door. 2. IKEA GURSKEN luxury sideboard Photo Credit: @interiorxlifestyle | Instagram @interiorxlifestyle’s IKEA GURSKEN nightstand hack reimagined the basic bedside table into an elegant sideboard, proving that creativity can elevate even the most affordable furniture pieces.The process involved adding a door to the lower compartment and combining multiple GURSKEN units to create a longer, more substantial piece. By joining these nightstands side-by-side, the result is a sleek sideboard with ample storage space. 3. Bookcase To Pull-Out Pantry Photo Credit: Qamar Derbas @decorista_93 | Instagram BILLY’s cheaper little brother GERSBY became the storage hero in this hack. Qamar Derbas @decorista_93 added rolling bases (for washing machines) under it and transformed the narrow bookshelf into a mobile storage unit. The GERSBY bookcase slides effortlessly into that awkward gap between the refrigerator and the wall, as a space-maximizing pull-out pantry cabinet. 4. Round Wall Sconce Photo Credit: Camilla Bakken @camillabakken | Instagram Norwegian designer Camilla Bakken @camillabakken transformed the IKEA SNUDDA lazy susan into fabulous wall sconces. They look absolutely stunning next to her spiral staircase.This repurposing might be the most unexpected use of the SNUDDA turntable yet. What can we say except, it’s lit! 5. PAX wardrobe height extension unit Photo Credit: John J. IKEA customers have long desired a way to extend the height of their PAX wardrobes. This year, John J. gave us a clever solution. The PAX height extension hack combined elements from both the PAX wardrobe system and IKEA’s kitchen range.This hack utilizes METOD kitchen cabinet frames to create additional storage space above the standard PAX units. The frames are positioned horizontally on top of the wardrobe, integrating with the PAX structure.It’s useful for rooms with high ceilings, allowing homeowners to take full advantage of otherwise wasted areas. 6. BILLY bookcase patio storage hack Photo Credit: Alexander Johnson @easyalex | Instagram The IKEA BILLY bookcase got a surprising outdoor makeover in this creative patio storage solution. Alexander Johnson @easyalex took inspiration from a DIY project he saw on @hagalo_en_casa and converted the bookcase into a practical and stylish outdoor storage unit.Garden tools find a new home in this cleverly adapted bookcase. Shelves are customized to accommodate various sizes of equipment, from small hand trowels to larger rakes and shovels. 7. Elevated dog bowls BESTÅ cabinet hack Photo Credit: Romain Deby @rd_creative_interior | Instagram Pet owners seeking a stylish and functional solution for feeding their furry friends will love this clever IKEA hack. Architect Romain Deby @rd_creative_interior found new life for the BESTÅ, modifying it into an elevated dog feeding station, with a built-in pot filler to refill his dog’s water bowl. He also repurposed a drawer below the food containers to hold dog food. No more unsightly bags of kibble cluttering up the kitchen floor. 8. Hidden PAX closet hack Photo Credit: Lee Middleton Lee Middleton’s standout hidden closet hack took center stage, converting an unused top-floor landing into a sleek, concealed storage space. His design integrated PAX wardrobes into the existing architecture and disguised them behind custom-built panels and paint, cleverly blending with the surrounding walls. When closed, the panels create a clean, uncluttered appearance. Upon opening, they reveal a fully functional closet system, complete with hanging rods, shelves, and drawers. 9. Desk and window seat PAX wardrobe hack Photo Credit: Sophia Nikolaides @1894home | Instagram Sophia Nikolaides came up with a brilliant idea to create a desk and window seat using IKEA PAX wardrobes in a whole new way. She placed two 29.5-inch wide PAX frames on either side of a window, giving it a built-in look.The star of the show is the clever dual-purpose centerpiece that easily transforms from a desk to a window seat. All you have to do is lower the tabletop, and voila! You’ve got a cozy spot to sit and enjoy the view. 10. Behind the couch table with outlet for charging Photo Credit: Gülcan Öztürk One of the most practical IKEA hacks of 2024 is the behind-the-couch charging table. This clever DIY addresses the common problem of always needing to juice-up our devices.Now, there are a few different ways to create this hack, but I really like how Gülcan Öztürk used the IKEA MOSSLANDA picture ledge for this project. It’s such a simple way to make a shelf with power outlets that fit perfectly behind the couch. Not only can you charge your devices, you also have a convenient spot to put down your drink while relaxing on the sofa. 11. KALLAX dining bench with storage Photo Credit: @inside_hannahs_home/Instagram The KALLAX series continues to inspire creative DIY projects in 2024 and this one from @inside_hannahs_home caught my eye. Hannah transformed three KALLAX units into a chic corner dining bench, maximizing both style and storage in one fell swoop.What I love most about this hack is the curved ends. I’m sure they were a pain to build, but the result is worth every penny. 12. Laundry Drying Rack Photo Credit: Kerry Kellet @klk.interiors | Instagram I always love a hack for laundry rooms. Kelley’s clever drying rack has two levels and folds up against the wall when not in use.Installation is straightforward, requiring only a few IKEA components and some basic tools. The main elements include KOMPLEMENT pull-out pants hangers and a FORSAND door. If you really want to push costs down, replace the FORSAND door with any wooden board or install it directly on the wall. Onwards to 2025 As we wrap up our journey through the top IKEA hacks of 2024, I hope you’re feeling as inspired as I am. I’ve really enjoyed the creativity and ingenuity of the IKEA hacking community. Whether you’re a seasoned DIY pro or just starting to explore the world of IKEA hacks, I encourage you to take these ideas and make them your own. Don’t be afraid to put your own spin on these projects and create something that truly reflects your unique style and needs. I can’t wait to see what new and exciting IKEA hacks the DIY community will dream up in 2025. As always, I’ll be here to showcase your hacking endeavors. Who knows? Your IKEA hack may be on my top 10 list next year? So, here’s to another year of incredible IKEA hacks, and happy hacking!",
