Ensure proper sticker placement, the thickness of your case, and chargers for optimal functioning. Using MagSafe on Android might seem impossible since the technology is exclusive to Apple devices. However, I'll share a workaround that involves using stickers to get your Android devices working with MagSafe chargers and accessories in no time. What Are \"MagSafe Stickers\"? MagSafe is essentially a combination of a wireless charging coil and some magnets. iPhones come with these magnets built in, but if you buy an Android device, you're only getting half the package, assuming your phone supports wireless charging. So, while your Android phone might be able to use MagSafe chargers to charge wirelessly, it'll definitely not snap into place like an iPhone does. This is where \"MagSafe stickers\" come into play. Yadullah Abidi / MakeUseOf These stickers are made of small magnetic rings with adhesive on the back. All you have to do is line them up with your phone's wireless charging coil and stick them either to the back of your phone or case, and that's it. The magnets in the sticker keep your phone stuck to the MagSafe charger you're using, and wireless charging works as expected. I'm using the PopSockets Adapter Ring for MagSafe, which costs around $7 on Amazon. You can find cheaper alternatives from other sellers, and some MagSafe chargers even bundle these as extras. In theory, all such stickers should work fine, but I'd recommend sticking to reputed sellers. The PopSockets ring has quite a lot of magnetic strength and doesn't seem to affect the charging speed of my Pixel 7a. The stickers work with just about any phone that supports wireless charging, including older iPhones that don't support MagSafe. In case your phone doesn't support wireless charging, you can use these stickers to use the many MagSafe accessories, like phone mounts for desks, cars, and everything else. What Phones Do These Stickers Work With? The good thing about using these stickers is that they'll work with any phone that supports wireless charging. Additionally, you can also stick them directly on the back of your phone if you don't like putting on a case. Even if your phone doesn't support wireless charging, these stickers allow you to use the hundreds of MagSafe-compatible phone mounts on the market. For example, if the phone mount in your car is a headache to get your phone hooked up to (which it generally is), these stickers allow you to upgrade to a magnetic one where you pretty much snap your phone onto the mount. You can also use a magnetic case, but unless you have an iPhone or a flagship Android, you have limited case options. These stickers, on the other hand, let you use any phone, and pretty much any case, with MagSafe-compatible chargers and stands without having to spend an unreasonable amount. MagSafe cases also cost more than these stickers. Some case considerations must be made when using stickers, though. The stickers I bought aren't officially compatible with silicone, textured, or anti-fingerprint-coated cases. From my experience, they should work on most cases as long as they're not too thick or made of fabric. The adhesive strip on the back of the stickers I got is strong enough to stick on a silicone case so I wouldn't worry too much about that. Are MagSafe Stickers Safe to Use? These stickers are totally safe to use, but since they're an aftermarket solution, there are a few things you should be mindful of. Sticker placement is the most important thing here. While you don't have to get the alignment perfectly right, it's best to be as close as possible, as a misaligned sticker may not charge your device properly or cause overheating issues. I placed mine slightly off-axis, and my phone sometimes sits on the charger and fluctuates between charging and non-charging states. Most of these stickers aren't reusable either, so if you end up sticking them in the wrong spot, you'll have to use a fresh one. Hannah Stryker / MakeUseOf You also need to keep an eye out for the charger you use. This isn't a big issue because most MagSafe-compatible chargers work fine, but I still recommend getting a charger that matches your phone's wireless charging speed. In case you're confused, we have a list of the best MagSafe chargers you can pick from. With a few careful considerations, you can use these stickers to make any phone MagSafe compatible and enjoy all the benefits. Wireless charging is great, but it's even better when your phone snaps into place instead of you having to fiddle around to find the right spot.",
