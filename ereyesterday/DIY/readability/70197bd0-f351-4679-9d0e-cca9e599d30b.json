  "text": "HBO Max Sign in to your MUO account In a world where streaming services seem to be constantly raising prices, there is a bit of good news for some Max subscribers. Max Won’t Charge Extra for B/R Sports Content Max owner Warner Bros. Discovery has announced that it won’t be charging for B/R Sports. The tier was originally unveiled in late 2024 and features more than 1,700 live events per year from the NBA, NHL, MLB, NCAA March Madness, AEW, and more. That’s a huge amount of live sports content, something that’s hard to find on many streaming services. When originally announced, Max was planning to charge an extra $10 per month starting in March for the tier to coincide with March Madness. But if you have the Standard or Premium tier, Max is now providing that content for free. Unfortunately, the news is not so great if you subscribe to the ad-supported tier. Both B/R Sports content and CNN Max will no longer be available starting on March 30. CNN Max provides a 24/7 news feed along with on-demand news and CNN Originals. Sports have become a driving force behind streaming, and Max keeping B/R Sports content for free will make it a more popular destination for sports fans. And it will likely get some ad-supported subscribers to make the move up for the sports content. Currently, the Premium tier on Max costs $20.99 per month and offers 4K video, Dolby Atmos audio, and the ability to download up to 100 items. The Standard tier is $16.99 per month and only allows 1080p resolution and up to 30 downloads. Basic with ads is $9.99 per month. If you’re looking to save a bit of money, don’t try to share your Max password as the service is already starting to crack down on the practice. There are a lot of reasons to enjoy Max. While I’ve never been thrilled with the higher subscription cost, I’ve enjoyed the service with its wide variety of media, HBO exclusives, and more. Adding B/R Report content for the Standard and Premium tiers makes both options a better value.",

The tier was originally unveiled in late 2024 and features more than 1,700 live events per year from the NBA, NHL, MLB, NCAA March Madness, AEW, and more. That’s a huge amount of live sports content, something that’s hard to find on many streaming services.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhen originally announced, Max was planning to charge an extra $10 per month starting in March for the tier to coincide with March Madness. But if you have the Standard or Premium tier, Max is now providing that content for free.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the news is not so great if you subscribe to the ad-supported tier. Both B/R Sports content and CNN Max will no longer be available starting on March 30. CNN Max provides a 24/7 news feed along with on-demand news and CNN Originals.\u003c/p\u003e    \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eSports have become a driving force behind streaming, and Max keeping B/R Sports content for free will make it a more popular destination for sports fans. And it will likely get some ad-supported subscribers to make the move up for the sports content. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, the Premium tier on Max costs $20.99 per month and offers 4K video, Dolby Atmos audio, and the ability to download up to 100 items. The Standard tier is $16.99 per month and only allows 1080p resolution and up to 30 downloads. Basic with ads is $9.99 per month.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re looking to save a bit of money, don’t try to share your Max password as \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/max-crack-down-password-sharing-sooner/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe service is already starting to crack down on the practice.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThere are a lot of \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-love-hbo-max-subscription/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ereasons to enjoy Max\u003c/a\u003e.
