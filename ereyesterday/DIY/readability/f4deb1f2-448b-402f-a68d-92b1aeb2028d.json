You can use these tips to help get top dollar for your old devices. 6 Use a Case and Screen protector Aryan Surendranath/MakeUseOf Modern smartphones come with a durable glass cover and an aluminum chassis. Some flagship phones, like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and Apple's iPhone 16 Pro lineup, feature an even more durable titanium frame. Some phones, like those in the Galaxy lineup, feature cover glass that’s more scratch-resistant than the standard glass used on other phones. Yet, irrespective of the phone I use, I always use a case and screen protector for added protection. I typically order a few cases from renowned accessory makers for my phone. Later, I sell them with the phone, which helps give the buyer a feeling that they are getting more value for their money. While there are plenty of minimal cases on the market, I avoid them as they don't always offer ample protection. A case with a raised lip and edge protection is essential, as it safeguards the phone from damage in case of a fall. This ensures the phone doesn't pick up any scratches or scuffs from accidental falls or dings. Similarly, the screen protector shields the display from minor scratches and scuffs caused by my jeans pocket or table. These added protection measures help boost the resale value of my phones, as you can get at least 20-30% more for a phone in mint condition, without any scratches or scuffs. 5 Keep the Box and Charger Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf Smartphone boxes do not come with as many goodies as they used to. You get a basic case, a USB-C cable, a SIM ejector pin, and regulatory papers. Despite this, I never throw away my phone's boxes. I also keep the bill inside the box itself, ensuring I don't misplace it. I don't even remove the bundled USB-C cable, as I have plenty of them lying around, and use them instead. While not much, this helps me fetch a higher resale value for my phone. Individually, having the box of your phone might not make a big deal. However, combined with other tips I have shared in this article, it can make a big difference in the final resale value. 4 Try to Maintain Battery Health sirajexclusivep5/Shutterstock This part is easier said than done, but I always try to maximize the battery health of my phones to increase their resale value. Typically, this involves not fast charging the phone frequently and avoiding fast wireless charging. I also avoid draining the phone's battery to zero and then charging it to full. Unless I am traveling, I prefer to charge my phone with a regular 10W-20W charger. I only like to fast charge it when I am traveling or in a hurry. While I can limit the battery charge capacity to 80% or 90% to extend its lifespan, I find this a bit excessive. Admittedly, this isn't easy, especially if you use a phone for a year or two and then sell it. By then, the battery health is bound to take a hit. Still, you can do your best to maximize its lifespan, as a phone with 80% battery health will get you noticeably less than a phone with a 95% capacity. Alternatively, if your phone's battery health has gone down noticeably, you can get it replaced, use it for a few months, and then sell it. I follow this approach with my wife’s and mom’s iPhones, replacing their batteries about six months before I intend to sell them. If the device you are selling is too old and the resale value is poor, consider repurposing your old Android phone into a security monitor or an Android Auto companion. You can also turn it into a remote control for your streaming stick. 3 Claim Warranty for Any Defect As long as my phone or any other device is under the standard manufacturer warranty, I always visit the official service center for any repairs or defects. This keeps my phone’s warranty intact and guarantees quality workmanship, which helps retain the phone's resale value. I’ve had instances where I got my phone’s display or back panel replaced at a third-party repair shop, only to face more issues later due to their poor work. This also ends up negatively affecting the phone's resale value. For older devices that are out of warranty, I only take them to renowned third-party repair shops. In such cases, I avoid the manufacturer's service center, as their out-of-warranty repair costs are exorbitant and make little sense. 2 Resell a Few Weeks Before a New Model Comes Out Justin Duino / MakeUseOf My wife typically upgrades to a new iPhone every year. As a content creator who relies heavily on her phone for shooting videos and creating content, her workflow benefits from even minor yearly improvements. Since Apple typically launches new iPhones around mid-September, I sell her current phone in late August or early September to get the best resale value. This approach ensures she gets 15-20% more value for her phone, with its pristine condition further helping increase its value. Otherwise, once Apple announces a new iPhone, the value of older models drops significantly. 1 Try Multiple Platforms When Selling I’ve likely used hundreds of smartphones over the years, yet I’ve never traded one for a new device. Instead, I always list them for sale on eBay, Facebook Marketplace, and other similar services. This ensures I get the most value for my old phone, as most manufacturer trade-in programs don't offer the best price. There can be exceptions, with Google and Samsung offering boosted trade-in values for old phones when they launch their new flagship. But otherwise, you are always better off selling your phone through one of the above-mentioned channels. The only problem is that you will frequently run into hagglers or people who will provide lowball offers. I also always list the phone for sale on multiple marketplaces. Admittedly, this takes time, especially if there are many interested buyers. But again, this helps me get the best resale price for my old phone. Irrespective of where you sell, always do these 10 things before selling your old phone. You don't want to hand over the device to its new owner with your private photos and data still on it. Getting the most value for your old phone will take effort and time. If you cannot put in the time, consider using a boosted trade-in program for its convenience.",

do not come with as many goodies as they used to. You get a basic case, a USB-C cable, a SIM ejector pin, and regulatory papers. Despite this, I never throw away my phone\u0026#39;s boxes. I also keep the bill inside the box itself, ensuring I don\u0026#39;t misplace it. I don\u0026#39;t even remove the bundled USB-C cable, as I have plenty of them lying around, and use them instead.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhile not much, this helps me fetch a higher resale value for my phone.

Typically, this involves not fast charging the phone frequently and avoiding fast wireless charging. I also avoid draining the phone\u0026#39;s battery to zero and then charging it to full.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eUnless I am traveling, I prefer to charge my phone with a regular 10W-20W charger. I only like to fast charge it when I am traveling or in a hurry. While I can limit the battery charge capacity to 80% or 90% to extend its lifespan, I find this a bit excessive.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAdmittedly, this isn\u0026#39;t easy, especially if you use a phone for a year or two and then sell it. By then, the battery health is bound to take a hit. Still, you can do your best to maximize its lifespan, as a phone with 80% battery health will get you noticeably less than a phone with a 95% capacity.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAlternatively, if your phone\u0026#39;s battery health has gone down noticeably, you can get it replaced, use it for a few months, and then sell it. I follow this approach with my wife’s and mom’s iPhones, replacing their batteries about six months before I intend to sell them.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf the device you are selling is too old and the resale value is poor, consider \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/make-old-android-phone-useful/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erepurposing your old Android phone\u003c/a\u003e into a security monitor or an Android Auto companion.

As a content creator who relies heavily on her phone for shooting videos and creating content, her workflow benefits from even minor yearly improvements. Since Apple typically launches new iPhones around mid-September, I sell her current phone in late August or early September to get the best resale value.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis approach ensures she gets 15-20% more value for her phone, with its pristine condition further helping increase its value. Otherwise, once Apple announces a new iPhone, the value of older models drops significantly.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"try-multiple-platforms-when-selling\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e1 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Try Multiple Platforms When Selling\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve likely used hundreds of smartphones over the years, yet I’ve never traded one for a new device. Instead, I always list them for sale on eBay, Facebook Marketplace, and other similar services. This ensures I get the most value for my old phone, as most manufacturer trade-in programs don\u0026#39;t offer the best price.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThere can be exceptions, with Google and Samsung offering boosted trade-in values for old phones when they launch their new flagship. But otherwise, you are always better off selling your phone through one of the above-mentioned channels. The only problem is that you will frequently run into hagglers or people who will provide lowball offers.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eI also always list the phone for sale on multiple marketplaces.
