The before, as you can see above, was a little lackluster — though the original fireplace and crown molding were stunners! The DIYer behind the makeover wanted to give this long space a little more oomph, not to mention a more defined focal point.To do that, she reached for a classic: BILLY bookcases. But instead of leaving them as is, she decorated the doors with molding to give them a fluted wood look, added in glam new hardware, and (my favorite part!) topped the bookshelves with scalloped molding that looks at once sophisticated and a little whimsical, too. The finishing touch is, of course, the stunning new paint color: a chalky paint with a matte finish in a pale pinkish-purple color that’s used on the walls, too.I’ve seen a lot of IKEA hacks over the years, and many of them have wowed me, but this is one I come back to again and again. I love how a few relatively simple changes made basic bookshelves into something that’s completely unique to this DIYer’s home. And I love that she made a setup that truly worked for her needs, piecing together BILLY bookshelves of different sizes to create the custom built-ins of her dreams.",
