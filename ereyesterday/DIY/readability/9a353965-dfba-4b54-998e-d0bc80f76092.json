All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterSome people prefer red kitchens, while others ditch bright red and go for a more neutral palette. There’s no wrong answer; it just depends on personal taste! Katerina Alevra (@my.bohemian.nest), an apartment-dweller based in Greece, recently revamped her kitchen, and it went from red to a white, more minimalist aesthetic.Katerina says that the red-toned wood cabinets felt “dark” and “never clean.” The cabinets got a white, glossy overhaul, and in addition the range was relocated to allow for a dramatic, stainless steel hood.The kitchen now has a U-shaped layout. Katerina hired professionals to rearrange her kitchen and replace her cabinetry. The biggest difference, she says, is her kitchen is now laid out in a U-shape (or Greek letter Π, as Katerina says) rather than a straight line, which allows room for more prep surfaces and for bar seating. “I had a hard time finding the right stools,” Katerina says. “The ones I found on the internet had very expensive shipping, so I had to find something in my city. I made an order from a local store, and they came broken and the quality was poor, so I had to find another store, When I finally found a store to order them, they came the first time in another [incorrect] color,” Katerina says. It took about seven months for the perfect spot to sit in her revamped kitchen. “It … feels really good when I cook and I have company sitting at those stools so close to me to hang out!” Katerina says.The glossy white cabinets are easier to clean than expected.Katerina’s friends and family were initially hesitant about the white colorway she picked. “They were saying things like, ‘You don’t want white cabinets! they are going to get dirty all the time!’” Katerina says. But after the fact, she’s glad she stuck with her decision. “The cleaning is easier than expected!” she says. “Because of the glossy surface, the cabinets clean very easily and look great!” The countertops were budget-friendly.Katerina’s confidants also tried to talk her into ordering gray granite countertops, but she likes the Scandinavian look of her faux wood ones. “It is not solid wood,” Katerina says. “It is melamine with wood effects. It is very cheap compared to solid wood, and so far it holds perfectly.”Katerina’s kitchen remodel motto is to stick to what you want, and also to supervise any major professional changes taking place. “Otherwise, you will end up with not-straight knobs, or tiny changes you never agreed to,” she says. Small woodworking projects complete the cozy kitchen.  Although the kitchen remodel was a professional job, Katerina did add a few DIY projects to help keep her organized: Using six pre-cut pieces of wood meant to be wall hangers, nails, and wood glue, she made a shallow shelf for mugs for the countertop. She also made a small spice rack to the right of the range and a wooden rail for hanging utensils.",
