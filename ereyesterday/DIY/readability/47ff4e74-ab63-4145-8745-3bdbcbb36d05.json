An eighth emoji, Flag of Sark, is also included in Emoji 16.0 but not Unicode 16.0 because Unicode no longer accepts flag proposals.The new emoji coming with iOS 18.4.The full lineup and details are below. If you can't see the new emoji characters, it's because your device is not yet capable of displaying the new Emoji 16.0 characters. But you can still see what they look like in the image above. Apple devices running iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 should be able to display these emoji just fine.Smileys and Emotion (1 total)🫩 Face with Bags Under Eyes: The ultimate emoji for conveying tiredness.People and Body (1 total)🫆 Fingerprint: A versatile symbol for identity, security, or individuality.Animals and Nature (1 total)🪾 Leafless Tree: Perfect for seasonal chats or metaphors about change and growth.Food and Drink (1 total)🫜 Root Vegetable: Representing turnips, radishes, or other root crops.Objects (2 total)🪉 Harp: A musical emoji for conversations about tradition or creativity.🪏 Shovel: From gardening to digging into projects.Symbols (1 total)🫟 Splatter: A bold and abstract purple splat that sparks curiosity and imagination.Flags (1 total)🇨🇶 Flag of Sark: This flag adds a touch of geographic diversity, representing the Channel Island of Sark.If you're not running the latest iOS when these emoji roll out, you might see placeholders or, for Flag of Sark, the grouped regional indicator letters \"CQ\" instead.The Unicode 16.0 emojis are expected to be adopted by major platforms throughout 2025.
