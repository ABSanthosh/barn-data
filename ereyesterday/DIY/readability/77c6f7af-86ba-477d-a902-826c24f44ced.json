  "text": "Greetings all, just popping in to wish you all a Happy Easter! I’ve been keeping busy, mostly working, but I kept a promise to myself and began a fun creative project I’ve been wanting to try for a long time. I’ll have to hit pause on it before I finish because I’m leaving on an international trip on Thursday. Each year my travel besties and I pick a new country to visit together. This year we’re off to the Aegean Sea to tour the Cyclades in Greece. We’ve booked a series of ferry rides and apartments . I feel so lucky to have wonderful friends to travel with and we’ve made so many memories year after year. I’ll post pictures of all the prettiest spots in Instagram stories. :) Favorite links spied this week: This beautiful kitchen which blends traditional and modern style so well. This lovely house in Nottingham. This elegant Germantown home layered in dark wood tones. This modern abode in Sonoma. This brilliant IKEA hack DIY console table. I love this ceramicist’s portfolio of works inspired by botanicals and the sea. This tray is a beautiful way to memorialize a hand written note. How to create ‘soft fascination’ in your yard and garden. 30 resilient perennials to plant in the shade. Who knew a hairdryer could do this! Can’t sleep? Consider this technique.",
