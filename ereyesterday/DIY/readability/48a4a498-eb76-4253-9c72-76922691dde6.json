But wall-mounted sinks leave you with limited options when it comes to storing essentials. The exposed pipes and fittings get in the way of most traditional vanities and shelving options. You could always do a custom solution, but you’ll spend a pretty penny that you likely need to use elsewhere. That’s where this IKEA hack from Can Burak Erusta (@weil_ichs_can) comes into play. It transforms the NISSAFORS utility cart into a snappy bathroom organization solution. Yes, it’s true that IKEA offers a few different vanity units that have cut-outs for pipes. But if you’re on a tight budget, or like the hacker, prefer an airier solution, then this checks the boxes. What You’ll Need 1 NISSAFORS utility cart from IKEA Whatever tools the instructions require to assemble the cart That’s it! It’s kind of a breath of fresh air to find a hack that doesn’t require a bunch of extra pieces and add-ons, right? Under-Sink Shelf Storage in Seconds With the NISSAFORS 1. Assemble the Cart Assemble the NISSAFORS according to IKEA’s instructions. However, leave off the top shelf and the wheels. 2. Place and Style Put the cart into position under the sink and set up the shelves with towels, toiletries, and other items. That’s it! Told you it was simple. Keep an Open Mind About This Open Storage Solution  Over 44,000 people liked this hack, but quite a few comments mention not liking the out-in-the-open look for storage. Of course, others prefer the openness, especially if they’re working in a small space. Like the hacker says, “There isn’t a lot of space here, which is why I wanted an open construction in black to make everything appear more airy!” But what if you aren’t a fan of the open-concept? Understandably, there are things you keep in your bathroom that you prefer to stay hidden. Plus, open storage tends to get dusty.) However, if the alternative is no storage, I say this is a great option.) If you must hide your stuff, a few pretty bins and baskets on the shelves take care of the visibility issue. Another option would be to use adhesive Velcro strips or double-sided tape to hang a small curtain across the front of the uppermost shelf. You can tuck away the things you want to hide on the bottom of the cart and keep the prettier things on top. More Reasons to Love This Under Sink Shelf Hack Besides giving you storage in your bathroom, this hack is super quick. It’s also simple to do (in a slap-your-head and say “Why didn’t I think of that?” kind of way), requiring no special expertise or tools. Furthermore, it’s affordable, coming in at only $29.99, and you can get it in white, beige, yellow, or black. If none of those colors work for your space, you can paint it, or cover the shelves with contact paper in a fun, funky pattern. The style of the NISSAFORS is perfect for a modern or industrial space, offering a streamlined, no-frills look.
