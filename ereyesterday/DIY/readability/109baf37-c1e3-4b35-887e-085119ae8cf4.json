Introducing the new IVAR box shelf with divider: a simple pine insert that’s about to make snack-stashing, spice-sorting, soup-can-organizing so much easier. It’s the latest clever addition to the classic IVAR family, and honestly, we’re breathing a sigh of relief. Unlike previous IVAR drawers that could barely support a bag of flour without the bottom panel falling out, this one comes with a solid pine bottom that means business.

IVAR, But Make It a Pantry IVAR Box shelf with divider | IKEA.com IVAR has always been the Swiss Army knife of IKEA storage — raw, reliable, and ridiculously customizable. But pantry duty? Let’s just say the open sides and back aren’t always the best for slippery jars, small cans, and pouffy bags of snacks. With the open-shelf format, even the most organized pantry setup can start to feel chaotic. That’s where this clever little box shelf comes in. With its built-in divider and two roomy compartments, it helps you sort your pantry staples into neat, grab-and-go sections. Need to store something bulkier? No problem. The divider pops right out to create one spacious cubby for oversized items. And the best part? The front edge is slightly lower, making it easier to see what’s inside and grab items from the back. How To Use the IVAR Box Shelf for Pantry Organization Photo Credit: IKEA.com Here’s how to style your IKEA pantry shelving to feel less utility closet and more rustic chic general store: 1. Go vertical. Assemble two IVAR side units, and insert these box shelves between regular shelves to create mini “zones” — dry goods, snacks, baking supplies, etc. 2. Label everything. Clip-on metal label holders or handwrite on washi tape for a homespun touch. 3. Mix open and closed storage. Pair the box shelves with an IVAR cabinet to hide clutter and keep visual chaos to a minimum. 4. Accessorize. Use IKEA VARIERA boxes, KORKEN glass jars, or even repurposed spice tins to corral small items. The box shelf compartments are deep enough to hold these helpers. 5. Paint or stain it. Want a more polished look? Give the pine finish a coat of white, soft sage, or charcoal grey. Or lean into the Scandi vibes and let it patina naturally. 6. Add drawer slides. It’s the upgrade we wish IKEA had included out of the box. While we’re holding out hope for a version 2.0 with built-in runners, in the meantime, DIYing your own drawer slides is totally doable and might just take your IVAR pantry from smart to genius. Things to Keep in Mind Photo Credit: IKEA.com This shelf insert is designed for IVAR storage units with a 12″ depth. IKEA recommends installing it on the IVAR side units. IVAR is made of untreated solid pine. The product will be even more hard-wearing and easier to look after if you oil or wax the surface. Have you tried the IVAR box shelf?
