That was the dilemma Sanu (@sanu.home), a dedicated IKEA fan, was facing when she came up with a quick, clever hack. Sanu decided to transform IKEA’s VARIERA pot lid organizer into a space-saving, wall-mounted bookshelf. When asked how this hack came about, Sanu said,  “I thought it would be convenient to have a small bookshelf by my bedside. However, since my room is quite small and I couldn’t fit a traditional shelf, I decided to use the VARIERA. I love that the VARIERA can hold books at any width and keeps them evenly spaced, which makes it look neat. The only drawback is that larger, thinner books can sometimes slide off easily.” I thought this was a really smart solution to Sanu’s book storage enigma. It saves space, doesn’t look cluttered, and keeps current bedside reads within easy reach. Plus, it only takes seconds to do, which is always a bonus when it comes to DIY projects. What You’ll Need 1 IKEA VARIERA Pot Lid Organizer 1 hook suitable for your wall type with appropriate hardware Drill/Screwgun Photo Credit: VARIERA Pot Lid Organizer | IKEA.com How to Turn the VARIERA Pot Lid Organizer Into a Bedside Bookshelf in Seconds 1. Install the Hook Photo Credit: Sanu @sanu.home | Instagram Decide where to hang your bookshelf and install the hook. Sanu used a push-pin style hook set with a hyper pin that secures a hook to the wall. It’s super simple since you don’t need any tools.  The one she uses is white, but there are different styles and strengths available, including silver plaster hooks that could blend well with the VARIERA. Make sure to pay attention to the weight load of the hook you get since you need to support several books. If you’re not a fan of the push-pin style, try out traditional hooks and hang with the appropriate hardware. Unless you’re screwing into a stud, you’ll need an anchor for added support. There are also adhesive hooks that can hold quite a bit of weight, but make sure to follow the instructions when installing. Usually, you need to let the hook set for a certain period before hanging anything on it. 2. Hang the VARIERA Vertically Photo Credit: Sanu @sanu.home | Instagram Instead of laying your VARIERA in a drawer to organize pot lids, hang it on the wall vertically to turn it into a bookshelf. So simple. Adjust the organizer to the desired width by opening and closing it until you have it just right. 3. Load Up the Books Put your books on the VARIERA as your final touch. As previously mentioned, Sanu says that thinner books and hardcovers tend to slip, so the shelf seems to be better suited for paperbacks. A Simple, Space-Saving Bedside Bookshelf Undoubtedly, this is a super simple hack and budget-friendly. The VARIERA costs $7.99, and the hook would run you another $10 to $15. It’s a good solution for small spaces or for anyone who prefers a more sleek, minimalist look. Sanu mentions that the chrome finish works especially well with industrial and modern-style spaces. What do you think? Would this hold your favorite reading material? (Or maybe you’d rather use it to hold towels like this hack.)",
