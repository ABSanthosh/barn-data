The trees all around are in full transition, showing off their red, orange, and yellow leaves so I spend as much time outdoors as possible. Yesterday we went to a birthday party for a friend with the most beautiful home. Off their living room was a full library with walnut shelving filled with books and collected things and a billiard table in the middle, it was like stepping on to a film set. Today I’m making a Sunday pot roast and sitting down to watch the show Shrinking, so many people are raving about it so we’re going to dive in. What shows are you enjoying these days? I’m always looking for more to add to my list! Favorite links from the week: This California home with quiet luxury with its beautiful custom cabinetry. This Hoboken loft layered in cozy textiles and warm tones. This minimalist home inspired by the Italian countryside. Hallway ideas to inspire a great first impression. The strega nona kitchen aesthetic is trending. Creative ways to embellish pumpkins. (Also my leaf embellished pumpkin project). Ten reasons why gardening is good for you. Phrases that make you “instantly likeable”. How to let possessions go when it feels difficult. Castles in Europe that are also vacation rentals.",
