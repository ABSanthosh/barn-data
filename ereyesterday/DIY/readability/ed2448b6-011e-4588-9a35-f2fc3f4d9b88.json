  "text": "Sign in to your How-To Geek account Corbin Davenport / Apple Apple Maps is making a major improvement by adding professional ratings and reviews from top experts in the industry. This should help separate Apple from Google since this will help people looking for high-quality reviews, not just user reviews. The feature will launch in the United States exclusively at first, and one of the biggest parts of this update is how users find restaurants. Apple Maps will now include the Michelin Guide’s famous star rating system, which is well-known to food lovers around the world. Restaurants with one, two, or three Michelin stars, which mark outstanding food, will be clearly labeled in the app. Users will also see restaurants with the Michelin Green Star, which highlights eco-friendly practices, and the Bib Gourmand, which recognizes places that offer great food at a good value. This detailed system lets users filter their search results based on the type of dining experience they want and their interest in sustainability. Related Apple Maps Finally Works in Mobile Browsers (Including Android) Apple is not known for supporting platforms other than its own, which is why it was no surprise when Apple Maps launched exclusively for the iPhone and iPad. Slowly, Apple has loosened it's grip, and now it finally works on more phones thanks to mobile browsers. All you have to do is go to maps.apple.com in a web browser on your phone. The update also covers hotels, starting with the Michelin Guide’s \"Michelin Key\" award for hotels that meet high standards of quality and service. Like the restaurant ratings, these top-rated hotels will be easy to find using search filters, helping travelers quickly locate places to stay that match their preferences. For golf lovers, Apple Maps adding Golf Digest ratings will make it much easier to pick the best courses. While this feature isn’t available right now, it will soon give users access to Golf Digest’s rankings and reviews, helping golfers choose courses based on expert advice and thorough analysis. Beyond ratings, Apple Maps users can now use advanced search filters to find restaurants and hotels with specific Michelin awards, Green Stars, or Bib Gourmand recognition. This makes searches more precise, so you can find the right place faster. The update also includes curated guides from each partnered source, offering more than just star ratings. For some hotels, users can book directly through Apple Maps, avoiding visiting a separate booking site. Apple has also mentioned that direct booking for restaurants and golf tee times will be added later, making finding and reserving a spot smoother. Google Maps using user reviews exclusively makes it hard to determine if a restaurant is good. I have seen plenty of reviews where someone was overreacting or didn't give them more stars because the food was more expensive than they expected. Unfortunately, Apple Maps still doesn't have a native application available for Android or Windows devices, and it's not clear if the basic web app will show the new reviews. The new review features will be rolled out first in the United States and then expanded to other regions. Source: Apple",

Like the restaurant ratings, these top-rated hotels will be easy to find using search filters, helping travelers quickly locate places to stay that match their preferences.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFor golf lovers, Apple Maps adding Golf Digest ratings will make it much easier to pick the best courses. While this feature isn’t available right now, it will soon give users access to Golf Digest’s rankings and reviews, helping golfers choose courses based on expert advice and thorough analysis.\u003c/p\u003e    \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003e Beyond ratings, Apple Maps users can now use advanced search filters to find restaurants and hotels with specific Michelin awards, Green Stars, or Bib Gourmand recognition. This makes searches more precise, so you can find the right place faster. The update also includes curated guides from each partnered source, offering more than just star ratings.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFor some hotels, users can book directly through Apple Maps, avoiding visiting a separate booking site. Apple has also mentioned that direct booking for restaurants and golf tee times will be added later, making finding and reserving a spot smoother.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eGoogle Maps using user reviews exclusively makes it hard to determine if a restaurant is good. I have seen plenty of reviews where someone was overreacting or didn\u0026#39;t give them more stars because the food was more expensive than they expected. Unfortunately, Apple Maps still doesn\u0026#39;t have a native application available for Android or Windows devices, and it\u0026#39;s not clear if \u003ca href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/apple-maps-finally-works-in-android-mobile-browsers/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe basic web app\u003c/a\u003e will show the new reviews.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe new review features will be rolled out first in the United States and then expanded to other regions.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-brings-insights-ratings-and-reviews-from-expert-sources-to-apple-maps/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApple\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
