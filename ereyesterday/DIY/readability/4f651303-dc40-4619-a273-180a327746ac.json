All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterThree years ago, when Rhythm and her husband moved into a mid-century modern California home, the existing kitchen (which she describes as “weathered”) wasn’t where they envisioned themselves hanging out much — which wasn’t going to work for them. “Since we spend so much time in the kitchen — cooking, entertaining, and enjoying the heart of our home — it felt important to make it our own,” Rhythm says. “We wanted to create a space that truly reflects our personalities and brings our energy into the room.”Given that the rest of their home has a mid-century modern style, they wanted to keep parts of that throughline in the kitchen, but with a twist. Instead of walnut cabinets (usually associated with the style), when Rhythm came across IKEA’s BODARP kitchen units in the gray-green color, she knew they were perfect. But they wanted to customize the cabinets even further. “We teamed up with a designer from Semihandmade to create a kitchen space that stayed true to our existing layout,” Rhythm shares. “We wanted to ensure the new design not only accommodated our countertop, but also enhanced our storage, which was a top priority.” To start, she ordered unfinished MDF panels and the aforementioned IKEA bases. The couple sanded, primed, painted (in Benjamin Moore’s Lush), added new hardware to the panels, and put together the IKEA bases.“After the old kitchen was demo[lish]ed, we installed new drywall, cut and hung the metal railing for the IKEA system, and carefully mounted the cabinets,” Rhythm says. “The matching fronts were attached, and all the extra trim and pieces were measured, cut, and installed. It was quite the project, especially considering that nothing in an old Eichler is ever a perfect 90 degrees!”When Rhythm hit the midway mark of the cabinet installation, she placed an order with Concrete Collaborative for terrazzo countertops (a throwback kitchen trend that’s hotter than ever!). “Truthfully, we wanted something that would complement the beautiful gray-green tones while also adding vibrant colors and personality that reflect both of us,” Rhythm says. “The terrazzo we chose, with its playful pinks, pairs beautifully with the gray-green hues in the kitchen.”A fabricator measured and cut the terrazzo to align with their countertop space and installed it. One of the room’s final touches was a classic white subway tile backsplash, which Rhythm appreciates because it doesn’t distract from the other elements in the space. Samsung appliances and a new sink were the “cherries on top,” she jokes.While the new kitchen’s design is incredible, what makes it even more special is that Rhythm and her husband did most of the work themselves. It took them five months to complete (while both were working full-time jobs), and cost around $35,000 for materials. “The kitchen DIY project completely consumed us, but in the best way,” Rhythm says. She loves the ample storage that the new kitchen layout affords her. (The island has storage, too, which allows her to keep items off the countertops — giving the room an open, less cluttered look.) The color scheme also complements the artwork that’s displayed in the kitchen.“It’s peaceful, serene, and full of the refreshing tones of spring,” Rhythm shares. “At the same time, it’s fun, playful, and bursting with color — definitely not taking itself too seriously. With the terrazzo counters, it’s both classy and sassy!”",
