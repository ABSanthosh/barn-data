All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterWhen interior designer Kyra Vargas, who founded Handled Interior Design in 2020, moved into her 800-square-foot NYC apartment just three months ago, she knew she wanted to update the space ASAP — especially the 1950s kitchen.“I strongly believe that the kitchen was never renovated since the building was constructed in 1952,” Kyra says. Modernizing the kitchen was important for several reasons, but the decision was mostly influenced by her desire to make a space that would cultivate family memories similar to the ones she had growing up.“The kitchen will always be the heart of the home; I spent so much time watching my father make Michelin-worthy meals and my mom cooking traditional Dominican food,” Kyra says. “There was always something happening in the kitchen. I wanted to carry on that tradition by creating an open kitchen with plenty of space for great meals and even better entertainment.” Additionally, she saw the kitchen renovation as a way of boosting her interior design portfolio while picking up some hands-on skills. The first step was determining how the 96-square-foot kitchen would feel super functional without moving the gas or plumbing lines (which were, luckily, in good shape). But once the new layout was determined, Kyra says she demolished the original kitchen in a matter of a few hours and began painting the room in Behr’s White Base Dead Flat paint. The very next day, Kyra began installing laminate wood flooring from The Home Depot. Next up was installing the new kitchen cabinets, stone countertops, energy-efficient appliances (one of Kyra’s favorite details!), and new white and green tiles. It took two to three weeks to completely reimagine the kitchen, and cost around $5,850 in total. (Her boyfriend is a contractor and helped for free, as well as taught her how to do much of the installation herself.)",
