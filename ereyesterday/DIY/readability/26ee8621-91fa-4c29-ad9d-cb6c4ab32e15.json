  "text": "Subscribing to ChatGPT might seem pointless, but considering how good GPT-4o has become, it's time to seriously reconsider your reservations. 9 Deep Research You can always conduct a decent amount of research with ChatGPT, but the software's capabilities have significantly expanded with GPT-4o. Deep Research is the best example of this. While you can use ChatGPT's Deep Research tool with the free version, you will not receive as many requests as with the Plus version. When you prompt via Deep Research, ChatGPT will do a comprehensive web search. You can pull reading lists, statistics, and much more. Given the extent to which Deep Research does its job, you'll need to wait a few minutes for the results to be completed. But considering how comprehensive the answers are, it's worth waiting. At the time of writing in May 2025, you get 25 Deep Research requests per month. 8 Better Reasoning Reasoning was a big problem in previous versions of ChatGPT, but over time, GPT-4o has become much better in this respect. While still not on the same level of Perplexity, you'll get comprehensive responses when you ask for deeper reasoning. You can use this feature in all kinds of conversations. While it makes sense when researching, you may also find use in asking for deeper reasoning when you set goals. Sometimes, asking for this can help with applying more logic to decisions you make, too. In addition to reading your prompts, ChatGPT can reason using images you upload. 7 Fewer Robotic Responses ChatGPT will never replace human conversations, but it now sounds much less robotic. When exchanging messages with the chatbot, you'll feel as though you're speaking to a person. The software can use human language and colloquialisms, and it has the intelligence to ask legitimate questions. With GPT-4o, ChatGPT is more likely to give honest responses when you ask it to. Rather than acting like your biggest cheerleader, the tool can rationalize its points and is less afraid to disagree with you. You may sometimes need to fine-tune this, though, with prompts like \"please be honest, and don't be afraid to disagree.\" 6 Better Image Generation DALL-E was a useful AI image generator, but it had numerous issues that needed addressing. For example, it was notoriously bad at creating text; anything more than simple words quickly became a problem. Though it occasionally makes errors, GPT-4o is much better at generating images. Humans interact better with objects, and the app listens to prompts more. When coupled with ChatGPT's editing features, you get a strong all-around AI image generator, though Adobe Firefly is still better. One annoyance is that even now, GPT-4o sometimes doesn't listen to requests. Regardless of how many times you reword the prompt, ChatGPT sometimes just won't do what you asked it to. Hopefully, this will be ironed out with enough time. 5 Faster Processing I'm what you would describe as a ChatGPT power user, and as a result, I've noticed subtle changes, such as increased processing speeds. From what I've seen, GPT-4o takes less time to craft responses. Conversations typically flow much faster, especially when the software doesn't have to search the web or update memory. The web app could use some improvement, as conversation speeds slow down as they grow, but it's still significantly better than before. Since you can speak more quickly with the tool these days, it's even easier to save time and accomplish more with ChatGPT. 4 Offering More Suggestions Earlier versions of ChatGPT often felt like using the app as a one-sided idea launchpad. You could receive suggestions if you manually prompted the chatbot, but it rarely took the initiative on its own. However, GPT-4o is much better at giving suggestions without you needing to prompt further. ChatGPT asks if you want to create spreadsheets, images, mind maps, and more. Often, these suggestions will be things that you either didn't think of or would have needed to spend more time manually working on. When using Deep Research, ChatGPT often asks follow-up questions to ensure it has all the necessary information. You can tell GPT-4o to stop offering suggestions if you think they're too much, but having this feature on by default is great for creative thinking. 3 Better Memorization You may need to start different conversations on ChatGPT for numerous reasons. Perhaps you want to organize your thoughts more effectively, or maybe you've reached the maximum conversation limit. Regardless, you don't need to worry about the app forgetting everything it's told you. The software can cross-read and extract any relevant information to better inform its responses. Even after deleting certain memories, I've found that the tool is capable of understanding the context without me needing to refine my prompt. Because ChatGPT can remember what you tell it more effectively, you'll receive much better responses than before. This alone is worth paying the monthly price for Plus. 2 Improved Non-English Use While ChatGPT has made significant strides in its English-language offerings, it hasn't always performed as well in other languages. But with GPT-4o, it's much better in this respect. In addition to English, I sometimes use GPT-4o in Danish. While it's still not on the same level as English, the tool is better at helping me memorize and develop the responses I want. It could use some improvement in image generation, but I expect that to change in the long run. Languages with special characters will probably take the tool more time to learn. 1 Better Voice Mode In addition to text-based improvements, ChatGPT's Voice Mode has made huge strides since the early days of GPT-4o. Conversations flow better, and while you can still tell that you're talking to a bot, it does feel more human. ChatGPT even introduced Monday Mode, a new voice, in April 2025, to expand its offerings. Besides asking for advice, you can use the tool for interview preparation, to engage in some banter, and much more. Since your chats will be transcribed later, it's worth experimenting with Voice Mode. ChatGPT Plus offers more benefits than may initially meet the eye, and the significant improvements to GPT-4o are one of those. The free version of ChatGPT is suitable for basic conversations, but you'll miss out if you don't upgrade.",

Perhaps you want to organize your thoughts more effectively, or maybe you\u0026#39;ve reached the maximum conversation limit.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eRegardless, you don\u0026#39;t need to worry about the app forgetting everything it\u0026#39;s told you. The software can cross-read and extract any relevant information to better inform its responses. Even after deleting certain memories, I\u0026#39;ve found that the tool is capable of understanding the context without me needing to refine my prompt.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eBecause ChatGPT can remember what you tell it more effectively, you\u0026#39;ll receive much better responses than before.
