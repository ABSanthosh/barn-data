Before AT, I was an editor at HGTV Magazine and This Old House Magazine.published nowWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.One thing in my home I’ve been struggling with lately is the entryway — especially since the super low temperatures have been requiring more warm winter gear than is normal. It’s hard to pack a lot of function into what is ultimately a pretty tiny entryway that’s basically just a hallway. But hard doesn’t mean impossible! I’ve managed to find bins that perfectly fit the built-in shelves, and a boot tray that’s exactly the width of the available floor space. Next on my list is hooks; while my husband and I keep our coats at the back door (all the better to throw on before escorting our dogs outside), it would be nice for guests to have a place to hang their jackets right as they come inside.In my quest to make my entryway work better for my family (and our friends), I’ve been looking back at previously published entryway before and afters to see how other DIYers dealt with their less-than-perfect entryways and mudrooms. One that I recently rediscovered, to my delight, was this budget mudroom makeover that turned an impractical closet into much more functional storage. Here are the two biggest things in this makeover that I can’t stop thinking about.Removing the closet doors was a game-changer.As someone with a serious lack of closet space, I understand the gasps of alarm some people have when hearing someone willingly removed a closet from their home. But the reality is that sometimes closets are just not the best fit! I, for one, hate having to fuss with a hanger when putting away my coat.The DIYer behind this transformation understood that what made the most sense for her lifestyle was not an enclosed closet, but an open mudroom-style entryway that would make coats and shoes easier to put away. The lesson? Don’t cling to home features that aren’t working for you just because “that’s what’s done.” Your home should fit your life!The shoe cubby is IKEA in disguise.The other thing I love about this makeover is that it looks completely custom and professional, but there’s actually an IKEA hack here! A KALLAX shelf — you know, those basic cube shelves you’ve seen a million times before — was the perfect fit for the width of the closet, and with a couple coats of deep blue paint and a piece of stained wood on top to serve as a bench, it looks totally unrecognizable.Even though this makeover certainly looks high-end, the total price was just $215 thanks to the use of budget IKEA furniture, leftover paint and stain, and plenty of sweat equity. It’s a great reminder that you don’t have to spend a lot to make it look like you spent a lot. In other words, you can fake fancy!To learn more about this clever redo, check out the full makeover here.
