There’s a special kind of dread when your phone hits 1% and you’re nowhere near an outlet. 5 Great for Emergency Situations Aryan Surendranath / MakeUseOf Most smartphone batteries last between 15 and 20 hours on a single charge. That’s plenty of juice for a regular day, but what happens if you forget to charge your phone before you leave home or use a lot of battery-intensive apps during the day? Your battery could run out at the worst possible time. Of course, if you have access to a power outlet, you can simply plug in your phone and wait for it to charge back up. But what if you’re traveling or stuck in the middle of nowhere? Plugging your phone into an outlet might not be an option. In times like these, a power bank can truly be a lifesaver. Many power banks even support fast charging, so you won't have to wait all that long to use your phone if you’re in a pinch. 4 Keeps You From Relying on Public Charging Stations There’s nothing wrong with using a secure public charging station. But the reality is that if you’re in a crowded place, you’re unlikely to find one with free ports. Even if you find an unoccupied charging station, your phone won’t charge as fast as it does at home. This means you’re essentially just stuck waiting around the charging station for your phone to power on. Beyond that, security risks like juice jacking have really turned me off public charging stations. I don’t want to risk data theft or malware exposure because I forgot to charge my phone. I’d much rather carry a power portable bank to charge my phone anytime the battery drops too much. 3 Protects Your Phone's Battery You’ve likely heard that charging your phone overnight to maximum capacity is bad. The opposite is also true. Routinely letting your phone’s charge get close to 0% can wear out the lithium-ion battery. If you want to prevent this sort of battery degradation, it’s best to keep your phone’s charge between 20% and 80%. If you have trouble doing this, purchase a portable power bank that can help you keep your phone’s charge from dipping too low. This way, not only will you always have sufficient charge on your phone, but you’re also maintaining your battery’s health. 2 Traveling Becomes Less Stressful I tend to use my phone a lot when I’m traveling, whether it’s for navigation, photography, or even just listening to music. All this extra usage drains my battery relatively quickly, compared to when I’m at home or working. A dead phone is the last thing I want when I’m in an unfamiliar place, and I don’t want to go through the hassle of trying to locate a charging station. That’s why I always carry a power bank with me during my travels. 1 They're Cheap and Portable Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf Power banks are relatively inexpensive, and yet provide a ton of value. Given that it’s not hard to find a high-quality power bank for under $20 and sometimes even less on sales, it helps to have one on hand. Unlike a lot of other gadgets, power banks are fairly compact and lightweight, which means you can just carry one around in your backpack or bag, without it taking up too much room or adding unnecessary weight. Keeping a power bank on you at all times won’t do you any harm. In fact, it just makes your life easier. So, if you spot one at a good price, don’t hesitate to purchase it right away.",

That’s plenty of juice for a regular day, but what happens if you forget to charge your phone before you leave home or use a lot of battery-intensive apps during the day? Your battery could run out at the worst possible time.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, if you have access to a power outlet, you can simply plug in your phone and wait for it to charge back up. But what if you’re traveling or stuck in the middle of nowhere? Plugging your phone into an outlet might not be an option. In times like these, a power bank can truly be a lifesaver.

But the reality is that if you’re in a crowded place, you’re unlikely to find one with free ports. Even if you find an unoccupied charging station, your phone won’t charge as fast as it does at home. This means you’re essentially just stuck waiting around the charging station for your phone to power on.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eBeyond that, security risks like \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-juice-jacking/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ejuice jacking\u003c/a\u003e have really turned me off public charging stations.
