  "text": "Artificial Intelligence Sign in to your MUO account As the AI revolution continues to change the face of technology, we're beginning to see companies figure out what people want from their digital assistants. It seems that people are interested in having AI models do all of the busy work for them so they can get back to doing more important things. As such, a company has released the beta build of an AI that can control your PC, letting it do all of the boring jobs for you. Anthropic Releases a New AI Model That Can Control Your PC As announced on the Anthropic blog, the company has updated its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model. Among all the new features, the biggest one allows the AI to control your computer based on what you ask it to do: Available today on the API, developers can direct Claude to use computers the way people do—by looking at a screen, moving a cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the first frontier AI model to offer computer use in public beta. Anthropic admits that, right now, the AI model that controls your PC is \"cumbersome and error-prone.\" However, this may be the beginning of digital assistants that can perform menial computer-based tasks without being tied to a single app. If you're not interested in letting a robot dig through your computer, Anthropic also upgraded Sonnet's intelligence. Not only is it better at doing math problems, summarising topics at an undergraduate level, and generating code, but it also has improved reasoning skills. The latter point is important when generating factual responses, as studies suggest that AI reasoning has critical flaws that prevent LLMs from giving accurate answers. Anthropic announced that Sonnet is now available for general use, so if you're curious about how it holds up to the competition, be sure to give it a try.",
