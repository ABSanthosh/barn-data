Here are four of my favorites. Anker Solix C1000 Brent Dirks / MakeUseOf A portable power station is a must-have, especially if you live in an area with frequent power outages or if you want to keep all your electronics powered up during a camping trip. The Anker Solix C1000 provides a nice mix of features and capacity. The 1,056wh battery can power a wide variety of devices, including appliances, thanks to a 2400W output. You can juice the C1000 to 100 percent in under an hour. You can use the companion app to check the power status of the battery from anywhere. Along with traditional AC, you can even use an optional solar panel to provide power. The Anker Solix C1000 is $449 during the sale. You can read my comprehensive review of the Anker Solix C1000 to find out more about how it works. Roborock Q5 Pro+ Robot Vacuum and Mop You don’t need to break the bank for a combination robot mop and vacuum. The Roborock Q5 Pro+ can keep your floors and carpets clean for less. The vacuum provides 5,500Pa of suction power to tackle dirt and debris on your floor. And you won’t have to get your hands dirty to empty it. Everything is sucked into a bag in the self-emptying station that can hold up to 7 weeks of debris before needing to be switched out. While vacuuming, the unit can also mop hard floors. You can use the companion app to customize cleaning around your home. It even works with Amazon Alexa, so you can send the robot cleaning with a simple voice command. The Roborock Q5 Pro+ is $299.99. Apple Watch Series 10 Brent Dirks / MakeUseOf Now is the time to snag the most recent Apple Watch—Series 10. Both the 42mm and larger 46mm versions are on sale. The Series 10 offers some substantial upgrades for fans of Apple’s wearable device. Along with a larger screen, the case is thinner and lighter, making it more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. The watch can help detect sleep apnea as well. It also borrows some features from the larger and more expensive Ultra 2, including a water temperature and depth gauge. Take a look at my complete Apple Watch Series 10 review for more information about all the wearable device. The 42mm Wi-Fi only version starts at $299.99 while the 46mm version with Wi-Fi is $329.99. Roku Express A streaming stick is one of the best accessories to take your smart TV to the next level. It can also bring a dumb TV into the modern age. If you’re looking for an inexpensive option, try out the Roku Express. It’s simple and easy to get started, just plug it into your TV and connect to the Internet. There’s no dedicated power adapter needed. You can stream pretty much anything you can imagine, including more than 400 free live TV channels. A remote is included. You can purchase the Roku Express for $17.99.",
