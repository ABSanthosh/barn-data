  "text": "Sign in to your How-To Geek account NotebookLM, the AI-powered notebook and research tool with Google Gemini, just received yet another update. Google has added 'Discover sources' as a new option to help you find sources for whatever you're working on. With the new Discover Sources feature in NotebookLM, users can now do web searches directly within the app, saving time and effort. The new 'Discover' button can be found in the Sources pane next to the 'Add' button. When users click this button, a search box will appear that asks them to describe their topic of interest. After entering a topic, NotebookLM's advanced search engine, powered by Google's Gemini technology, kicks into action. NotebookLM then searches the web and collects possible sources related to the user’s request. The app then uses advanced algorithms to review these sources and pick the most relevant and credible ones, considering factors like content quality and how well they match the topic. The outcome is a curated list of up to ten recommended sources, presented clearly. Each source comes with a short, annotated summary that explains its relevance to the user's query, making it easy to assess and choose. This annotation feature greatly cuts down the time needed to sort through many search results, focusing on those most useful to the user. Users can fully control which sources they want to add to their NotebookLM project. They can select all ten recommended sources at once or pick the ones that suit their needs best. Once added, these sources integrate seamlessly into the NotebookLM ecosystem and are ready for use in features like Audio Overviews, FAQs, and Q\u0026A functions. This should make a more efficient workflow and allow users to utilize their new sources within existing projects without interruption. Moreover, these sources stay accessible in the notebook for later review, citation, and note-taking. For newcomers or those seeking inspiration, Google will also add an 'I'm Feeling Curious' button. This is found beneath the text field and generates sources for random topics. Google is using its advanced Gemini AI model to operate NotebookLM. Gemini’s powerful abilities let NotebookLM execute complex web searches, analyze results, and curate highly relevant sources quickly. This strong engine provides a level of accuracy and efficiency that surpasses traditional search methods. Related Gemini's New Canvas Feature is The Ultimate Writing/Coding Buddy While you probably don't want a whole program written by AI, it can help you come up with solutions in specific snippets so your code is more efficient and functional. If you're going to do that, though, you might as well use it with Gemini's Canvas—it will make it way easier to check if that code actually works. If you use Wordtune, then the library feature seems very similar to this. Unfortunately, Wordtune's feature tends to mess up a lot and needs constant updates, but it seems like NotebookLM is doing so well that it's adding more features. You'll need a Google One AI plan if you want more of these advanced features from NotebookLM. I wouldn't say you need it unless you work in an environment where you use the same sources repeatedly. Even still, this update is a major advancement in the app’s capabilities. I don't doubt that finding sources is a time-consuming process. Researching on its own takes a while, but this should make it easier. However, Google isn't always the most reliable, so I would be careful of just trusting whatever sources it puts in front of you. It's always best to do independent research and double-check what you're given. Things like these tend to take everything given to them as fact, and websites aren't always correct. It's still good to start researching, and you can always add more sources, so be on the lookout for the rollout, which should be coming in a week. You can check it out from the official NotebookLM website. Source: Google",

another update. Google has added \u0026#39;Discover sources\u0026#39; as a new option to help you find sources for whatever you\u0026#39;re working on.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWith the new Discover Sources feature in NotebookLM, users can now do web searches directly within the app, saving time and effort. The new \u0026#39;Discover\u0026#39; button can be found in the Sources pane next to the \u0026#39;Add\u0026#39; button. When users click this button, a search box will appear that asks them to describe their topic of interest. After entering a topic, NotebookLM\u0026#39;s advanced search engine, powered by Google\u0026#39;s Gemini technology, kicks into action.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eNotebookLM then searches the web and collects possible sources related to the user’s request. The app then uses advanced algorithms to review these sources and pick the most relevant and credible ones, considering factors like content quality and how well they match the topic. The outcome is a curated list of up to ten recommended sources, presented clearly.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eEach source comes with a short, annotated summary that explains its relevance to the user\u0026#39;s query, making it easy to assess and choose. This annotation feature greatly cuts down the time needed to sort through many search results, focusing on those most useful to the user.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eUsers can fully control which sources they want to add to their NotebookLM project. They can select all ten recommended sources at once or pick the ones that suit their needs best. Once added, these sources integrate seamlessly into the NotebookLM ecosystem and are ready for use in features like Audio Overviews, FAQs, and Q\u0026amp;A functions.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThis should make a more efficient workflow and allow users to utilize their new sources within existing projects without interruption. Moreover, these sources stay accessible in the notebook for later review, citation, and note-taking. For newcomers or those seeking inspiration, Google will also add an \u0026#39;I\u0026#39;m Feeling Curious\u0026#39; button. This is found beneath the text field and generates sources for random topics.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eGoogle is using its advanced Gemini AI model to operate NotebookLM. Gemini’s powerful abilities let NotebookLM execute complex web searches, analyze results, and curate highly relevant sources quickly.

I don\u0026#39;t doubt that finding sources is a time-consuming process. Researching on its own takes a while, but this should make it easier. However, Google isn\u0026#39;t always the most reliable, so I would be careful of just trusting whatever sources it puts in front of you.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s always best to do independent research and double-check what you\u0026#39;re given. Things like these tend to take everything given to them as fact, and websites aren\u0026#39;t always correct. It\u0026#39;s still good to start researching, and you can always add more sources, so be on the lookout for the rollout, which should be coming in a week.
