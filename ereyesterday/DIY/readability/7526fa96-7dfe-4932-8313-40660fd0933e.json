What to Do if You Receive This Message What to Do if You've Already Fallen for This Scam Key Takeaways Beware fake \"sad announcement\" phishing scams, which can come off as legitimate with touching quotes and real names. Delete the message and block the sender if you receive a \"sad announcement\" phishing email; contact loved ones mentioned to alert them to a potential scam. If you fell for the scam, inform the payment provider, cancel bank cards, and scan for malware to minimize financial and tech damage. Some phishing scams are easy to recognize, but you’ll have to try harder in other cases. One of the most sinister schemes circulating now relates to fake sad announcements; it’s vital that you know what to look out for. What Is the \"Sad Announcement\" Phishing Scam? The “sad announcement” phishing scam involves someone sending you a message saying they have bad news. Most of the time, this relates to them claiming one of your loved ones has passed away. These emails almost always finish off with a thought-provoking quote. You will also see a link included, which typically looks strange. While you can use websites to check if a link is safe, the links in these emails are best avoided in every situation. These emails are sometimes difficult to assess because they use legitimate first and last names. Finding and verifying email addresses can sometimes help you confirm your suspicions that these emails are not genuine. What to Do if You Receive This Message This message likely won’t harm you if you know what to do with it. To ensure that you don’t fall victim to this phishing scam, I’ve listed my two key recommendations below. 1. Delete the Email and Block the Sender I’ve almost fallen for a phishing scam in the past, and in that situation, I reported the email to PayPal. However, I only did so because it used the company’s invoice format. For the \"sad announcement\" phishing scam, you don’t need to go to such lengths. In this case, you should simply delete the email. Once you’ve done that, you must block the sender. Doing so will at least stop them from being able to contact you again. After you’ve removed it from your main inbox, it’s a good idea to then delete the email permanently. 2. Contact the Loved One If the sad announcement phishing scam included the name of someone you actually know (or their relation), it’s still a good idea to contact them. Let them know you received this email and wanted to check on them; it’s a good opportunity to show gratitude, too. Besides looking out for them and showing your appreciation, you should tell them that other emails about them might be circulating. However, if you plan to show them the message, take a screenshot rather than forwarding the email to them. You don’t want them to accidentally click on the link! What to Do if You've Already Fallen for This Scam Hearing that prevention is the best cure is pretty useless if you’ve already fallen victim to this scam. So if you fall into that category, here are some actions you can take to minimize the damage. 1. Inform Your Payment Provider and Cancel Your Bank Cards If you’ve submitted payment details or have saved them on your device, inform your payment provider as soon as possible. Get the institution to cancel your cards and issue new ones. Fortunately, with online banking being so commonplace now, you can often use virtual cards until a new physical card is delivered. Getting a chargeback for credit cards, PayPal, or your debit card can be difficult. Nonetheless, if you’ve transferred money (or you notice that some left your account), it’s still worth trying. Normally, you’ll have to dispute the transaction in your app or by contacting customer support; the process will vary depending on your bank. 2. Scan for Malware Besides minimizing the financial impact, you should also consider the effects on your computer, phone, or tablet. If you clicked the link in this phishing scam email, make sure that you scan for malware. You can choose whichever tool you want, but I personally recommend upgrading to Malwarebytes Premium. If the software finds malware or other dangerous programs, quarantine them. While the “sad announcement” phishing scam is very sinister and guaranteed to play on your emotions, staying vigilant when receiving is essential. Do not click on the links in these messages under any circumstances, and if you already have, be sure to check for malware. Informing your bank so it's aware of any potentially fraudulent transactions is also a good idea.",
