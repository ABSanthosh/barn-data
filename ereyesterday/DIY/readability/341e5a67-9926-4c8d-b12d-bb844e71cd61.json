  "text": "Sign in to your MUO account Pinterest has, for some time now, been facing complaints that AI slop is ruining the user experience. However, thankfully, Pinterest is now tackling the problem of AI slop by labeling images it suspects of being generated by or modified with AI. Pinterest Tackles Its Big Gen AI Problem As fun, exciting, and useful as generative AI can be, it can also be misused in plenty of ways. One of which is using generative AI to create endless AI images which can then be passed off as real. AI images can be seen everywhere now, but especially on social media platforms. And most AI images are not labeled as such, with people passing them off as either a real photo or original artwork created by a human. This is especially problematic for Pinterest, which is built solely around images. When many of those images are being generated by artificial intelligence, but the people uploading them decline to admit as much, that's an issue. Thankfully, Pinterest is taking action against the rise of AI slop, which some users have been complaining about for months. AI slop, for those unfamiliar with the term, is low-quality, mass-produced content generated by artificial intelligence. To fight back against the AI slop that has become a noticeable presence on the site, Pinterest is introducing what it calls Gen AI Labels. These are, as the name suggests, labels attached to images identified as being generated or modified by AI. In a post on the Pinterest Newsroom, Pinterest explains how it has been experimenting with these labels for the past several months. And they're now finally ready to be rolled out globally. When Pinterest's systems identify an AI image through metadata and classifiers, a label will be attached to it. This will inform viewers that it's \"AI Modified\" when they click on an image pin. Users will also be able to opt to see fewer AI pins in their chosen topics. Pinterest Has Been Impacted by AI Slop There's no doubt that Pinterest has been impacted by the rise of generative AI. The company has maintained that AI images are a small part of what users see, but as this Futurism article explains, some users feel that AI images have, alongside other issues, ruined Pinterest. Pinterest is far from alone in being affected by AI slop, however. Anyone still using Facebook will have likely seen an AI image accompanied by some heartwarming message designed to get a reaction. And there will be hundreds of comments underneath it from people who have fallen for the ploy. Images created by artificial intelligence are going to get more difficult to detect over time. But for now at least, most people should be able to see through the fakery by using common sense and logic. And if those fail you, labels such as the ones Pinterest is introducing will help.",

id=\"article-body\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePinterest has, for some time now, been facing complaints that AI slop is ruining the user experience. However, thankfully, Pinterest is now tackling the problem of AI slop by labeling images it suspects of being generated by or modified with AI.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"pinterest-tackles-its-big-gen-ai-problem\"\u003e\n                        Pinterest Tackles Its Big Gen AI Problem\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs fun, exciting, and useful as generative AI can be, it can also be misused in plenty of ways. One of which is using generative AI to create endless AI images which can then be passed off as real.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAI images can be seen everywhere now, but especially on social media platforms. And most AI images are not labeled as such, with people passing them off as either a real photo or original artwork created by a human.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis is especially problematic for Pinterest, which is built solely around images. When many of those \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-ai-online-photo-editors/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eimages are being generated by artificial intelligence\u003c/a\u003e, but the people uploading them decline to admit as much, that\u0026#39;s an issue.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, Pinterest is taking action against the rise of AI slop, which some users have been complaining about for months. AI slop, for those unfamiliar with the term, is low-quality, mass-produced content generated by artificial intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e    \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eTo fight back against the AI slop that has become a noticeable presence on the site, Pinterest is introducing what it calls Gen AI Labels. These are, as the name suggests, labels attached to images identified as being generated or modified by AI.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIn a \u003ca href=\"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en-gb/news/introducing-gen-ai-labels/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epost on the Pinterest Newsroom\u003c/a\u003e, Pinterest explains how it has been experimenting with these labels for the past several months. And they\u0026#39;re now finally ready to be rolled out globally.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhen Pinterest\u0026#39;s systems identify an AI image through metadata and classifiers, a label will be attached to it. This will inform viewers that it\u0026#39;s \u0026#34;AI Modified\u0026#34; when they click on an image pin. Users will also be able to opt to see fewer AI pins in their chosen topics.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"pinterest-has-been-impacted-by-ai-slop\"\u003e\n                        Pinterest Has Been Impacted by AI Slop\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s no doubt that Pinterest has been impacted by the rise of generative AI. The company has maintained that AI images are a small part of what users see, but as \u003ca href=\"https://futurism.com/pinterest-ai-slop\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis Futurism article\u003c/a\u003e explains, some users feel that AI images have, alongside other issues, ruined Pinterest.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003ePinterest is far from alone in being affected by AI slop, however. Anyone still using Facebook will have likely seen an AI image accompanied by some heartwarming message designed to get a reaction. And there will be hundreds of comments underneath it from people who have fallen for the ploy.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eImages created by artificial intelligence are going to get more difficult to detect over time. But for now at least, most people should be able to see through the fakery by using common sense and logic. And if those fail you, labels such as the ones Pinterest is introducing will help.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                            \n\n    \n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
