Like other items in your home, dust buildup happens slowly over time, creating a surface that’s dirtier than you realize and fingerprints can also easily leave smudges each time the screen is touched. Cleaning a TV screen is pretty quick and easy, but you’ll want to make sure that you are using the right tools for your particular type of TV so you don’t damage the screen. You’ll also want to keep up with cleaning your remote controls as they are handled multiple times a day in most homes as well as your cable box and related TV cords.

Before you start cleaning, you’ll want to know which category your TV fits into. Most TVs on the market these days are either LCD (LED) or OLED TVs, but some homes still have older sets that are plasmas or even glass front CRTVs (the ones with the tubes inside). If you have a tube TV you can use certain types of cleaners without an issue, but most chemicals are too damaging for the more delicate coated LCD, OLED, and plasma screens, so make sure to pay attention to the type of screen you have. Supplies needed to clean a TV Soft microfiber cloth (the lint-free type of cloth used for cleaning camera lenses or eyeglasses) TV cleaner spray or distilled water (optional) Note: When it comes to cleaning electronics, you’ll always want to consult your product owner’s manual to see if your particular model has any cleaning restrictions from the manufacturer so you don’t void your warranty. Large Microfiber Cloth Screen Cleaner Spray Screen Cleaner Spray and Cloth T What to avoid when cleaning a flat screen TV When cleaning a flat screen TV, you’ll want to avoid harsh chemicals that can damage your delicate TV surface. Cleaners like Windex (or any other type of window cleaner), scouring powder, and abrasive pads and scrubs should be avoided as well as any cleaner that contains wax, undiluted dish soap, alcohol, paint thinner, ammonia, benzene, or acetone as they can ruin your TV screen. How to clean a flat screen TV When it comes to cleaning a LCD (LED), OLED, or plasma TV screen, there are just a few steps to follow to ensure a clean screen: Turn Off Your TV: It’s best to turn off your TV for several minutes before cleaning or even unplug. This will allow the screen to cool (a warm screen is harder to clean) and the dark screen will show the dust and prints much more clearly than when the TV is on. Dry Dust Your Screen: Use a soft microfiber cloth to wipe off the screen gently without pressing too hard on the delicate surface. While items like household rags, paper towels, or even tissues may seem soft enough, they can actually be abrasive to the surface so it’s best to use a microfiber towel. Clean in a circular motion until all the dust is removed from the TV screen and don’t forget to wipe down the top and side edges of the TV as well. Check that the vents of the TV are not clogged with dust as those should be clear so the TV can dispel heat and cool down properly. Just be sure to carefully support your TV while cleaning if it’s simply on a stand and not anchored to the wall or piece of furniture under the TV. Remove Stains and Smudges: If there is a stain of some sort or smudge on your TV, you can either use a cleaning spray designed specifically for TVs, or you can use a small amount of distilled water. Either way, you’ll want to lightly spray your cleaning solution onto a clean soft microfiber cloth rather than directly onto the TV. Using only a small amount of water or cleaner will prevent any liquid or moisture from getting inside your television and causing any damage. Spray the cloth lightly and use small circular motions over the areas of stains or smudges until gone. Again, remember not to press too hard as you clean to avoid screen damage—too much pressure can cause pixels to burn out, which is also the same with laptop displays and desktop monitors. Light pressure is the key when cleaning these types of screens. Make sure to spray only your cleaning cloth with cleaning solution or distilled water, never spray the liquid onto the screen itself. Buff Out Any Streaks: Once your TV screen is clean and dry, check to see if there are any streaks from your cleaner product, and use a dry soft microfiber cloth to gently buff out any streaks until your screen is spotless. Can I make my own TV cleaner? If you don’t want to buy a TV or laptop screen cleaner, you can mix together a cleaning solution of water and white vinegar at a 1:1 ratio and pour into a spray bottle. Spray that lightly onto a cloth to gently clean your flat screen TV. Can you use tap water to clean your TV? While it may seem tempting to switch out distilled water for tap water in your cleaning routine, tap water contains minerals and other additions that will leaves streaks on your TV, so it’s best to distilled water if at all possible. How to clean a glass front TV Glass front TVs (the ones that have tubes inside) can withstand a little more elbow grease and product than newer TVs since it’s a lot closer to cleaning the glass windows in your home. Simply: Turn Off Your TV: It’s best to turn off your TV for several minutes before cleaning or even unplug. This will allow the screen to cool (a warm screen is harder to clean) and the dark screen will show the dust and prints much more clearly than when the TV is on. Dry Dust Your Screen: Use a clean soft cloth or rag to wipe off the screen gently. Clean in a circular motion until all the dust is removed from the TV screen and don’t forget to wipe down the top and side edges of the TV as well. Check that the vents of the TV are not clogged with dust as those vents should be clear so the TV can dispel heat and cool down properly. Just be sure to carefully support your TV while cleaning. Remove Stains and Smudges: If there is a stain of some sort or smudge on your TV, you can either use a cleaning spray designed specifically for TVs, or you can use 70% isopropyl alcohol. Either way, you’ll want to lightly spray your cleaning solution onto a clean soft cloth rather than directly onto the TV. This will prevent any moisture from getting inside your television and causing any damage. Spray the cloth lightly and use the damp cloth in small circular motions over the areas of stains or smudges until gone. Buff Out Any Streaks: Once your TV screen is clean and dry, check to see if there are any streaks from your cleaner product, and use a dry soft microfiber cloth to gently buff out any streaks until your screen is spotless. It’s a good idea to also dry dust your TV cords and related receiver or cable box when you clean your TV as they also gather dust. Use distilled water misted onto a cloth if there is reside to remove.How to clean your TV remote Your remote is actually what withstands the most daily touching, so you’ll want to clean your remote often to keep grime from building up. Remove the Batteries: Taking out the batteries will ensure that all the button pushing you do while cleaning won’t be activating the TV controls. Give it a Tap: Tap the remote gently into the palm of your hand to dislodge any small debris or crumbs that may have gotten stuck. Wipe it Down: You can use a watered down solution of water mixed with a bit of 70% isopropyl alcohol and wipe down the whole surface. Don’t soak your rag with the cleaning solution though as that may get the water into the buttons of your remote and cause damage, just lightly mist the rag so it’s barely wet. Get Detailed: For a deeper clean, you can use a damp pointed cotton swab to clean and scrub a bit between the buttons with your water/alcohol mixture and a toothpick can be handy to dislodge any stuck debris. Dry and Reassemble: Dry your newly clean remote with a soft cloth and reinstall the batteries.",
