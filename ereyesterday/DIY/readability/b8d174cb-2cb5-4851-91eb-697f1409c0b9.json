  "text": "With subscription fatigue hitting everyone's wallets, cloud storage often feels like an easy expense to eliminate. But before you hit that cancel button on Google One, there are some serious consequences you need to know about. Your Google Account Reverts to Free Storage Limits Every Google Account comes with 15GB of free storage, shared across Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Photos. That sounds generous on paper, but if you've been a Google One subscriber for a while, chances are you've already sailed past that limit. When you cancel your Google One subscription, you revert to this default limit, which might seem manageable at first, until you see how quickly that space gets used up. You won't lose access to your files immediately once your billing cycle wraps up; Google gives you some breathing room to sort things out. That's your window to either download the important stuff or do a deep clean—because once you're over that free limit, your options get restricted real fast. You Can't Add New Files or Create New Documents Now, here's where things start to get really inconvenient. You won't be able to upload any additional files or folders to Google Drive once you exceed the free storage limit. This means you won't be able to upload PDFs, images, or any other files to your Drive. Related It gets worse. You also can't create new or edit documents directly in Google's suite of apps. Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, and Forms, that is. Google doesn't delete your stuff when you downgrade, but you're stuck in read-only mode until you either clear space or pay up again. The workaround involves either deleting existing files to make room (which is almost impossible and defeats the purpose of cloud storage) or working in other platforms temporarily. Gmail Will Stop Sending and Receiving Mail This one hits hard. When your account exceeds the free storage limit, Gmail stops functioning properly. That means no new messages come in, and you can't send emails either. Think about what that means if you're job-hunting, receiving bank alerts, or relying on Gmail for customer communication. Even worse, senders won't receive a bounce message right away, so they might think their email has gone through. You could miss something important and not even know it. Your Backups Could Be at Risk If you've been using Google One to back up your WhatsApp chats, photos, and videos, or even your Android phone, canceling the plan introduces the risk that Google will stop automatically backing up your data. Related 6 Simple Ways to Back Up Your Data Safely Avoid risking lost files by learning how to back them up securely. If a device goes missing or breaks, you may not have the most recent version of your content to restore. It's not a guaranteed disaster, but it's a gamble you'll want to think twice about. Family Sharing Gets Disabled One of Google One's more underrated features is family sharing. With a single subscription, you can share your storage and some benefits with up to five other people. Once you cancel, they all revert to their respective 15GB limits as well. That can lead to unexpected issues for family members who may have been unknowingly relying on your plan, especially if they're not tech-savvy and don't realize why things suddenly stop syncing. You Lose Access to Exclusive Benefits Google One is not just all about storage. Depending on your plan, you may also gain access to a VPN for Android and iOS, Google Photos editing tools (such as Magic Eraser), Google Store cashback offers, longer group video calls, extended customer support, and even special hotel pricing in Google Search. Many of these perks disappear when you cancel. And while you might not use all of them, a few (like the VPN or photo-editing tools) could actually be saving you money on third-party apps or services. Related Before you cancel your Google One subscription, take a good look at how you actually use its services. Add up the potential costs of replacing lost functionality with alternative solutions. Then decide if those monthly savings are really worth the digital disruption you're about to create.",
