Until then, you can test the new Food section as a beta user if you're comfortable running beta software on your devices.

On iPad, you can tap Edit in the sidebar and drag Food to your tab bar for quicker access.Food will be at the top, sharing the same area as Puzzles, Shared with You, Saved Stories, and History. Tap that to open Apple News+ Food. Near the top are large buttons for Recipe Catalog and Saved Recipes, giving you quick access to hunt for new dishes from various publishers.Don't Miss: Apple Just Added Sudoku to Apple News — Here's How to Play It on iPhone, iPad, and MacIn the top right, you'll see the More (•••) icon, where you can quickly share or copy the link to Apple News+ Food. Beside it is the spoon-over-four-squares icon, which opens the Recipe Catalog like the large button does. Below the large buttons is a featured recipe selected by Apple News editors, which may appear further down the page to make room for recipes you recently viewed and saved.The Apple News+ Food homepage not only shows articles with recipes but also written news stories and Apple News+ Audio stories in sections for Healthy Eating, Tools \u0026 Techniques, For You, and more. So News+ Food is not just recipes — you get restaurant reviews, kitchen tips, kitchen essentials, and other interesting reads. Browsing, searching, and filtering the Recipe CatalogAfter opening the Recipe Catalog, you can browse topics like Weeknight Chicken Dinners, New Recipes, Popular Recipes, and sections from publishers like Real Simple, Serious Eats, and EatingWell. You can use the circular icons near the top of the Recipe Catalog to filter by topics such as Dinner, Easy, Vegetarian, Dessert, \u003c 30 Min, Breakfast, Vegan, and Cocktail. You can also find these topics and others at the bottom of the page under More to Explore.You can use the search bar at the top to find something specific or hit the Filter button at the top right of the Recipe Catalog to narrow down to specifics like time, dish type, dietary preferences, and other topics. When you select one or more filters, the number of recipes available with those filters will show at the bottom. You can unselect filters, hit Clear All to start over, or choose Apply to see the results. Viewing recipe directions, ingredients, and detailsOnce you find a recipe you want to check out, tap it to view the recipe card. It will show you the recipe's servings, a link to read the story by the publisher, and buttons for Cook, Save, and Share. Scroll down to see the ingredients list, recipe directions, and more details, the latter showing suggested recipes and topics. You can tap ingredients to gray them out on the ingredients list so you know what you have and need.When viewing an article with an associated recipe, you'll see a giant Recipe button that will take you to the recipe card. So, you don't necessarily need to open the Recipe Catalog to find recipes — you can open a new story with a companion recipe card from anywhere, like on the Today tab, then hit the Recipe button. If you're viewing an article in a magazine with multiple recipes, tap the giant Recipes button to see a list of all the recipes in that issue.Tap the More (•••) button on the recipe card to view quick links for Save Recipe, Read Story, Copy Link, and Share Recipe. Hit the Cook button above the recipe's description to open a full-screen view of the ingredients and directions, which looks best on an iPad's large display. This is helpful when shopping or cooking, and you can tap ingredients to mark what you already have. When following the step-by-step instructions, you can swipe to view the other steps or tap a step directly to pull focus to it.Ingredients and measurements will appear in bold in the full-screen directions. Tap one to view the ingredient involved as pulled from the ingredients list. Touch a timer in the directions to quickly set a timer. When you start it, it will be labeled with whatever step it appeared in plus the recipe name, helping you to remember where you left off. Saving recipes and finding them laterThere are various ways to save recipes you like, and anything you save will be available offline. From a recipe card, you can tap the large Save button or Save Recipe from the More (•••) menu. Alternatively, when viewing a list of recipes in the Recipe Catalog, touch and hold the recipe and hit Save Recipe from the contextual menu.You can find your saved recipes on the Recipe Catalog's homepage. There will be a section for Saved Recipes visible, where you can quickly scroll to find the one you want. You can also tap the saved-recipe-card icon next to the Filter button or the large Saved Recipes button further down the page to see your saved recipes. Saved Recipes is also available from the Following tab.There doesn't appear to be any syncing between a recipe card's ingredients and your shopping list in the Reminders app, but that could be a possibility in a future update.Don't Miss: iPhone 16e: Everything You Need to Know About the Budget iPhone SE's ReplacementCover photo and screenshots by Gadget Hacks.",
