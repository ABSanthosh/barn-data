  "text": "Sign in to your How-To Geek account Crucial Summary Crucial launches highly efficient, high-speed Gen 5 SSDs with impressive read/write speeds at Computex 2025. The T710 has better power efficiency and an optional heatsink, and it's available in capacities up to 4 TB. Alongside T710 is the X10 Portable SSD with read speeds up to 2,100 MB/s, offering 4TB to 8TB storage capacity. PCIe Gen 5 SSDs are still a luxury more than an actual necessity, but it's good to see that they're becoming more commonplace and, therefore, have started to go down in price compared to the first batch. Crucial just launched some of the best ones we've seen yet, in case you're hunting down options for your next gaming PC. Micron Technology, the parent company of Crucial, took to Computex 2025 to unveil its latest offerings in the SSD space: the Crucial T710 PCIe Gen5 NVMe SSD and the Crucial X10 Portable SSD. The T710 is a PCIe Gen 5 SSD, which means that sequential read speeds can reach up to 14,900 MB/s, and sequential write speeds can up to 13,800 MB/s. These numbers are in line with what we've seen from other Gen 5 SSDs, but they never fail to impress nonetheless. Random read and write speeds are listed at 2.2 million and 2.3 million IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second), respectively. There are a few cool things about this particular SSD model compared to others. The T710 has vastly improved power efficiency, delivering up to 67% more IOPS per watt compared to previous-generation Gen 5 drives, allowing it to run faster and cooler. An optional integrated heatsink is available to help maintain performance under sustained loads. The drive will be offered in capacities up to 4 TB. So not only will you be able to save power while polling your fast storage, but you will also be able to fit all of your stuff in one of these bad boys. It doesn't go to 8 TB, like some NVMe SSDs we've seen from other manufacturers, but 4 TB is also okay. Alongside the internal T710, Crucial also introduced the X10 Portable SSD. The X10 offers read speeds of up to 2,100 MB/s, making it twice as fast as its direct predecessor, the Crucial X9. The X10 will be available in 4 TB, 6 TB, and 8 TB capacities, with the 8 TB version capable of storing approximately 500,000 4K photos, 114 games, or 2.6 million MP3 files. You're not getting an 8 TB T710, but at least you can buy an 8 TB external drive if you're really craving that much storage. It's also as tough as it gets. The X10 features a matte blue design, an IP65 rating for dust and water resistance, and drop resistance up to 9.8 feet (3 meters) on a carpeted floor without data impact. Related The Crucial X10 portable SSD is available for purchase now, while the ultra-fast Crucial T710 Gen5 SSD is scheduled for release starting in July 2025. You'll want to keep an eye out at your retailer of choice for that last one, since it's probably one of the best NVMe SSDs we've seen to date. Source: Micron",

\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePCIe Gen 5 SSDs are still a luxury more than an actual necessity, but it\u0026#39;s good to see that they\u0026#39;re becoming more commonplace and, therefore, have started to go down in price compared to the first batch. Crucial just launched some of the best ones we\u0026#39;ve seen yet, in case you\u0026#39;re hunting down options for your next gaming PC.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eMicron Technology, the parent company of Crucial, took to Computex 2025 to unveil its latest offerings in the SSD space: the Crucial T710 PCIe Gen5 NVMe SSD and the Crucial X10 Portable SSD. The T710 is a PCIe Gen 5 SSD, which means that sequential read speeds can reach up to 14,900 MB/s, and sequential write speeds can up to 13,800 MB/s. These numbers are in line with what we\u0026#39;ve seen from other Gen 5 SSDs, but they never fail to impress nonetheless. Random read and write speeds are listed at 2.2 million and 2.3 million IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second), respectively.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThere are a few cool things about this particular SSD model compared to others. The T710 has vastly improved power efficiency, delivering up to 67% more IOPS per watt compared to previous-generation Gen 5 drives, allowing it to run faster and cooler. An optional integrated heatsink is available to help maintain performance under sustained loads. The drive will be offered in capacities up to 4 TB. So not only will you be able to save power while polling your fast storage, but you will also be able to fit all of your stuff in one of these bad boys. It doesn\u0026#39;t go to 8 TB, like some NVMe SSDs we\u0026#39;ve seen from other manufacturers, but 4 TB is also okay.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAlongside the internal T710, Crucial also introduced the X10 Portable SSD. The X10 offers read speeds of up to 2,100 MB/s, making it twice as fast as its direct predecessor, the Crucial X9. The X10 will be available in 4 TB, 6 TB, and 8 TB capacities, with the 8 TB version capable of storing approximately 500,000 4K photos, 114 games, or 2.6 million MP3 files. You\u0026#39;re not getting an 8 TB T710, but at least you can buy an 8 TB external drive if you\u0026#39;re really craving that much storage. It\u0026#39;s also as tough as it gets. The X10 features a matte blue design, an IP65 rating for dust and water resistance, and drop resistance up to 9.8 feet (3 meters) on a carpeted floor without data impact.\u003c/p\u003e            \n
