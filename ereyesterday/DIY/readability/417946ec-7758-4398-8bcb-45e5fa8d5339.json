That’s probably why it’s been the subject of so many hacks over the years. And let me tell you, I’ve seen my fair share. I’ve been collecting IKEA MALM hacks for ages and I thought I’d seen it all. Apothecary style? Check. Chinoiserie? Yup. Vinyl wrap, built-ins, metal accents, even bobbin style – I’ve featured them all. But rattan? Nada. I can’t imagine how it escaped me. Now, I should probably mention that with IKEA’s launch of the STORKLINTA range (which looks identical to the MALM) except for its Anchor and Unlock feature, the MALM’s days might be numbered. But I have a feeling DIY enthusiasts will keep hacking away at it for years to come or at least until we exhaust the pre-loved MALM inventory. So when I saw Jenn’s beautiful take on a pre-loved MALM rattan dresser on her IG @jnn.liu.liu, I thought it was the perfect hack to add to our collection of IKEA MALM hacks. IKEA MALM Rattan Dresser Makeover Photo Credit: Jenn Liu @jnn.liu.liu | Instagram How to Add Legs to MALM Dresser Jenn kicked off her makeover right from the bottom. Wanting to give the MALM dresser a more modern look, Jenn decided to add legs under the chest of drawers. But here’s the thing about the MALM: its bottom is completely hollow. To provide something for those legs to grip onto, she took some scrap wood blocks and attached them to the bottom of the dresser. Once the blocks were in place, she attached the legs as usual. Check out her video for the how-to. How to Add Rattan To Dresser Drawer Fronts The most striking aspect of Jenn’s makeover is the drawer fronts with cane webbing. This natural material adds texture and warmth to the previously plain surface. Here’s how she did it: She first cut the rattan roll into pieces slightly smaller than the drawer front. She bought a 31.5″ x 60″ roll of cane webbing to complete all 6 drawers. Using a saw, Jenn cut 45-degree angled pine strips to create frames for each drawer. Jenn also painted the drawer fronts with Varathane’s Sunbleached Stain to create a lighter backdrop to complement the rattan. To ensure the rattan was pliable enough to work with, Jenn soaked the rattan pieces in warm water for 20 minutes. The softened rattan was then stapled to each drawer front and pulled taut for a smooth finish. The pine strips were attached using a nail gun, creating a polished, framed look for the rattan panels. Next, she filled the nail holes with wood putty and sanded them down. Lastly, she added a coat of polyurethane to protect the wood. Once the protective coating dried, she attached the handles and slid the drawers back into the dresser. And the IKEA MALM Rattan Dresser is all done! I absolutely adore how this makeover turned out. I like how the rattan fronts are lighter in tone than the MALM frame. And the legs make a marked difference to the overall aesthetic of the piece. Very boho chic. So, what do you think?
