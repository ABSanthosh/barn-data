I think this hack is a great example of what you can do when you use a dash of ingenuity and a little DIY power. Marlena Schubert (@schuberts_haustagebuch) turns the IKEA SNUDDA Lazy Susan into a cute wall-mounted moon lamp for a kid’s room. The idea is very similar to this other wall sconce hack featuring the SNUDDA, from Norwegian designer Camilla Bakken. I love that you don’t need to gather a long list of tools and supplies to pull this one off. And there are no expert-level DIY skills or fancy power tools required. A little painting talent helps, but you don’t need to be the next Rembrandt or anything. Therefore, if you’re itching to try your hand at a cool hack, this is a great one to start with.  What You Will Need 1 IKEA SNUDDA Lazy Susan LED light strip Paint Sponge This Cute Moon Wall Light Puts a New Spin on the SNUDDA Lazy Susan Photo Credit: Marlena Schubert @schuberts_haustagebuch | Instagram 1. Paint the SNUDDA Sponge a mix of white and gray paint onto the SNUDDA’s surface to resemble a moon effect. Acrylic paints work well and are easy to use. Make sure the SNUDDA is clean and dry before painting, and don’t forget to paint the edges. 2. Add Light Next comes the critical step to creating your moon lamp — adding the light. Wait for the paint to dry first. Marlena puts a strip of adhesive LEDs around the SNUDDA base. Many of these strips are cuttable, making it a snap to get the length you need (just make sure to cut at the designated cut points). Rechargeable LED light strips are great because you don’t have to fuss around with unsightly cords. They’re easy to control with a remote, and you can find ones with various features, like dimmable, color changing, or fading. 3. Hang Your New Moon Lamp Now it’s time to hang your moon wall light with the hardware of your choice. If you don’t want to put any holes in the wall, use some heavy-duty picture hanging strips. Let’s Shine a Light on This Simple Hack The world of DIY projects can get a bit muddled sometimes. You see a bunch of projects that seem more akin to an experienced carpenter’s wheelhouse than a well-intentioned beginner’s. However, every once in a blue moon (see what I did there?) a hack comes along that makes you go, “I can do that!” I think that’s one of the reasons this SNUDDA redo is worth showcasing. Yes, it’s cool looking, but it’s also simple. What’s that? You don’t have any tools? No problem. Don’t know the difference between a miter saw and a jigsaw? No sweat. You don’t even need a screw gun, which seems to be the go-to tool in 80% of DIY projects. A Custom Look for Minimal Cost The other thing that makes this IKEA hack so appealing is the price point. The SNUDDA costs $18 and you can grab a strip of LEDs for about $10. Yes, a plain wood round might cost about $10 or $12 bucks, but honestly, less than $30 for a custom wall sconce is pretty sweet. That’s why the SNUDDA works so well. You can use it as-is, no need to modify it, except for the paint job (and even that is up to you). You could leave it plain for a more modern wall sconce or paint several and hang the entire solar system. That’s the beauty of DIY, you get to make it your own. Check out Marlena’s SNUDDA hack and follow her on Instagram (@schuberts_haustagebuch) for more DIY inspiration and clever hacks. Love the idea of a moon lamp, but don’t have the wall space?
