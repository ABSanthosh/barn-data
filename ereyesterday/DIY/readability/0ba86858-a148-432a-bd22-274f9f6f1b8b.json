Meet the latest addition to the BILLY family: the BILLY Bookcase with foldable table. It’s smart, streamlined, and maybe the most exciting thing to happen to bookshelves since color-coded spines. IKEA has finally given its most iconic bookcase a literal flip side—and for anyone living small, or just trying to squeeze more function into their space, it’s a big deal. Pullout vs. Foldable: What IKEA Got Right This Time (left) BILLY Bookcase with pullout desk (right) BILLY Bookcase with Foldable Table | IKEA.com If this all feels vaguely familiar, you’re not imagining things. IKEA did release a BILLY bookcase with a pullout desk in 2024 — a clever concept, but one that didn’t quite fold into small-space life as seamlessly as we’d hoped. That version featured a sliding desk surface that never fully tucked away, leaving a fixed ledge that still jutted out into the room. Functional, yes, but not ideal if you were hoping to reclaim that floor space when the workday was done. And, I also didn’t love how the fixed tabletop made accessing the two lower shelves a bit less than graceful. The new foldable table version, by contrast, folds completely flat into the bookcase, giving you a clean, flush facade and all your square footage back. The lower part of the shelf and tabletop are easy to roll out, fold up, and lock in place to keep the table stable and safe to use. The two lower shelves are completely usable, whether the table is folded in or out. It’s a smarter solution for those who want their home office to disappear at the end of the day. A Long Time Coming (Hackers Saw It First) This isn’t exactly a revolutionary concept. IKEA fans have been hacking their BILLYs into desks for years. From a hidden tabletop inside a tall BILLY bookshelf to extending a BILLY shelf into a work surface, the IKEAhackers community saw the potential and promptly converted their trusty bookshelves into a workhorse. Now, IKEA has done the honors with a factory-finished version—and honestly, I’m blown away. The brilliance lies in its clean, no-fuss engineering. A hook-shaped groove built into the inner sides of the BILLY frame allows the desk to glide smoothly and lock into place. Runners attached to the side of the tabletop guide it along this track as it folds down or pulls up. Below, a slightly smaller two-shelf bookcase sits snugly within the main frame, like a Russian nesting doll. Discreet built-in wheels let it roll out effortlessly when you adjust to desk position. It’s sleek, space-smart, and surprisingly satisfying to watch in motion. When closed, it looks like a typical bookcase. When open, it’s a minimalist, sturdy workspace that’s perfect for laptop work, journaling, homework, or even a quick breakfast spot. Finally: a workspace that disappears when you’re done. It’s the kind of dual-purpose design small space dwellers dream of. Using the BILLY Bookshelf with Foldable Desk BILLY bookshelf with folding desk | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The beauty of the new BILLY foldable table is its chameleon-like charm. Here’s where it shines: Small Space Home Office This BILLY turns a sliver of wall into a fully functional home office—without eating up your living space. Style the upper shelves with pretty storage boxes, a mini plant jungle, or your favorite books. Pull out the desk when you need to work, then fold it back up when it’s Netflix o’clock. Kids’ Homework Station Photo Credit: IKEA.com Need a study station but don’t want your child’s schoolwork permanently scattered across the dining table? This is the answer. Add colorful bins to the shelves, tuck in a slim chair, and voilà—instant homework zone that can vanish at the end of the day. Or better yet, pair it with a foldable chair that tucks in completely. Mount a hook nearby to hang the chair when not in use. The IKEA TERJE folding chair is a good match. The Craft Corner That Closes Itself The new BILLY desk is the perfect backdrop for a compact, foldaway craft station. Store your supplies, tools, and inspiration on the shelves, and pull down the table when it’s time to sketch, sew, or scrapbook. When you’re done, simply fold it all away. It’s the clean, clutter-free solution for makers who want their space to feel as intentional as their projects. But wait, there are some limitations You can’t add doors to close up the entire bookshelf. No full-height version available yet. But in true IKEAhackers spirit, there’s always a workaround: stack another short BILLY bookcase (upside down) on top to reclaim that vertical storage. Anchor it securely (as always), and you’ve got yourself space-savvy storage with a secret desk tucked inside. Specs \u0026 Details of the new BILLY desk: Dimensions (closed): 31 1/2″ wide x 11″ deep x 41 3/4″ high Dimensions (table folded out): 31 1/2″ wide x 44 1/4″ deep x 41 3/4″ high Tabletop depth (open): 31 1/2 “ Colors: Available in classic white Price: $149.00 USD (as of writing) Learn more about the BILLY bookcase with fold-away desk on IKEA’s website.
