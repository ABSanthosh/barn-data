LG Smart TVs are going to become Xbox game streaming machines with a simple software update—no console required. Xbox Game Streaming Comes to LG TVs Starting April 23, the Xbox app is available on select LG Smart TV models. This means that as long as you have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, you should be able to stream games directly on your TV. Microsoft's announcement wasn't clear on exactly what TVs are getting the app. If you have a 2025 LG TV, you can find the Xbox app in the new LG Gaming Portal, accessible from the Gaming Q-Card on the TV home page. 2022 OLED TVs, 2023 LG Smart TVs and newer models running webOS24 or later will also get access to the app via a firmware upgrade that lets you download the app from the TV's app store. According to a support page listing compatible devices for Xbox Cloud Gaming, you need firmware 23.20.01 or higher to download the app. Smart monitors running webOS24 or later will also get the feature, and it will \"soon expand to StanbyME screen.\" You will have to bring your own Bluetooth-enabled controllers to the party though. An Xbox wireless controller would be ideal, but as long as you can pair your existing controller with Bluetooth to your compatible LG TV—including Sony's DualShock controllers, you should be good to go. Related What Is Xbox Cloud Gaming and How Does It Work? Did you know you can play Xbox games on your mobile phone? Here's how it works. LG TVs aren't the first to support Xbox Cloud Gaming either. 2020 or newer Samsung smart TV models with software version 1300 or higher already have the feature. And if you're on a regular TV, you can use either of the following Amazon Fire TV sticks to gain access to cloud gaming: Fire TV Stick 4K Max (1st Gen) Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd Gen) Fire TV Stick 4K (2nd Gen) Fire TV Cube (3rd Gen) Microsoft wanted to go further and launch a dedicated Xbox Cloud Gaming dongle to let players with any USB-compatible screen stream Xbox games. The company confirmed its intentions, but we're yet to see a final product. How To Stream Xbox Games on LG TVs? Streaming games on your LG TV once you've updated it to the latest version should be relatively straightforward. Microsoft provides the following instructions in its announcement: Navigate to the LG Gaming Portal from either Gaming Q-Card or LG Gaming Portal on the Home Page. Download and launch the Xbox app. Sign into or create your Microsoft account. Connect a compatible Bluetooth-enabled wireless controller. Controllers like the Xbox Wireless Controller, Xbox Adaptive Controller, Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2, PlayStation DualSense, or DualShock 4 controller are all compatible. Pick a game and start playing! You're going to need a good enough internet connection for a good experience, of course. Another requirement is Game Pass Ultimate—a permanent subscription for me given its benefits. That said, Xbox's game streaming service is limited to specific regions. This means that even if you have an Xbox Game Pass Utlimate subscription, you may not be able to stream games. I recommend checking the Xbox supported countries page in case you live outside the US. Given the Xbox Cloud Gaming program is still in beta, I wouldn't expect it to perform as a complete Xbox replacement. Regardless, it should encourage a lot more people to get an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription and dip their toes in online game streaming.",
