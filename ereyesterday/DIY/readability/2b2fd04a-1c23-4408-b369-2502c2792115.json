  "text": "Sign in to your How-To Geek account The Minecraft movie is blowing up records and is currently the second highest-grossing video game movie of all time, and it might even reach the top if things keep rolling the way they are. However, not everyone is into the chaotic energy of the movie, and certainly not the TikTok-driven havoc that's spreading through cinemas across the US. So why not stay at home and watch one of these great alternatives as you wait for the inevitable streaming release of the current gaming movie juggernaut? 10 The Super Mario Bros. Movie Release Year 2023 Runtime 1 hour 32 minutes No, I'm not talking about the horrible 1993 Super Mario Bros. and I'm pretty sure Nintendo would like us all to forget that abomination, which I'm perfectly happy to do if only I could. Luckily, we now have 2023's The Super Mario Bros. movie, which is a genuinely good piece of family entertainment that could stand on its own two feet even if it weren't a movie tie-in. The plot is as simple as you might expect, but each character is rendered and performed to an exquisite degree. The action looks great, the world pulls you in, and Jack Black's Bowser is a highlight that perhaps he didn't quite achieve with his portrayal of Minecraft's Steve. The Super Mario Bros. Movie Nintendo and Illumination pull out all the stops for this visually stunning, fast-paced romp through the mushroom kingdom. A rare film that's great for both adults and kids. 9 Mortal Kombat (1995) Release Year 1995 Runtime 1 hour 41 minutes One of the earliest examples of a video game move, Mortal Kombat is in many ways still unsurpassed. Yes, it's a low-budget, cheesy, janky mess of a film, but that's what makes it such an authentic adaptation of the early MK games. It's the definition of a \"so bad it's good\" film, because the whole thing is made with such sincerity. The casting, in particular, is absolutely perfect and Christopher Lambert as the thunder god Raiden will go down in history as one of the most inspired choices for a film ever. The costumes look like they are straight from MK 1 \u0026 2, the hammy acting is on-brand, and I have never once in the many time I've watched this film had anything other than a good time. Is it a good movie? Probably not. Is it a great Mortal Kombat movie? Undoubtedly. Also, the soundtrack alone is worth the price of entry. Mortal Kombat (1995) Perhaps the first ever \"good\" video game movie, Mortal Kombat is a pitch-perfect cheesefest that anyone who loves the classic games will appreciate. 8 Sonic (Any Sonic) Release Year 2020 Runtime 1 hour 39 minutes 2020's Sonic the Hedgehog was on its way to being one of the worst movie adaptations of a game ever, then a miracle happen. Following massive complaints after the original trailer, the studio made the unprecedented decision to delay the movie, hire new people, and spend millions redesigning the titular character to be the adorable gaming mascot he is, rather than a furry ball of nightmare fuel. With Sonic's design fixed, and an absolutely master-class performance by Jim Carry as Dr. Robotnik, any retro video game fan should watch this film, and its two glorious sequels. Each of which just amps up the characters, the villains, and the action. Sonic the Hedgehog After a massive fan-protest and an expensive redesign of Sonic, this movie launched a massive new video game movie franchise that's just getting started. 7 Gran Turismo Release Year 2023 Runtime 2 hours 14 minutes I love the Gran Turismo series of games. It's what introduced me to the original PlayStation, and I have owned and played every version of the game since, culminating in my current sim-racing VR setup mainly used just for Gran Turismo 7. As much as I love these simcade games however, I could never imagine a movie adaptation of the series. Well, in real life, the GT Academy has provided the opportunity for the best players to get into real motorsport, and the movie is a heavily-dramatized story, loosely based on the people who really did just that. While it's no Ford vs. Ferrari, Gran Turismo is still a worthwhile motorsport movie, and a nice addition for fans of the game series. Gran Turismo Possibly the most improbable \"game\" adaptation, Gran Turismo is loosely based on the real story of how the best GT sim racers were given a chance to compete in real-world racing through the GT Academy. 6 Detective Pikachu Release Year 2019 Runtime 1 hour 44 minutes Pokémon is one of the largest media franchises in the world, but it had never entered the realm of live action film until Detective Pikachu. It would have been easy to fall into the same trap that Sonic almost did, with Pokémon designs not really translating well to the \"real\" world. In the end, Detective Pikachu gets the look and feel of the Pokémon world just right. More importantly, this is an adaptation of a Pokémon game spinoff, rather than the mainline games. Which means it doesn't retread the same ground as the animated movies and series. Instead, we have a wild story about a Pikachu that can talk, but only one person can understand him, and they have to solve a complex mystery while being blocked and sometimes attacked at every turn. It sounds like a mess, but it's a funny, well-produced film with a heart of gold. Detective Pikachu The advent of live-action Pokemon could easily have been a visual disaster, but Detective Pikachu manages to both be an interesting film, and a glimpse into what the world of Pokemon might be like from the viewpoint of someone who isn't a Pokemon trainer. 5 Mortal Kombat (2021) Release Year 2021 Runtime 1 hours 50 minutes While the original Mortal Kombat film made good on the janky sprite-based game's vibe, modern Mortal Kombat games take themselves a little more seriously, and 2021's Mortal Kombat makes good on the visual spectacle and ultra-violence of the modern games. Don't let the safe-for-work trailer above fool you. This is not a movie you want to take your kids to see. Despite a lukewarm reception by critics, Mortal Kombat was the most-streamed movie on MAX at the time, and I, for one, enjoyed the heck out of it. The plot could be a little tighter, but overall it's a must-see for any MK fan, and clearly it did well enough for them to greenlight a sequel. Mortal Kombat (2021) This modern take on the Mortal Kombat franchise makes good on the ultra-violence, though misses the charming cheesiness of the original film. 4 The Angry Birds Movie 2 Release Year 2019 Runtime 1 hour 37 minutes The first Angry Birds did gangbusters at the box office, raking in about 350M on a 70-ish million dollar budget, but it was pretty much eviscerated in reviews. The Angry Birds Movie 2 had a similar budget, but made less than half of that, despite being a much better movie overall and getting mostly positive reviews. Go figure. That said, this is an excellent family film with enough humor and coherence to keep parents interested too, and, you know, there's a third one slated for 2027 so I think this one has legs. Regardless of what critics think or how much money it made, the second movie is fun and funny on different levels. It ain't no Shrek, but no one will throw popcorn on you while watching it either. The Angry Birds Movie 2 It took two tries, but somehow we have a movie based on a mobile puzzle game that manages to be a charming hoot on its own merits. Feel free to skip the first one, though. 3 Uncharted Release Year 2022 Runtime 1 hour 56 minutes The Uncharted games are basically a male-led take on Tomb Raider, which is a female take on Indiana Jones, but just because a lot of people are copying each other's homework doesn't make it a bad thing! The game brought cinematic action to gaming in a big way, and the movie tells us what happened long before the events of the first game, as a young Nathan Drake is recruited by Sully for a job. What follows is a fun, action-packed adventure that's (I hate to say) a lot more enjoyable to watch than the last two Indy movies. While critics didn't like this one much, audiences loved it and it's not hard to see why. Uncharted The ultra-popular gaming franchise comes to live in an action-adventure that certain other whip-wielding and dual-pistol shooting characters could learn from in their next movies. 2 Resident Evil Release Year 2002 Runtime 1 hour 40 minutes Resident Evil takes a lot of liberties with the plot and setting of the enormous video games, but then again, the games themselves play fast and loose with their own lore, or at least I don't know what the heck is going on half the time in them. So maybe it's just me. Taken on its own merits, this movie by director Paul W.S. Anderson is visually beautiful, with expertly-made action sequences, and some specific scenes (which I won't spoil) which have become iconic. Coming in just a year or two after The Matrix, the visual influences are clear to see, but then few action movies post 1999 managed to stay free of the Wachowskis shadow. Either way, I think this is still be best Resident Evil movie in the franchise, and certainly a great, dumb, action movie in its own right. Resident Evil (Requires Starz) A now-iconic take on the video game franchise in movie form. It doesn't follow any of the specific games, but Paul W.S. Anderson has made a fantastic horror sci-fi romp that's still the best movie in the franchise. 1 Silent Hill Release Year 2006 Runtime 2 hours 7 minutes Like Resident Evil, Silent Hill was an early pioneer of survival horror on the PS1, but stood apart with its supernatural rather than sci-fi horror, and its iconic, misty location. The movie version of the game isn't a straight adaptation, but all the core parts are there. It's a different character's story, but the character of Silent Hill itself is correct and present, and iconic monsters like Pyramid Head are done justice in the visual department. Like the game, this isn't a movie for the faint of heart, but even if you've never played Silent Hill, I still think the movie stands alone as a horror classic! Silent Hill While the Silent Hill movie does its own thing compared to the game, the general atmosphere and character of the town is captured perfectly, and this movie is now a horror classic in its own right. I don't know about you, but it seems that movies and series based on video games are getting better and better. Sure, there are still plenty of flops (I'm looking at you Halo), but it feels like these days there are more hits than misses. Whether you like the Minecraft movie or not, I think we're going to see much better movies and shows based on games in future, as studios and creators finally take the medium as seriously as books, or other traditional sources of adaptation.",

So maybe it\u0026#39;s just me.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eTaken on its own merits, this movie by director Paul W.S. Anderson is visually beautiful, with expertly-made action sequences, and some specific scenes (which I won\u0026#39;t spoil) which have become iconic. Coming in just a year or two after \u003cem\u003eThe Matrix, \u003c/em\u003ethe visual influences are clear to see, but then few action movies post 1999 managed to stay free of the Wachowskis shadow.

The movie version of the game isn\u0026#39;t a straight adaptation, but all the core parts are there. It\u0026#39;s a different character\u0026#39;s story, but the character of Silent Hill itself is correct and present, and iconic monsters like Pyramid Head are done justice in the visual department.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eLike the game, this isn\u0026#39;t a movie for the faint of heart, but even if you\u0026#39;ve never played Silent Hill, I still think the movie stands
