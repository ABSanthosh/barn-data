All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 after“I am de-modernizing my home one room at a time using secondhand finds, lots of Amazon items, making over old furniture, building new furniture, and everything in between!” she says. In the sunroom, that meant covering up the geometric floor with a large rug, adding architectural details, and adding more furniture for gathering. “The room … was originally set up as a dedicated space for our plants and dogs,” Mae says. “With its fresh, crisp walls and a clean aesthetic, it brought life to our greenery, yet it felt more like a pass-through than a true living space.” She added cozy details through DIY. Crown molding and a ceiling medallion softened things.First, Mae added some architectural charm to soften the modern, crisp feel. She installed new crown molding and a ceiling medallion. “These architectural touches brought an elegant layer to the space,” Mae says, adding that the latter looks especially great with her new chandelier, which her husband installed.Her molding choice is from Amazon, and she says it was the most difficult part of the project. “This was my second time doing it, but I get better each time,” she says. After the trim and medallion were up, Mae painted the walls a creamy off-white (HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams’ Maison Blanche, gifted to her by the brand). Furniture DIY projects saved money but added style.Mae made a wavy coffee table herself, too, and painted that brown (HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams’ Otter.) Her husband poured the cylindrical cement bases for the table, and she cut the top out of a thick wood slab; it was her first time using a jigsaw and router.  “Making a piece of furniture has been on my list of things I want to accomplish for YEARS, and I finally did it!” she writes on Instagram. “The coffee table was new territory for me,” Mae adds” “I’m so happy with the shape, materials, and color but wish I had attached the top differently, she says. Her main takeaway, though, is that “it’s important to try at least one new thing on every makeover so you keep expanding your skillset.”Mae also painted a Facebook Marketplace console table in the same brown shade, and she stapled fabric to the doors of black arched cabinet she already owned. The gallery wall consists of Goodwill finds. Another way Mae saved money in her sunroom revamp is by sourcing artwork secondhand. “The gallery wall (which you can see in the mirror’s reflection) is almost exclusively from Goodwill and estate sales,” she says, and she calls the artwork collection an “evolving project.”“If you’re planning a similar project, my best advice is to be patient and allow yourself extra time,” Mae advises. “it almost always takes longer than expected! Embrace the process of finding unique pieces by exploring thrift stores and estate sales; these are often the best places to discover character-rich items that add a personal touch.”On the flipside, Mae also notes: “But don’t overlook the convenience and variety of places like Amazon, where you can find great basics and finishing touches. I love blending both sources to create a space that feels intentional and layered, with a mix of old and new.”New furniture and accessories make the room much cozier. Mae added a new sofa, brown boucle chairs, floor-to-ceiling curtains, and a new rug to complete her sunroom, now a place with much more seating. The makeover (sans the new sofa) cost about $1900.“The space has become so much more functional for us. It’s now my “soft office,” where I can work comfortably, and we spend so much more time here as a family,” she says.",
