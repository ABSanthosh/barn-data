She took four basic IKEA FLISAT wall storage shelves, originally designed for organizing toys and books, and transformed them into a practical, behind-the-door storage system. By assembling the four shelves and attaching them to two vertical planks, she created a slim shelving unit that can be discreetly tucked away behind a door. The DIY storage unit can hold various items, from shoes, books, and bags to keys and hats, all while remaining hidden behind the door. DIY Slim Behind The Door Storage Before you dive into this DIY project, measure the space behind your door. If there’s at least 10cm (approximately 4 inches) of clearance between the wall and the door, you’re good to go! This will ensure that your door can still open fully. Materials: SKÅDIS pegboard, FLISAT wall storage | Photo Credit: IKEA.com IKEA FLISAT wall storage x 4 SKÅDIS pegboard (76xm x 56cm) Wood planks 1. Assemble the Shelves: Start by assembling the four FLISAT shelves following IKEA’s instructions. 2. Measure and Cut: Begin by measuring and cutting two long planks. The width of the planks should match the depth of your FLISAT shelves (9 cm), while the height should be comfortable for you to reach the top shelf. If you opt for a taller shelf, you might need additional FLISAT wall storage units to ensure the structure’s stability. If needed, notch the back of the wooden planks to accommodate the baseboard, ensuring a seamless and flush finish against the wall. Tip: If you don’t have the necessary tools to cut the planks yourself, most hardware stores like Home Depot or Lowe’s offer cutting services. 3. Plan your Shelf Spacing: Decide on the placement of your FLISAT shelves along the planks. If you’re replicating Corina’s hack, measure the pegboard and allocate space for it. 4. Attach the Shelves: First, drill pilot holes into the side planks at each shelf position. Then, clamp the planks to the FLISAT wall shelves, centering the pilot holes to the side of the FLISAT shelf unit. Next, using a cordless drill fasten the planks to the FLISAT shelves with screws. 5. Add a Pegboard: Add a SKÅDIS pegboard between the top two shelves. 6. Install Behind the Door: The unit can be installed on the wall using the original mounting holes on the FLISAT. If you want to avoid making holes in the wall, use Command Strips to fix the lightweight shelving to the wall. 7. Finishing Touches: Fill the shelves with bags, shoes, and a potted plant and you’ve got yourself a cute storage unit for the most unexpected space. Rather not hack one? Get a similar behind the door storage unit from Amazon. Other Creative Ways to Use the FLISAT Behind The Door Storage Unit This hack is perfect for entryways, but we think it will work great all around the house. Here are some additional ideas that can help you make the most of these shelves especially when space is at a premium: Makeup station: Transform it into a dress-up area with shelves designed to hold your makeup and skincare products. Attach a mirror to one side of the pegboard while utilizing the other side for hanging necklaces and accessories. Playroom Organizer: Hack this behind-the-door storage at a child-friendly height and fill it with toys, art supplies, and books, making it easy for kids to access their favorite items. Home Office Solution: In a home office setting, the behind-the-door storage unit can serve as a compact shelving unit for a vision board, books, and files. Position it on a wall or in a corner to maximize your workspace. Pet Supply Station: Add this FLISAT storage hack behind your mudroom door for pet supplies, toys, leashes, and grooming tools. Bathroom Storage: Create a version of this FLISAT hack without the bottom shelves and install it above the toilet. This setup is perfect for storing toiletries, towels, and decorative items, allowing you to make the most of the space above the cistern. FLISAT Movable Bookshelf Hack Photo Credit: Teresa Casamonti While this hack is probably better with picture ledges, you can also use FLISAT shelves to create this movable bookshelf for kids. Arrange the shelves at a child-friendly height and attach them to a wooden board with a base. Fill them with toys, art supplies, and books, making it easy for kids to access their favorite items.",
