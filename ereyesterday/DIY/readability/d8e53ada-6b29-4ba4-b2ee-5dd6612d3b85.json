  "text": "Samsung has officially revealed its super-thin flagship phone for 2025: the Galaxy S25 Edge. It’s available to order starting today, but as you might expect, Samsung had to make a few compromises to achieve the super-slim design. Following a teaser at the Galaxy Unpacked event in January, and another announcement last week, the Galaxy S25 is finally a real phone you can buy. The hardware and general design are close to the other Galaxy S25 phones, with the same Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, Android 15 operating system with One UI 7, and IP68 water/dust resistance. The phone will be sold in 256GB and 512GB capacities, both with 12GB RAM. The display is a 6.7-inch AMOLED screen, with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz and adaptive color tone. That’s the same size as the screen on the Galaxy S25+. Thankfully, Samsung didn’t take out the USB Type-C port to make the phone thinner—maybe Apple will try that with the rumored iPhone 17 Air—but there’s still no headphone jack. Super Thin, at What Cost? The main selling point here is the thinner design, which measures just 5.8 millimeters (0.228 inches) in depth. For comparison, the regular Galaxy S25 is 7.2 mm, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra is 8.2 mm. In Apple’s phone lineup, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 15 Plus are 7.8 mm, while the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are 8.25 mm. The phone is certainly thinner than most of the competition, but not to an absurd extent. Samsung made some structural changes to the phone to pull this off, including a new type of Corning glass. The company said in its announcement, “The optimally curved edges of the sturdy titanium frame offer enduring protection for everyday use. The latest Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2, a new glass ceramic offering that delivers engineered resilience, is used for the front display to yield both vibrancy and strength on Galaxy S25 Edge.” Galaxy S25 Edge Specifications Display 6.7-inch* QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display Super Smooth 120Hz refresh rate (1~120Hz) Vision booster Adaptive color tone Dimensions \u0026 Weight 75.6 x 158.2 x 5.8mm, 163g Camera 12MP Ultra-Wide Camera F2.2 200 MP Wide Camera OIS F1.7, 2x optical quality zoom, up to 10x Al zoom 12MP Front Camera F2.2 Memory \u0026 Storage 12+512GB 12+256GB Battery 3,900 mAh Charging* Wired charging: Up to 55% charge in around 30 mins with 25W Adapter Fast Wireless Charging Wireless PowerShare OS Android 15 One UI 7 Network and Connectivity 5G, LTE, Wi-Fi 7, Wi-Fi Direct Bluetooth v 5.4 Water Resistance IP68 Unfortunately, Samsung can’t bend the laws of physics. Even though it’s almost the same width and height as the Galaxy S25+ and its 4,900mAh battery, the Galaxy S25 Edge has a 3,900mAh battery cell. The cameras also seem to stick out further from the phone than the S25 and S25+ cameras, but Samsung didn’t provide exact measurements. The camera setup here is a bit weird. This phone has a 12MP main camera and 12MP front camera, just like the regular Galaxy S25 and S25+ phones. However, instead of the 10MP telephoto or 50MP wide-angle cameras on those models, it has a 200MP wide-angle camera with 2x optical zoom and 10x digital zoom. That’s similar to the 200MP lens on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but that phone can do 3x and 5x optical zoom or up to 100x zoom. Pricing and Availability The Galaxy S25 Edge is now available to purchase, starting at $1,100 for the 256GB storage option, and the 512GB storage option will cost you $1,220. Samsung is selling the phone in three colors: Titanium Silver, Titanium Jetblack, and Titanium Icyblue. If you buy it from Samsung’s online store before the pre-order period ends on May 30, you can upgrade to the 512GB model at no extra charge. Samsung will also throw in a $50 credit to use for other items in the same order. Personally, I would take longer battery life over a thinner design, and the other Galaxy S25 phones seem to have a more versatile camera setup. There’s also the Galaxy S24 FE to consider, which is a downgrade in cameras and chipset, but is frequently on sale for half the price of the S25 Edge. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Samsung's latest flagship phone provides the company's bleeding-edge technology in a slim form factor. If you pre-order the Galaxy S25 Edge directly from Samsung, you'll get $50 in credit and a free upgrade to the 512GB model. Source: Samsung",
