Kathleen used this $50 “deco palm”-patterned stencil (flipped upside down) and royal blue paint Sherwin-Williams’ Blue Plate for the DIY project.Her best stenciling advice? Use as little paint as possible to prevent a blotchy outcome. “The paint should be so little that you [have] to put pressure onto the roller to get paint out,” she says on Instagram.  In other words, you should be working with an almost-dry roller, she adds. “This was my first experience stenciling, and wow did it humble me,” Kathleen recalls. “I ended up painting over the entire wall and redoing it.” The second time around, she learned to roll her soaking-wet roller onto a piece of cardboard (anything absorbent and flat works, preferably reusable) to offload paint onto it before the wall.First came fixture swaps.You’ll notice in the “after” that Kathleen and her husband hired a plumber to “change the creepy toilet position too,” she says. The floors got a peel-and-stick makeover.Lastly, the floors got a peel-and-stick makeover. Kathleen and her husband ripped up the tile, put in a new subfloor, and installed a stick-on tile from Wallpops that creates the perfect amount of pattern play with the walls.And speaking of flooring, Kathleen says her stenciling endeavor gave her the courage to try stenciling her kitchen floors.
