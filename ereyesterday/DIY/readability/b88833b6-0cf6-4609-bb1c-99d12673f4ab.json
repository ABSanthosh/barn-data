This feature offers four distinct categories — Chill, Productivity, Sleep, and Wellbeing — each providing a tailored auditory experience to suit various moods and activities.While iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 won't be released to the general public until April, you can test the new Ambient Music app as a beta user if you're comfortable running beta software on your devices.Currently, the Ambient Music app cannot be found on the Home Screen, in the App Library, or via Spotlight Search, and there are no actions for it yet in the Shortcuts app. Instead, you need to add one or more Ambient Music controls to your Control Center to use the app. You can also replace the two shortcuts for Flashlight and Camera on the Lock Screen with Ambient Music controls. And you can even assign an Ambient Music control to your iPhone's Action button.Adding Ambient Music controls to your Control CenterTo incorporate Ambient Music into your Control Center for quick access, swipe down from the top-right edge on any screen to open Control Center. Next, touch and hold the background to bring up the Control Center editor. Then, tap Add a Control and browse or search for Ambient Music.Ambient Music gives you four categories to choose from: Chill, Productivity, Sleep, and Wellbeing. Tap one to add it to the Control Center page you were on. If you want it somewhere else, you can drag and drop it from there onto another page.The controls can be used as 1-by-1 circular icons or larger 2-by-2 icons. To change the size, pull the drag handle on the control to expand or shrink it. When done, tap the background again to save the layout.Once added, you can access these controls by swiping down from the top-right corner of your screen. This allows you to start ambient soundscapes with a single tap. Adding Ambient Music controls to your Lock ScreenFor even quicker access on an iPhone, you can replace the default Flashlight and Camera controls on your Lock Screen with Ambient Music controls. First, enter Lock Screen editing mode by long-pressing the wallpaper on your Lock Screen or Notification Center. Next, choose the Lock Screen you want, hit Customize under it, and tap on the Lock Screen preview on the left side.Alternatively, you can go to Wallpaper in the Settings app, find the wallpaper set you want, and tap Customize on the Lock Screen preview.Then, select a control — the Flashlight, Camera, or a custom one you already replaced them with. From the picker, browse or search for Ambient Music, and choose between the Chill, Productivity, Sleep, and Wellbeing categories.Select Done to save your Lock Screen configuration, then tap the Lock Screen to exit the editor.This setup lets you initiate your preferred ambient sound directly from the Lock Screen, enhancing convenience and accessibility. Adding Ambient Music controls to your Action buttonIf you have an iPhone with an Action button, you can go to Settings » Action Button, then swipe over until you hit the Controls option. Tap Choose a Control, then browse or search for Ambient Music. Next, choose between the Chill, Productivity, Sleep, and Wellbeing categories and exit the settings.When you set one, you can tap Configure under it the Action Button settings to select a different playlist for the shortcut, whether it's one of Apple's suggestions or something from your own Music library.While controls are not yet supported by Back Tap, you can set an Ambient Music playlist to play whenever you double-tap or triple-tap the back of your iPhone. However, you do need to set the playlist to your Action button. To do it, go to Settings » Accessibility » Touch » Back Tap, choose between Double Tap or Triple Tap, and then assign Action Button to the gesture. Exploring Ambient Music categoriesWhen you tap an Ambient Music control from your Control Center or Lock Screen or use your iPhone's Action button shortcut, the Ambient Music app will immediately start playing a track from your selected category. You can control the music and soundscapes from the Now Playing control and Live Activity as well as your Dynamic Island, just like any other audio you would play on your device.Each Ambient Music category offers a unique selection of sounds:Chill: Offers relaxed tunes suitable for unwinding and stress relief.Productivity: Provides focused, instrumental tracks to aid concentration during work or study sessions.Sleep: Features calming sounds designed to promote restful sleep.Wellbeing: Includes uplifting melodies aimed at enhancing overall mood and well-being.You won't see the Ambient Sounds app appear in your App Switcher until you tap the player on the Now Playing control, Live Activity, or Dynamic Island. If you open another app, Ambient Music will continue playing, but the app itself will disappear from the App Switcher.Integrating these ambient soundscapes into your daily life allows you to create a more personalized and supportive auditory environment tailored to your specific needs and activities.",
