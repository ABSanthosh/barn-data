All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterMy kitchen had not been updated since my apartment building was built in 1962, and you could tell. The floors reminded me of an elementary school cafeteria, with a speckled muddy tone. It was impossible for them to ever look clean. The countertops looked extremely cheap; they featured a dirty off-white color with brown specks and a silver trim. Not to mention there were numerous cooking stains engrained into the laminate. While the rest of my apartment had a cozy, modern, wabi-sabi vibe, my kitchen was a major eyesore that I hated stepping foot into.Not only did I hate going into my kitchen, but I also hated that my kitchen was the first thing that guests would see when they walked into my apartment. Given the kitchen is immediately to the right of the entrance, guests would have to walk past the kitchen to see the rest of my studio, which I have carefully curated to my taste. However, the fact that guests’ first impression of my apartment would be the kitchen made me feel like all the work I put into decorating the rest of my studio was tainted.After a year of living in this apartment without any plans to move, I decided I needed to make a change. I could not stand to look at it any longer, so I wanted to implement some renter-friendly updates. I gave the counters a marble contact paper makeover.As someone who has never considered herself handy, I decided to start with what seemed to be the easiest: the counters. After watching one video on how to apply contact paper, I felt ready to take this on. I soon became comfortable laying and smoothing down contact paper with a metal credit card and cutting the edges with a utility knife. This small update absolutely transformed my counters from stained off-white to shiny marble, and it was the most budget-friendly upgrade I made. The contact paper cost less than $20, and it was very forgiving to air bubbles and mistakes. Next, I decided to tackle the floors.My old, ugly cafeteria floor tiles were 12 inches by 12 inches, and luckily I was able to find white and grey marble stick-on tiles in the exact same size to place right over top. The most difficult part about this process was cutting the edges of the tiles to exactly match the grooves in my cabinets and wall moldings. After much trial and error, though, I was very proud of how the floors turned out.Updating the floors made the biggest difference because they turned the dark, dirty-looking kitchen into a shiny and bright space.A peel-and-stick backsplash gave the brown cabinetry a new lease on life. Next, I decided to add my own flair by installing a light pink peel-and-stick tile backsplash behind the sink (did you notice I replaced the faucet, too?) and coffee corner. The counter and floor updates prepared me to meticulously line up the backsplash tiles with the grooves of my kitchen sink. This update makes my kitchen look a lot more expensive, and, most importantly, it makes me happy every time I walk into the space because pink is my favorite color. If I can provide any advice, it would be to just start! If you’re thinking of making any renovations, or if there is anything about your living space that is bothering you, don’t hesitate to make a change. That, and maybe order more tiles than you think are necessary. I ran out of both floor tiles and backsplash tiles, so I ended up having to order an additional pack of both. While pricier than expected, it was worth it to complete the job.The kitchen now sets the tone for my studio apartment.Everything about this project was a “first” for me! I had never done any handy work other than hanging a picture frame. However, I have always had a knack for art, so I think my experience painting and drawing helped me form a vision for the space and be precise with my work.What I love most about the “after” is that I no longer dread walking into my kitchen. I actually quite enjoy it. I am so proud of all the work I have done — you can follow my process on TikTok — and I no longer feel icky stepping onto my kitchen floors. My guests have also been so impressed with my upgrades, which has inspired several of my friends to start their own DIY apartment projects.",
