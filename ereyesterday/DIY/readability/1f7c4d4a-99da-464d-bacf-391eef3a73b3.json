Maybe it's stuck between cushions, lost in a pile of laundry, or simply vanished. Before frustration kicks in, try these simple solutions to control your smart TV without tearing the house apart. 6 Use Your Smartphone as a Remote An easy way to control your smart TV when the remote goes missing is to use your smartphone. Most smart TVs have official remote apps, like SmartThings for Samsung, LG ThinQ, and Roku Remote. If you have an Android TV, the Google TV app works universally. Just connect your phone to the same Wi-Fi as your TV, and you're good to go. If your TV brand doesn't offer a dedicated app, don't worry. Third-party universal remote apps, like Vsray Universal Remote or CodeMatics, work with many smart TVs as long as your phone and TV are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. 5 Try a Universal Remote for a One-Remote Solution James Bruce / MakeUseOf If your original remote is lost for good, a universal remote can be a great long-term fix. These remotes are designed to work with a wide range of TV brands and other home entertainment devices like soundbars, streaming boxes, and Blu-ray players. The simplest universal remotes, like the GE Universal Remote, let you manually program them using manufacturer codes. Meanwhile, more advanced options allow for app-based setup and even support custom macros. The Sofabaton X1 is one such option (and one that we really enjoyed in our Sofabaton X1 review). The Logitech Harmony Elite (if you can still find one, as Logitech discontinued the line) is another. These advanced remotes let you control multiple devices with a single button press. 4 Use Your Smart Speaker or Voice Assistant With a smart speaker or a voice assistant like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple Siri, you might not need a physical remote to control your TV. Many smart TVs and streaming devices support voice commands, letting you control your TV hands-free. If you have a Fire TV, saying \"Alexa, turn on the TV\" or \"Alexa, play Stranger Things on Netflix\" gets the job done. Google Assistant works similarly with Chromecast and Android TVs, allowing commands like \"Hey Google, pause the TV.\" If you're in the Apple ecosystem, Siri can control Apple TVs via HomeKit. Even if your TV doesn't have built-in voice support, some smart speakers can act as a bridge. For instance, an Amazon Echo with Fire TV or a Google Nest speaker with Chromecast allows full voice control. Voice commands won't replace every function of a traditional remote, but it's a quick, convenient way to regain control without buying a new one. 3 Enable HDMI-CEC to Use Another Device's Remote Oluwademilade Afolabi/MakeUseOf If you have a gaming console, Blu-ray player, or streaming stick connected to your TV, you might already have a backup remote without realizing it. Most smart TVs support HDMI-CEC (Consumer Electronics Control), a feature that lets one remote control multiple connected devices. For example, if you have a PlayStation or Xbox, you can navigate streaming apps on your TV using your game controller. Similarly, if you use a Roku, Apple TV, or Fire Stick, their remotes can often adjust your TV's volume and power. To enable HDMI-CEC, go to your TV's settings menu (it may be called Anynet+ (Samsung), BRAVIA Sync (Sony), SimpLink (LG), or CEC on other brands). Once activated, your streaming or gaming device's remote can take over basic TV controls. It's not a perfect replacement for all functions. However, if you just need to turn your TV on and start streaming, this trick can save the day. 2 Get a Tile Tracker Connor Jewiss / Shutterstock Remotes have an uncanny ability to disappear at the worst moments. Instead of tearing up the couch every time, attach a Tile tracker or a similar Bluetooth tracking device to it. These small, lightweight gadgets let you track your remote using your phone, making the frantic search a thing of the past. With a Tile Mate, Apple AirTag, or Samsung SmartTag, you can use your phone to make the remote play a sound when it's nearby. If it's buried under a blanket or slipped between cushions, you'll find it in seconds. Some trackers also show the last known location on a map, which is useful if your remote tends to travel to unexpected places (like the fridge). If your remote keeps playing hide-and-seek, a tracker is an easy way to keep it from vanishing for good. 1 Create a Dedicated Remote Storage Spot One of the simplest ways to avoid losing your remote is to give it a designated home. Whether it's a remote caddy, a wall-mounted holder, or a specific spot on your coffee table, having a go-to place makes it easier to keep track of. If you tend to misplace your remote between couch cushions, consider using Velcro strips or a magnetic mount to attach it to a fixed spot when not in use. Some people even use a decorative bowl or tray near their seating area to keep all remotes in one place. For households with multiple people, a house rule can also help—something as simple as \"always put the remote back in the holder\" can cut down on the chaos. While this solution won't stop occasional forgetfulness, having a designated remote storage area reduces the chances of it disappearing into the abyss of blankets, cushions, or the kitchen. Losing your TV remote is one of those small but infuriating inconveniences that always seems to happen at the worst time. But instead of tearing apart your living room every time it goes missing, you now have several smart solutions to keep control of your TV.",

ability to disappear at the worst moments. Instead of tearing up the couch every time, attach a Tile tracker or a similar Bluetooth tracking device to it. These small, lightweight gadgets let you track your remote using your phone, making the frantic search a thing of the past.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWith a \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/airtag-vs-smarttag-vs-tile/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTile Mate, Apple AirTag, or Samsung SmartTag\u003c/a\u003e, you can use your phone to make the remote play a sound when it\u0026#39;s nearby. If it\u0026#39;s buried under a blanket or slipped between cushions, you\u0026#39;ll find it in seconds. Some trackers also show the last known location on a map, which is useful if your remote tends to travel to unexpected places (like the fridge).\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf your remote keeps playing hide-and-seek, a tracker is an easy way to keep it from vanishing for good.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"create-a-dedicated-remote-storage-spot\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e1 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Create a Dedicated Remote Storage Spot\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the simplest ways to avoid losing your remote is to give it a designated home. Whether it\u0026#39;s a remote caddy, a wall-mounted holder, or a specific spot on your coffee table, having a go-to place makes it easier to keep track of.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf you tend to misplace your remote between couch cushions, consider using Velcro strips or a magnetic mount to attach it to a fixed spot when not in use. Some people even use a decorative bowl or tray near their seating area to keep all remotes in one place.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFor households with multiple people, a house rule can also help—something as simple as \u0026#34;always put the remote back in the holder\u0026#34; can cut down on the chaos.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhile this solution won\u0026#39;t stop occasional forgetfulness, having a designated remote storage area reduces the chances of it disappearing into the abyss of blankets, cushions, or the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eLosing your TV remote is one of those small but infuriating inconveniences that always seems to happen at the worst time. But instead of tearing apart your living room every time it goes missing, you now have several smart solutions to keep control of your TV.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
