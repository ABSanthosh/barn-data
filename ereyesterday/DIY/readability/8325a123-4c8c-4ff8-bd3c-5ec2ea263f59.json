This meant you couldn't access detailed insights into a site's security — something that browsers like Chrome and Firefox have long provided. Even Safari on Mac has supported certificate lookup for over a decade.With iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4, Apple introduces a long-awaited feature that finally lets us see in-depth security details of a website's connection directly within Safari.This update is a significant step forward in improving transparency and security. Whether you're verifying a website's legitimacy, ensuring a secure transaction, or simply curious about a site's security status, this new feature puts valuable insights right at your fingertips. What are SSL/TLS certificates?SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)/TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificates are digital credentials that authenticate a website's identity and enable encrypted communication between your browser and the site. These certificates are issued by trusted certificate authorities (CAs), who ensure that any data you share — like passwords, payment details, or personal information — remains private and secure.When you visit a secure website, your browser checks the validity of its certificate to confirm that the connection is encrypted and that the site is who it claims to be. If the certificate is invalid or expired, Safari will warn you before you proceed. By allowing you to view certificate details, iOS 18.4 gives you greater control over your browsing security. How to view SSL/TLS certificate information in SafariChecking a website's security details in Safari is now easier than ever. Here's how you can do it:Navigate to any website where you want to check the security details.Tap the Page Settings icon (a rectangular screen with lines under it) in the address bar.Select the More (•••) button on the sheet that appears.Choose Connection Security Details from the Page Menu options.This will open a panel displaying whether the website is secure or not with the website's SSL/TLS certificate information. If you need deeper insights, tap Details to see individual digital certificates and additional security information.Details may include the subject, issuer's name, serial number, validity period, public key info, key usage, extended key usage, basic constraints, subject key identifier, authority key identifier, certificate authority information access, subject alternative name, certificate policies, CRL distribution points, embedded signed certificate timestamp, signature, and fingerprints.This small but crucial enhancement gives users greater confidence when browsing the web, especially when dealing with sensitive data such as online banking or shopping. It also allows security-conscious users to verify certificates without needing third-party tools or workarounds.With this new addition, Apple continues to refine Safari's capabilities, making it a more competitive and secure browser for iOS and iPadOS users.Don't Miss: iOS 18.4 Has 50+ New Features and Changes for iPhone You Won't Want to MissCover photo and screenshots by Gadget Hacks.",
