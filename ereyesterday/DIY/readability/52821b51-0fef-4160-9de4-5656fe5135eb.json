  "text": "AirTags Sign in to your MUO account AirTags are a great way to find your lost stuff, but when one is stuck deep within an airport's luggage system, it can be hard to direct staff to it. Fortunately, the iOS 18.2 update is set to change that. As a new feature to the Find My tool, the update will let you temporarily share the location of an AirTag with someone else to help them find where your stuff went. iOS 18.2 Is Getting Temporary AirTag Location Sharing Aryan Surendranath/MakeUseOf As reported by The Verge, you can use the Find My tool in iOS 18.2 to temporarily share an AirTag's location with someone. Right now, sharing your AirTag's location is more meant to be an ongoing occasion with someone you trust, such as a family member or a dear friend. This new update will allow someone to see your AirTag for up to a week, or until whatever you're tracking has been handed back to you. The main draw of this feature is sharing the location of a lost item with someone in its vicinity. For example, if an airport loses your luggage, you can share its AirTag with the employees so they can use its location to find out where it went. Because iOS 18.2 hasn't been fully released yet, you'll need to sign up for the beta to get this feature. Check out how to try the new iOS 18 beta for more information. Otherwise, this useful feature will arrive with the general release of iOS 18.2, so if you don't mind waiting, it'll come to your device eventually.",
