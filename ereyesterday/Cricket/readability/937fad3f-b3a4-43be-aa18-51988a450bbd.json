He was initially ruled out of The Hundred but, having been retained as captain, was picked in England's squads to play Australia last month.Buttler then pulled out of the T20 series because of the issue and targeted a return for the five ODIs, only to also withdraw.Harry Brook captained England in the ODI series against Australia when Buttler was ruled out, but is not part of the squad for this tour because of his involvement in the Test tour of Pakistan.
