  "text": "Jacob Bethell has shown enough on England's white-ball tour of the West Indies to suggest he is ready to make his Test debut in New Zealand later this month, says Adil Rashid.Bethell has been one of England's standout players in the Caribbean and played an eye-catching innings to help the tourists to victory in the first T20 of the series on Saturday.The 21-year-old scored an unbeaten 58 as England chased down a challenging 183 with eight wickets to spare.Bethell was a surprise inclusion in England's Test squad to tour New Zealand and is seen as the reserve batter in the squad but, if called upon, leg-spinner Rashid is confident the Warwickshire youngster will shine.\"He’s a very good player,\" said Rashid. \"He showed it in the first game but also in the summer when he played against Australia.\"He showed his class there even though he didn’t get big runs. He showed with the sixes and fours he scored, and the way he goes about his business, he’s mature for his age. He’s got a bright future ahead.\"I wouldn’t be surprised if he played in New Zealand – with the way he bats and technique wise, with his drive, he’s looked to be a solid and accomplished player.\"He’s proven that in ODIs and T20s and I’m sure he’ll do the same in Test cricket.\"After losing the one-day series which kicked off their Caribbean tour, England are 2-0 up in the T20 series with three to play.They can win the series in the third match in St Lucia on Thursday (20:00 GMT).As well as Bethell's performances, captain Jos Buttler has returned from injury in good form.In Sunday's second match of the series, Buttler looked back to his devastating best as he plundered 83 off 45 balls, which included six sixes.Buttler has been out injured for four months but said that absence made him \"determined\" to lead England's latest white-ball reset, which will accelerate in the new year when Brendon McCullum takes over as head coach.McCullum said part of his role is to cheer up Buttler, who he said had been \"miserable\" at times during England's recent limited-overs troubles.Rashid, though, says the smile is already back on the skipper's face.\"He’s quite chilled and relaxed anyway but I think it’s natural for every single person, you can’t always be smiling,\" he said.\"Playing cricket, you’re always going to have your ups and downs and maybe there are times you are not smiling but I think that’s part and parcel of being a cricketer.\"He showed his class when he came back in. He showed he’s capable of match-winning performances and how big of a miss he is when he’s not playing. He’s a world-class player and captain.\"Yorkshire's Rashid was speaking to mark the launch of a new charity cookbook called Taste of Cricket, published by the England and Wales Cricket Board to celebrates the diversity of cricket teas.Rashid has contributed, with a Moroccan tagine which is served at Lord's his favourite.Meanwhile, fast bowler Reece Topley has been fined for smashing a chair in reaction to his latest injury setback.Topley, 30, jarred his right knee in the first T20 of the series - awkwardly tumbling over in his delivery stride as rain fell in Barbados, causing the surface at the Kensington Oval to become greasy.As he walked off the field and up the steps to the pavilion, Topley threw a chair against a staircase handrail in frustration and was docked 15% of his match fee.He was also give one demerit point - four points in a two-year period triggers a suspension.",
