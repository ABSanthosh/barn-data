It will be interesting to see how it goes. You’d think a rake would assist the spin. You look down the pitch and we can have a pretty good guess which ends the Pakistan spinners will operate from.”Stokes, who reiterated that he had no issue with Pakistan’s attempts to manipulate the pitch to their advantage, said that while there was clear evidence of raking at both ends, “there are certain areas” where it has been concentrated. These are seen as being intended to assist Pakistan’s spin duo, Noman Ali and Sajid Khan, who took all 20 English wickets in the second Test last week.The home side picked three specialist spinners for that game, but while between them Noman and Sajid sent down 87.5 overs their leg-spinner, Zahid Mahmood, bowled only six. Pakistan are likely to announce their own team on Wednesday, and had been expected to drop Zahid.England’s unexpected decision to field a leg-spinner in Rehan Ahmed, in addition to Jack Leach and Shoaib Bashir, may prompt them to reconsider. “You want to pick someone who, if you do go with three options of spin, who is not a luxury but who’s there to be able to break the game open when you feel like it might be coming a little bit too easy at one end,” Stokes said. “Pakistan played a leg-spinner last week who only bowled a few overs, but you’d rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it.”Quick GuideEngland team to play PakistanShowZak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (wk), Gus Atkinson, Rehan Ahmed, Jack Leach, Shoaib Bashir.Possible Pakistan team: Abdullah Shafique, Saim Ayub, Shan Masood (c), Kamran Ghulam, Saud Shakeel, Mohammad Rizwan, Salman Agha, Aamer Jamal, Sajid Khan, Noman Ali, Mohammad Ali.England felt that in Multan the run of pale, dry grass across the middle would help to rough up the ball and encourage reverse swing, and the fact that the ground in Rawalpindi offers no such assistance helped to swing their focus away from seam bowling.“The reasoning behind three spinners was, as the game progresses, they will probably come more into the game,” Stokes said. “Also with the outfield being lush and green, we’ll probably struggle to get reverse swing.

Stokes put himself through an unusually lengthy spell of bowling in the nets on Tuesday, and the selection demonstrates that he feels able to contribute more than the five overs per innings he managed when he returned from a hamstring injury for the second Test.“It was good to get through it,” he said. “I put myself through my paces at training, bowled two spells. Coming in and being one of only two seamers, I’m fully confident that I’ll be able to get more out of myself this week than I did last week.”",
