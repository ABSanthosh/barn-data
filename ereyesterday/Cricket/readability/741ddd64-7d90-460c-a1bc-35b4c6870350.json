  "text": "Australia have dropped Nathan McSweeney and called up 19-year-old opener Sam Konstas to replace him for the final two Tests against India.New South Wales' Konstas is in line to become Australia men's youngest Test batting debutant since Ian Craig in 1953.McSweeney was preferred to Konstas at the start of the series but he managed only 72 runs across six innings at an average of 14.40.Australia's chief selector George Bailey said Konstas' selection offers the chance to \"throw something different\" at India's bowling attack.\"I think Sam's method and style is different to Nathan's, should we go down that path,\" he said.Earlier this season Konstas scored two centuries against South Australia in the Sheffield Shield, becoming the youngest player to do so since Ricky Ponting in 1993.Should the right-hander be picked, he would become Australia's youngest Test debutant since current skipper Pat Cummins, who was 18 years and 193 days when he played against South Africa in 2011.Seamer Jhye Richardson, who last played a Test in the 2021-22 Ashes, has also been recalled with Josh Hazlewood out injured.Fellow quick Sean Abbott and all-rounder Beau Webster, both uncapped at Test level, have been retained in the squad, having been called up previously in the series but not selected in the XI.Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne, who, like McSweeney, have struggled at the top of the order, have retained their places in the squad.The Boxing Day Test in Melbourne starts at 23:30 GMT on 25 December with the series tied at 1-1. There will be ball-by-ball commentary on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app, where video highlights will also be available (all UK users only). Australia squad for final two Tests v India: Pat Cummins (captain), Travis Head, Steve Smith, Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Beau WebsterKonstas made his debut for New South Wales in 2023, less than two months after his 18th birthday, but has played only 11 first-class matches.Part of the Australia team that won the Under-19 World Cup earlier this year, his breakthrough came with the twin centuries against South Australia in October when he followed a first-innings 152 - his first first-class hundred - with 105 in the second innings.He has scored 471 runs at 58.87 in five matches in the Sheffield Shield this season and made a timely, 20-ball fifty for Sydney Thunder on his Big Bash debut on Tuesday, in doing so becoming the youngest man to score a fifty in the competition.He also played for Prime Ministers XI against the India squad in a tour match between the first and second Tests and scored 107 from 97 balls against an attack featuring most of India's Test line-up.He will still play in the Big Bash against Sydney Sixers on Saturday before joining up with the Test squad.",
