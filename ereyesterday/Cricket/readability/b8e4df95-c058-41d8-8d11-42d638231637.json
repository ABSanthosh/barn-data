It means a career haul of 1,126 first-class wickets will only swell further.“Congratulations Sir Jimmy Anderson,” said Richard Thompson, the current chair of the England and Wales Cricket Board. “This is a really well-deserved honour for an England legend who has given so much to our sport.“Jimmy’s career has been marked by extraordinary achievements, not least in winning the Ashes four times and becoming England’s all-time leading wicket-taker.“His skill, determination, and sportsmanship have inspired millions of cricketers and fans alike, in England and around the world.“This is fitting recognition for a true world-great who has given so much to the game on and off the field.”Jimmy Anderson bowls during an Ashes Test at Old Trafford in 2023.
