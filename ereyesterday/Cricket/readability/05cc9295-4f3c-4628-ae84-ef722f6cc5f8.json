Sarfaraz Khan hit 150 and Rishabh Pant 99 for India as they look to pull off one of the most famous victories in cricket after being dismissed for just 46 in their first innings.That pair guided India into the lead with just three second-innings wickets down but the hosts lost 7-54 with the second new ball to set New Zealand 107 to win.Seamers Matt Henry and Will O'Rourke took 3-102 and 3-92 respectively, having shared nine wickets in the first innings.New Zealand are looking for their first Test win in India since 1988.\"I wouldn't say it's an easy wicket here. Obviously, we've got a world-class team going up against us,\" said O'Rourke.\"We've got to be confident going out there tomorrow and hopefully for the crowd's sake the rain stays away and we get the chance to have a crack at the total.\"Safaraz said: \"It is not an easy wicket and I feel the game has not slipped out of our hands. If we can take out two or three quick wickets then they will suffer the same fate.\"Pant's 99 came after he suffered a knee injury on day two and remained off the field on the third day. It was the same knee he injured in a serious car crash in December 2022, keeping him out for more than a year.After the first day was washed out, India's first innings 46 on day two was the third-lowest total in their Test history and lowest at home.",
