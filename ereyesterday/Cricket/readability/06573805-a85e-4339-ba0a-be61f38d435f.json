  "text": "The retained and released players from each WPL franchise for the 2025 tournament were announced today, ahead of the auction for the upcoming edition. Here's how it leaves each side's purse as the auction approaches. The auction for the competition is reportedly set to take place in early December, with the competition due to take place earlier in the New Year than previous editions. Ahead of the auction, the deadline for each team to name who they would retain and release from their squads last year passed today. There were some notable names among the released players from several teams. Mumbai Indians opted to release England pacer Issy Wong, who only played two games for them last year having starred in the inaugural edition. RCB released Heather Knight who pulled out of last year's tournament with an injury, as well as Nadine de Klerk who replace Knight in last year's squad. Gujarat Giants also opted to release Sneh Rana and 2024 T20 World Cup winner Lea Tahuhu from their squad, as they look to rebuild after finishing at the bottom of the table last year. Each side has a salary cap of INR 15 crore to spend on their players. Following the list of retentions, Gujarat Giants have the most money left in their purse to spend at the auction at INR 4.4 crore. Delhi Capitals have the least remaining in their purse of all the sides, with five spots left to fill and INR 2.5 crore to do so.
