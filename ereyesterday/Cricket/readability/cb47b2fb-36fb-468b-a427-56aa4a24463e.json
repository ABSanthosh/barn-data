  "text": "England sack coach Lewis after Ashes humiliationImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jon Lewis was appointed head coach of the England women's team in November 2022England have sacked head coach Jon Lewis following a shambolic Ashes series in which they suffered a 16-0 clean sweep against Australia.Lewis, who was appointed in November 2022, has been removed after a review of the tour led by England director of women's cricket Clare Connor.The former England seamer met with Connor and high-performance manager Jonathan Finch last week.Lewis becomes the first casualty of the humiliating tour of Australia, which was the first time either side has lost every match in an Ashes series since the multi-format points system was introduced in 2013.That demolition came at the end of a winter where England suffered a calamitous early exit at the T20 World Cup. A string of dropped catches cost them dearly in a defeat by West Indies, resulting in elimination at the group stage.Following the Ashes, 49-year-old Lewis stated his desire to remain as head coach while captain Heather Knight said she would take some time to decide her future. It is possible that Knight remains as skipper under a new coach.Lewis said: \"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time as England head coach. \"Unfortunately I won't be able to finish this incredibly challenging but enjoyable job of developing this young team, whilst winning and growing the women's game in this country.\"I am determined to continue to help drive women's cricket forward in whatever comes next for me. I wish all the players the best and thank them for letting me be part of their journeys.\"Candidates to replace Lewis could include former England captain Charlotte Edwards and the identically named Jon Lewis, who is in charge of the England A team. Mark Robinson, who guided England to World Cup glory in 2017, left Warwickshire last month and has taken a short-term role at Sussex.The new coach faces home white-ball series against West Indies and India this summer before a 50-over World Cup in India in the autumn.Whoever does take charge will be looking to end a trophy drought that stretches back eight years to the 2017 World Cup triumph.Lewis, previously a fast-bowling coach with the England men's team, took over from Australian Lisa Keightley more than three years ago.The high point of his reign was a drawn Ashes series against the all-conquering Australians in 2023, but in two T20 World Cups England failed to reach a final.Following the elimination from last year's T20 World Cup, former England spinner Alex Hartley, who was part of the World Cup-winning side, said some members of the squad were not fit enough.On the Ashes tour, England spinner Sophie Ecclestone declined to be interviewed by Hartley in her role as a television broadcaster.When asked if fitness was a reason for the gulf between his side and Australia, Lewis pointed to a \"cultural difference\" between the two nations.Connor then pledged an \"honest review\" into the series and called the Ecclestone incident \"unfortunate\".Connor has paid tribute to Lewis' record in one-day international series but accepted results in the T20 World Cup and Ashes had been poor.\"Under his leadership the team held off Australia to draw a thrilling 2023 Women's Ashes - attracting record crowds with an entertaining brand of cricket â€“ while the team's consistent success in bilateral cricket included a remarkable eight consecutive ODI series wins for which he should take real credit,\" she said.\"While the recent T20 World Cup and Women's Ashes in Australia have been disappointing, there is no doubt about the talent we have available and we will look to appoint a successor shortly. \"We must be ready for an exciting summer of international cricket and to challenge for two World Cups over the next 15 months, including the T20 World Cup in this country next year.\"More on this story",
