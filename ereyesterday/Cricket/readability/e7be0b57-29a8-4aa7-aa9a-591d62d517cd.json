  "text": "Lancs thump Notts and Durham win Blast openerImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Keaton Jennings made his second-highest T20 scoreKeaton Jennings made 95 from just 49 balls as Lancashire thumped Nottinghamshire by 47 runs to make it two wins from two in the T20 Blast.Their T20 captain led from the front as his side posted 216-3 having won the toss at Old Trafford, with Luke Wells striking a career-best 87 from 50 balls in a record opening stand of 177.Moises Henriques briefly threatened a chase, making 60 from 32, but it was a lone hand as Notts were bowled out for 169 in the final over. Elsewhere, Ollie Robinson led Durham to victory in their opening game of the competition as they beat Birmingham by three wickets with two overs to spare.After their County Championship Division Two struggles, beleaguered Lancashire found some relief in their first T20 game of the year with a home win against Worcestershire - and backed it up with a dominant display against Notts.Jennings struck eight fours and six sixes in running up his second-best T20 score and Wells posted a new highest score, featuring seven boundaries and six maximums.Their stand of 177 in 15.4 overs was the highest T20 partnership for any wicket for Lancashire and put them out of sight.Notts lost openers Lyndon James and Joe Clarke cheaply in the powerplay and tumbled away, with 20-year-old Charlie Barnard taking 3-23 on his debut and Tom Aspinwall 3-26.At Edgbaston, Durham won the toss and took three wickets in the opening 17 balls of the game to set up a comfortable victory.Sam Hain was the only batsman to show for the Bears, making 45 in 28 balls, but New Zealand's Jimmy Neesham took 3-34 as the hosts were bowled out for 143.Graham Clark provided the ideal start to the chase with 40 from 23 deliveries, including five fours and a six, before Robinson took up the mantle, eventually out for 45 from 36.His departure, and the wicket soon after of Kasey Aldridge, took some gloss off the victory margin, but it was still achieved with 17 balls in hand.More on this story",
