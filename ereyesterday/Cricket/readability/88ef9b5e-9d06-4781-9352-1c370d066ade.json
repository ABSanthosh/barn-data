  "text": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Glamorgan begin their Championship campaign at home against Leicestershire on Friday, 4 AprilGlamorgan have signed England spinner Shoaib Bashir on a short-term loan from Somerset.Bashir, 21, is joining for three County Championship games as cover for Mason Crane, who will miss the opening month of the season because of a shoulder injury. Surrey-born off-spinner Bashir impressed after being a shock choice for England's tour to India in early 2024.After a match-winning performance against the West Indies, he struggled in subsequent series against Sri Lanka, Pakistan and New Zealand.Bashir has a central England contract and is likely to benefit from working under new Glamorgan coach Richard Dawson, himself a former England spinner.Though he is England's first-choice spinner, Bashir is behind Jack Leach in the Somerset pecking order but did travel to Abu Dhabi for the county's pre-season preparations.Glamorgan have the ambidextrous Ben Kellaway as their other main spin option, although Kellaway can also bat in the top order.Glamorgan director of cricket Mark Wallace said: \"It's fantastic to welcome a player of Shoaib's talent to Glamorgan for the first three games of the season.\"With Mason Crane picking up an injury, the opportunity arose to bring Shoaib in and we're delighted to have a current England Test cricketer joining to help us make a positive start to the season.\"",
