Henry claimed five for 15, while O’Rourke returned four for 22 to condemn Rohit Sharma’s side to their third lowest five-day total, only just surpassing the 36 they made in Australia in 2020 and 42 in England 50 years ago.Devon Conway’s quickfire 91 off 105 balls, containing three sixes and 11 fours, lifted the Black Caps to 180 for three and a lead of 134 at stumps, but the story of the day belonged to India’s dramatic collapse. Rohit was the first to go, charging at Tim Southee but undone by movement off the pitch and bowled, before O’Rourke claimed the prize wicket of Virat Kohli for a nine-ball duck. Sarfaraz Khan chipped tamely to mid-off to give Henry his first and while Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rishabh Pant – the only two batters to make double figures – put on 21, India slipped from 31 for three to 34 for seven.KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin departed for ducks after Jaiswal made 13. Pant went for a top score of 20 as Henry, who moved to 100 Test wickets, and O’Rourke cleaned up the tail in a remarkable passage of play as India were all out in 31.2 overs.“You see [the pitch] and try and make a judgment. Sometimes you make the right call and sometimes, you don’t,” said Rohit. “I’m hurting a little bit because I made that call … The challenges that were thrown at us, we didn’t respond to well and found ourselves in a situation where we got bowled out for 46. As a captain, it definitely hurts to see that number.”New Zealand’s openers overhauled India’s paltry total in the 13th over, with Conway taking the attack to the spinners. He might have been stumped on 89 but Pant could not gather and looked in pain after the ball thudded into his knee, with Dhruv Jurel taking on wicketkeeping duties from then on.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionIt was not a costly miss as Conway fell nine short of a hundred when he missed a reverse sweep off Ashwin and was bowled.
