  "text": "Nov 12, 2024 1 minute read News Pakistan A continued their dominance over Sri Lanka A on the second day of the first four-day game of the series in Rawalpindi today (November 12), finishing the day with a lead of 66. Having bowled Sri Lanka out for 115 on day one, Ali Zaryab continued on from where he left on the night before, reaching a half century early in the day. Hussain Talat and wicketkeeper Rohail Nazir also made half-centuries, taking the Shaheens up past 250. However, their progress was checked by a four-wicket haul from Vishwa Fernando, who took two wickets in consecutive balls in the opening session. The Shaheens were eventually bowled out for 258, reaching a first-innings lead of 143. When Sri Lanka began their response, they lost a wicket in the very first over. Khurram Shahzad took the wicket of Oshada Fernando with the final ball of his opening over, Nazir taking the catch behind the stumps. That took Shahzad's total wickets in the match so far to five after his four wickets on day one skittled Sri Lanka, as he continues on his comeback after missing Pakistan's Test series against England through injury. Following that early wicket, however, Sri Lanka steadied the ship. Nipun Dhananjaya and Ahan Wickramasinghe built a solid partnership which lasted until the end of play, and meant Sri Lanka didn't lose another wicket before stumps. Wickramasinghe finished the day on 48 off 66 balls, while Dhananjaya finished on 23 off 50. Sri Lanka closed on 77-1, still 66 runs off parity in the second innings. Following the conclusion of this match, the second match of the series will start on November 18, again in Rawalpindi, before the 50-over leg of the tour.
