  "text": "SL vs WI(38.2/44 ov, T:190) 190/5Sri Lanka won by 5 wickets (with 34 balls remaining)Powered by Smart StatsReportRutherford and Motie put on a WI record ninth-wicket stand but it was in vainMaheesh Theekshana and Sri Lanka's spinners had a great time in Pallekelle  •  SLCSri Lanka 190 for 5 (Asalanka 62*, Joseph 2-30) beat West Indies 189 all out (Rutherford 80, Motie 50, Hasaranga 4-40, Theekshana 3-25, Fernando 3-35) by five wicketsWanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, and Asitha Fernando had sent West Indies crashing to 58 for 8, before that ninth-wicket resistance came. Then, after the loss of two early wickets, Sri Lanka recovered through a 62-run partnership between Sadeera Samarawickrama and Nishan Madushka, before the in-form Charith Asalanka came in to produce a fluent half-century, and take Sri Lanka to a substantial victory, and another series victory under his fledgling captaincy.Though the pitch for this 44-over match - drizzle had delayed the start by two hours - was exceedingly spin friendly (it was the same track used for Sunday's game), 190 was always going to be a challenge to defend. Where Sri Lanka's spinners were able to be consistently menacing, often getting significant turn even off faster deliveries, West Indies' slow bowlers did not quite have the same impact.Motie was their best slow bowler, conceding only 18 from his nine overs, and taking the wicket of Kusal Mendis. But legspinner Hayden Walsh was underwhelming, guilty of pitching far too short and being picked off - he went for 41 runs off his five overs. Roston Chase was also only moderately effective. In fact it was seamer Alzarri Joseph who collected the innings' best figures of 2 for 30.Although Hasaranga would go on to get more wickets, it was Theekshana who was the best of Sri Lanka's slow bowlers, and Theekshana who set the collapse in motion with a gorgeous offbreak that beat the outside of left-hander Alick Athanaze's bat and clip off stump. The offbreak turned big on this surface, and he threatened both right-handers and left-handers with it, going to the carrom ball only occasionally. The lines Theekshana bowled were mostly impeccable.Later, a big offbreak would sneak between Keacy Carty's bat and pad and rattle his stumps as well, before a slider beat the wild reverse-swipe that Walsh attempted off Theekshana in the 15th over. He collected figures of 3 for 25 off nine overs.Hasaranga's googlies were doing their usual damage, with Chase suckered in by one that was flighted beautifully. Hasaranga had to work less hard for the wickets of Romario Shepherd, and Alzarri Joseph, who didn't fancy picking him. He'd take the final wicket of the innings too, getting Jayden Seales caught and bowled, and took home the game's best figures of 4 for 40.Fernando's 3 for 35 was especially impressive on a track that did not favour him. He dismissed Brandon King with a surprise bouncer that King played at too early, before bowling Shai Hope with a slightly back of a length delivery that the batter dragged on to his stumps. That he broke the big Rutherford-Motie stand was also significant, even if the wicket of Rutherford came off a low full toss.In fact, Rutherford had been struggling terribly before Motie joined him at the crease in the 16th over and provided the early impetus for their partnership. The No. 10 struck important boundaries, off Hasaranga especially, and by the end of the 25th over had 35 runs to Rutherford's 33, though Rutherford had been there longer and faced more balls.This is the point at which Rutherford began to attack however, having earlier seemed bewildered by every spinner Sri Lanka employed against him. There were suddenly sixes down the ground and on the legside from Rutherford - one hoick over deep square leg off Asalanka's bowling taking him to his half century, off 57 balls. He continued to hit out until he was caught on the deep square leg boundary in the 35th over, having hit four sixes and seven fours. His 80 off 82 was the highest score in the game.Later, after Samarawickrama and Madushka - both of whom made 38 - had lifted Sri Lanka out of immediate danger, Asalanka's entry into the game sent them smoothly off towards the five-wicket victory that would eventuate with 34 balls remaining.The hallmark of a good Asalanka innings is his early boundary-striking ability, and so it was here - spotting a full delivery outside off from the opposition's best seamer second ball, Asalanka creamed it through point for four. In Joseph's next over, Asalanka crashed him through square leg and drilled him through cover for two more fours, having also slog-swept Roston Chase for a boundary in between. In a flash he was on 20 off 14.Though the tempo slowed, he got to his half century off the 48th ball he faced, and went on to shepherd Sri Lanka home, remaining not out on 62 off 61 balls.Andrew Fidel Fernando is a senior writer at ESPNcricinfo. @afidelfGet latest cricket updates on WhatsApp",
