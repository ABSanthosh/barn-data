  "text": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jamie Overton made his ODI debut in October 2024Fast bowler Jamie Overton has been ruled out of England's remaining two one-day internationals against West Indies with a broken finger.Overton suffered a broken little finger while attempting to take a return catch during England's huge win in the series-opener at Edgbaston on Thursday.The 31-year-old immediately left the field for treatment but came back on to bowl and took three wickets.No replacement has been called up to the squad, with Matthew Potts replacing Overton in the England XI as the only change from the side that beat West Indies on Thursday - earning his 10th ODI cap and first since September.Overton is expected to be out for about a month, so will also miss the three T20s against West Indies that follow the ODIs.Potts and Luke Wood are the other fast bowlers in the ODI squad.Overton is the latest fast bowler to miss out through injury after Mark Wood, Jofra Archer and Gus Atkinson.England began Harry Brook's reign as captain with a comprehensive 238-run defeat of West Indies, racking up 400-8 in Birmingham.More on this story",
