  "text": "News\"There's a bit of joy when you finish games for the team\", he said after scoring a match-winning centuryShubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan got the job done for GT with minimal fuss  •  BCCIGujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill admitted that his team may have conceded \"10 to 15 extra\" in the first innings against Delhi Capitals. But he and B Sai Sudharsan more than made up for it with an unbroken 205-run opening stand that powered GT to a 10-wicket win that helped them secure a playoff berth in IPL 2025. GT now sit top of the table, with two league games - and potentially a home playoff - still to come.\"Honestly at the halfway point, I thought we gave 10 to 15 extra,\" Gill said. \"There was a little bit of grip for the spinners. They [Delhi Capitals] batted well, kept wickets in hand and utilised the wicket pretty well. When we went out to bat, the talk was to just try and play good cricket shots, and once we were in the flow, we can take the game from there.\"Gill, who revealed the break allowed him to recover from a sickness bug, finished unbeaten on 93, while Sai Sudharsan brought up his second IPL hundred - a scintillating 108 not out off just 61 balls. Together, the duo has now amassed 839 runs (and counting) this season, the most by an Indian opening pair in IPL history.How GT's bowlers have been igniting the Sai Sudharsan-Gill fireworksStats - GT become second team to chase 200-plus without losing a wicketSai Sudharsan and Gill help clinical GT book playoffs berthGT, RCB and PBKS book their places in IPL 2025 playoffsNamed Player of the Match, Sai Sudharsan spoke about the mindset shift that helped him close the game out without any jitters.\"There's a bit of joy when you finish games for the team,\" Sai Sudharsan said. \"In the break we got, I was thinking on that [finishing games] a bit more. Between overs 7-10, they bowled really well [DC conceded 30 to leave Titans 93 without loss]. The momentum went down a bit.\"We wanted to take the game deep, didn't want to be desperate to take a lot of chances, have a cool enough mindset to take the game deep. And we got two or three big overs that changed the game. In the previous games, I took chances and got out. Here I was aware enough to take the game deep, and take my chances against the right match-ups.\"Asked about the changes in his approach to T20 batting, Sudharsan pointed to growing belief and mental freedom. \"I've started to believe a bit more,\" he said. \"From my mindset point of view, the belief I have has gotten better to take the game deeper and win games. I've expanded my batting, explored my batting, mentally I'm a bit more free and expressive.\"Sai Sudharsan was also highly complementary of his captain, Gill, when asked about their partnership and understanding. \"When I got after the bowlers, he complements me, we rotate strike and run really well,\" he said. \"In the middle overs, running is vital thing for us. When I do some mistakes, he makes me aware and similarly from my side as well.\"Meanwhile, GT batting coach Parthiv Patel credited the pair's chemistry and risk-free aggression for their continued success. \"You talk of high-risk, high reward. These two play low-risk cricket and still have the ability to hit down the ground and get boundaries and sixes,\" Parthiv said.\"The fours they hit in the powerplay…I feel they know their game, on top of everything. People don't see how much hard work they put in, creating those basics stronger, that's why they're scoring runs. They communicate really well.\"Last year also, they batted brilliantly. When the season started, everyone thought Buttler would be opening. These two knew what they're doing. The opening pair is about chemistry and knowing each other's game really well, and these two know their games really well.\"Shashank Kishore is a senior correspondent at ESPNcricinfo",
