  "text": "Nov 17, 2024 2 minute read News The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have refuted a report claiming that Jason Gillespie is set to be axed as the head coach of their Test side. The last 12 months have been tumultuous for Pakistan off the field, with changes in leadership roles almost becoming routine. Earlier today (Sunday, November 17), ESPNcricinfo reported that more change was in the offing, with Gillespie set to be removed from his role as head coach and that he would be replaced by Aaqib Javed, who currently sits on the selection panel. Gillespie has been head coach of the Test side since earlier in 2024, overseeing a home series defeat to Bangladesh but also a series victory against England. After Gary Kirsten's departure as white-ball head coach, Gillespie also assumed duties as Pakistan's interim limited overs coach. He presided over Pakistan's recent ODI series win over Australia in Ausralia. The ESPNcricinfo report states that Gillespie was offered the chance to coach across formats but on a contract worth the same as his initial Test-only responsibilities, an offer that Gillespie was set to reject. With the PCB now keen to have one head coach across formats, this prompted them to start looking elsewhere, according to the report. However, the PCB publicly refuted the claims made in the report, taking to X (formerly Twitter) to say: \"PCB strongly refutes the story. As announced previously, Jason Gillespie will continue to coach the Pakistan side for the two red-ball matches against South Africa.\" That statement is hardly a wholehearted endorsement of the incumbent head coach, though. It refuses to confirm that Gillespie will remain as the head coach past the upcoming tour of South Africa despite his contract running through to 2026. Pakistan have four matches remaining in their World Test Championship campaign; two away to South Africa and then two at home against West Indies. Alongside England, Bangladesh and West Indies, they are one of the four sides already out of World Test Championship contention.
