He admitted to the offence and accepted the sanction, which also included an official reprimand. India had won the series 3-1.Netherlands captain Scott Edwards and Oman seamer Sufyan Mehmood also faced sanctions for breaching the ICC code of conduct during the third T20I between the two teams in Al Amerat on Saturday.Edwards was found guilty of two breaches - Article 2.8 and 2.2, which relates to \"abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings during an international match\".After being given out lbw, he showed his bat to the umpire. Then, while returning to the dugout, he threw his bat and gloves on the field, copping two demerit points in all. He was also fined 10% of his match fee.Mehmood was also fined 10% of his match fee and given one demerit point for giving a send-off to Netherlands batter Teja Nidamanuru.
