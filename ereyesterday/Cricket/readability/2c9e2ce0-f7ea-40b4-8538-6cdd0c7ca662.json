The 19-year-old fast-bowling all-rounder came through Lancashire's academy ranks and played for the county's second team last summer.His younger brother Rocky made his debut as a 16-year-old for Lancashire last season and has gone on to play for England Lions. Corey has been training with Kent this year and bowled four overs in his new side's warm-up game against Essex last week.His rookie deal means he is available to play for Kent while also being able to balance his university studies for the next two years. \"The lads in the dressing room have been so welcoming to me this week and there's a great atmosphere here,\" Flintoff told the club website., external\"I'm excited for what's next for me and I know that Kent is the right place for me to make the step up to first-team cricket.\"Kent's director of cricket Simon Cook added: \"Corey is an extremely exciting young player and has great all-round ability to score runs and take wickets.\"He is a very hard worker and I know that he is extremely determined to make a name for himself in professional cricket. \"We're delighted that he feels that he can do this as a Kent cricketer.\"More on this story",
