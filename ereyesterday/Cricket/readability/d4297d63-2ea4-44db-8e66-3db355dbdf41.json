Santner struck a quickfire half-century late on Day 1 to take New Zealand past the 300-run mark. England will be hoping to continue in their aggressive batting style, with the likes of Ben Duckett and Harry Brook expected to take charge, amidst the composure provided by the experienced Joe Root. New Zealand's 36-year-old pace talisman Tim Southee will hope to get among the wickets, in what is his last-ever Test match. (LIVE SCORECARD) Topics mentioned in this article",
