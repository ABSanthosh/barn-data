  "text": "Allrounder Sophie Molineux has been ruled out of the multiformat Ashes series due to a knee injury that will require surgery while captain Alyssa Healy remains unsure whether she will keep wicket due to her ongoing knee problem.Molineux, a left-arm spinner, managed a knee issue through the WBBL, where she captained Melbourne Renegades to a maiden title, and the problem flared again after the ODI series against India. Molineux was ruled out of the recent trip to New Zealand and now faces a further spell on the sidelines.\"Sophie Molineux will undergo left knee surgery next month, following that we will provide further updates on an anticipated return date,\" team physiotherapist Kate Beerworth said.Sutherland's 78-ball century overwhelms NZ in rain-hit ODIRyana MacDonald-Gay seals place in England's Test squad for Women's AshesJon Lewis: T20 World Cup exit was 'line in the sand' for England WomenOne of the key issues for Australia to resolve ahead of the Ashes will be whether Healy is able to keep wicket having handed the gloves to Beth Mooney in New Zealand. Healy has been included in the Governor-General's XI squad for a 50-over warm-up game against England on January 9 at North Sydney Oval which she said would be good test for her knee.\"That'll be a great opportunity for me to take the gloves for a little bit and see how everything's progressing,\" Healy told reporters at the MCG. \"I can't really give you any more information than that. It's kind of play it by ear at the moment to see how everything pulls up.\"But I did thoroughly enjoy running around the field in New Zealand. So if that's the option and is less disruptive to our side, then that could be the way moving forward. But the aim is to take the gloves and hopefully I can do that.\"Having an angry joint in there and flaring that up, and knowing the really tight schedule with the Ashes as well, probably managing that and not wanting to blow it up too much that it's going to affect my ability to play at all. So that'll be the real test, I think, in the next 10 days, moving into the series as to how that pulls up, how it responds to keeping again, and we'll just assess as we go.\"Georgia Voll, who made a stunning start to her international career against India, with 173 runs in three ODIs including a century, has been included for the one-day and T20I series which form the first two parts of the Ashes. Grace Harris will join for the T20Is at the SCG, Canberra and Adelaide.\"It was pleasing to see Alyssa Healy return to action against New Zealand and looked in good touch, along with a number of batters continuing their strong form on from the recent series against India,\" national selector Shawn Flegler said.\"Whilst Georgia Voll didn't play against New Zealand, she's made a brilliant start to her international career and will be a strong option with the bat if required in her debut Ashes series. The bowling group provides plenty of variety which will be important against a strong England batting line up.\"A squad for the day-night Test at the MCG in late January will be named in the coming weeks.\"I think you look at the way we've probably shaped up in Test cricket over the last couple of seasons, it's looked a little bit different to what we've done in the white-ball format,\" Healy said. \"So there is some reasoning as to why that Test squad hasn't been announced, and we'll probably look at that over the next few weeks, just to see where all the bowlers in the domestic cricket are at and their loads and how they're going to prepare for a Test match.\"Knowing it's pink ball, knowing it swings a little bit more, and what the conditions are going to be like, I think there's a few players around the country at the moment that could stick their hand up for a baggy green which I think is really exciting.\"The Ashes starts with the first ODI at North Sydney on January 12 followed by matches at Junction Oval in Melbourne and Hobart.Meanwhile, legspinner Georgia Wareham has also been called into the Governor-General's XI squad in place of fast bowler Darcie Brown to give Wareham more game time ahead of the Ashes having only featured in one of Australia's last six ODIs where she wasn't required to bat or bowl.Australia ODI and T20I squad for Women's Ashes Alyssa Healy (capt), Darcie Brown, Ashleigh Gardner, Kim Garth, Grace Harris (T20s only), Alana King, Phoebe Litchfield, Tahlia McGrath, Beth Mooney, Ellyse Perry, Megan Schutt, Annabel Sutherland, Georgia Voll, Georgia Wareham",
