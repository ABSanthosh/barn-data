  "text": "Alzarri Joseph will rejoin West Indies' T20I squad for the final part of the T20I series against England following the conclusion of his two-match ban, replacing Shamar Joseph in the group. Joseph will join up with the group ahead of a must-win third T20I for the West Indies. They lost both of the first two matches of the series heavily, by a margin of eight and seven wickets in the first and second T20Is respectively. Phil Salt scored a remarkable century in the first game of the series to take England to victory with 19 balls remaining, while Jos Buttler's 83 off 45 in the second saw the second game completed with 31 balls to spare. Joseph was absent for both of those matches due to a suspension by Cricket West Indies after an incident in the final game of the ODI series. He had an on-field disagreement with captain Shai Hope during the game, before storming off the field and leaving the West Indies to field with only 10 players. West Indies head coach, Daren Sammy told TalkSPORT of the incident: \"Behaviour like that is unacceptable on my cricket field. We will be friends... but in the culture I'm trying to build, that's unacceptable.\" Miles Bascombe, Cricket West Indies director of cricket said: \"Alzarri's behaviour did not align with the core values that Cricket West Indies upholds. Such conduct cannot be overlooked, and we have taken decisive action to ensure the gravity of the situation is fully acknowledged.\" Joseph also apologised for the incident. He will now replace Shamar Joseph in the squad, who played the first match of the series, returning figures of 0-45 from three overs, but was replaced by Matthew Forde in the XI for the second match. In another change to the squad for the final three matches of the series, Cricket West Indies have announced that Andre Russell will play no further part in the series due to a left ankle sprain he sustained during the first T20I. Following the injury, Russell was replaced in the XI by Terrance Hinds for the second T20I. Shamar Springer will join up with the squad to replace Russell for the final part of the series. Springer made his T20I debut for the West Indies against Sri Lanka last month, returning figures of 1-25 and 1-24 in the two matches he played in that series respectively. The third match of the series will take place on Thursday, November 14 in Saint Lucia. Follow Wisden for all cricket updates, including live scores, match stats, quizzes and more.
