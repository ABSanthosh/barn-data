There is another Test series starting in 20 days' time.\"We know where we are. We have seen some things we have wanted to see.\"Speaking to BBC Radio Four's Today Programme, Trescothick added: \"We look at the opportunity to get a few games into them [players with less experience] so we can see these guys that may potentially impact the team in the future. \"It is good to see them playing under pressure and against a good West Indies team.\"This series has been sandwiched between England’s Test tours of Pakistan and New Zealand, meaning players who would likely make up their first XI have been unavailable, such as Harry Brook, Joe Root, Ben Duckett and Ben Stokes.England picked four debutants - Jordan Cox, Dan Mousley, Jamie Overton and John Turner - for the first ODI and were beaten by eight wickets via the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method.Liam Livingstone, standing in as captain for the injured Jos Buttler - another of England's absent first-choice players - scored a stunning century in the second match to level the series but the tourists were punished in the third match after a top-order collapse left them 24-4.Phil Salt made a careful and uncharacteristic 74 and Mousley hit his first ODI fifty but their total of 263-8 proved well below par as Keacy Carty and Brandon King stroked centuries for the hosts.The series defeat follows a 3-2 loss to Australia in September and another away loss against West Indies last winter, which came after their dismal defence of the 50-over world title won in 2019.Trescothick suggested England have learned more from the series than the results would suggest, name-checking his captain and 21-year-old all-rounder Jacob Bethell, who scored a half-century in the second match of the series.\"We have a better understanding of what our team will look like in comparison to series results,\" he said.\"A few guys are really stepping up. Liam Livingstone, for example. Bethell has really shone in the short space of time he has had.\"The support we get is amazing. We have to try and stick with it and understand what we are going through.\"'McCullum gets the best out of players'Brendon McCullum will take charge of the white-ball sides in January and former England captain Sir Alastair Cook feels that cannot come soon enough.The 43-year-old New Zealander has been head coach of the Test team since the summer of 2022 and has overseen an upturn in the side’s fortunes, leading them to 20 wins in 32 matches.\"I'm looking forward to McCullum having his stamp on this side because he has a way of getting the best out of players,\" Cook told TNT Sports.\"Every time he's taken over sides, there’s been a real enthusiasm about playing in that team. With that one-day team, it just needs a bit of a boost.\"McCullum will not have long to make his mark on the limited-overs team with England facing India in five T20 internationals and three ODIs, beginning in late January.That is quickly followed by the chance to claim a global title with the 50-over Champions Trophy in Pakistan starting in February.",
