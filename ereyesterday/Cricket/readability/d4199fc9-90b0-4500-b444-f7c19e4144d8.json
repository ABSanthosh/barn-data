No more discussion, let’s play,” Craig could be heard saying on the stump microphone.India’s wicketkeeper Ishan Kishan was then warned by Craig he could face further sanction, after telling officials it was a “stupid decision”.“You will be on report for dissent, that is very inappropriate behaviour,” Craig replied. “Because of your actions we changed the ball.”However, officials opted against pursuing any further action after Australia wrapped up a seven-wicket win, with Nathan McSweeney pushing his Test case with an unbeaten 88.“The ball used in the fourth innings of the match was changed due to deterioration,” a Cricket Australia spokesman said. “Both teams’ captain and manager were informed of the decision prior to the start of play. No further action is being taken.”AAP understands there was no footage that showed how the ball had deteriorated, or any evidence that pointed to one particular player. Umpires also did not hand down a five-run penalty on field.Kishan will also escape any sanction, with the matter now considered closed ahead of the next A-game starting in Melbourne on Thursday.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionWhile occurring in an A-game, any fallout from the alleged incident would have had the potential to overshadow the start of the summer.Kishan is not part of India’s Test squad for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, which begins in Perth on 22 November.Fast bowler Prasidh Krishna, allrounder Nitish Kumar and batter Abhimanyu Easwaran are the only players in the India A side who are also part of the Test squad.",
