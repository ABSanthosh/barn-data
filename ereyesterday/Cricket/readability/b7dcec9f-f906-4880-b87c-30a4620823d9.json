  "text": "Media caption, 'Absolutely delighted for him' - Tufnell on Dawson's comeback performanceEngland are a better side with veteran spinner Liam Dawson included, says former captain Michael Vaughan.Playing his first Test for eight years, and only his fourth in total, the 35-year-old dismissed Yashasvi Jaiswal with his seventh ball on day one of the fourth Test against India.Left-armer Dawson has a stellar domestic record with both bat and ball but was consistently overlooked by England for a variety of other options during his absence.\"He is the kind of cricketer as a captain you say 'give me control, a few runs and you field nicely',\" Vaughan told the Test Match Special podcast.\"It is the all-round package and for this England side, and going forward to Australia, they are stronger with this style of cricketer in it.\"Media caption, Dawson reflects on first Test appearance in eight yearsDawson's opportunity, one repeatedly called for by fans of the county game, came after Shoaib Bashir broke a finger during England's victory in the third Test at Lord's last week and was ruled out of the series.Despite being unable to hold down a place at his county, Bashir, 21, has been England's first-choice spinner since the start of last year with England banking on his potential.Bashir has taken 10 wickets across the first three Tests but those scalps came at an average of 54.10. Dawson, in contrast, held a consistent line throughout his 15 overs at Old Trafford and conceded 45 runs as England limited India's scoring - the tourists closing on 264-4.With the bat, Bashir comes in at number 11 and has a top Test score of 13, while Dawson has 18 first-class hundreds.\"On the pitches we are seeing in the UK and potentially Australia I want to see a batting line-up that is absolutely packed,\" Vaughan said.\"The over-spin of Bashir is very dangerous but what you require in this England team on the pitches they are playing is control.\"I don't think he [Dawson] is going to get six or seven-fors but he will get two or three. If the pitch breaks up he may get four or five-for.\"Dawson took seven wickets in three Tests in his first spell in international cricket between December 2016 and July 2017.In his time away he has become the leading spinner in county cricket - he was last year's Professional Cricket Association men's player of the year - and a regular on the global T20 franchise circuit.After leaving him out of the tour to India last year - the tour on which Bashir made his England debut despite having only six first-class matches to his name - England's managing director Rob Key said Dawson was \"probably not someone who wants to go around India as the 15th or 16th man\".Speaking on Wednesday, Dawson said he has never turned down a Test tour, although he did fulfill a contract in the 2023 Pakistan Super League rather than travel to Bangladesh for a white-ball series.\"I think the age I've got to, if I'm honest, I didn't think I'd play again, it's not something that I'd worry about,\" he said.\"I just tried to enjoy my cricket which I've made pretty clear. It's cool to be back involved, I've got to try and enjoy each day I'm involved and playing for England.\"I knew what to expect coming into it for a second time so that helped.\"Of course I was nervous but nerves are a good thing. The older you get and the more you play, you learn how to manage those nerves.\"Media caption, Dawson removes Jaiswal in second over of England Test returnMore on this story",
