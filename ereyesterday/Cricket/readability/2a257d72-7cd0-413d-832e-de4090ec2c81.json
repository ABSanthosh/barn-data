And she turns up, and there’s a shirt in the rooms which has a message from Josie.“Cricket, there’s stuff about it, it’s more than just the game. It’s about people and their trials and tribulations. It’s difficult. Our general manager, James Rosengarten, had quite a difficult year with some family stuff, too.”Renegades captain Sophie Molineux described Dooley as the “heart and soul” of the team.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“She’s just everything that the Renegades are about, it’s Josie to a tee,” she said. “She’s so inspirational, not just to us that know her, but to anyone that knows her story.“For her to be as involved as much as she could be this season for us, just to have her presence and being around, she’s just as much a part of this season as any other season she’s been around.”",
