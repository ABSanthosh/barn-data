Opting to bowl, GG put on a disciplined bowling display, with Deandra Dottin (2/31) and Tanuja Kanwar (2/16) restricting RCB to a below-par 125/7. The offspin allrounder Gardner also chipped in with 1/22 in a tidy spell. GG took just 16.3 overs to seal victory, with Gardner smashing three sixes and six fours in her third fifty of the tournament. She raced to her half-century in just 28 balls, bringing it up in style with back-to-back sixes-a slog-sweep over long-on followed by a powerful hit over deep midwicket.
