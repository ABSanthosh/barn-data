  "text": "Most men’s T20I hundreds, full list: Phil Salt joins elite club with third ton Phil Salt hit his third T20I hundred to drive England to victory in the first game of their five-match series against West Indies, a tally bettered by just three men in cricket history. Here’s the full list of batters with the most T20I hundreds. Salt played an uncharacteristic innings in the third ODI, battling to a slow half-century following a top-order collapse to prop up England’s total. He was praised for displaying a new, mature side to his game, but showed there’s still plenty of belligerence to be called upon, blasting away to a century to make a target of 183 look miniscule. Attacking the new ball, Salt raced to fifty inside the powerplay and barely let up thereafter. His ton came up off 53 balls and was laced with nine fours and six sixes, and England went on to seal victory with 19 balls to spare. Salt now averages nearly 40 and strikes at nearly 170 across his T20I career, and has made certain his place in Brendon McCullum’s plans when England’s Test coach takes on the role in all formats. The century was Salt’s third in T20Is after he reached three figures in consecutive innings in December last year. In that time, he has established himself as one of the world’s premier short-form batters, a reputation reflected in the lofty company his century tally puts him in. Only Australia’s Glenn Maxwell and India’s Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav have made more centuries in the format, while, among Full Member nations, only Pakistan’s Babar Azam and New Zealand’s Colin Munro are his equals.
