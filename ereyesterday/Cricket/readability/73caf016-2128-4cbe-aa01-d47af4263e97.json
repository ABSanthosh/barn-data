Once invincible during the league stage with five successive wins to start off the competition, DC's journey to playoffs became even more tougher as they succumbed to a 10-wicket loss to GT at their home arena of Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday. Speaking after the game in the post-match presentation, Axar said, \"The way they batted was excellent. The wicket also got better as the game went on. We felt we had a par score. Got a good finish, KL (Rahul) batted well. Our bowlers tried well but did not get the win. The way we batted was a positive given the last couple of games. Fielding and bowling in the powerplay needs to improve. The ball came on nicely in the second innings. It (ball) did not stick in the pitch like it did in the first innings. They didn't lose wickets, which made it easy as well.\"DC's home record has been poor as compared to their away record. At home, they have won just one game via Super Over, losing the other four.
