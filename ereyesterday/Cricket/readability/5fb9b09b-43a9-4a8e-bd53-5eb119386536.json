The familiar foes have had the best winning percentages in red-ball matches across that period and again top the World Test Championship standings after clashing in the final last year, when Australia capped off a cycle of renewal and rediscovered stability with a resounding 209-run victory at the Oval.While India are yet to taste success in a WTC decider, having also lost the inaugural final to New Zealand in 2021, they have had a firm grip on the silverware that arguably matters more – the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. India have won the past four Test series against Australia – twice as hosts and as many times when playing away – since last handing over the trophy almost 10 years ago.But with captain Rohit Sharma now showing signs of ageing and star batter Virat Kohli a fading force, cracks have started to appear in the India side and became most apparent in a historic and humbling 3-0 defeat at home to New Zealand. A lack of depth has perhaps also been exposed since the squad arrived in Australia with Shubman Gill – who was earmarked to jump from No 3 to open in the first Test, given Rohit is yet to arrive in the country for family reasons – suffering a thumb injury.As India are forced to take steps towards regenerating on the run amid mounting pressure to quickly turn around their results, we look at the five players – new and old – ready to make their mark against Australia in their first five-match series since 1991-92.1. Yashasvi JaiswalLike Sachin Tendulkar and Kohli before him, Jaiswal arrives in Australia carrying the the hopes of an expectant nation as “the next big thing” in India cricket. The pair of India greats each announced themselves as stars of the game on their first tour of Australia and it is hard to see Jaiswal doing much less. Since making a century in his Test debut in July last year, the 22-year-old has clubbed two more tons – both double centuries against England – for 1,407 runs at an average of 56.28 across 14 matches. The left-handed opener turns the heat back on the bowlers with an assertive style and broad range of strokes, though the No 4-ranked Test batter’s limited experience on bouncier decks in South Africa remains his only poor series so far with 50 runs in four innings.Jaiswal plays a shot during the internal practice match between India and India A at the Waca Ground.

Rishabh PantAustralia will know what to expect from India’s most dynamic batter who has been among the top-three run-scorers both times the tourists have won the Border-Gavaskar Trophy on foreign soil. But Pant has since had to rebuild his body and game after a horrific motor vehicle crash in late 2022 ended with the keeper-batter in hospital and eventually sidelined for 18 months. The 27-year-old has quickly returned to form to average 46.88 in five matches since coming back to the Test side in September.Pant is a known quantity to Australia.

Akash DeepWith Mohammed Shami not included in India’s squad due to injury, the tourists need to find a fast bowler to partner Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj at least on the fiery surface in Perth. Akash looms as the likely third quick after first putting his hand up for a regular place in the side when ripping through the England top order on the first morning of his debut Test earlier this year. The 27-year-old has 10 wickets from his five Tests and was praised for toiling away on the spin-friendly surfaces in the recent series against New Zealand, but will expect to have more luck in Australia where conditions better suit his guile as well as testing pace.New Zealand captain Tom Latham’s stumps take the full force of an Akash delivery earlier this month.

Dhruv JurelWith Gill under an injury cloud, doubts surrounding KL Rahul’s form and fitness, and Pant taking the gloves in the first-choice XI, India may be forced to call on promising keeper Jurel to play as a specialist batter. The 23-year-old looks capable of taking on the role without too much concern as he already plays with composure beyond his years, and suggested in India A’s recent match at the MCG that he is comfortable in the conditions with scores of 80 and 68. Jurel has shown that he is just as well suited to a step up in class when making 46 on Test debut against England and earning player of the match in his next match with 90 and 39 not out while guiding India home for a win over the same opponents.Dhruv Jurel impressed on India’s tour of England.

Jasprit BumrahAustralia have rarely seen the best of Bumrah as one of the most devastating bowlers in the game has suffered from back issues and other injuries, but the 30-year-old now appears to be fit and firing and set to captain the side in the early absence of Rohit. While Bumrah has missed the past two series against Australia on home soil, he has been a pivotal player in the series victories on the road. The right-arm speedster was equal leading wicket-taker on his first tour of Australia when taking 21 scalps at an average of 17, and backed it up with 11 wickets at 29.36 in 2020-21. Bumrah has only led India in one Test – a defeat in England in 2022 – but has been outspoken in the past in backing fast bowlers as captains, and will seek to show that he should be next in line to take the mantle longer-term with 37-year-old Rohit edging towards the end of his career.Bumrah is fit and firing ahead of the summer’s Test series.
