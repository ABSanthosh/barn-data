Harris' first match will be Surrey Women's opener against Hampshire Hawks at the Kia Oval on June 5, as part of the double-header alongside the equivalent men's fixture.Harris is renowned for her big-hitting and wily off spin, skillsets which have made her a staple across a number of franchise tournaments. As well as featuring prominently for her home side Brisbane Heat in the women's Big Bash, the Queenslander recently ended the WPL as UP Warriorz' joint-highest runscorer, and is part of London Spirit in The Hundred. She also featured in the three T20Is that made up the winter's women's Ashes, helping Australia consign England to a 16-0 defeat.\"I can't wait to take to the pitch with the team at Surrey and the Kia Oval,\" said Harris, in a statement released on Wednesday. \"The club has shown a strong commitment to the women's side and I know the team have been preparing hard over the winter. I'm really looking forward to contributing to the team and making the most of my time with them.\"Emma Calvert, Surrey's Director of Women's Cricket, added: \"We are incredibly excited to be able to announce Grace as our first overseas signing for our newly professional Surrey women's team.\"Grace brings international and franchise experience which we believe will really add value to our squad both on and off the pitch. She plays exactly the style of cricket we look to play and I can't wait to see her wearing the three feathers at the Kia Oval this summer.\"Surrey will play in the top league of the women's Vitality Blast, along with the seven other Tier One counties. The eight sides will play each other home and away across 14 group-stage matches, with the top three securing a spot at Finals Day, which will take place at the Kia Oval on July 27.",
