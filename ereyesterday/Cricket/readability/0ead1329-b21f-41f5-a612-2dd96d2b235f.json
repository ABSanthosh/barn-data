With a barrage of boundaries from Jamie Smith and Ben Duckett the home side took control of a match that was delayed after the players got stuck in traffic, and then abbreviated by rain, before with an explosive cameo from Jos Buttler they sped to victory by seven wickets, with 62 balls to spare.The series thus ended as it started, with a one-sided victory. The match in between was much more competitive but this was a very different display from England, whose fielding was as sharp as it had been sloppy on Sunday, and in particular from their openers who in Cardiff had scored a combined total of nothing but here each reached rapid half-centuries.Smith might have travelled in by train, but as soon as he had a bat in his hand he was motoring, hammering 64 runs off just 28 balls, 46% of which went for boundaries. The first of them, it is true, came off the inside edge, but from there his bat seemed to be made entirely of middle. England rushed to 50 off just 28 legal deliveries – at this point Smith was on 41 and Duckett on three – and by the end of an abbreviated, eight‑over powerplay they had already scored 100.Harry Brook of Smith: “He’s gone out and played extremely well, but he’s not a slogger, is he? He’s playing proper shots, and he’s putting them under immense pressure. We want batters that can put their best bowlers under pressure, manipulate the field, and score big runs. He did that today.”There was just a little bit of luck along the way, and Smith was dropped at midwicket by Jayden Greaves off the first ball of Gudakesh Motie’s opening over, Motie having himself dropped Duckett moments earlier. The bowler gained revenge by dismissing Smith with the final ball of the same over, though the four in between had disappeared for 20.By this point England, having come in needing 6.15 an over, had whittled the required run rate down to something only marginally less pedestrian than some players’ journeys to the ground, and when Duckett ended an excellent over from Roston Chase by spearing to cover having by then scored a 46‑ball 58 they were most of the way there. Brook was also dropped in what, but for the efforts of a couple of batters, was a dismal West Indies performance, before Buttler’s firecracker 41 – 32 of those from boundaries – took England over the line.Sherfane Rutherford hit an explosive 70 for West Indies. Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/ShutterstockGiven their late arrival at the ground it was perhaps understandable that some of West Indies’ batters looked underprepared as the game got under way, and both Shai Hope and Chase lasted only one ball – the latter falling to his first delivery for the second time in three days.They were not helped by England’s excellence in the field, and this time the only catch that did not stick was by Brydon Carse, sprinting to his left on the square‑leg boundary, though even if he had somehow clung on to Sherfane Rutherford’s mighty blow his momentum would have carried him beyond the rope.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThat was one of two sixes Rutherford registered, and if few batters had a finer excuse than him for feeling a little ill at ease – his last game was 4,000 miles and five time zones away in Mullanpur on Friday, the final outing of his Indian Premier League stint with Gujarat Titans – there was little sign of it here. Coming in with the West Indies innings almost as troubled as their journey to the ground, he took only two balls to get his eye in, before hitting his next two for four to slide smoothly into gear.The 26-year-old ended with 70 off 71, very slightly reducing his average in a format in which he has scored six fifties and a century in just 11 innings to 70.87. “He’s like a video game player,” Hope said. “He’s been scoring runs for fun.”With Motie contributing 63 off 54 and Alzarri Joseph adding a handy 41, West Indies recovered from 28 for three and 154 for seven to post 251, adjusted under the DLS method to leave England with a target of 246 and 40 overs to do it. It felt just about defendable, until England’s openers got to work.",
