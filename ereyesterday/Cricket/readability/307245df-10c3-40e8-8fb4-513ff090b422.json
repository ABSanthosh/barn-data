  "text": "NewsEx-Somerset legend says concerns were raised about conditions that 'reduced game to a farce'Lewis Gregory bats on a first-day pitch at Taunton that was showing clear signs of wear and tear before a ball was bowled  •  Getty ImagesLord Ian Botham, Durham's honorary president, has slammed his former club Somerset for preparing an \"appalling\" pitch after 35 wickets fell in five sessions in the County Championship fixture between the two sides.Botham, the legendary England allrounder, spent most of his professional career with Somerset and was a key part of the club's one-day success in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He later joined Worcestershire and then Durham, and became the latter's honorary president last year after serving a seven-year term as chairman.He accused his old county of reducing the Championship \"to a farce\" on Wednesday night after their five-wicket win over Durham by preparing a bright-green pitch on which 22 wickets fell to spinners. Jason Kerr, Somerset's head coach, described the pitch as \"an incredible surface\" and said the volume of wickets owed to the quality of his bowlers.\"As an ex-Somerset player, I find this appalling,\" Botham wrote on X, alongside pictures of the pitch, which were taken before a ball was bowled. \"Durham raised serious concerns the day before the game started… change is needed… both Somerset and Durham have high quality batsmen… Somerset do not need to do this… reduces the game to a farce.\"Somerset docked 12 points for 'poor' pitch in Championship deciderCraig Overton leaves Durham overwhelmed on 22-wicket dayJack Leach six-for hands Somerset two-day victoryBotham said that the pitch underlined why England have largely opted to ignore county averages in selection in recent years. \"These are not first-class cricket conditions in midsummer,\" he wrote. \"I am not surprised that Rob [Key] and Ben [Stokes] unfortunately have to disregard county performance in assessing players for Test quality appearances.\"He also said that the pitch undermined Somerset's opposition to a proposed cut in the number of Championship fixtures per team from 14 to 12, which Durham support: \"At a time when County Cricket is under pressure for relevance as a breeding ground for International Players and Somerset members have apparently voted for the status quo, the club produces this pitch.\"Kerr, the Somerset coach, told the ECB Reporters Network: \"There has been a lot of noise surrounding the pitch, but I thought it was an incredible surface. You can't see 400 runs scored in a day, as happened yesterday, and then complain about the wicket.\"We have to find a way of getting results here and, because there has been so much cricket at the ground this year, we had to prepare a used pitch. Craig [Overton] and Jack [Leach] exploited any help in it because they are top quality bowlers.\"Somerset's pitches have often attracted opprobrium. They were docked 12 points for the 2021 Championship season after preparing a pitch marked \"poor\" for their 2019 title decider against Essex, were warned after a two-day finish against Lancashire in 2018, and in 2017 were branded \"a disgrace\" by Angus Fraser after a relegation shoot-out against Middlesex.Matt Roller is senior correspondent at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98",
