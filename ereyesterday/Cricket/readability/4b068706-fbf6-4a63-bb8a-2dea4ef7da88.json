After a flogging like the one their players had just suffered across three sessions, perhaps this was to be expected.But on day two, cheered on by some wonderful pockets of support, the tourists mustered a pushback. First came an improved showing with the ball, England losing three for 67 to declare on 565 for six, followed by something of a fairytale century from the opener Brian Bennett. Though bowled out for 265, and closing on 30 for two following on, Zimbabwe had given their hosts a far stiffer outing.Bennett was still in the womb he shared with his twin brother, David, when Zimbabwe were last on these shores but now his name is etched in their cricketing folklore. Faced with a mountain of runs, and a green England attack desperate to impress their captain, the right-hander peeled off the fastest Test century by a Zimbabwean – just 97 balls – and struck 26 fours en route to 139 from 143.It was not always as frictionless as the numbers suggest but, if anything, this was to Bennett’s credit. A couple of edges squirted through gaps in the cordon and, on 89, a third was grassed by a perplexed Joe Root. But each time the 21-year-old got his head down and refocused, cruising through the nineties with a hat-trick of laced boundaries off Gus Atkinson and sampling some rarefied air with it.Only two Zimbabweans – two fine ones in Andy Flower and Murray Goodwin – had scored Test centuries against England previously and, once the renovation of the old pavilion is complete, Bennett will join the latter on Trent Bridge’s overseas honours board. His day ended lbw for one second time around – a fourth wicket for Atkinson across the two innings – but was scarcely tarnished by this.For England this was the early summer workout they were craving and, given the surface on which they racked up the sixth 500-plus total of the Bazball era, one they might have expected too. Despite falling for nine in the morning, undone by extra bounce from Blessing Muzarabani, Stokes claiming two for 11 from 3.2 overs on his return from hamstring surgery was arguably the biggest plus of all.Opener Brian Bennett celebrates his record-breaking century, the quickest ever in Tests by a Zimbabwean. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAThe captain had only brought himself on when Shoaib Bashir injured his right ring finger fluffing a return catch. But after overstepping initially, his first legal delivery was a snorter to Bennett that produced the edge Root put down. This was just a taster, however, with Sikandar Raza soon undone by a repeat and Wessly Madhevere castled off an inside edge. Stokes, all told, looked sharp.Bashir’s injury was not serious, thankfully, and across 16.4 overs the off-spinner picked up three for 62. The battle for control of his length remains but so too do the magic balls that lead England to persist. Snaffling a couple of senior pros in Craig Ervine (42) and Sean Williams (25), and returning to bowl Tafadzwa Tsiga through the gate, Bashir also became the youngest Englishman to reach 50 Test wickets.Though just 21 years and 222 days old, Bashir is also the most experienced of England’s frontline bowling attack in this match, with 16 caps. At the other end of this slim spectrum is Sam Cook, who shared the new ball with Atkinson and began with a 12-run over in which one inside edge whistled past the stumps.A mixed start, admittedly, but there was soon a new entry into Cook’s little black book of wickets. It was a pretty smart piece of bowling, too, Cook going around the wicket to the left-handed Ben Curran and squaring him up for an edge to second slip. Having kicked the door down to get this chance, and overcome doubts about his medium-fast speeds, the 27-year-old’s delight here was unbridled.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionAt the other end of the pace spectrum to Cook is Josh Tongue, England’s quickest option after Mark Wood and making his comeback following an 18-month injury ordeal. Across 13 overs Tongue’s nasty angle gave Stokes a point of difference. It also gave the experienced Williams a headache courtesy of one blow to the helmet.A no ball initially denied Tongue the wicket of Bennett on 139, likewise Ollie Pope a spectacular diving catch at short leg. But four balls later the pair combined for a simpler repeat that left Zimbabwe 246 for six. The resistance slipped away thereafter, Atkinson and Bashir combining to wipe out three more and Richard Ngarava not appearing after the previous day’s back spasms.After a punchy half-century from Harry Brook first thing – the English highlight of a session in which Pope added just two to his overnight 169 – it amounted to a tidy outing from the hosts. With Stokes inviting his guests to have another go – and soon watching Atkinson and Tongue whistle up a couple more strikes – a three-day Test match is now in the offing.Nevertheless, despite the gulf in quality and that grisly opening day, Zimbabwe have stamped their mark on this short tour. The flashing blade of Bennett is to thank for this; an innings worthy of the exclusive club it saw him join.",
