  "text": "India have selected Ravindra Jadeja for the third Test against Australia in Brisbane, replacing R Ashwin in the lineup. Here's why they might have made the call. At the toss, India skipper Rohit Sharma confirmed that there were two changes to the visitors' lineup – Ravindra Jadeja and Akash Deep coming in for R Ashwin and Harshit Rana. Australia, meanwhile, made just one switch as Josh Hazlewood returned from injury to take the place of Scott Boland. As far as India are concerned, they have gone with the same combination of bowlers in each Test so far – three specialist pacers plus one spinner, as well as a fourth pacer in all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy. The lone spinner has been different in each match, though. Washington Sundar was preferred for the first Test in Perth, while R Ashwin played in Adelaide, and Jadeja has come in in Brisbane. The decision is perhaps harsh on Ashwin, who bowled 18 overs in the day-night Test, taking 1-53 and stemming the run flow from one end even as Australia scored almost at will off Harshit Rana and Mohammed Siraj. Who didn't even see the first ball he faced? And who forgot that his batting partner had an injury? On the eve of the Gabba Test between India and Australia, @ovshake42 goes on a trip down memory lane – to four summers ago. https://t.co/u191g6ysDl — Wisden India (@WisdenIndia) December 13, 2024 But India's batting lineup has been their Achilles heel on this tour so far, so Jadeja may have been picked here for his superior ability with the bat, with a minimal drop-off from Ashwin in the bowling department. It may also be the case that Jadeja is India's preferred option for the spin-bowling all-rounder spot, but Ashwin was a horses for courses pick in Adelaide. On the last tour Down Under in 2020, Ashwin performed admirably with the pink ball, taking 4-55 and 1-16 at the same venue. By the same token, Sundar may have been selected in Perth for his ability to extract more bounce off the wicket at the Optus Stadium.

Ashwin played here in 2014, scoring 35 \u0026 19 but taking 2-128 as India went on to lose by four wickets. Sundar played here three years ago, playing a pivotal role in a now famous Indian victory with 62 \u0026 22 with the bat and 3-89 \u0026 1-80 with ball in hand. Jadeja does have an excellent Test record in Australia, with 175 runs at 43.8 and 14 wickets at 21.8 apiece, across five Test matches.
