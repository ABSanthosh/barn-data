  "text": "Sam Curran showcased excellent game awareness and clarity of thought during his half-century in England’s series-levelling ODI win against West Indies in Antigua, hitting six, then ensuring a no ball was called, and then attacking the free hit as well. Curran joined Liam Livingstone with England 160-4 after 28 overs, needing a further 169 runs to level the series after defeat in the first ODI. After nudging a single off his first ball, Curran upped the ante, smashing the left-arm spin of Gudakesh Motie over long-on for six. While it might have seemed an extreme risk early in his innings, Curran’s actions immediately after the ball sailed across the ropes made clear that there was no danger in the shot at all. He pointed out that West Indies had too many fielders outside the 30-yard circle, with Matthew Forde seemingly the man guilty of not coming inside the ring. The umpires, seemingly, missed this until Curran pointed it out, but confirmed he was correct, and signalled a no-ball and a free hit. To compound Motie’s misery, Curran struck the free hit for four as well, meaning England had got 11 runs off one legal delivery, and all down to Curran’s cunning. He went on to make 52 at a run a ball, adding 140 with Livingstone and guiding England to the brink of victory. Batting at No.6 in this series for the first time in ODIs, the knock was his second half-century in the format, and an important innings ahead of Brendon McCullum assessing who he wants in his side when he takes charge of England’s white-ball sides at the start of next year.
