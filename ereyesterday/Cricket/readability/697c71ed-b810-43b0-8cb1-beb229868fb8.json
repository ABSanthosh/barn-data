Like many in this country, I find myself contemplating the end of a difficult year and the imminent arrival of one that will likely bring nothing better. The sense of possibility that once came with a future that felt unwritten has long since gone, replaced by a queasy feeling of dread and a fear that if anything is to change, it will change only for the worse.Everything changes, even the cricket commentary. As the years have come and gone, so have the voices on the radio. Players’ names have changed as careers have begun, flourished, and ended. Even the subtle rhythms of the game itself have evolved. These days we have Tests decided in two days, something that would have been unthinkable to my father and his generation. Even the way I listen has changed: the crackle of the humble transistor radio has long since been replaced by the crystal-clear sound of an internet stream.But the experience of listening remains: a quiet, simple pleasure, an anchor for a peripatetic life, a source of certainty – or something that feels like certainty – in a world that feels ever more uncertain.
