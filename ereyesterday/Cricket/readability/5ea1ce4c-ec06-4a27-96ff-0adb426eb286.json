  "text": "Rothesay County Championship Division One, Trent Bridge (day two)Nottinghamshire 333 \u0026 171-6: Haynes 60*, Patterson-White 44*; Abbott 2-33, Wheal 2-52Hampshire 196: Abbott 67, Prest 43; Abbas 5-31Notts 5 pts, Hampshire 3 ptsMatch scorecardMohammad Abbas took five wickets on his Nottinghamshire debut to put the Division One leaders in a strong position against his former county after 16 wickets fell on day two of their County Championship clash with Hampshire at Trent Bridge.The 34-year-old Pakistan seamer, who took 180 first-class wickets in four summers at the Utilita Bowl before agreeing to move to Trent Bridge for part of this season, finished with 5-31 as Hampshire were bowled out for 196 in their first innings in reply to Nottinghamshire's 333.Nottinghamshire slipped to 59-5 in their second innings but Jack Haynes (60 not out) and Liam Patterson-White (44 not out) helped them recover to 171-6 at the close for a very healthy lead of 308.Earlier, Kyle Abbott - Abbas's former new-ball partner on the south coast - hit three sixes in a feisty 67 to rescue Hampshire from 106-7, before going on to add two more wickets to his five-wicket first-innings haul.Abbas dismissed Nick Gubbins via a catch to fourth slip to claim his first scalp in Nottinghamshire colours in his fifth over as Hampshire, 2-0 overnight, found themselves 31-2 after 40 minutes, having already lost opener Mark Stoneman, caught and bowled by Brett Hutton.Fletcha Middleton was caught behind as a ball from Lyndon James climbed on him sharply enough to prompt a miscued pull but, approaching lunch, Hampshire might have felt they had the foundation for a decent response to Nottinghamshire's first innings.But that assessment was blown apart as Abbas returned to the attack, taking three wickets in as many overs either side of the break, turning 96-3 into 99-6.Prest, having struck back-to-back boundaries as Abbas momentarily lost his lines, was leg before as the next ball struck him plumb in front. Ben Brown's off stump was sent cartwheeling and Toby Albert nicked to second slip.Hutton beat James Fuller's defensive prod at 106-7, after which, still 227 behind, Hampshire could quickly have found themselves batting for a second time had Abbott's positive approach not paid off.The South African hit a half-century from 36 balls as he added 42 for the eighth wicket with Liam Dawson, plus 30 for the ninth with Brad Wheal, last man Sonny Baker keeping him company long enough for the follow-on to be avoided.Dawson fell to a superb catch by Farhan Ahmed at extra cover as Abbas completed his quintet, Wheal becoming a second victim for James in almost a duplicate of Middleton's dismissal before lunch.Abbott, who lofted a straight six off the left-arm spin of Patterson-White and twice cleared the rope hooking Hutton, was ultimately caught at long-on. It gave Ahmed a wicket with his second ball and while Hampshire trailed by 137 runs, it was much fewer than had seemed likely.Abbott then enhanced the value of the runs he had made by dismissing both Nottinghamshire openers in his first four second-innings overs. He bowled Haseeb Hameed, seemingly beaten for pace, and had Ben Slater nicking to slip.A wicket in the last over before tea and two more shortly afterwards left Nottinghamshire in peril at 59-5, albeit 196 runs in front.Joe Clarke was caught behind trying to pull Wheal. Fuller then had first-innings centurion Freddie McCann caught behind off an outside edge and Wheal picked up a second as Kyle Verreynne was bowled by a ball he chose to leave.Nottinghamshire lost a sixth wicket for 84 as James pulled Baker's first delivery to mid-off but, with signs that some of the venom in the pitch might be starting to dissipate, Haynes and Patterson-White put together a partnership so far worth 87 that might have put the game out of Hampshire's reach.Report supplied by ECB Reporters Network, supported by Rothesay",
