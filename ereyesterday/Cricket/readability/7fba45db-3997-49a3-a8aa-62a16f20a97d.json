Mahmood is one of five frontline quicks in the party, with Gus Atkinson, Jofra Archer, Mark Wood and Brydon Carse having all worked with the bowling consultant coach, Jimmy Anderson, in Abu Dhabi.Even the seam-bowling all-rounder berth has gone to the faster man, with Jamie Overton preferred to the left-arm angle of Sam Curran and he is due to join the squad after playing in Australia’s Big Bash League.With Reece Topley and Chris Woakes overlooked, it represents a change in direction for England under McCullum; a strategy underpinned by the “Pace Project” the team director, Rob Key, commissioned last year.
