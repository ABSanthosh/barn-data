You can see the effect he's had on the Test team and the whole narrative around English cricket. He was always someone I'd have loved to play in a team with and now there's an amazing opportunity to work with him as a coach.\"Buttler will be a specialist batter for the T20 series, with Phil Salt remaining as wicketkeeper, while Marcus Trescothick continues as interim head coach.Buttler said he made the decision to give up the gloves with McCullum, who did the same during his career to focus on his role as New Zealand captain.\"When he moved to be close to the bowler, he found it incredibly beneficial and a great place to captain from,\" said Buttler.\"I'm open to something if it's going to be good for me, good for the team. I'm quite happy fielding. There are pluses and minuses to both.\"West Indies have announced a 15-man squad for the first two T20s, with seamer Matthew Forde replacing Alzarri Joseph, who is serving a two-match suspension for leaving the field after arguing with Shai Hope during the third ODI.England T20 squad: Jos Buttler (c), Rehan Ahmed, Jofra Archer, Jacob Bethell, Jafer Chohan, Jordan Cox, Sam Curran, Will Jacks, Liam Livingstone, Saqib Mahmood, Dan Mousley, Jamie Overton, Michael Pepper, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt (wk), Reece Topley, John Turner.West Indies T20 squad (for first two matches): Rovman Powell (c), Roston Chase, Matthew Forde, Shimron Hetmyer, Terrance Hinds, Shai Hope (wk), Akeal Hosein, Shamar Joseph, Brandon King, Evin Lewis, Gudakesh Motie, Nicholas Pooran, Andre Russell, Sherfane Rutherford, Romario Shepherd.",
