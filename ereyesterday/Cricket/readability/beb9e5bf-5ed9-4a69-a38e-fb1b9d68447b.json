  "text": "Australia have named a 13-man squad for the first Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test against India at Perth, with two uncapped batters included in the squad. The selection has ended the debate over who will succeed Steve Smith as Australia Test opener, following his short-lived move up the order next winter. Nathan McSweeney has held off competition from experienced Test openers Marcus Harris and Cameron Bancroft and 19-year-old upstart Sam Konstas to partner Usman Khawaja at the top of the order. The 25-year-old captained Australia A to a 2-0 series win over India A, impressing in the first four-day game with an unbeaten 88 to guide his side to victory. That innings earned the South Australian a promotion from No.4 to opener for the second ‘Test’, and while he couldn’t make it beyond a pair of starts, the lack of a significant score elsewhere allowed McSweeney to lock up the top spot. The right-hander, who bats at No.3 in the Sheffield Shield, had also made a hundred in his last game of last season and the first of this to press his case. Joining McSweeney in the squad as an uncapped player is Josh Inglis, who has carved out a reputation as an explosive batter in white-ball cricket. He has enjoyed an excellent start to the 2024/25 Sheffield Shield season, making two hundreds, averaging 99 and scoring at a brisk rate. However, he has been ruled out as an opening option, paving the way for McSweeney to make his Test debut. \"Nathan has displayed the attributes we believe will equip him well for Test cricket along with a strong recent record in domestic cricket,” said selector George Bailey. His performances for South Australia and Australia A weighed in his favour and supports our view he is ready for the opportunity at Test level. Similarly, Josh has been in great touch in the Sheffield Shield competition and deserves his place in his first Test squad.\" The rest of the squad is as expected, with Cameron Green already ruled out, and Scott Boland serving as fast-bowling back-up. The first Test at the Optus Stadium starts on November 22. Australia Test squad for first Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test v India: Pat Cummins (C), Alex Carey (wk), Josh Inglis (wk), Nathan McSweeney, Usman Khawaja, Travis Head, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Mitch Marsh, Mitch Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland.
