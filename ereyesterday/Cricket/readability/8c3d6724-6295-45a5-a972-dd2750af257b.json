But star quick Mitchell Starc has been named for the fifth and final match of the Border-Gavaskar series despite dealing with rib soreness at the MCG.The 34-year-old had scans on Wednesday, but received the all-clear to take his spot in a bowling line-up alongside captain Pat Cummins, Scott Boland and Nathan Lyon. Taking Starc in meant Australia needed more bowling options, with Webster providing the versatility of sending down pace and spin.Marsh had only been called upon for 13 overs in the past three Tests, with his pace appearing well down while going wicketless. The 33-year-old did suffer back complaints following the first Test in Perth, but Australian management have since insisted there are no fitness concerns for him.But Marsh’s struggles with the bat – making scores of 9, 5, 4, 2 and 0 from his past five innings – meant he was in trouble.“‘Mitchy’ obviously hasn’t quite got the runs, and perhaps wickets this series,” Cummins said on Thursday. “So we felt like it was time for a freshen up and Beau’s been great.“It’s a shame for Mitchy, because we know how much he brings to the team, but feel like now it’s a good week for Beau to get a chance.”More than an hour after the epic finish at the MCG on Monday, Marsh walked out onto the ground with two family members and took photos, seemingly knowing he might have played his final Test.Webster has averaged 57.1 in first-class cricket since March 2022, while also picking up 81 wickets at 31.7. Last year, the 31-year-old became the first player since West Indian legend since Sir Garfield Sobers to score 900 runs and take 30 wickets in a Sheffield Shield season.It will be the second-straight Test Australia have selected a first-gamer, following Sam Konstas’ memorable Boxing Day debut.Cummins said Marsh understood the decision and wasn’t “blindsided” by it.“Really excited for Beau; the first thing he [Marsh] said was ‘I can’t wait to see Beau go out there and give it a crack’,” Cummins said. “Particularly here in Australia, I think when a batter misses out or gets dropped, it’s always seen as a big thing.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“But the way that [Australia coach Andrew McDonald], and the selectors and myself look at is we love pulling a squad of players together who we can call on at different times.”Australia will regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy for the first time since 2014-15 if they win or draw the New Year’s Test. Victory for India and a series drawn 2-2 would allow the tourists to retain the trophy, emerging with the spoils for a record-extending fifth-straight time.A win at the SCG would book Australia’s spot in a second-straight World Test Championship final, after they beat India in the 2023 decider. South Africa became the first team to qualify for the WTC final at Lord’s next year, by winning a dramatic match at home to Pakistan on Sunday.",
