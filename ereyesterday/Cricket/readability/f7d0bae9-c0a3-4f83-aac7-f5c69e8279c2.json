  "text": "WTC 2025 Final Live: Stumps! Stumps have been called, moments after Jansen drops Starc at slip. Australia reach 144/8 and consolidate their lead to 218 runs heading into Day 3. Carey's fighting 43 during that 8-wicket partnership with Starc has pulled the holders back into the contest. Just like Day 1, 14 wickets fall on Day 2. Nightmare for the batters. Cummins with a six-for, and three each for Ngidi and Rabada. All to play for on Day 3. WTC 2025 Final Live: WICKET That looked plumb! No luck for Carey this time. It was a confident appeal for Rabada and co. Umpire gives it again. Replays confirm no bat this time. It comes down to umpire's call on leg stump as the ball was moving awayAlex Carey lbw b Rabada 43 (50)AUS: 134/8 (38.2) WTC 2025 Final Live: Runs flowing for AUS! Australia are finding the boundaries, thanks to Carey. Again, sweet timing. Starc almost gets in the way. Does well to get his leg out of the way. Punched through mid-on for four.AUS: 123/7 (36.3) WTC 2025 Final Live: Partnership blossoming! This has been an impressive rearguard from Carey and Starc. The partnership is now 40 runs. Every single is taking South Africa a step backwards. This would be the ideal time to strike with stumps approaching.AUS: 113/7 (34.3) WTC 2025 Final Live: Carey survives! Big let-off for Carey! Loud appeal for LBW and the umpire gives it straightaway. Carey reviewed, almost immediately. Gets the length ball to jag back into Carey on middle and leg, who looks for a flick and misses. However, replays reveal there was a thin edge before the ball hit the pad.AUS: 100/7 (33.2) WTC 2025 Final Live: Carey-Starc solid! This is turning out to be a good partnership from Alex Carey and Mitchell Starc. The duo has added 18 runs for the eighth wicket so far while playing 44 balls between them. Australia's lead has gone to 166 now. Slowly and gradually, they are fighting back in the game.AUS 91/7 (32) WTC 2025 Final Live: Rabada back into the attack! Kagiso Rabada was finally given the ball in the third session but he failed to trouble Alex Carey in the over. He was even hit for a four through fine leg after bowling a back of length delivery on the hips of Carey. Six runs came off the over.AUS 90/7 (31) WTC 2025 Final Live: Australia need a partnership! On the first ball of the Lungi Ngidi over, an outside edge flew from the bat of Alex Carey but it fell in front of Aiden Markram in the slips. Australia lead by 158 runs. A good partnership will put them in a strong position.AUS 84/7 (29) WTC 2025 Final Live: Australia lead by 150 runs! From 64 for 4, Australia were reduced to 73 for 7. While they scored only 9 runs, they lost three crucial wickets. Without a doubt, South Africa hold an edge here. But what would give Australia some comfort is the fact that the lead has grown to 150 as the side reached the 76-run mark.AUS 76/7 (26.4) WTC 2025 Final Live: OUT! Proteas on top! Lungi Ngidi strikes again! He has picked his third wicket and South Africa are right on top of this game. Pat Cummins was expecting a short delivery but Ngidi outplayed him with a fuller ball. It hit the pad of Cummins before disturbing the timberwork.AUS 73/7 (24.5) WTC 2025 Final Live: South Africa lose a review! South Africa have lost another review. It was a back of length ball from Lungi Ngidi and the batter tried to flick it away but missed it. He got hit on the front foot. Umpire was unconvinced over the appeal but South Africa reviewed it and ended up burning their second review.AUS 66/6 (24.1) WTC 2025 Final Live: OUT! Wiaan Mulder has dismissed Travis Head. It swung in and kept low. Head missed his shot before the ball brushed his pad and hit the off-stump. The southpaw is out for 9 runs off 18 balls. Australia are in deep trouble here as the lead is only 140. AUS 66/6 (23.4) WTC 2025 Final Live: Ngidi strikes again! Lungi Ngidi has struck again and Australia are in a bit of trouble here. They are five down. That delivery from Ngidi hit the back pad of Beau Webster. It was pitched outside off-stump but swung in sharply into Webster. Umpire raised his finger over an LBW appeal and the batter only burnt a review.AUS 64/5 (23) WTC 2025 Final Live: Wait for Rabada continues! South African pacers have not leaked runs and that sees them keep Australia under the pump. However, the wait for Kagiso Rabada continues. While Lungi Ngidi has been bowling from one end, Wiaan Mulder has replaced Marco Jansen at the other.AUS 58/4 (22) WTC 2025 Final Live: OUT! South Africa back in the game! Lungi Ngidi has dismissed Steven Smith and South Africa are back in the game. Australia are four down at an effective score of 123 (with the first-innings lead of 74). It was pitched around off-stump and straightened from there to square up Smith. The ball hit his back pad. Umpire was unconvinced over the appeal for an LBW but South Africa went upstairs to find out that it was a superb decision. Smith fell for 13 off 25 balls.AUS 48/4 (18.5) WTC 2025 Final Live: OUT! This is a big breakthrough for South Africa. Marco Jansen has got the wicket of Marnus Labuschagne. The right-handed batter is out after scoring 22 runs off 64 balls. It was a fuller delivery from Jansen, going into Labuschagne. The batter got an edge and handed an easy catch to South Africa wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne.AUS 44/3 (17.5) WTC 2025 Final Live: Relief for South Africa! Marco Jansen copped a blow on his left thumb but the good thing for South Africa is that he continues to bowl from the other end. Australia are looking solid at this point as Steven Smith and Marnus Labuschagne keep going. WTC 2025 Final Live: Jansen injured! Marco Jansen has hurt himself while trying to field a ball. He has been hit on the area at the bottom of the his left thumb. We have a short stoppage in play. The physio is checking him. Jansen receives some treatment and it seems he is good to continue. The match resumes! AUS 41/2 (16.3) WTC 2025 Final Live: Jansen keeps it tight! Another economical over from Marco Jansen. He conceded only one run in his sixth over. The fast bowler has not picked any wicket so far but he has managed to keep his spell economical. The lanky pacer has conceded just 11 runs in his six overs so far. AUS 38/2 (14) WTC 2025 Final Live: Australia aim to rebuild! Five runs came off the first over from Lungi Ngidi. Australia need Steven Smith and Marnus Labuschagne to dug in their heels here. One good partnership and the Pat Cummis-led side will truly be on control of this game. On the other hand, South Africa will aim for some more wickets in this session.AUS 37/2 (13) WTC 2025 Final Live: 3rd session starts! Lungi Ngidi will resume the post-Tea session. He starts with a back of a length ball into the pads of shuffling Steven Smith. The batter plays it on the leg side for a single. We are into the third session on Day 3.AUS 33/2 (12.1) WTC 2025 Final Live: Tea on Day 2! What could have been Australia's session entirely has been turned into a mixed one for them, courtesy South Africa pacer Kagiso Rabada. He struck twice in just three balls to bring the Proteas back in the game. Australia still hold an edge as they have a lead of 106 runs on the board. AUS 32/2 (12) WTC 2025 Final Live: Another WICKET! Kagiso Rabada is doing the job here for South Africa. He has struck again and Australia have lost two wickets in just three balls. It was a good length ball outside off-stump. It shaped a bit away from Cameron Green and took the outside edge of his bat. Kyle Verreynne grabbed it well in the slips.AUS 28/2 (10.4)  WTC 2025 Final Live: OUT! The first breakthrough for South Africa! They get it after waiting for 61 balls. It was a back of length ball from Kagiso Rabada and that took the outside edge of Usman Khawaja's bat. He is out for 6 runs off 23 balls. The southpaw's poor form in this match continues. Cameron Green comes in to bat.AUS 28/1 (10.2) WTC 2025 Final Live: What a ball! That was a beauty from Kagiso Rabada! The ball was angling into Marnus Labuschagne before pitching and then changing its direction sharply. It squared the batter up. The delivery was so good that even beat the outside edge of Labuschagne's bat.AUS 24/0 (8.5) WTC 2025 Final Live: FOUR! Marco Jansen bowls it fuller outside off-stump and Marnus Labuschagne has driven it away for a four. This is turning out to be a good start for Australia now. This is a good wicket to bat on. South Africa batters failed to make it count, but Australian openers are not missing the chance here.AUS 23/0 (7.1) WTC 2025 Final Live: Poor review! 5.3 - Usman Khawaja tried to play a pull shot on the bowling of Marco Jansen and missed it. There was a should for an edge but umpire was unconvinced. South Africa decided to go upstairs only to lose a review. WTC 2025 Final Live: Proteas in search for first wicket! Three economical overs from South Africa. Kagiso Rabada leaked 7 runs in his first over but managed it with just one in the following over. Marco Jansen has bowled the tight line and length and conceded only three runs in his two overs so far. However, the first breakthrough keeps eluding the Proteas.AUS 12/0 (4) WTC 2025 Final Live: Good start for Jansen! Marco Jansen conceded only one run in his first over. After missing his flick shot in one of the deliveries, Usman Khawaja left the rest three balls of the pacer outside off-stump.AUS 8/0 (2) WTC 2025 Final Live: 7-run over! Marnus Labuschagne played all the balls of the Kagiso Rabada over and collected 7 runs in it. He slammed the pacer for a four through the mid-wicket. It was a fuller ball from Rabada and Labuschagne played it really well.AUS 7/0 (1) WTC 2025 Final Live: Third innings begins! Kagiso Rabada is bowling the first over in this third innings of the game in which Australia are batting. Marnus Labuschagne is on the strike, while Usman Khawaja is at the other end. WTC 2025 Final Live: South Africa all out for 138! Pat Cummins has dismissed Kagiso Rabada for his sixth wicket and that sees him get to the milestone of 300 Test wickets. South Africa are all out for 138 runs, giving Australia a huge innings lead of 74 runs on this bowling-friendly wicket. Notably, 6/28 from Cummins is the best bowling figures in WTC final.SA 138 (57.1) WTC 2025 Final Live: WICKET! Keshav Maharaj has been run-out and South Africa are in big-big trouble here. They are nine down, still trailing Australia by 74 runs. Poor batting show this is from the Proteas!SA 138/9 (57) WTC 2025 Final Live: Five-Wicket haul! Pat Cummins has got set batter David Bedingham and with that wicket, the Australia captain completes a five-wicket haul. It was a good length delivery, coming into Bedingham. The batter ended up getting an outside edge to Australia wicketkeeper Alex Carey. Bedingham is gone for 45 off 111 balls. SA 135/8 (55.2) WTC 2025 Final Live: Proteas trail by 82 runs! Those twin blows from Pat Cummins have jolted South Africa badly. The Proteas could have played better in this post-Lunch session so far. Australia, on the other hand, are not giving up and that has helped them stay ahead in this game. SA 130/7 (54) WTC 2025 Final Live: OUT! Terrific from Cummins! A caught and bowled from Pat Cummins and he has turned this game truly in favour of Australia. Marco Jansen literally played it into the hands of the Australia captain to lose his wicket for a three-ball duck. South Africa have lost two wickets in just three balls. SA 126/7 (52) WTC 2025 Final Live: Brilliant review! Kyle Verreynne is OUT! That is a superb review from Australia captain Pat Cummins. It was pitched up and hit the pad of Verreynne, who missed his flick shot. Umpire was unconvince despite a loud appeal for an LBW but Cummins decided to review it. It turned out to be a really good decision as the ball was found to be hitting the leg stump. Verreynne departs for 13 off 39 balls. South Africa are six down.  SA 126/6 (51.3) WTC 2025 Final Live: Tight from Cummins! Pat Cummins conceded two singles in the first over of the second session. Both David Bedingham and Kyle Verreynne were careful in the over. Nathan Lyon will bowl the next over.SA 123/5 (50) WTC 2025 Final Live: Good news, folks! Okay, here is the good news for you all. The clouds have moved away and the sun is out at Lord's in London. The Australian players and umpires walk into the ground and so do the South African batters. We are set for resumption in the post-Lunch session. Cummins with the ball in hand. Verreynne on the strike. Here we go... WTC 2025 Final Live: Covers on! There are some clouds over the stadium and covers are on the pitch. There is some breeze and umpires are inspecting the conditions. The match would have resumed by now, but the weather conditions are interrupting here. Wait for an official word! WTC 2025 Final Live: A controversial moment! On 48.3, a controversial thing happened. A Beau Webster delivery got an inside edge of David Bedingham's bat and nearly stopped in his pad. As Australia wicketkeeper Alex Carey was going close to the batter to catch the ball, Bedingham collected with the ball in motion and dropped it on the ground. Australia wicketkeeper even appealed against that but umpires were unconvinced. \"The ball is considered dead once it gets lodged in the pad,\" informed Matthew Hayden and Aakash Chopra during English and Hindi commentary, respectively. But the interesting thing to note is that the ball was in motion and it didn't stop in the pad. WTC 2025 Final Live: Lunch on Day 2! A glorious cover drive from David Bedingham for a four and that is the Lunch on Day 2. It was a good session for South Africa as a total of 27 overs were bowled and they scored 78 runs in it while losing only one wicket in the form of Temba Bavuma. SA 121/5 (49) WTC 2025 Final Live: Webster into the attack! Beau Webster has bowled two overs so far and conceded 10 runs in it. The sky which was coudly  before has become clearer. These are now really good batting conditions and South Africa should take advantage of that.SA 106/5 (47) WTC 2025 Final Live: Big achievement for Cummins! As Australia skipper Pat Cummins dismissed South Africa captain Temba Bavuma, he achieved a huge feat. Cummins joined Ian Chappell and Monty Noble in the list of Australia captains who dismissed opposition captain in Tests at Lord’s. Chappell had removed Tony Greig in 1975, while Noble had dismissed Archie MacLaren across both innings in 1909.SA 97/5 (44) WTC 2025 Final Live: Australia in command! The wicket of Temba Bavuma has given Australia an edge here. For a moment, their bowlers were struggling for the breakthrough but now they must be feeling motivated. South Africa, on the other hand, find themselves in trouble and they need a good partnership to bounce back from here. SA 95/5 (42) WTC 2025 Final Live: Bavuma is OUT! This is a huge blow to South Africa. Temba Bavuma is gone! He was playing really well but ends up losing his wicket to a blinder from Marnus Labuschagne at cover. It was a fuller delivery and Bavuma didn't bother to keep his drive down. Labuschagne put a dive and completed a sensational drive at cover. Bavuma is out for 36 off 84 balls.  The 64-run partnership for the fifth wicket has been broken.SA 94/5 (39.2) WTC 2025 Final Live: Tight from Australia! While Nathan Lyon conceded just a single off his second over, Pat Cummins followed it up with a similar one. The Australia captain also conceded just one run in this over. Australia have managed to control South Africa's scoring rate a bit. Is a wicket loading?SA 94/4 (38) WTC 2025 Final Live: Lyon back into the attack! Spin has been re-introduced with Nathan Lyon bowling his second over. He conceded only a single in the over. The partnership for the fifth wicket between Temba Bavuma and David Bedingham has gone to 63 now.SA 93/4 (37) WTC 2025 Final Live: Good start from South Africa! Temba Bavuma is playing a sensational knock here while David Bedingham is giving him a good support from the other end. Bavuma is ensuring that the Proteas keep going forward while Bedingham is also making sure that they don't lose more wickets. South Africa trail Australia by 125 runs.SA 87/4 (35) WTC 2025 Final Live: Sensational stuff! Wow! Wow! Wow! This is sensational stuff from Temba Bavuma. He is playing with great fire here. Pat Cummins tested him with a short ball and Bavuma responded in style. He muscled it over the deep square leg for a biggie. That is not only the first six of the innings but also the match.SA 87/4 (34.3) WTC 2025 Final Live: Bavuma on fire! Temba Bavuma is playing some quality cricket today. This was a fuller delivery from Mitchell Starc outside off-stump and Bavuma found the big gap between the fielder at cover and sweeper cover for a four. That also bring the 50-run stand for the fifth wicket.SA 80/4 (33.2) WTC 2025 Final Live: FOUR! Slightly overpitched from Josh Hazlewood and Temba Bavuma didn't shy away from taking on the pacer. He played a lofted drive on it over the cover for a four. This is superb intent from the South Africa captain as they need to keep the scoreboard ticking.SA 76/4 (31.4) WTC 2025 Final Live: Australia search for breakthrough! No wicket for Australia on the day while the duo of David Bedingham and Temba Bavuma have added 26 runs so far. Mitchell Starc has been removed from the attack with captain Pat Cummins taking that end. SA 69/4 (30) WTC 2025 Final Live: What a review! Temba Bavuma was given out LBW on the bowling of Josh Hazlewood. The ball pitched around the good length area and swung in to hit the back pad of Bavuma. The South Africa captain took his time before deciding to go upstairs for a review. To everyone's surprise, the UltraEdge revealed that the ball got something from the bat before hitting the back leg of Bavuma. The Australian players were left surprised and the commentators too behaved in same manner. It turned out to be a good review from Bavuma!SA 66/4 (27.3) WTC 2025 Final Live: Proteas in control! Another expensive over from Mitchell Starc. He leaked 7 runs in his third over of the day. He was hit for a four on the fifth ball of the over. It was an overpitched delivery on the pads of David Bedingham and he flicked it away for a four.SA 66/4 (27) WTC 2025 Final Live: FOUR again! A short of length ball outside off-stump from Starc and Bavuma plays another uppish drive for a four. This one went through the deep backward point. The fielder there did give a run but the ball went past him for the boundary. Good gesture this is from Australia captain Pat Cummins as he claps for his bowler's effort.SA 55/4 (24.5) WTC 2025 Final Live: FOUR! Here is the first boundary of the day! A fuller ball outside off-stump from Mitchell Starc and Temba Bavuma played a lofted drive on it over the cover for a four. It was a fully committed shot from Bavuma and there was no stopping. Temba takes a single off the next ball and SA have 50 runs on the board.SA 50/4 (24.2) WTC 2025 Final Live: First runs of the day! A fuller ball from Mitchell Starc outside off stump and Temba Bavuma has driven it towards the fielder at cover. A bit of misfield there and the South Africa batters have stolen a couple of runs. Josh Hazlewood will bowl the next over. Some good test this is for the Bavuma-Bedingham duo. Welcome to Test cricket, folks! SA 45/4 (23) WTC 2025 Final Live: Day 2 play begins! Mitchell Starc has the ball in hand. Temba Bavuma is on the strike. We are all for the first ball on Day 2. Umpire Richard Illingworth gives a green light and Starc starts with a fuller delivery outside off stump. Bavuma got an inside edge on it but managed to defend it. WTC 2025 Final Live: SA aim to bounce back! South Africa would need big runs from skipper Temba Bavuma and David Bedingham, unbeaten on three and eight respectively, to make a fightback on day two. The conditions on Day 2 is expected to be a bit easy at Lord's, London. If this is true, the duo of Bavuma and Bedingham should make it count. WTC 2025 Final Live: What happened on Day 1! Australia's fast bowlers were at their accurate best as they reduced South Africa to 43/4 in 22 overs at stumps on Day One of the World Test Championship final at Lord’s ohere n Wednesday.
