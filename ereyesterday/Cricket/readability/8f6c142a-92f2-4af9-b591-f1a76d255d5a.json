The 2018 Ashes Test in Sydney took place – with additional drinks breaks – when the temperature soared above 43C.The Bureau’s forecast for Melbourne updated on Friday is for a medium chance of showers, most likely later in the day, with winds northerly 20 to 30 km/h shifting south to southwesterly 15 to 25 km/h later in the day.Allsopp said there’s a good chance fans and players won’t be exposed to extreme conditions. “Usually in Melbourne, the temperature gets a lot hotter later in the afternoon, so I anticipate the first and second session won’t get to that extreme, but obviously we want to make sure all our fans are looked after.”The MCG’s record crowd for cricket is 93,013 at the 2015 World Cup Final, and 91,112 for a single day of Test cricket, for Boxing Day during the 2012-13 Ashes.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionAll general public tickets have been sold, meaning whether or not this year’s Boxing Day Test challenges those records will be up to the MCC members.“We genuinely feel like there could be a record on the crowd, there’ll certainly be a record for an India-Australia Boxing Day Test,” Allsopp said.“The weather might have an impact in terms of how hot it does get, and how people feel about that, but we’re anticipating a monster crowd and the series is just so well set up.”The five-Test series is level at one-all, with two Tests – in Melbourne and Sydney – still to play.",
