  "text": "South Africa all-rounder Wiaan Mulder was ruled out of the Sri Lanka Test series with a broken finger, but he didn’t let it stop him from contributing what he could on the third day. In fact, the injury even had the unusual effect of pushing Mulder up the order, rather than down. Here’s why. Mulder’s right middle finger was broken while batting in the first innings when he was struck by a delivery from Lahiru Kumara. Batting at No.7, he was forced to retire hurt, returning after the fall of the ninth wicket and crashing a six off Dhananjaya de Silva. Mulder was sent to the hospital soon after, so it was a surprise when he, rather than Tristan Stubbs, walked out to bat at the fall of South Africa’s first wicket in the second innings. He lasted 31 balls in making 15, but the value of his contribution became clear as each of the men following him, Stubbs and South Africa captain Temba Bavuma, made centuries to set up a declaration. It’s not uncommon for injured batters to contribute lower down the order to extend an innings as much as possible, but a promotion in such circumstances is highly unusual. Mulder, a right-hander, explained how his injury, affecting his bottom hand, made facing off the new ball more feasible than contributing some late swinging. — Proteas Men (@ProteasMenCSA) November 29, 2024 \"I was at the hospital, and then I thought [batting at No.3] was the only way I could impact the game,\" he said. \"I knew I had no power in my bottom hand. I only really had top-hand shots. At No. 3, which is the hardest time to bat at Kingsmead with the new ball moving, I can pretty much play with a straight bat. I don't really need that much bottom hand. \"And if I can face 30 to 70 or 80 balls, that just gives the other guys a better chance to come in with a little bit of an older ball, to be a bit freer, and get the lead as big as we can.\" The quicks had done significant damage in the first two innings of the game, with South Africa bundled out for 191 before razing Sri Lanka for 42, a record low. Given that, the Proteas needed a solid start to ensure Sri Lanka didn’t get back into the game. Mulder gave them that, and Bavuma and Stubbs – whose entrance was delayed by 10 overs thanks to Mulder's bravery – capitalised. The game is a vital one for South Africa’s World Test Championship hopes, with a home summer clean sweep guaranteeing them a spot in next summer’s final. Should they get there, Mulder’s heroics will be a small but memorable part of the tale. Follow Wisden for all cricket updates, including live scores, match stats, quizzes and more.
