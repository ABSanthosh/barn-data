  "text": "Ruturaj Gaikwad made his displeasure at a controversial dismissal of one of his Maharashtra teammates in the Ranji Trophy known on social media as he watched while on India A's tour of Australia. Gaikwad scored 145 for the Ranji side in his last match for them before joining up with India A. He made 0 and 5 in their first match of the series this week against Australia A. However, he has evidently been checking in on his domestic side, commenting on a dismissal of Ankit Bawne in their ongoing match against Services. Having bowled Services out for 293 in the first innings, Maharashtra collapsed from 137-3 to 185 all out. Part of that collapse was the controversial wicket of Bawne. Having edged the ball in the direction of second slip, the fielder had to move low to their right to take the ball. While the fielding side appealed and Bawne was given out, replays showed the ball clearly bouncing before settling in the hands of the slip fielder. Despite the umpires giving the decision as out, Bawne stayed on the field and remonstrated his case with the umpires, but had to walk off unable to change the decision. Posting on his Instagram story, Gaikwad labelled the decision \"absolutely pathetic\" and questioned \"how can this be given out in a live game?\" Gaikwad also questioned whether the fielding side should have appealed, writing: \"Shame to even appeal this for a catch!\". — Vijeet Rathi (@vijeet_rathi) November 7, 2024 After Maharashtra were bowled out, Services reached 15-0 before the close of play on Day Two, and lead by 123 runs.
