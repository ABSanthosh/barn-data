  "text": "India defeated Bangladesh 3-0 in the T20I series and here are the player rankings for the hosts. Sanju Samson: 8.5/10 150 runs @ 50, SR: 205.47 Samson made his maiden T20I ton in Hyderabad, with his innings helping India to a mammoth score. He was unable to maximise his chances in the first two games but maintained a healthy strike rate throughout. Abhishek Sharma: 2/10 35 runs @ 11.66, SR: 159.09 Abhishek, one of the most talented India batters, would be disappointed at missing out. He made only 35 runs, all of which came in the first two games. With the likes of Yashasvi Jaiswal and Ruturaj Gaikwad not playing in the series, Abhishek had the chance to cement his spot but was unable to do so. Suryakumar Yadav: 8/10 112 runs @ 37.33, SR: 189.83 Suryakumar once again showed why is he the best T20I batter in the world at the moment with another quick knock in the third T20I. He also made a 14-ball 29 in the first game and gets extra marks for his captaincy, be it giving his batters the backing to play freely or his clever bowling changes. Nitish Kumar Reddy: 9/10 90 runs @ 45, SR: 180 3 wickets @ 23.66, ER: 7.88 Nitish Kumar Reddy made his debut in the series and left a mark in just his second game. After India lost early wickets, he steadied the innings without letting the run rate drop, making 34 in 74. His full range of shots was visible and he even picked up a couple of wickets with the new ball to suggest he could be another seaming all-round option going forward. Hardik Pandya: 7/10 118 runs @ 59, SR: 222.64 1 wicket @ 58, ER: 8.28 Pandya was yet another batter who batted the way the way the team wanted him to. He made 39* in 16 in the first game and followed it up with 32 (19) and an 18-ball 47 in the last game to show why he is one of the most important members of the side. He would have hoped to leave a bigger impact with the ball though. Riyan Parag: 8.5/10 49 runs @ 24.50, SR: 257.89 Parag faced only 19 balls with the bat but ensured he ended as one of the positives of the series. He batted selflessly, making 15 in 6 in Delhi and followed it up with a 13-ball 34 in Hyderabad, ending the series with the best strike rate. He also picked up a wicket. Rinku Singh: 8/10 61 runs @ 61, SR: 184.84 The series had plenty of batters playing important cameos, and Rinku was not one to be left behind. He combined with Reddy in Delhi after his team had fallen to 41-3 and helped in the recovery with a knock of 53 in 29 balls. Washington Sundar: 3/10 3 wickets @ 6.66, ER: 5 Sundar surprisingly bowled just four overs in the series with the other spinners Varun Chakravarthy and Ravi Bishnoi overshadowing him. Mayank Yadav: 8/10 4 wickets @ 20.75, ER: 6.91 Mayank nearly touched 150kmph in his very first game and was accurate as well. It helped him gain a place as a reserve in the Test squad.  Arshdeep Singh: 5/10 4 wickets @ 10, ER: 5.85 Arshdeep was inconsistent in patches, with his three overs going for 26 runs in the second game. However, he ended with 3-14 in the first game. Ravi Bishnoi: 8.5/10  3 wickets @ 10, ER: 7.50  Bishnoi has fared well for India whenever he has gotten his chances and he starred in the only game he played, in Hyderabad.  Varun Chakravarthy: 9/10 5 wickets @ 14.60, ER: 6.08 Chakravarthy's remarkable comeback after three years was one of the highlights of the series. His variations, googlies and leg breaks made it tough for the Bangladesh batters, who were beaten more often than not.  Follow Wisden for all cricket updates, including live scores, match stats, quizzes and more.
