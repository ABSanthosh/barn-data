Rohit and Suryakumar's explosive century partnership helped MI win by nine wickets. MI are now placed sixth in the points table. \"The way I think we are playing the sport, we knew it was going to be a high-scoring game and we took the percentage. The way Rohit and Suryakumar bat, it is a relief from outside. You do not have to worry about Rohit's form, when he comes good, we know the opposition will be out of the game and the way Surya batted it was great as well, that partnership took the game away. We are sticking to basics. We are playing simple cricket and we are sticking to our plans,\" Hardik said during the post-match presentation.Hardik also admitted that while pacers went for some runs, \"but at the end of the day, 175-180 was below-par\".Coming to the match, a quickfire 32 in 15 balls (four boundaries and two sixes) by teen debutant Ayush Mhatre and fifties from Shivam Dube (50 in 32 balls, with two fours and four sixes) and Ravindra Jadeja (53* in 35 balls, with four boundaries and two sixes) powered CSK to 176/5 in 20 overs.
