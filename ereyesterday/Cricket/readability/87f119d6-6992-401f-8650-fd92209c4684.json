They lost 4-1 to India in the preceding T20s.Root's last ODI was the final match of their dismal World Cup defence against Pakistan in Kolkata on 11 November 2023.This series and the Champions Trophy that follows mark the start of the journey towards the 2027 World Cup in South Africa in 50-over cricket.Root was a key part of England's 2019 World Cup win but has struggled for form in the format since, with his options limited because of clashes in the schedule between England's red and white-ball teams.He averages 28.95 in 28 matches since the 2019 World Cup and has not scored an ODI century since his 100 not out against West Indies in the group stage of that competition.\"He is one of the great players of the game in all of the formats,\" captain Jos Buttler said.\"I am excited to see him in phase of his career. Look what he has done in Test stuff when he has not had the captaincy and is back with that cheeky smile on his face.\"I expect him to do the same in this environment. \"He has been a vital player for England in all formats and we feel he has a crucial role to play in these games.\"Buttler also said he wants England to \"double down\" on their aggressive approach despite defeat in the T20s.\"We played well in phases in the T20s, never quite long enough to run with it and run away with games and get results but it is important we stay on track and on course with the way we want to play.\"",
