Young all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy has been ruled out of the remainder of he series, owing to a left knee injury.Anshul Kamboj, a 24-year-old seamer from Haryana, was sent to Manchester to bolster India's pace bowling options, and he has been preferred to fill the vacant spot left by Akash ahead of Prasidh Krishna.
