  "text": "Ahmed and Hill turn on the style for LeicestershireTanya AldredWith a swish of his velvet cloak and a cut down to third man, Rehan Ahmed reached his second hundred of the summer against Lancashire. It was another hugely enjoyable innings, full of rapier wrist and flamboyant defence. He and Lewis Hill, who hit his own entertaining century – his first for two years – put on 256 for the third wicket, after coming together in tricky conditions on Thursday evening at 24 for two. A partnership of 76 between Ian Holland and Ben Cox added further irritation to another day of toil for Lancashire’s bowlers, With rain skirmishing, Leicestershire collected maximum batting bonus points, to go with the maximum bowling points already in the bag. They were finally all out with a lead of 251.Cloud cover and a friendly dose of overnight rain at New Road set the scene for Chris Woakes to run in for the first time this season, after recovering from a knee injury. A glancing England selector on his way home from Trent Bridge would have seen a bowler in full flow and fine fettle, picking up three for 34, while Chris Rushworth, also in his first match of the season, grabbed four for 37. Warwickshire carried a handy lead of 46 into their second innings against Worcestershire, Alex Davies was bowled cheaply by Jacob Duffy, but Rob Yates and Tom Latham saw them through to stumps.Calvin Harrison, who has proved an inspired loan signing for Northants, from Notts, cracked a career-best 63 before winkling out Ollie Price and Miles Hammond. Saif Zaib had reached a career-best 159 before being caught at slip, and the tail, marshalled by Harrison and Lewis McManus, took Northants to 469. Gloucestershire are still 164 runs short of the follow on.Sussex are pickling Hampshire at Southampton, first building a handy first-innings lead thanks to a third century of the season from John Simpson and 74 from Hudson-Prentice, then rattling through their second innings.Micky Arthur’s happy hunch, Caleb Jewell, hit 232 and together with Wayne Madsen (100) carried Derbyshire to 587 for five declared - their highest score against Kent. Matt Parkinson also became a record-breaker, his 46 overs, 1-204 are now the expensive bowling figures against Derbyshire in history. But Kent’s bowlers didn’t find running in at the County Ground much easier, Ben Compton compiled an unbeaten 105.Eighteen wickets fell on a chaotic day at the Riverside, leaving Somerset to chase 265 for victory. Mitch Kileen snaffled five for 36 on Championship debut when Somerset were bowled out for 172 in the morning. Matt Henry and Migael Pretorius then rattled through Durham for 159, Alex Lees the top scorer with 35. Careful batting from Lewis Gregory and Tom Lammonby gave Somerset hope of a win on Sunday.Nottinghamshire are on top at Headingley, after Mohammad Abbas grabbed six for 45 to dismiss Yorkshire for 159. Glamorgan enforced the follow-on against Middlesex, thanks to Andy Gorvin’s four wickets, but evening rain gave the batters some respite. And Essex’s Paul Walter and Dean Elgar put Surrey under pressure at The Oval, with a dominating opening partnership of 188.Key events6h agoAhmed and Hill turn on the style for Leicestershire6h agoClose of play scores8h agoFifties for DBD and Ben Compton8h agoConcussion sub for Durham9h agoTea-time-ish scores10h agoA hundred for John Simpson!10h agoSix wickets for Abbas11h agoA century for Lewis Hill11h agoRehan Ahmed's second century against Lancashire!12h agoLunchtime scores12h agoA double century for Caleb Jewell, 100 and out for Wayne Madsen!13h agoFive wickets for Mitchell Killeen!13h agoFifty for Rehan Ahmed!14h ago150 for Saif Zaib!14h agoShubman Gill is India's new Test captain15h agoPreamble15h agoScores on the doors15h agoFriday's round-up15h agoWeather watchShow key events onlyPlease turn on JavaScript to use this featureThe end of another day of fun and frolics, from Rehan and Lewis at Grace Road, to the Chrises at New Road, and everything in between.

Hello there Romeo!“You may have come across this by Fanos Hira, the former chair of Worcestershire, who knows what he’s talking about. It was in The Cricketer a few days ago. I don’t understand much of this stuff but Brian does, and he has written a bit about it all at my place which you’ll find here:Fifties for DBD and Ben ComptonKent looking at ease after Joe Denly was caught for three, time for the Derbyshire bowlers to toil. And a wicket at Grace Road, as Anderson Phillip fires one into Cox’s pads and he must leave after a frisky 41. Leics 389-6.Concussion sub for DurhamI’d missed that Durham have a concussion sub – Daniel Hogg stepping in to replace Codi Yusuf who failed a concussion test after being hit on Friday. Hogg, No. 11, currently 16 not out, adding a useful 18 with James Minto. Durham 156-9 – the lead 261.Middlesex lose Holden and Higgins with the score on 70, Middx 79-4, trailing Glamorgan by 304. Higgins, incidentally, ended up with five and TRJ four in Glamorgan’s 383 – glued together by the centuries from Carlson and Northeast.At Wantage Road, Harrison is now striking with the ball , Ollie Price for 10, Glos 74-2.Leicestershire are accumulating nicely, if less flamboyantly than when Hill and Ahmed were at the crease. A 200 plus lead at stumps will be very useful indeedTea-time-ish scoresDivision OneChester-le-Street: Durham 277 and 131-7 v Somerset 172Southampton: Hampshire 154 and 3-0 v Sussex 297The Oval: Surrey 279 v Essex 217 and 73-0New Road: Worcestershire 181 v Warwickshire 227 and 26-1Headingley: Yorkshire 159 v Nottinghamshire 228 and 105-2Division TwoDerby: Derbyshire 587-5 v Kent 63-1Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 383 v Middlesex 70-4Grace Road: Leicestershire 325-5 v Lancashire 206County Ground: Northamptonshire 469 v Gloucestershire 48-1Vegan cinnamon cake at Grace Road; Al Davies out fairly cheaply at New Road. Gloucestershire lost Ben Charlesworth just before tea after eventually bowling out the mighty Derbyshire for 469 – another very useful 63 for Calvin Harrison, who is a brilliant loan signing.Hello Tanya, hello Paul McIntyre!“The press are clearly being briefed that the proposals to cut the number of Championship matches from 14 to 12 and the number of Blast games from 14 to 10, is a done deal. But these cuts are not inevitable. It needs at least 12 counties to vote for them. A members’ petition has forced Middlesex to hold a special meeting on 26 June to vote on resolutions opposing cuts. I hope members in in other counties will follow this lead.”Thanks Paul, this topic has been bubbling along all season. I think one of the main issues is that the players really feel they are playing too much cricket. This was from the PCA earlier in the season: ” 83% confirming they are concerned from a physical point of view due to the current schedule, with 67% concerned regarding their mental state, this is a rise in both stats from the 2024 results.“Noting a wider understanding than ever before from administrators within the game, there is an 11% rise in those believing there should be at least one day between T20 games, meaning nine out of 10 deem this to be a minimum standard.”If there is not going to be any change to the Hundred, that just leaves the CC and the T20 to cut swathes of. Unfortunately. I also worry that the players are inadvertently in danger of voting for their own P45s.The floodlights are on here at Grace Road. Oh and a wicket – reward for Anderson Phillip at last. 310-5, a lead of 104.Fun fact: the friends of Grace Road made £24,600 last year for the club in cakes and quizzes.Morning cake lovers! The FoGR cafe under The Meet is open today from 2.30pm to 4.30pm for the sale of home-made cakes \u0026 hot drinks during the @leicsccc v @lancscricket game. We look forward to seeing you this afternoon. Hopefully we will see @jimmy9 \u0026 Josh Hull on the field.🍰🏏 pic.twitter.com/UDyRN67bAF— Friends of Grace Road (@FoGRMeet4Cake) May 23, 2025 A hundred for John Simpson!He’s a hungry boy, sticking another century in his back pocket, Sussex, six down, lead Hants by 137.Durham doing their best to make things interesting at Chester Le STreet – now 88 for six, while Worcestershire’s tail is wagging just enough to get them in touching distance of Warwicks – the deficit 50.Six wickets for AbbasAbbas removed both openers then gobbled up the tail, as Yorkshire are all out for 159. Six for 45 will do nicely. Hameed and Slater have got Notts off to a tasty start in their second innings: 41-0.And that’s the end of Rehan for 136 - his best score in Championship cricket. He hangs his head, reluctant to move his feet plugged in a wide-apart stance, done by the flight, and caught by Keaton Jennings. He’d become frisky in the 120s. A generous, affectionate standing ovation from Grace Road. Leicestershire 280-3.Rehan quicksteps down the wicket, casually slams Hartley for six, pauses to readjust his box. The cake stall is open.At the Oval, Curran (70) and Clark (54) have given Surrey a very handy lead of 62. Elgar and Walter walk out again.At Durham, injured wicketkeeper James Rew has been replace by wicketkeeper Thomas Rew, who is doing his A levels when he isn’t playing cricket. Somerset have crunched through Durham’s big guns– McKinney, Gay, Bedingham all gone: 55 for three, but the lead already 160.A century for Lewis HillLewis Hill joins the party, with a top edged hook, and gets a huge fist bump and bear hug from Rehan. Lancashire struggling for a suitable incisor here at Grace Road.Rehan Ahmed's second century against Lancashire!First the lead, then a 200 partnership, now a wonderful hundred from Rehan Ahmed, as he cuts Williams down to third man with a swish of his velvet cloak: 164 balls, 14 fours. As at Old Trafford, he looks the real deal.Eats Lancashire for breakfast: Rehan Ahmed Photograph: John Mallett/ProSports/REX/ShutterstockA career best 232 for Caleb Jewell – a Micky Arthur hunch that came off. Derbyshire in heaven 542-5.Lancashire throwing all their efforts into their appeals, or rather celebrations that are followed by the umpire very much not raising his finger. Rehan and Hill both hovering in the 90s.“Can you name the seven one-cap wonders who are still playing County cricket,” asks Ali Martin from Trent Bridge, where he is watching Chris Woakes on the stream, and England in front of his nose.Sit on a bench under the trees for a few minutes to admire Rehan Ahmed and Lewis Hill flaying Lancashire around the ground. “The best session we’ve had all season” I hear one member say to another.Lunchtime scoresDivision OneChester-le-Street: Durham 277 and 18-2 v Somerset 172Southampton: Hampshire 154 v Sussex 228-5The Oval: Surrey 203-7 v Essex 217New Road: Worcestershire 115-5 v Warwickshire 227Headingley: Yorkshire 119-7 v Nottinghamshire 228Division TwoDerby: Derbyshire 483-4 v KentSophia Gardens: Glamorgan 383 v Middlesex 20-1Grace Road: Leicestershire 189-2 v Lancashire 206County Ground: Northamptonshire 423-8 v GloucestershireThe players wander off at Grace Road, think Leicestershire just about shaded it. Fabulous from Ahmed 85 and Hill 79. Lunch scores to follow.Oh Durham.A double century for Caleb Jewell, 100 and out for Wayne Madsen!Derbyshire continue to run amok at The County Ground – Caleb Jewell, easy as pie, turns a single to reach his double century, while Wayne MAdsen thunders to his 41st first-class hundred before holing out to long on. Derbyshire 482-3.The bumptious Somerset last pair have been dismissed for 172 – giving Durham a very useful 105-run first-innings lead.An impressive sixth-wicket partnership between Simpson (57) and Hudson-Prentice (51) has stretched to 117 and lifted Sussex into the lead.Sam Curran approaches fifty to inch Surrey towards parity at The Oval; Chris Rushworth is rolling back the years at New Road, Worcs 105-5, and Abbas, Pennington and Hutton are filletting through Yorkshire at Headingley, 107-7.Five wickets for Mitchell Killeen!Happy hunting for 20 year old Killeen, voted Durham’s second XI player of the year 2024. He dismissed Tom Lammonby late last night and has added another four this morning as Somerset dribble to 165-9 – 36 of whose have come from Pretorius and Henry, Nos 10 and 11.Rajitha has another Surrey man in his pocket, Overton for nought. No happy return for Jason Roy either, bowled for a seven-ball duck by Shane Snater. Surrey 145 for seven.At Grace Road, Tom Bailey replaces the expensive Phillip as Rehan and Hill make merry.Hill dispatches a half volley to the rope, and the Hill-Ahmed partnership races up to a hundred. Leicestershire 126-2, trial by 80.Essex have winkled out Sibley and Foakes this morning, both wickets to Rajitha. Sam Curran still there, 21 not out.I enjoyed this thoughful piece on Sam Cook by Andy Bull at Trent Bridge.Fifty for Rehan Ahmed!Leicestershire are flexing their muscles here: first Lewis Hill effortlesly lofts Will Williams just over the straight boundary and then Rehan Ahmed, mid leap, pistons two consecutive short balls from Anderson Phillip to the cover boundary for four. And, with a whisk off his boots, that’s fifty for Rehan: off 102 balls, seven fours – and picking up the pace.150 for Saif Zaib!What a great season he’s having, and such a handsome batsman to watch too. Northants 366-7.An interesting article from Will Macphereson on county clubs criticising umpiring decisions on social media. The ECB have warned that they could face sanctions. The Cricket Regulator advises that clubs shouldn’t “post negatively about officiating decisions”.Counties have been warned they could face sanctions via the Cricket Regulator if they criticise umpiring decisions on social media https://t.co/dA9bhSRCrL— Will Macpherson (@willis_macp) May 23, 2025 The clouds are closing in at Grace Road, the tall figure of Tom Bailey, running in from the pavilion end, just about visible through the gloom. Rehan Ahmed plays him back with perfect caution.A few early wickets round the grounds: at Chester le Street, James Rew is gone, lbw to James Raine; Yorkshire have lost James Wharton, caught at first slip, Taylor has removed Lewis McManus at Northampton and Chris Woakes is back amongst the wickets – trapping Jake Libby to remove Worcestershire’s lynchpin.Shubman Gill is India's new Test captainShubman Gill has succeeded Rohit Sharma as India’s Test captain. The best of luck to him, it’s quite the responsibility. Gill, 25, previously led India in five T20s, as well as being captain of IPL team Gujarat Titans.Heir to Rohit: Shubman Gill Photograph: Manish Swarup/APThis was interesting from John Turner last night: “Initially it felt horrendous bowling, the first two overs weren’t great, but it is always great to get some wickets and found some rhythm towards the end.“Every over I bowled, I bowled better. I ran in harder and hit the crease with more momentum. It is weird how a spell ebbs and flows like that.“It has been an interesting start to the season. It isn’t how I planned on it going, I wasn’t planning on going on loan but it served a good purpose for me and I enjoyed it.“I am slowly going in the direction I want to be going in and I think that is noticeable from the sidelines as well. It has been a weird few months.“I was in a really good place at the start of pre-season but there was a two week period where everything went south. It turned around pretty quickly. It is weird to think I made my England debut six months ago and then on loan trying to find some cricket after that.”On the (muggy) walk to the ground I saw a seagull, a solitary swift, wild roses and the British Gas museum. It rained here in the night but the groundstaff’s efforts mean that we are starting on time with Lancashire needing early wickets.Head to Grace Road for your homemade sugar fix (I recommend the cherry cake):Weather watchCloudy, with hit and miss scattered showers.Friday's round-up High spring hangs over this final May round of Championship cricket, the international summer pulling eyeballs away, the lack of rain leaving parched pitches.A good crowd collected on the apple-green benches sitting around the Grace Road boundary. They saw Lancashire get off to a steaming start thanks to Keaton Jennings and Luke Wells, but then fold in familiar fashion to patient Leicestershire bowling. Logan van Beek removed the two openers either side of lunch, finishing with three for 38, while Josh Hull found some devil in the dirt. Leicestershire lost two evening wickets, but Rehan Ahmed and Lewis Hill saw the day out. After his come-back game against Gloucestershire last week, Lancashire are without Jimmy Anderson – the club said that they were “managing his return to competitive cricket.”Durham won the toss at Chester le Street and chose to bat on a pitch that shuffled its uneven bounce that never quite let the batters settle. Ollie Robinson top scored with 52, while Matt Henry spearheaded Somerset’s attack, finishing with four wickets.Hampshire were pancaked for 154 at Southampton, Henry Crocombe taking four wickets in 11 balls in his first game of the season. John Turner then countered with three wickets in nine balls to leave Sussex with work to do. A Sam Cook-less Essex were sent packing in two sessions by a Surrey side including Sam Curran, who had zipped down from Trent Bridge where he had been watching brother Ben play for Zimbabwe on Thursday – Curran ended up being Cook’s first Test wicket. Michael Pepper held the Essex innings together with 75, but Surrey perch greedily, 94 for three at stumps.Saif Zaib’s charming 141, his highest first-class score, rescued Northants from 57 for four against Gloucestershire; while Caleb Jewell’s unbeaten 152, his first Derbyshire century, gave the Kent bowlers little time to rest.Marnus Labuschagne was contained by Middlesex, caught for 23, but Glamorgan’s Sam Northeast and Kiran Carlson rebuilt in a boundary-laden partnership of 228. Toby Roland-Jones finished with four wickets. A quizzical Headingley pitch tested Nottinghamshire, but Ben Slater and Joe Clarke made half-centuries. Tom Latham’s 59 and Sam Hain’s first half-century of the summer were balanced by four more wickets for Tom Taylor as Warwickshire were bowled out for 227.Scores on the doorsDivision OneChester-le-Street: Durham 277 v Somerset 63-3Southampton: Hampshire 154 v Sussex 110-5The Oval: Surrey 94-3 v Essex 217New Road: Worcestershire 53-0 v Warwickshire 227Headingley: Yorkshire 10-2 v Nottinghamshire 228Division TwoDerby: Derbyshire 352-2 v KentSophia Gardens: Glamorgan 334-7 v MiddlesexGrace Road: Leicestershire 59-2 v Lancashire 206County Ground: Northamptonshire 327-6 v GloucestershirePreambleHello from an overcast Leicester.
