There is a belief that, as someone steeped in the sport’s history, Kohli is keen to play at the Home of Cricket again.Alan Coleman, director of cricket at Middlesex, said: “Virat Kohli is the most iconic player of his generation, so of course we are interested in having that conversation.”Still contracted by the Board of Control for Cricket in India and playing in the Indian Premier League, Kohli is barred from featuring in domestic T20 cricket overseas, ruling him out of the Blast and the Hundred.

They then return in September for Division Two games against Derbyshire and Gloucestershire.Quick GuideIPL return and Kohli tribute washed outShowThe Indian Premier League match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Kolkata Knight Riders, which was to mark the tournament’s resumption after the India-Pakistan ceasefire, was abandoned without a ball being bowled, putting paid to plans for a tribute to mark Virat Kohli's retirement from Test cricket.With 12 matches left, the IPL was suspended on 9 May because of the conflict between India and Pakistan before a decision was taken to resume the tournament after a ceasefire. The final few matches will be played in Bengaluru, Jaipur, Delhi, Lucknow, Mumbai and Ahmedabad.Rain left Bengaluru fans disappointed as they had planned to transform the M Chinnaswamy Stadium into a sea of white to pay tribute to the India batting great Kohli, who announced his Test retirement last week. The 36-year-old, who brought down the curtain on a glorious 14-year career in the longest format, was set to make his first appearance since the announcement.The washout gave Bengaluru one point, taking them back to the top of the table, but they have not yet guaranteed a playoff spot. Bengaluru will still need one more win from their remaining two games to seal a berth in the top four, while sixth-placed Kolkata have been eliminated from the tournament. ReutersWere Kohli to play that final block of red-ball cricket, which also includes a game against Lancashire at Old Trafford and thus a possible reunion with Jimmy Anderson, it would form something of a fantasy middle-order partnership with Williamson. Even at the end of the season, Lord’s would expect this to a draw a bumper crowd.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionKohli has a home in London and has stated his interest in playing in the County Championship, signing for Surrey before India’s tour of England in 2018.
