Earlier on day two, India put their nose ahead by dismissing Usman Khawaja (21) and Nathan McSweeney (9) cheaply. No.3 Marnus Labuschagne (12) soon followed the openers to the dugout after perishing while attempting a booming cover drive six balls after a bail swap from Mohammed Siraj. Thereafter it was the Steve Smith-Travis Head show. Smith, entering the Test match battling a lean patch, bounced back to form with a hard-fought century, his 33rd, the second most by an Australia batter in the format. On the other hand, Head batted in his usual gung-ho fashion to score another big hundred, this time a 160-ball 152. Jasprit Bumrah, who picked up a six-wicket haul, was the lone warrior for India as the hosts stretched their total past 400. A passing shower interrupted the first session of play on day three and there’s a significant forecast for rain for the rest of the day. — Wisden (@WisdenCricket) December 15, 2024 Weather forecast for day 3, Brisbane Test match According to Google Weather, there's a 10 per cent chance of precipitation during playing hours on Monday.
