  "text": "Watch: In a show of anger following his dismissal in final innings of the second Test in Pune, India superstar batter Virat Kohli was seen smashing an ice box with his bat at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium on Saturday (October 26). Kohli's form has been marred with inconsistencies recently, averaging just 27.22 in Tests in 2024. After getting out cheaply in the first innings of the second Test against New Zealand for one, he failed to make a notable contribution in the second innings, getting out for 17. On his way back to the pavilion, he smashed an ice box with his bat before walking up the stairs India began Day Three on a positive note, bowling out New Zealand for 255, with the hosts adding only 57 to the overnight score. However, it was enough for New Zealand to set a humongous target of 359. Despite the tall order, India came out firing in the fourth innings, with Yashasvi Jaiswal scoring a quickfire 77 off 65 with nine fours and three sixes. Unfortunately, the left-hander received no support from the rest of the top order, with none of the top seven below Jaiswal getting past 25. Ravindra Jadeja provided some resistance towards the backend of the innings with a knock of 42 off 84. Nevertheless, it was too little too late as India were bowled out for 245 in 60.2 overs. New Zealand won the match by 113 runs and also bagged the series 2-0 with a game in hand. In 2024, Kohli has scored 245 runs in 10 innings with only one fifty. He will look to find his feet in the third Test in Mumbai as the Australia tour awaits later in the year.
