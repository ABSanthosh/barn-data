The contest started from the fourth over, which was Hazlewood's first as RCB was defending a 205-run total. Up against Jaiswal, Hazlewood started with three dot balls. One of the deliveries was a short ball that completely stunned Jaiswal. But Jaiswal made a brilliant comeback to hit three straight boundaries. Then in the final over of the Powerplay, Jaiswal struck two fours and six in the first four balls, before a slower one from Josh Hazelwood was miscued and went to mid-wicket for an easy catch. Jaiswal fell on 49.
