  "text": "Rothesay County Championship Division One, Ambassador Cruise Line Ground, Chelmsford (day three)Yorkshire 216 \u0026 426-6 dec: Lyth 185, Bairstow 79, Wharton 61; Thain 3-96Essex 123: Pepper 30; Hill 6-51, Coad 3-20 \u0026 64-4 White 3-17Essex (3 pts) need another 456 to beat Yorkshire (3 pts) with six wickets standingMatch scorecardAdam Lyth's patiently accumulated 185, and Jonny Bairstow's typically belligerent half-century, set Essex an unlikely 520 to prevent Yorkshire chalking up their second County Championship win of the season.Lyth's second century of the spring, the 39th of his 18-year first-class career, spanned six hours and 41 minutes of determination and obduracy. The 37-year-old left-hander shared a 153-run second-wicket stand with James Wharton, who added 61 to his unbeaten 63 from the first innings, that underpinned Yorkshire's 426-6 declared.The declaration was hastened by Bairstow's 79 from74 balls that included three sixes and was part of a roller-coaster sixth-wicket stand of 99 with Matty Revis, who contributed 37 off 32 balls. Bairstow, dropped on five by slip that would have enhanced Thain's analysis, played an unorthodox reverse sweep-cum-pull that sent a delivery from Critchley for six over point. With the declaration looming, Bairstow and Revis rattled off 29 runs in a 14-ball spree before the captain raced past his second half-century of the season with two sixes in the last over before tea from Shane Snater that also included a ramped four.Yorkshire batted on for 14 balls after tea before Bairstow holed out to long-on and immediately called a halt to proceedings.With Sam Cook rested in light of his potential England debut against Zimbabwe later this month, the Essex attack had lacked penetration. And the only consolation for Essex's dispirited fielders who circled the boundary by the end, were career-best bowling figures of 3-96 for young seamer Noah Thain.The sense of gathering despair continued when Essex batted. They lost four wickets in the 27 overs that remained in the day in the face of some accurate seam bowling from Jack White, who took 3-17. Essex eked out 64 runs by the close but, with 456 to win, are staring down the barrel of back-to-back defeats when they resume on day four.Their chances of batting out nearly four sessions became considerably slimmer when White got a delivery to jump up around Dean Elgar's adam's apple as early as the second over and it was fended off into third slip's hands.George Hill followed up his six-wicket haul from the first innings by trapping Tom Westley lbw with only his fourth delivery in the second. And next over Charlie Allison drove White uppishly to a tumbling mid-off while Robin Das nudged one to first slip.ECB Reporters' Network supported by Rothesay",
