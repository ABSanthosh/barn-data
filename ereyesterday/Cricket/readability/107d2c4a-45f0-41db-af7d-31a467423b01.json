That doesn't mean diversity of gender, but diversity of thought, coaching styles and points of difference.\"Led by former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, on his first tour as Lions head coach, the backroom team also includes ex-England spinner Graeme Swann, and former South Africa internationals Dale Steyn and Neil McKenzie.The squad departed on Wednesday for a training camp that will partly focus on white-ball skills, and conclude with a four-day match against South Africa A.Taylor will also work with an under-19 Young Lions squad in South Africa at the same time. That group includes Flintoff's son Rocky and Archie Vaughan, son of former England captain Michael.In 2013, Taylor held talks over playing for the Sussex men's second XI, though never featured in a match.Taylor made history in 2015 when she became the first woman to play Australian first-grade cricket, turning out for Northern Districts in Adelaide.She initially ended her playing her career in 2019, but came out of retirement to play one season in The Hundred for Welsh Fire in 2021.More on this story",
