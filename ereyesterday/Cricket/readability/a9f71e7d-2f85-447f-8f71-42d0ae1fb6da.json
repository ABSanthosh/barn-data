Barnard put the hat-trick ball away for a single but Durham continued to run through Warwickshire's top order, as Raine got his third with the last ball before lunch when Hamza Shaikh edged behind to Robinson for 23.However, Warwickshire had the perfect blend of experience and youth in the form of Smith and Barnard, who combined brilliantly for a partnership worth 147 to take the wind out of Durham's sails.Raine removed Smith before the Bears survived run-out mix-up when former Bears skippr Will Rhodes' throw went to the wrong end - but there was still another twist as Brendan Doggett orchestrated a fightback.Barnard got to his ton, only to depart next ball, with 54 still needed, caught down the leg side off Doggett, who then had Taz Ali caught behind.Booth was then bowled by Potts for a valiant 40 but, still needing 15 to win, Ethan Bamber and Vishwa Fernando remained calm and composed to see the visitors over the line. And Bamber finished it with a theatrical flourish, smashing a six down the ground off Raine.Warwickshire are back in action on Good Friday when they start their home game with Nottinghamshire at Edgbaston, while Durham are again at home for the derby clash with Yorkshire.Durham head coach Ryan Campbell told BBC Radio Newcastle:\"That's probably the best game I've seen in England since I've got here.\"People are going to umm and ahh about the declaration. We've always said we're going to risk everything to win a game of cricket, so you have to risk losing.\"They batted really, really well. We kept trucking in on what is a very flat wicket but it doesn't go our way. Next time it will. It's exciting moments for Durham cricket, watching our young lads doing really well.\"Ben McKinney will admit, coming into this game, he wasn't in the best of nick but sometimes you've just got to survive the first 20 to 30 balls. What we saw was a maturing young man who's starting to understand the game. He batted really well in the second innings as well when we kept losing wickets.\"Warwickshire centurion Ed Barnard told BBC Radio Newcastle:\"It's pretty incredible really, I'm pretty speechless right now. That sort of 45 minutes to an hour was as tense as it gets really.\"The way the Durham lads bowled out there was outstanding. Again Boothy and Bambs have been outstanding, Boothy's really stepping up. We've seen glimpses over the last year and to put in a performance like that is a really good sign.\"One thing we're massive at is bringing through the young players. We had four debutantslast week so everyone knows there's a bit of change going on. \"We've got some serious talent coming through and Kai Smith obviously proved that in both his innings, both were exceptional. And Taz has done a brilliant job as a spinner. Early season, it's never easy. He's kept the run rate and taken his wickets as well so he's going to be a huge asset.\"",
