Otherwise, the West Indies pair did enough to make the opening day of the series theirs. The 140-run fourth wicket stand between the pair revitalised West Indies' innings, adding pace to the overall scoring. It led to West Indies dominating proceedings for more than two sessions.Louis came agonizingly close to his maiden Test century, but fell on 97. Despite showing great restraint throughout his 218-ball stay, Louis spent 27 balls in the nineties before falling to Bangladesh stand-in captain Mehidy Hasan Miraz. Athanaze fell to Taijul Islam a few overs later, the second time he got out in the nineties in his short Test career.The Bangladesh bowlers would be disappointed that they couldn't hold back the Louis-Athanaze partnership after keeping West Indies' scoring rate in check in the first 54 overs. Taskin Ahmed took two wickets, while Taijul and Mehidy took one each, average returns overall despite Bangladesh choosing to bowl first at the toss.After the Louis-Athanaze pair fell to the spinners, Justin Greaves and Joshua Da Silva scored freely against the second new ball towards the end of the day. Play was called off after 84 overs when a drizzle started, while the light was not great either.Bangladesh's fast-bowling trio of Hasan Mahmud, Shoriful Islam and Taskin challenged West Indies early in the day, but Louis held his own. Hasan kept beating him outside the offstump. Shoriful tested him around the off-stump with the delivery always threatening to shape in. Taskin used the wobble seam, sometimes bowled the odd yorker, and pressing Louis to fish outside off-stump.Shoriful, who got more swing from the Sir Curtly Ambrose end than the Andy Roberts end, was playing his first Test since mid-August. He missed the previous five Tests but looked in tune with the red ball. He roubled Kraigg Brathwaite, who tried to dig in despite the runs not flowing from his bat. Louis meanwhile waited for the short ball, which got him two fours with the pull shot.Taskin then removed Brathwaite, trapping him lbw with a hint of inward movement that beat his bat. Taskin then had Keacy Carty caught at mid-on when he couldn't keep his wristy whip down, ending up as a tame dismissal. Brathwaite made four runs in 38 balls, while Carty ended on a eight-ball duck.Louis then found Kavem Hodge a little more forthcoming as they tried to rebuild the innings. The pair struck four boundaries before the lunch break, but then consolidated in the second session.Louis brought up his fifty when he struck Taskin with a punch down the ground for a boundary. Hodge then slapped Taskin with a square cut, but he wouldn't last too much longer. Attempting a second run off Mehidy's bowling, Hodge was run out for 25 after Taijul's throw from long leg had him well short despite a dive.Athanaze made efforts to push the run-rate but he was met with Bangladesh's continued discipline. In the afternoon, it was the spinners Mehidy and Taijul who kept things tight. Athanze skied a couple of balls that fell slightly away from the fielder's reach. One of them, a top edge towards mid-on could have become a catch had Taskin moved slightly faster from mid-on. Athanaze struck Mehidy with a sweep for four, but couldn't quite connect with his several reverse sweeps in the second session. Louis, who lifted Taskin for a four over the bowler's head towards the end of the second session, remained mostly quiet in his approach.Athanaze took the initiative to raise West Indies' scoring rate after tea. He started the the final session with two square-cut boundaries, before he finally got a four with a reverse sweep, off Mehidy.Louis then lofted Mehidy for the first six of the day, which took him into the eighties. Then, Mehidy dropped Louis at slip when he reached 90. Louis picked up Mahmud for his ninth boundary as he edged closer to his maiden century, while Athanaze opened up at the other end too.He swept Taijul before hitting Taskin for consecutive fours in the 71st over, cut and flicked away. Athanaze then slog-swept Taijul for his first six, and then came another reverse-swept boundary.Against the run of play, Mehidy removed Louis, charging at him, caught at slip where Shahadat Hossain took a good catch. Three overs later, Taijul had Athanaze caught behind. In the space of four runs, both batters were gone, allowing for a small opening come day two.Mohammad Isam is ESPNcricinfo's Bangladesh correspondent. @isam84Get latest cricket updates on WhatsApp",
