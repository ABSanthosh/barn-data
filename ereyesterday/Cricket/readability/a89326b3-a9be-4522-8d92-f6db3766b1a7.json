  "text": "India has informed the International Cricket Council it will not travel to the Champions Trophy, according to hosts Pakistan.Ongoing political tensions mean the two countries have not played each other outside of men's major tournaments since 2013, while India have not played in Pakistan for 16 years.Pakistan are due to host a global event for the first time since 1996 in February and March next year, the eight-team, 50-over Champions Trophy.But the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said the Board of Control for Cricket in India has told the ICC the India team will not cross the border.\"The PCB has received an email from the ICC, stating that the BCCI has informed them that their team will not travel to Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025,\" said a PCB spokesperson. \"The PCB has forwarded that email to the government of Pakistan for their advice and guidance.\"The tournament is due to begin in one hundred days, on 19 February. A schedule is still to be confirmed by the ICC.The ICC has not responded directly to the PCB statement but is in discussions with Pakistan and the other seven competing nations over a schedule. The BCCI has been asked for a response.One possible solution would be for a 'hybrid' staging of the tournament, with India playing its matches outside of Pakistan, possibly in the United Arab Emirates. A similar model was employed when Pakistan staged last year's Asia Cup.However, this throws up the possibility of uncertainty over where knockout matches would be played if India progress to the semi-finals.And, on Friday, chairman Mohsin Naqvi said the PCB is not prepared to accept a hybrid solution.Pakistan travelled to India to play in the 2016 T20 World Cup and 2023 50-over World Cup.Last month, any suggestion that the tournament could take place without India was dismissed by England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive Richard Gould.\"If you play the Champions Trophy without India or Pakistan, the broadcast rights aren't there, and we need to protect them,\" he said.\"There are a variety of different options available if those circumstances come along. This is a big moment for Pakistan, and hopefully we can have the fullest possible competition in Pakistan. If that's not possible, we know there are options available.\"Pakistan did not host any international cricket between 2009 and 2015 after gunmen attacked the Sri Lanka team 15 years ago.Former England assistant coach Paul Farbrace was part of the Sri Lanka staff and told BBC Sport Pakistan \"deserves to host international cricket\".\"I completely understand that historical events have muddied the water between the two countries, but the BCCI has to realise this is a bigger picture than whether or not they want to go to Pakistan,\" he added.\"In terms of sport, this is a fantastic opportunity for India to show it wants cricket to flourish, rather than saying 'no, we don't fancy going to Pakistan'. Every one of the big nations need to travel to all of the other countries in order to grow the game and in that respect, India has too much clout.\"Additional reporting by Henry Moeran",
