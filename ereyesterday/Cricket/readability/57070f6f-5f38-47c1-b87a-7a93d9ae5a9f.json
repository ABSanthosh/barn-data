It is the first time since 1992 Australia have lost a home ODI by nine wickets. They avoided becoming the first Australian team to lose a white-ball match at home by 10 wickets when Adam Zampa ended the 137-run opening stand.“It wasn’t one of our best days,” Pat Cummins said of the heavy loss. “You hope to get more than 160 [but] they bowled well. We got some catchers in, tried to attack, but it wasn’t to be.” Pakistan’s Ayub said: “I’ve been bowling here for the Melbourne Stars, I know the pitch, I know the length. I just wanted to get the breakthrough.”Pakistan’s stunning triumph gives them a huge opportunity to win the three-match series, with Test stars Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne to sit out Sunday’s deciding game in Perth. Those five won’t make the trip so they can prepare for the upcoming battle for the Border-Gavaskar trophy against India. Wicketkeeper Josh Inglis, who will captain Australia for the first time in Cummins’ absence, Glenn Maxwell and Zampa will be the only members of last year’s World Cup final side to play at Optus Stadium.Pakistan’s first ODI win against Australia at the Adelaide since 1996 was set up by tearaway quick Haris Rauf, who demolished the middle order. Rauf, who has been a popular figure in the Big Bash League for the Melbourne Stars since 2020, picked up where he left off at the MCG when the Pakistan captain, Mohammad Rizwan, won the toss and opted to bowl.Quick GuideAustralia’s biggest ODI losses, by wicketsShow10 wickets v New Zealand, Wellington 20079 wickets v West Indies, SCG 19849 wickets v West Indies, Kingston 19849 wickets v South Africa, SCG 19929 wickets v West Indies, Waca 19929 wickets v Pakistan, Rawalpindi 19949 wickets v West Indies, St George’s 20039 wickets v England, Headingley 20059 wickets v India, Jaipur 20139 wickets v Pakistan, Lahore 20229 wickets v Pakistan, Adelaide Oval 2024The 31-year-old gave Pakistan a chance of a shock victory on Monday with three for 67, before Cummins steered Australia home by two wickets. But Rauf (five for 29) went to another level in Adelaide with his second five-wicket haul in ODIs, dismissing Inglis, Labuschagne, Aaron Hardie and Maxwell as Australia collapsed from 79 for two to 129 for seven.The fiery right-armer also claimed Cummins’ scalp to end any chance Australia had of posting a competitive total.
