  "text": "The India team was seen wearing black armbands during the second day of the Boxing Day Test between Australia and India. On day two of the ongoing Test, the Indian team walked out to field, with Australia resuming their innings on 311-6. Steve Smith and Pat Cummins were the two unbeaten batters at the crease. Rohit Sharma and team walked out to the packed MCG wearing black armbands. It was apparent, and soon confirmed, that they were added in the honour of India's former prime minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, who passed away on Thursday night in New Delhi at the age of 92. He had been admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in the late hours of Thursday, where he later died. Dr Manmohan Singh was one of India's longest-serving prime minister from 2004 to 2014, as part of the UPA (United Progressive Alliance)'s leadership in the central government. Formerly the finance minister of the country, Manmohan was at the forefront of India's economic liberalisation in 1991. Several Indian cricketers shared their tributes on social media for the former prime minister. Fans in India would have vivid memories of Manmohan Singh in attendance for the India-Pakistan semi-final during the 2011 World Cup, having invited, and sat next to Pakistan PM Yousuf Raza Ghilani at the PCA stadium in Mohali at a time when political relations between the two countries were considered rocky. The series is level 1-1 going into the MCG Test, with one more Test to go in Sydney. Follow Wisden for all cricket updates, including live scores, match stats, quizzes and more.
