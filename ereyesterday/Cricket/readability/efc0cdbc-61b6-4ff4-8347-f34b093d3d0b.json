  "text": "England have 'got to' pick Archer, says AndersonImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, James Anderson was in the England team the last time Jofra Archer played a Test, in 2021England have \"got to\" play Jofra Archer in the third Test against India at Lord's, says James Anderson.The pace bowler is in line to play his first Test for more than four years after a string of injuries.The 30-year-old's route back to fitness has been almost exclusively in white-ball cricket. He made his red-ball comeback for Sussex against Durham in the County Championship two weeks ago, bowling 18 overs.Anderson, England's all-time leading wicket-taker, told the Tailenders podcast: \"You could keep trying to build his overs up and play him later in the series, but it could be too late by then.\"Anderson was part of the England team when Archer last played a Test, against India in Ahmedabad in 2021.The 42-year-old has since retired from Test cricket and spent time on the England coaching staff as a fast-bowling consultant.Archer returned to the England squad for the second Test at Edgbaston, which India won by 336 runs to level the series at 1-1. The third Test begins on Thursday.\"I think he will play,\" said Anderson.\"He's played one game for Sussex, he was around the team at Edgbaston and bowled a bit. I just feel like you've got to play him. It's too crucial a game not to.\"Media caption, 'Whatever they do, it's a risk' - Vaughan on England's bowling dilemmaEngland head coach Brendon McCullum said Archer is \"ready to go\" and will \"come into calculations\".Archer's return could come as part of a refresh of an England attack that looked weary in conceding scores of 587 and 427-6 declared at Edgbaston. India's match total of 1,014 was the fourth-highest amount of runs scored by one team in a single Test.Chris Woakes could be retained, partly because of an excellent record at Lord's, where he has taken 32 wickets at an average of 12.90. If Woakes is omitted, Sam Cook would be the most like-for-like replacement in the England squad.Brydon Carse and Josh Tongue seem more likely to be rested, especially as the Durham bowler has been struggling with foot problems.Archer would take one spot, leaving another for Gus Atkinson or Jamie Overton. Atkinson is back in the squad after suffering a hamstring injury against Zimbabwe in May but may not be ready for this Test, leaving Surrey team-mate Overton in line for his second Test cap, three years after his first.\"Whatever England go with, it's a huge risk,\" said former England captain Michael Vaughan.\"I would have loved to see Archer play a bit more cricket. England believe he has done enough in terms of workload.\"More on this story",
