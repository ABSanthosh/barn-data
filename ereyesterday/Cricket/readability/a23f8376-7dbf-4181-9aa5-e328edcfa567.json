  "text": "England have confirmed they will play Afghanistan in the upcoming Champions Trophy despite pressure to boycott the fixture in response to the Taliban’s violation of women’s rights in the country.Last month a cross-party group of 160 British MPs wrote to the England and Wales Cricket Board urging it to withdraw the men’s national team from the group stage match in Lahore on 26 February.But following an ECB board meeting on Thursday, the chair, Richard Thompson, gave the green light for Jos Buttler’s side to play the match and instead urged the International Cricket Council (ICC) to take collective action.Thompson said: “What is happening in Afghanistan is nothing short of gender apartheid. At a cricketing level, when women’s and girls’ cricket is growing rapidly around the world, it is heartbreaking that those growing up in Afghanistan are denied this opportunity, but the appalling oppression of women and girls by the Taliban goes so much further.“The board recognises there are different views and opinions on the issue of boycotting the match and has listened carefully. We have been in close contact with the government, the International Cricket Council, our England men’s players and other stakeholders to discuss this matter, as well as considering how best the ECB can support those women cricketers who have fled Afghanistan.“Following this, we remain of the view that a coordinated international response by the cricketing community is the appropriate way forward, and will achieve more than any unilateral action by the ECB in boycotting this match. We have also heard that for many ordinary Afghans watching their cricket team is one of the few remaining sources of enjoyment. As such, we can confirm that we will play this fixture.”While Afghanistan are the only ICC full member not to run a programme for women’s cricket, recent diplomatic dialogue between the Indian government and the Taliban – talks that reportedly included strengthening sporting ties – means their removal from cricket’s top table is unlikely.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionInstead, the ECB is calling for the ICC to divert money towards the female Afghani cricketers in exile – the majority of whom fled to Australia – and recognise them as a refugee national team. Last week a fund for those players was established by the MCC Foundation, with the ECB making an initial £100,000 donation.",
