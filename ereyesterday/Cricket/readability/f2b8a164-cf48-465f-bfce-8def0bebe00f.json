  "text": "ICC Champions Trophy Group A, KarachiNew Zealand 320-5 (50 overs): Latham 118* (104), Young 107 (113); Naseem 2-63Pakistan 260 (47.2 overs): Khushdil 69 (49), Babar 64 (90); O'Rourke 3-47New Zealand won by 60 runsScorecardCenturies from Tom Latham and Will Young set New Zealand on their way to a convincing 60-run win over hosts Pakistan in the opening game of the Champions Trophy.The Black Caps were put in to bat in Karachi and, despite losing three early wickets, kept their composure in a superbly-paced innings to post 320-5.Opener Young, only playing because of an injury to Rachin Ravindra, set the tone on his way to a 107-ball century, and put on 118 with Latham for the fourth wicket.Test skipper Latham pushed on to complete his own hundred from 95 balls and after sharing a stand of 125 with Glenn Phillips (61 off 39 balls), eventually finished unbeaten on 118 from 104 balls.Pakistan's chase only really kicked into gear once the game was lost.After a painfully slow start, Phillips' stunning one-handed catch at backward point to dismiss Muhammad Rizwan left them 22-2 at the end of the powerplay.The required rate was just shy of 10 an over by the time Salman Ali Agha came in and showed some intent, but his 42 from 28 balls only kept it at that mark - and once he was dismissed it soon began to rise again.Babar Azam, who had been kept quiet early in his innings, briefly tried to pick up where Agha left off but fell to Mitchell Santner for 64 before Khushdil Shah gave the locals a glimmer of hope with a counter-attacking 69 from 49.He holed out off Will O'Rourke, who claimed 3-47, and the defending champions were bowled out for 260 in the 48th over.Another global tournament is upon us and, once again, New Zealand provided a reminder they are not to be underestimated.It has been 29 long years since Pakistan last hosted an ICC event but while it was a moment to savour and enjoy, it was the Black Caps left celebrating at the end - victory ensured with a minimum of fuss.They lost the toss, were put in and quickly lost three of their top four - including talisman Kane Williamson, caught behind after a beauty from Naseem Shah, for one - but there was no sense of panic.Young just continued to bat as he had from the start, calmly rotating the strike and punishing the bad balls in a knock that screamed sensible cricket.There was more attacking intent from Latham late in the innings but through the middle overs, he was happy to follow Young's lead.This was not the T20 approach stretched over 50 overs as seems to have become the strategy employed by others but an almost old-fashioned ODI innings based around steady scoring through the middle overs, wickets in hand and a barnstorming final 10 overs.Young had reached his fourth ODI hundred and departed before the late onslaught but the Black Caps could hardly have planned for a better situation than Phillips striding to the crease with 12.4 overs remaining.While Latham moved through the gears to reach his eighth ODI ton, Phillips plundered three fours and four sixes in a typically destructive knock that capped a wonderfully paced New Zealand innings.By contrast, Pakistan failed to find the required balance in the chase as they started at a glacial pace and, ultimately, left themselves too much to do.Given the ease in which their lower order managed to clear the ropes as the innings progressed, Rizwan's side will be ruing that slow start with their semi-final hopes already hanging by a thread.Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan: \"They put a good target on the board - we didn't expect 320.\"The partnerships were crucial and we tried our best, but they played very smartly.\"Every match is important for us. If you look at us being defending champions that's extra pressure on us.\"Player of the match, New Zealand's Tom Latham: \"Will Young played fantastically well and the longer we batted together, we went through the gears and increased the run-rate.\"With these types of surfaces and boundaries you can make hay at the back end. Glenn Phillips played an exceptional hand and continued the momentum and the score we got was well above par.\"Pakistan face India in their next game in Dubai on Sunday knowing that another defeat would likely end their chances of progressing from the group.Meanwhile, New Zealand are back in action on Monday when they take on Bangladesh in Rawalpindi.Two-time winners India begin their campaign against Bangladesh on Thursday.The Group A match will take place in Dubai after India told the International Cricket Council that they would not travel to Pakistan for the tournament amid ongoing political tensions between the two countries.Group B gets under way with South Africa taking on Afghanistan on Friday before England and Australia renew rivalries on Saturday.",
