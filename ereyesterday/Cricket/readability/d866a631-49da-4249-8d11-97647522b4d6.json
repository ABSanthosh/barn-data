  "text": "Virat, who?There is a reason Ben Stokes has been trying to banish talk of Australia.The eye kept firmly fixed on the next Ashes series is English cricket's biggest weakness - one that occasionally borders on obsession.Stokes wanted to ensure none of that distraction reached his dressing room because, long before it was laid bare by the hosts' toil on day one of the five-Test series against India in Leeds, he knew the size of the challenge his side's current opponents will pose over the next six weeks.Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin may have retired, taking with them 296 Tests worth of experience and enough runs and wickets to fuel a country, but India's next generation are here and ready.Stokes and England must already be sick of Yashasvi Jaiswal.The 23-year-old may look no older than the university freshers who fill the terraced streets around Headingley but the batter who lived in a groundsman's tent as a 10-year-old has quickly become England's scourge.In India's 4-1 home series win against Stokes' men last year, Jaiswal piled up 712 runs and sent their greatest bowler James Anderson into early retirement.In Rajkot he hit three consecutive sixes off Anderson, the first a thrillingly inventive slog sweep over deep square leg.This classy 101 from 159 balls was a total contrast - an innings that would have pleased Yorkshire and England great Sir Geoffrey Boycott watching on.Jaiswal may be an Indian Premier League megastar but he began slowly before growing in intent to crash England's bowlers through the off side. England targeted the pads from over the wicket but that angle only aided his strengths as he scored 92 of his runs through the off side.Jaiswal now has centuries in his first Test and first innings in both Australia and England - the two destinations where all Indian batters are judged most - while no-one from the world's cricketing superpower can match his haul of 1,899 runs after 20 Tests.The talk before this match was about how India replace the run machine that was Kohli, the defining cricketer of the past decade who stepped away after giving the format 9,230 runs, 30 centuries and everything more.Yet Jaiswal already has 15 scores of 50 or more to his name, four more than Kohli at the same stage. At this point the great Sachin Tendulkar had only eight.The wisest heads are already pondering whether Jaiswal is India's greatest left-hander. Should he continue unchecked, he will keep company with the greatest of them all.While Jaiswal bounded around Headingley in celebrating three figures, India's second century was met with a roaring release of emotion.Shubman Gill, the player of the tournament at the Under-19 World Cup and an IPL debutant at 18, has been groomed for this role since he was a teen.As he timed Josh Tongue through the covers - a shot that epitomised this procession to a first Test century outside of Asia - he took a moment before feelings from all of those days, weeks and years of waiting came bursting out.Gill may be the perfect India captain for their new era.While Rohit Sharma, Kohli and MS Dhoni before him were captains who began their careers before the IPL's explosion, Gill has grown up alongside it to the point occasions such as these must feel like a hit in the local park.What is a Test match in front of 20,000 in West Yorkshire when you have captained your franchise before 100,000 at the world's biggest sporting stadium?That is not to say Gill's ascension will diminish the Test game.Kohli fought against the strongest tides to promote the longest format during his career and Gill has begun in a similar vein.On Thursday he said winning this series would be bigger than anything the IPL could offer. His celebration suggested those words were not merely spoken to please.An elegant cover drive and a ferocious fitness regime are other similarities between Gill and Kohli. Their differences are stark too.The pristine Kohli would never bat with black socks - club players receive fines for less - and a badly matching undershirt as Gill did on Friday, nor would he joke with the media as Gill did 24 hours earlier.\"I wouldn't be telling you any tips one day before the match,\" Gill said with an endearing smile when asked to share any advice his predecessors gave before this series.He may not have the aura of Kohli but Gill exudes a softly-spoken calmness.In his first knock as skipper, Gill's false shot percentage was a mere 8.5% throughout his 175 balls, making this the most serene innings by an Indian in England since 2006. There was a miscalculated call for a run where an Ollie Pope hit would have run out the diving India captain on one but afterwards Gill's pre-match calmness was reflected in the middle.It is folly to draw too many conclusions from one day in the sun.England's understrength bowling attack lacked threat in the Leeds sunshine but Chris Woakes will not be as generous in offering boundary chances again.KL Rahul and Jaiswal saw off the new ball but on another day their edges in the opening overs go to hand.It is clear, though, that any fears for India after the retirements of Kohli and Rohit were misplaced.A band of IPL rockstars - frontman Jasprit Bumrah is yet to be seen and Rishabh Pant played only a quick cameo - have the chance to go one better than Rohit and Kohli, who both retired without the series win in England they craved.England knew it and day one of this series proved it. India's future is already here.",
