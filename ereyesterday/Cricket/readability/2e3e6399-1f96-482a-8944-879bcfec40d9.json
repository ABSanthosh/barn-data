With five game remaining, the Pat Cummins-led side needs to win at least three more in order remain in the qualification mix. With some important fixtures to be held at home, SRH need to go on an unbeaten run from here on if they are to really boost their hopes of a top four finish in the league stage.If Hyderabad win all of their remaining matches, their qualification chances would not need to depend on other teams' results. However, a single defeat here would make the scenario quite a tricky one for them.SRH's Remaining matches:May 2 - vs Gujarat Titans (Away)May 5 - vs Delhi Capitals (Home)May 10 - vs Kolkata Knight Riders (Home)May 13 - vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru (Away)May 18 - vs Lucknow Super Giants (Away)Chennai Super Kings arrived in the match against Sunrisers Hyderabad with 2 wins in 7 games, putting them in the same equation as their opponents.
