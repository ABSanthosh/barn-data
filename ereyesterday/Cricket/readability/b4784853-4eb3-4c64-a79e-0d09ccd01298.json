  "text": "Pakistan completed a 2-1 ODI series win over Zimbabwe in Bulawayo today (November 28). Here are the marks out of 10 for the touring side for the series. Saim Ayub - 9 3 matches, 155 runs at 77.50, HS: 113*3 wickets at 19.00, BBI: 2-29 Ayub scored his maiden international hundred in the second match of the series, and was given the Player of the Match award. It was a rapid knock, coming off just 53 balls - the second-fastest in the format by a Pakistan batter. While he only made starts in the other two games, Pakistan will be hopeful the innings will be the springboard Ayub needs in his international career. Kamran Ghulam - 8 3 matches, 120 runs at 94.48, HS: 1031 wicket at 7.00, BBI: 1-7 One of two innings from Ghulam in this series was a century in the final game. In a must-win match to seal the series, his maiden ODI ton saw them to a comfortable win by 99 runs. He also took a wicket in the second of his only two overs in the series. Mohammad Rizwan - 5 3 matches, 56 runs at 56.00, HS: 37 Captaining the series in Babar Azam's absence, it was a middling series for the keeper-batter. He got stuck during a 43-ball 19 as wickets fell around him in the first match of the series which Pakistan lost. While he contributed with a 47-ball 37 in the last game, he was far from his free-flowing best. Abdullah Shafique - 7 3 matches, 83 runs at 41.50, HS: 50 Aside from being part of a collapse in the first game, Shafique made valuable contributions in both of the second two games. He sat back and played the anchor role as Ayub shone in the second match, and scored a valuable half-century in the third. Agha Salman - 7 3 matches, 6 wickets at 16.83, BBI: 3-2634 runs at 17.00, HS: 30 Six wickets in the series are a positive return for Salman, and he was the pick of the Pakistan attack. He conceded just 26 runs in the second game from his seven overs, along with taking thee wickets. Irfan Khan - 2 3 matches, 10 runs at 5.00, HS: 7 Irfan made little to no impact in the series. He was dismissed for single figures in both of his innings and while he got a jaffa from Sean Williams in the first, he fell to his own error in the second. Haseebullah Khan - 1 1 match, 0 runs at 0, HS: 0 Haseebullah was dismissed for a duck in the only match before he was dropped from the side. Tayyab Tahir - 5 2 matches, 29 runs at 0.00, HS: 29* Having played two matches in the series, Tayyab's only contribution was constructing a useful partnership of 20 off nine balls with Aamer Jamal at the end of Pakistan's innings in the third ODI. As a result, Pakistan's total was pushed above 300. Aamer Jamal - 6 3 matches, 3 wickets at 28.33, BBI: 2-19 A decent return for Jamal on spin friendly decks. He assisted the spinners in blowing through Zimbabwe's middle order in the final game, and his economy for the series was more than decent at 5.31. Abrar Ahmed - 8 2 matches, 6 wickets at 13.00, BBI: 4-33 Abrar was part of the trio of wicket-taking spinners in the series for Pakistan. His 4-33 in the second match - his ODI debut - put Pakistan back on track after their opening loss, and he contributed with 2-45 in the final game. Faisal Akram - 7.5 3 matches, 5 wickets at 16.00, BBI: 3-24 In his first ODI series, Akram found significant success. He was the pick of the bowlers in the first game and made valuable contributions in the second two. Haris Rauf - 5.5 3 matches, 3 wickets at 32.00, BBI: 2-34 Slightly below average returns for Rauf in unhelpful conditions, but he still had some decent results. He took the final wicket of the series to seal the result in the last game, taking 2-34 in 7.1 overs in that match. Mohammad Hasnain - 3 1 match, 1 wicket at 43.00, BBI: 1-43 Hasnain was only included in the first match of the series before he was left out. He took one wicket (Richard Ngarava), and conceded 43 runs. Follow Wisden for all cricket updates, including live scores, match stats, quizzes and more.
