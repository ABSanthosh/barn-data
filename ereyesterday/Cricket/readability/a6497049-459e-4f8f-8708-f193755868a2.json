The next highest score on debut is 127. The highest score in a women's ODI on debut is 136 not out and was made by USA's Chetna Pagydyala against Zimbabwe last October. Breetzke, who has played one Test and 10 T20s for South Africa, opened the batting and was dismissed in the 46th over by Matt Henry.The 26-year-old is not part of South Africa's squad for the Champions Trophy, which starts on 19 February, and is playing in a weakened squad as the Proteas balance workload after their franchise T20 tournament, the SA20, concluded on Saturday. He was supported by Wiaan Mulder (64) and Jason Smith (41), while seamers Matt Henry and Will O'Rourke both picked up two wickets for New Zealand.New Zealand's successful chase was built on a second-wicket stand of 187 between Devon Conway and Kane Williamson.Conway made 97 from 107 balls and the Kiwis needed 68 from 87 balls when he picked out point off Junior Dala. Daryl Mitchell and Tom Latham, who was out first ball, fell shortly after but Williamson guided New Zealand home with an unbeaten 133 off 113 balls.He hit a four to seal the victory and moved to 7,000 ODI runs in doing so. He has reached the landmark in 169 innings, second to only South Africa's Hashim Amla (150 innings). The win secures New Zealand's place in Friday's tri-series final, and they will be joined by the winner of Wednesday's game between Pakistan and South Africa.",
