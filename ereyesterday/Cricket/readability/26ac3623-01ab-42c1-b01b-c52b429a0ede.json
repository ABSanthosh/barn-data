  "text": "The 2024 Wisden Cricket Photograph of the Year competition in partnership with Flashback is now open for entries. The contest is open to all photographers, amateur or professional, from anywhere in the world. It remains free to enter. The only stipulations are that images must have a cricketing theme and have been taken during the 2024 calendar year. The competition aims to promote and sustain cricket in all of its forms in every corner of the globe, from an international match played in front of thousands, to a game between children on the street. Arjun Singh won last year’s competition for his image of Sanju Samson, Shimron Hetmyer and Dhruv Jurel colliding as they attempted to catch batter Wriddhiman Saha in the 2023 IPL match between Rajasthan Royals and Gujarat Titans. The judges said that “the figures compose so well in what is a deservedly winning photograph”. You can see his photograph, along with the two runners-up, here. The best images in the 2024 competition will appear as the first three colour photographs in the 2025 edition of Wisden Cricketers’ Almanack. The winner will receive £1,000, and the two runners-up £400 each. The top three amateur photographers from this year's competition will all also take home a Flashback One35 camera. The three winning images, together with seven shortlisted photographs, will be publicly displayed for up to twelve months in a gallery in the entrance area below the Galadari stand at The Kia Oval cricket ground. The independent judging panel will be chaired by Chris Smith, former chief sports photographer of The Sunday Times. Also on the panel are the acclaimed cricket photographer Patrick Eagar; filming and photography manager Clare Adams; and Nigel Davies, the former art director of The Wisden Cricketer. The editor of Wisden Cricketers’ Almanack, Lawrence Booth, said: “It's always a thrill to see what gems have been unearthed by cricket's many skilled and dedicated photographers, and I'm sure 2024 will be no different. We are very much looking forward to seeing the entries.” We're really excited to be partnering with Flashback Cameras this year. Flashback's reusable camera brings the disposable film look into the digital age, making analogue photography simple, fun and sustainable. It has the look, feel, and function of a disposable camera—complete with a viewfinder, winder, bright Xenon flash and only takes 27 photos at a time—but it’s digital and connects straight to an app on your phone. Please click here to read more about Flashback's products. Entries, to a maximum of three per person, must be submitted online at: www.wisden.com/photographoftheyear. There is no fee for entering. The closing date for entries is 23:59 GMT on Sunday January 5, 2025. Winners will be announced in March 2025.

Prizes The winning photograph and two runner-up images will be reproduced as the first three images in the colour section of the 2025 Wisden Cricketers’ Almanack, a copy of which will be provided to each of the top three photographers. The prize for the winning photograph is £1,000 and a copy of the 2025 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. Two runners-up will each receive £400, plus a copy of the 2025 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack each.
