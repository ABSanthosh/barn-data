The Indian conglomerate are in line to be the first investor in the Hundred sales process to buy the entire stake in a Hundred franchise, by acquiring both the England and Wales Cricket Board’s 49% share as well as the 51% gifted to the host county, Yorkshire in this case.Yorkshire confirmed on Wednesday evening that they have entered a period of exclusivity with Sun Group for the sale of shares in the Superchargers, with a completed deal to prompt a significant and much-needed windfall for the county. Colin Graves, the club chairman, urged last year for the club to demutualise to protect its financial future, with more than £20m owed to the Graves family.The Guardian reported last month that those demutualisation plans had been paused as the club focused on the Hundred auction, with Sunrisers linked as a possible partner. Yorkshire’s chief executive, Sanjay Patel, confirmed that discussions with Sun Group have been ongoing.“We are delighted to be entering into an exclusivity period with the Sun Group, and will be continuing our conversations with them in the coming weeks with a view to setting the Northern Superchargers up for long‑term and sustained success,” said Patel, who was the managing director of the Hundred before leaving the ECB in 2023.“Having been in consultation with them for some time now, it is clear that they are aligned to the values and future direction of the club and will play a huge part in ensuring we can go on to achieve great success in the coming years.“Today is clearly a huge milestone for Yorkshire CCC, the Northern Superchargers and the Sun Group, but it is worth stressing that there is a lot of detail to be discussed alongside further due diligence and legal processes before a contract can be signed.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThe intervention of Sun Group means three of the six teams in the Hundred sales process so far have attracted investment from IPL franchise owners. Reliance, the owner of Mumbai Indians, and RPSG Group, which runs Lucknow Super Giants, have agreed stakes in Oval Invincibles and Manchester Originals, respectively. GMR Group, the co-owner of Delhi Capitals, took over Hampshire last year and appears set to take control of the team based at the Utilita Bowl, Southern Brave.Trent Rockets are another team still up for sale and a fluid process means their date for auction remains unconfirmed.Sunrisers Hyderabad have won the IPL once, while Sun Group also owns Sunrisers Eastern Cape, who won the first two editions of the SA20. “[Sunrisers Hyderabad] bring significant expertise in building high‑performance environments, brand and digital and the partnership is expected to supercharge the success of the team, and Yorkshire Cricket, in the coming years,” Yorkshire said in the statement.",
