  "text": "Andre Russell is a two-time T20 World Cup Champion.© AFP West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell has retired from international cricket. The opening two games of West Indies five-match T20I series against Australia at home are set to be his last games for the team. Russell, 37, has been included in the squad for the five-match series, and the first two matches, taking place at his home ground of Sabina Park in Jamaica, will serve as his farewell to international cricket. Windies Cricket revealed the news of his retirement with a tribute post.  “Words cannot explain what it meant. To represent the West Indies has been one of the proudest achievements in my life. When I was a kid, I did not expect to get to this level, but the more you start to play and get to love the sport, you realize what you can achieve. This inspired me to become better because I wanted to leave a mark in the maroon colours and become an inspiration to others,” Russell said in a statement“I love playing for the West Indies and I love playing at home in front of my family and friends where I get to showcase my talent and produce more high-quality performances. I want to finish my international career on a high while being a role model for the next generation of cricketers coming out of the Caribbean.” — Windies Cricket (@windiescricket) July 16, 2025Since 2019, Russell has been an exclusively T20I player for his country.
