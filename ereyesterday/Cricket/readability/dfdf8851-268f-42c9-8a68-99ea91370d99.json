  "text": "The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has been urged to boycott next month’s Champions Trophy match against Afghanistan by a group of more than 160 politicians, including Nigel Farage, Jeremy Corbyn and Lord Kinnock.The England men’s ODI side are due to face Afghanistan in Lahore on 26 February but there are calls from Westminster for the ECB to refuse the fixture, taking a stand against the Taliban regime’s ongoing assault on women’s rights.Female participation in sport has effectively been outlawed since the Taliban’s return to power in 2021, a move that puts the Afghanistan Cricket Board in direct contravention of International Cricket Council (ICC) rules, which require full members to organise a women’s national team.With Afghanistan’s men’s team still allowed to compete by the ICC despite the women’s side being disbanded in 2021, a strongly worded letter has emerged from parliament pleading for the ECB to make its own moral objection.Written by the Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi and signed by a wide cross-party group from the House of Commons and House of Lords, it raises concerns over the “insidious dystopia” and “sex apartheid” unfolding in Afghanistan.The statement, addressed to the ECB chief executive, Richard Gould, concludes: “We strongly urge the England men’s team players and officials to speak out against the horrific treatment of women and girls in Afghanistan under the Taliban.“We also urge the ECB to consider a boycott of the upcoming match against Afghanistan … to send a clear signal that such grotesque abuses will not be tolerated. We must stand against sex apartheid and we implore the ECB to deliver a firm message of solidarity and hope to Afghan women and girls that their suffering has not been overlooked.”Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi wrote the letter to the ECB, which was co-signed by more than 160 fellow UK politicians. Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PAGould issued a swift response, reaffirming the ECB’s principles while suggesting it favoured a uniform approach from all ICC member nations rather than acting alone. “The ECB strongly condemns the treatment of women and girls in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime,” he said.“The ICC constitution mandates that all member nations are committed to the growth and development of women’s cricket. In line with this commitment, the ECB has maintained its position of not scheduling any bilateral cricket matches against Afghanistan,” he continued.“While there has not been a consensus on further international action within the ICC, the ECB will continue to actively advocate for such measures. A coordinated, ICC-wide approach would be significantly more impactful than unilateral actions by individual members.“We acknowledge and respect the diverse perspectives on this global issue,” Gould added. “We understand the concerns raised by those who believe a boycott of men’s cricket could inadvertently support the Taliban’s efforts to suppress freedoms and isolate Afghan society.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“It’s crucial to recognise the importance of cricket as a source of hope and positivity for many Afghans, including those displaced from the country. The ECB is committed to finding a solution that upholds the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan while also considering the broader impact on the Afghan people.”In conclusion, Gould wrote: “We will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the UK government, other stakeholders, the ICC, and other international cricket boards to explore all possible avenues for meaningful change.”The situation brings back memories of the 2003 World Cup, when Nasser Hussain’s England side forfeited a game against Zimbabwe in protest at Robert Mugabe’s regime, with politicians advocating for the move without stepping in to make the decision on the squad’s behalf.The ECB and Cricket Australia have stated that their men’s teams will not currently face Afghanistan in bilateral series – matches between two nations across different formats. This stance does not currently extend to include matches against Afghanistan in tournaments.England will also face Australia in Lahore, and South Africa in Karachi, in Group B of next month’s Champions Trophy tournament in Pakistan. India will play all of their matches in Dubai after refusing to travel to Pakistan over security concerns.",
