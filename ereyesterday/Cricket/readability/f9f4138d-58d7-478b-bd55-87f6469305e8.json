Pakistan ended the day on 73 for three in reply.“You can have your gameplan before the game but it’s adapting to the surface provided,” Smith said. “The people who batted first and got out came and gave advice about what might work. It’s just being clear how you want to go about things. You’re not thinking about the game situation, you’re thinking about how you can impose your skills.”One piece of information that was fed back to the dressing room was that the sweep, a shot England were perhaps overreliant on during last week’s second Test, was, on this surface, a difficult and dangerous option. “We had a bit of a laugh about that,” Smith said. “When Ben Duckett is saying it’s tough to sweep, then it probably is near on impossible.”Sajid Khan, who added six wickets to the nine he took in Multan last week, denied the wicket made life easy for the bowlers. “There were some good balls, but also poor shots from them,” he said. “Wickets don’t get given to you here. You have to vary the pace, use the crease, and that’s how I got my wickets.”Pakistan’s Sajid Khan reacts after taking his fifth England wicket. Photograph: Anjum Naveed/APSmith said England were “pretty pleased with the position we’re in” given how difficult batting could become as the game progresses. “The low bounce will make it harder,” he said. I can’t see it bouncing any more – it’s only going to get lower. When you feel the pitch is going to deteriorate as the game goes on, every first-innings run is vital.”",
