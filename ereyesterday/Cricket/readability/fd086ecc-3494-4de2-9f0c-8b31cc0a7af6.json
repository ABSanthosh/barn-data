  "text": "Dubai has been chosen as a neutral venue for India to play their matches at next year's Champions Trophy, the Pakistan Cricket Board has announced. The eight-team tournament in February and March is being held in Pakistan, who said earlier this month that India had told the International Cricket Council the team would not travel to the country to play in the event.As part of the same agreement, Pakistan will play at a neutral venue in any event hosted by India until 2027. \"Pakistan has chosen Dubai as the neutral venue for the Champions Trophy and it has been conveyed to the ICC officially, meaning India will play its matches there,\" a Pakistan Cricket Board spokesman said. Political tensions mean the two countries have not faced each other outside of men's major tournaments since 2013, while India have not played in Pakistan since 2008.The 50-over Champions Trophy will be the first time Pakistan has hosted a global event since 1996.Pakistan will also host the women's T20 World Cup in 2028, when neutral venue arrangements will also apply.The countries taking part in the Champions Trophy in addition to hosts Pakistan are Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand and South Africa.The ICC is likely to announce a final tournament schedule later next week.",
