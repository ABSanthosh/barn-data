The 35-year-old signalled his intent to continue his Test career until at least the Ashes series against England in the next Australian summer. Smith will also continue to play Twenty20 internationals.“Test cricket remains a priority,” Smith said in a statement on Wednesday. “And I am really looking forward to the World Test Championship final, the West Indies in the winter and then England at home. I feel I still have a lot to contribute on that stage.”Smith has long said he would continue weighing his career on a series-by-series basis. But he opted to retire from the 50-over format after playing 170 ODIs, scoring 5,800 runs at an average of 43.28.“It has been a great ride and I have loved every minute of it,” said Smith, a dual 50-over World Cup winner. “There have been so many amazing times and wonderful memories. Winning two World Cups was a great highlight, along with the many fantastic teammates who shared the journey.“Now is a great opportunity for people to start preparing for the 2027 World Cup, so it feels like the right time to make way.”Australia’s next ODIs are a three-match series against South Africa in August to be played in northern Australia. A three-match ODI series then looms in India, before Australia’s Test series against arch foes England.Smith captained Australia’s Champions Trophy campaign in the absence of regular skipper Pat Cummins, who is recovering from an ankle injury. He bowed out as Australia’s top-scorer in his last game, making 73 in the four-wicket loss to India in a semi-final that ended early Wednesday (AEDT).“Right up until his final ODI innings Steve exhibited an incredible ability to accumulate runs in all conditions,” Cricket Australia’s chief executive Todd Greenberg said in a statement. “And his astute leadership has been crucial in the team’s ongoing success.”",
