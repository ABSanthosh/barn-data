A local boy, Mhatre has been a regular fixture for Mumbai across formats since he broke into the squad earlier in the season.With defending champions looking to bounce back, Mhatre led the charge with a brilliant 176 off 232 balls, which was studded with 22 fours and four sixes, against Maharashtra. Mumbai won that game by nine wickets. He had a couple of quiet outings against Tripura and Odisha but slammed his second first-class ton - 116 off 149 balls with 12 fours and three sixes - against Services and went on to represent India in the Under-19 Men's Asia Cup.Mhatre kept the runs flowing with fifties (54 and 67 not out) against Japan and UAE, but fell for a single-digit score in the tournament's final which India lost to Bangladesh.Having missed Mumbai's Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy title triumph, Mhatre began the Vijay Hazare Trophy, India's premier domestic 50-overs competition, with 78 in a high-scoring contest against Karnataka.Get latest cricket updates on WhatsApp",
