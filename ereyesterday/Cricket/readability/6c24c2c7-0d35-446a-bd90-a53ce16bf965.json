The Taliban has banned secondary and higher education for girls and women, though exemptions had till now existed in the medical sector. With girls and women also banned from participating in sport, Afghanistan's status as an ICC Full Member has come under increasing scrutiny.No bilateral cricket with Afghanistan till there's 'a level of progress', says CAAfghanistan women request ICC to help set up a refugee team in AustraliaHuman rights question hangs over success story of Afghanistan's menAfghanistan's status as ICC Full Member unlikely to be affected\"Education holds a central place in Islamic teachings, emphasizing the pursuit of knowledge for both men and women,\" Rashid wrote in an Instagram story. \"The Quran highlights the importance of learning and acknowledges the equal spiritual worth of both genders.\"It is with deep sadness and disappointment that I reflect on the recent closures of educational and medical institutions for the sisters and mothers of Afghanistan. This decision has profoundly affected not only their future but also the broader fabric of our society. The pain and sorrow they express through social media serve as a poignant reminder of the struggles they face.\"Afghanistan, our beloved homeland, stands at a critical juncture. The country desperately needs professionals in every field, especially the medical sector. The acute shortage of female doctors and nurses is particularly concerning, as it directly impacts the healthcare and dignity of women. It is essential for our sisters and mothers to have access to care provided by medical professionals who truly understand their needs.\"I sincerely appeal for the reconsideration of this decision so that Afghan girls may reclaim their right to education and contribute to the nation's development. Providing education to all is not just a societal responsibility but a moral obligation deeply rooted in our faith and values.\"Writing on X, formerly Twitter, Nabi echoed Rashid's views: \"The Taliban's decision to ban girls from studying medicine is not only heartbreaking but deeply unjust. Islam has always emphasised the importance of education for everyone, and history is full of inspiring examples of Muslim women who made vital contributions to many generations through knowledge.\"I urge the Taliban to reflect on these values. Denying girls the chance to learn and serve their people is a betrayal of both their dreams and our nation's future. Let our daughters study, grow, and build a better Afghanistan for everyone. This is their right, and it is our duty to protect it.\"Rahmanullah Gurbaz also put out a post on Facebook, voicing his support for women's education.GMT 1800 The article was updated with Nabi's post on X.Get latest cricket updates on WhatsApp",
