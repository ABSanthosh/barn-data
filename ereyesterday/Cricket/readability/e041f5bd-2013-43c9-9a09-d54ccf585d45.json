Holland with the new ball on a string brought back familiar memories of that 48 hours prior when Zain Ul Hassan fell for a second single-figure score in the match and Sam Northeast first ball, Glamorgan still needing 188 to make the visitors bat for a second time.Enter Carlson. With no expectations of a result, the white-ball captain carried the weight of the side for a five-hour knock. Battling through the movement on the ball Glamorgan never seemed to find with the same effect as Leicestershire. As Eddie Byrom fell slashing at a wide half-volley, Ingram unable to replicate his and Carlson's 174-run partnership from a similar position in this fixture just eight months prior, and Ben Kellaway next, it was soon 46 for 5 with five sessions still left in the match.As the ball got older, Chris Cooke added some resistance and the home-grown Carlson began to show positivity, manoeuvring around his crease and oozing class with an uppercut off Ben Mike for six to bring up his half-century, shortly followed by a cut shot mid-leap to pass 5,000 first-class runs for the Welsh county.With Green continuing to impress economically as Glamorgan bided their time, Cooke eventually fell for a hard-fought 21, Timm van der Gugten attempting to withstand pressure succumbing to the extra pace of Mike.Gorvin and Carlson combined for 99 and the former continued to put up a fight when Carlson was dismissed, reaching his career-best score in the process in a patient knock until he was stranded with not enough of a lead.Needing just 51, Sol Budinger and Rehan Ahmed came out swinging to complete the job inside three days thanks to a bizarre scenario of facing Northeast's off-spin as he was forced to replace Kellaway after just two legal deliveries for bowling beamers.Get latest cricket updates on WhatsApp",
