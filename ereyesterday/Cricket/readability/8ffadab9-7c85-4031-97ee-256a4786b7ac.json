  "text": "The International Cricket Council has announced the formation of a dedicated taskforce to support displaced female cricketers from Afghanistan.Many of the country's leading players fled following the Taliban's return to power in 2021, with female participation in sport effectively outlawed.The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), along with Cricket Australia and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), will assist with the project.In a statement, the ICC said it will \"establish a dedicated fund to provide direct monetary assistance, ensuring these cricketers have the resources they need to continue pursuing the game they love\".It added: \"This will be complemented by a robust high-performance programme offering advanced coaching, world-class facilities and tailored mentorship to help them reach their full potential.\"ICC chairman Jay Shah said: \"We are deeply committed to fostering inclusivity and ensuring every cricketer has the opportunity to shine, regardless of their circumstances.\"In collaboration with our valued partners, we are proud to launch this taskforce and support fund, complemented by a comprehensive high-performance programme, to ensure displaced Afghan women cricketers can continue their journey in the sport.\"This initiative reflects our steadfast dedication to cricket's global growth and its power to inspire unity, resilience and hope.\"ECB chief executive Richard Gould said: \"We are proud to support this new initiative from the ICC. We have been vocal in recent times around the need for meaningful funding to support female players from Afghanistan so that they can thrive despite not being able to play at home.\"Having previously contributed a significant sum to the Global Refugee Cricket Fund, we are encouraged that this positive step from the ICC will go even further.\"We want the Afghanistan women's team to continue being a beacon of hope for all women and girls.\"The ICC requires its full members, of which Afghanistan is one, to have a national women's team, but the men's team has retained its Test status, reached the semi-finals of last year's T20 World Cup and participated in the Champions Trophy earlier this year.England's game against Afghanistan at the tournament went ahead as scheduled, despite a group of MPs across various political parties asking England to boycott the match.",
