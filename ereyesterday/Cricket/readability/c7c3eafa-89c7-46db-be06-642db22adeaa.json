We are going to dominate, no matter what.”England sit above India in the International Cricket Council’s T20 team rankings but the manner of this defeat suggests the rankings have not quite caught up with reality. The home team were outplayed in every department.With the bat, England suffered from a combination of poor shot selection and general muddle-headedness to finish on 126 for seven. India’s fielding was so blisteringly good that England failed to score a single boundary between the 11th and 19th overs.India’s openers, Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana, then raced to 53 not out in the powerplay, displaying the controlled aggression which England had so lacked, and laying a secure enough platform that a few overs of sensible batting and strike rotation from Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues enabled the latter to hit the winning runs with three overs to spare.“India have adapted to English conditions better than we expected,” Tammy Beaumont said.“It’s really difficult to defend a score like that when you know they’re going to come out and play freely and get ahead of the game. We stuck at it and did pick up a few wickets, but we never really had enough runs if we’re honest.”Jemimah Rodrigues leads the celebrations as India reach England’s target.
