  "text": "Liam Livingstone delivered a \"coming-of-age knock\" in England's win in the second one-day international against West Indies in Antigua, said former captain Sir Alastair Cook.The stand-in skipper struck an unbeaten 124 from 85 balls to power his side to a five-wicket win, levelling the three-match series at 1-1.Livingstone, 31, has received criticism for a perceived one-dimensional approach to 50-over batting, prioritising fast scoring over building innings that would take the team to victory.\"He will be really satisfied that, under pressure, he delivered. He has finished the job for the first time,\" Cook said on TNT Sports.\"That was up and down the gears playing the situation, and to be there at the end was wonderful for him. \"That was freakish playing at the end. You have seen a change in his determination - he was never getting out there. That was a coming-of-age knock for him.\"Livingstone came in with England 107-3, 222 runs short of their target of 329, and with almost 30 overs left to play.He played surprisingly cautiously, scoring 42 from his first 50 balls, but accelerated from that point, scoring 82 from 35, the fastest ever acceleration post-50 balls by an England batter.It took his side to a win with 15 balls to spare and brought life to a series which looked set to be one-sided after England were hammered by eight wickets in the first ODI on Thursday.\"Fair play to him, he was under scrutiny and pressure after Thursday's game,\" added Cook.\"When as a captain with the next opportunity you deliver the goods - that will do wonders for him.\"Livingstone, who scored 48 in Thursday's opening match, spoke in the post-match presentation about how he was enjoying his cricket.\"I feel like I am getting back to my best,\" he said. \"Just maturing, knowing my game and enjoying my cricket - if I'm doing that I know I'm playing pretty well.\"I tried to get myself going, then knew we could wait until the end and target their death bowling. That's how Sammy [Curran] and I wanted to play and it worked perfectly in the end.\"We need somebody in our top six to go on and get a big score. I thought we were good with the ball as well, overall it was a pretty decent performance and we're back in the series.\"His side now go into a decider in Barbados on Wednesday (18:00 GMT) and the temporary captain was hopeful the performance in this match would help his inexperienced side.\"We've got a lot of young boys still learning the ropes of international cricket,\" he said. \"Hopefully that'll boost their confidence and do them a world of good.\"",
