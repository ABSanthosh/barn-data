  "text": "Glamorgan won by an innings and 161 runsReportThree wickets each for Asitha Fernando, Timm van der Gugten secure their first win of the season and biggest over KentGlamorgan fielders crowd Kashif Ali as they close in on victory  •  Nick DillamGlamorgan 549 for 9 dec (Kellaway 181*, Kashif 4-92) beat Kent 212 (Benjamin 94, van der Gugten 3-23, Harris 3-59) and 176 (Muyeye 41, Fernando 3-18, van der Gugten 3-33) by an innings and 161 runsGlamorgan thrashed Kent by an innings and 161 runs at Canterbury to pick up their first win of the season in the Rothesay County Championship.Asitha Fernando took 3 for 18 and Timm van der Gugten 3 for 33 as the Welsh side dismissed Kent for 176 in their second innings, having enforced the follow on after rolling them over for 212 first time out.Chris Benjamin's first innings score of 94 not out was the only positive for the hosts in a game the visitors dominated throughout, winning with a day and 29 overs to spare.Home expectations were hardly high when Kent resumed on their overnight score of 156 for 8 overnight, with Benjamin unbeaten on 68, but for the first hour at least they showed some doggedness.George Garrett was on 11 when he edged Fernando to second slip but Kiran Carlson couldn't take a head-high catch and Garrett made a sensible-looking 35 before he finally edged Zain ul-Hassan and was caught behind.That left Benjamin's hopes of a maiden Kent century relying on Kashif Ali and although he trusted his partner enough to rotate the strike, Kashif managed just three before he was bowled by ul-Hassan.Glamorgan unsurprisingly enforced the follow on, but Harry Finch and Ben Compton looked comfortable enough till lunch, at which point it was 19 for 0.Any thoughts that Kent might drag things into a fourth day, however, disintegrated during the afternoon session. Fernando got Ben Compton lbw for 19 and Daniel Bell-Drummond fell to Gorvin for 5 after a breathtaking one-handed grab by Kiran Carlson.Finch nicked Fernando behind for 28 and the Sri Lankan then had Leaning caught behind for a four-ball duck.Although 18-year-old debutant Ekansh Singh avoided a pair, he fell for 8, caught behind off van der Gugten, and the Dutch international then bowled Benjamin for 7 and got Grant Stewart lbw for 16, from nine balls.Tawanda Muyeye was lbw to James Harris for 41 and by this stage the only jeopardy was whether or not Glamorgan would manage to retrieve the over rate.This explained why the celebrations were so muted when Matt Parkinson was caught and bowled by Ben Kellaway for 4: a number of fans didn't realise he was out until he walked off.Kashif went down swinging, heaving Kiran Carlson for six over the Colin Cowdrey Stand and then pulling another one into a floodlight pylon. He hit a third six over cow corner but Glamorgan's biggest ever victory over Kent was secured when he pulled Kellaway to Govin and was caught on the midwicket boundary.Instant answers to T20 questionsCounty Championship Division Two",
