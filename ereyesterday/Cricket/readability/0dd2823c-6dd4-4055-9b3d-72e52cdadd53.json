  "description": "Simon Hughes and Simon Mann review the first day's play from Headingley, dominated by India's batters after Ben Stokes put the tourists in. Yashasvi Jaiswal's expertise is admired, Shubman Gill's poise applauded, Rishabh Pant's audacity marvelled at. The England attack looked mostly impotent. It doesn't bode well, but the pitch promises lots of runs. This podcast is supported by Betfair.
