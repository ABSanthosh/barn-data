  "text": "Specific windows in the calendar for international fixtures are among the improvements needed for cricket to survive across the world, says a major report by the global players' union.The World Cricketers' Association has published a six-month review into the sport's structure at the elite level and says the current situation is \"putting the future of the international game at risk\", amid the rise of T20 leagues.The report calls for four, short windows per year for international cricket, with the rest of the calendar able to be filled by T20 leagues or longer international series.It also suggests divisions for each of the three international formats, with promotion and relegation at the end of a two-year cycle. This would also form the qualification process for World Cups and other major events.\"Whilst there are a number of positive trends in cricket, there is no doubt that global cricket is at an inflection point,\" said Paul Marsh, the chair of the committee which produced the report.\"Many of the issues highlighted in the report are challenging, but they need to be discussed if we are to create a more sustainable future in more than just a few countries.\"The report has been produced after interviews with 64 stakeholders in the game, including current and former administrators, commercial and media partners and elite players such as Jos Buttler, Heather Knight and Australia captain Pat Cummins. It is critical of the sport's global leadership and says the International Cricket Council (ICC) needs to be \"modernised\".It is understood there has been little engagement from the ICC to the initial findings and suggestions. The contribution from senior figures in India, the game's global powerhouse, was also limited to one executive from an Indian Premier League franchise.The report highlights the power held by the three biggest cricketing nations - England, India and Australia - who it says share 83% of global revenue.It claims the suggested changes, which also include a global growth and development fund and a more even split of revenue, would \"ensure the survival of international cricket\", create an \"easier to follow\" calendar and increase revenue by $240m (£196m).International cricket currently competes with lucrative T20 franchise leagues for much of the year, with national boards largely left to plan their own tours within the Future Tours Programme.The report says set windows would allow internationals to \"co-exist\" with T20 leagues \"rather than compete with them, thereby ensuring its future survival\".It also says an overhaul of the structure to include divisions with promotion and relegation across the board would provide greater context, jeopardy and interest.\"As players we understand our responsibility to the game, and we have an interest in it being successful,\" said Knight, who was sacked as England captain last week.\"A unified sport is going to achieve better outcomes than a fragmented one.\"Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan said: \"Cricket has given me so much and I want to see it be strong and sustainable in more than just a handful of countries. \"We're urging the game's leadership to act on the information and suggestions contained in this report.\"There have been reports a two-tier system could be introduced to the World Test Championship, but such a move would be controversial.",
