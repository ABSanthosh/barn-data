  "text": "Jos Buttler has extended his central contract with the England and Wales Cricket Board by a year.White-ball captain Buttler, 34, is already one year into his existing two-year deal. He joins Test skipper Ben Stokes in signing until the autumn of 2026 after the all-rounder agreed a new deal at the beginning of October.\"The strength and depth of talent across England men's red and white-ball cricket is clear in the quality of players who are centrally contracted,\" said Rob Key, director of England men's cricket.“Both our captains have signed two-year central contracts that showcase the commitment of all the players to prioritise playing for their country.\"Buttler is currently recovering from a calf injury that has ruled him out since June, with Liam Livingstone standing in for the tour of West Indies.Twenty nine players are on central contracts. Pace bowler Gus Atkinson has also extended by a year until 2026, while spinner Jack Leach and white-ball seamer Reece Topley have agreed new one-year deals.Five players have signed their first central contracts - wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, white-ball batter Phil Salt, spinner Shoaib Bashir, all-rounder Will Jacks and fast bowler Olly Stone have all signed one-year deals. Batter Jonny Bairstow, who last represented England in June, still has a year left on the contract that he signed in 2023. James Anderson, Moeen Ali and Dawid Malan have all retired, while Ben Foakes and Ollie Robinson have lost their deals. All-rounder Jacob Bethell and seamers Josh Hull and John Turner have signed development contracts.Two-year contracts: Gus Atkinson, Harry Brook, Jos Buttler, Joe Root, Jamie Smith, Ben Stokes, Mark WoodOne-year contracts: Rehan Ahmed, Jofra Archer, Jonny Bairstow, Shoaib Bashir, Brydon Carse, Zak Crawley, Sam Curran, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Jack Leach, Liam Livingstone, Ollie Pope, Matthew Potts, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Olly Stone, Josh Tongue, Reece Topley, Chris WoakesDevelopment contracts: Jacob Bethell, Josh Hull, John TurnerTest vice-captain Ollie Pope has received a one-year extension, despite his recent poor form with the bat.Pope managed just 55 runs across the three games in Pakistan, at an average of 11.Despite scoring three centuries, he is averaging 32 in 2024 - the lowest average of any player to have hit three hundreds in a calendar year in Test history.\"He's someone that has been brilliant in recent times and I'm sure that he will come good,\" James Anderson, England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker, said on the Tailenders podcast.\"New Zealand [England's next Test tour] will suit him better. I think it can be tough when you are starting against spin. It's about going away and thinking about it and trying to improve so that you are prepared if you come up against those conditions again in future.\"Pope's lack of runs has led to questions about his place, external in the side, despite his position as vice-captain, but Anderson said he has \"not heard anything like that\" when asked if he heard Pope's place be questioned. \"I haven't even thought about that. He had a pretty light series but I don't know how far back you are talking that he's not scored runs because he got 190 in the summer,\" Anderson said.Smith will miss the New Zealand tour for the birth of his first child, and Essex's Jordan Cox is set to deputise. An impressive series for Cox, and another poor return for Pope, could lead to further questions about his future when England next play Test cricket in May.",
