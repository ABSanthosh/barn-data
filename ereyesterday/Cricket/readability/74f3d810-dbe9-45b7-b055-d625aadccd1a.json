  "text": "England withstand Matthews to claim T20 clean sweepMedia caption, England win final T20 against Windies to complete clean sweepThird T20, Chelmsford England 144-5 (20 overs): Knight 66* (47); Matthews 3-32West Indies 127-8 (20 overs): Matthews 71 (54); Bell 2-11England won by 17 runs; win series 3-0ScorecardEngland withstood all-rounder Hayley Matthews' brilliance to win the third and final T20 by 17 runs and complete a dominant series clean sweep in Charlotte Edwards and Nat Sciver-Brunt's first series in charge. Matthews was playing a lone hand in West Indies' pursuit of 145 for a consolation win at Chelmsford, but a rain delay with 48 runs required from the last 26 balls disrupted the chase. They slipped from 109-3 to 127-8, with Lauren Bell claiming the game-changing wicket of Matthews for a sublime 71 from 54 balls in the 18th over.Bell finished an exceptional spell with figures of 2-11 while there were also two wickets each for fellow quick Em Arlott and spinners Linsey Smith and Charlie Dean.Matthews claimed 3-32 in England's 144-5, leading West Indies' much-improved bowling performance, but former captain Heather Knight's unbeaten 66 from 47 balls ensured England just had enough runs on the board.After Danni Wyatt-Hodge was bowled from the first ball of the innings by Zaida James' spin for the second match in a row and Sophia Dunkley was caught behind off Matthews for three, Knight and new captain Sciver-Brunt rebuilt the innings from a stuttering powerplay of 24-2. The experienced pair added 48 for the third wicket before Sciver-Brunt fell for 37, and Knight added a further 42 with wicketkeeper Amy Jones, who made a quickfire 22. A three-match one-day international series begins in Derby on Friday, but England will be waiting on Knight's fitness after she could not take the field in the second innings because of a hamstring problem suffered during her knock. Superb Knight anchors EnglandMedia caption, Knight brings up 50 with a 'lovely' reverse paddleThere was plenty of discussion and hope that losing the England captaincy would allow Knight more freedom as a batter, and in her first two knocks since, that has already come to fruition.She made 43 not out in the first T20 at Canterbury, and was not required to bat in the second, before finishing strongly by reaching her first international T20 half-century on home soil from 38 balls.West Indies were rewarded for a much more consistent bowling effort, sticking to a simple plan of keeping the stumps in play and squeezing England's batters as much as possible with a little help from a surface which aided their spin-heavy attack.It meant that Knight had to work through the gears, focusing on rotating the strike and picking the gaps in her partnership with Sciver-Brunt which came after England posted their second-lowest T20 powerplay score when batting first at home, with only two boundaries struck in the opening six overs.After Sciver-Brunt was caught on the boundary at the end of the 11th over, Jones' counter-attacking knock took the pressure off during the the middle overs which allowed Knight to display more versatility, striking one enormous six over mid-wicket and producing an array of cheeky ramps and paddles off the spinners.Her injury will be a concern as she struggled to run between the wickets in the final couple of overs, but it has been a highly promising return to the batting ranks.There are questions surrounding Wyatt-Hodge's form, however, with 17 runs in three innings having already been dropped from the ODI squad for this series. The opener's 22 ducks are the most in men's and women's T20 internationals, and 11 of them have come first ball.Matthews' magic in vain - againMedia caption, Matthews hits 'terrific' sixThe fact that Matthews was named player of the series and claimed two player of the match awards, and yet her side was unable to win a single game, perfectly summarises both her magnificent talent but the team's unsustainable reliance upon her.Across the series, she has scored 177 runs in three innings including an unbeaten century in the first match, with Shabika Gajnabi's tally of 47 their next highest. At Chelmsford, it was also the first time a player had scored 70+ runs and taken three or more wickets in a losing cause in women's T20 internationals. She struck 11 fours and a six in her knock, sweeping the spinners smartly and regularly unveiling her characteristic lofted drives over cover which had England on the brink when the equation came down to 49 from 30 balls . England's fielding woes started to creep in under pressure again, with Sciver-Brunt and Dean dropping Realeanna Grimmond from consecutive balls off the latter's own bowling in the 11th over. But the rain delay worked in England's favour. They were nine runs ahead on Duckworth Lewis Stern (DLS) when the players left the field anyway, but a four from Matthews and a fine straight six from Gajnabi gave West Indies a boost.But Smith fought back with two wickets in two balls, including Gajnabi, and Matthews hit Bell's slower ball to long-on in the following over to all-but seal England's win.West Indies' lack of batting depth came to the fore once again and their hopes in the longer format appear bleak unless Matthews continues to work miracles.Media caption, Grimmond dropped three times and then out in same over'We've played some brilliant cricket' - what they saidEngland captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, speaking to Sky Sports: \"We played some brilliant cricket over this T20 series. We didn't have the perfect game today but we set the standards very high in the first two games of the series.\"With the way we started our innings, to get up to that score was really competitive. West Indies made it very difficult for us. Heather [Knight] batting like that was perfect to get us to a competitive total.\"Player of the match and player of the series, Hayley Matthews, on Sky Sports: \"It was really good to be able to go out there and score some runs and take some wickets. It was definitely a closer game today and one we felt like we competed in. We'd have loved to get over the line.\"I'm really happy and super proud of the younger players who have come in.\"World Cup winner Ebony Rainford-Brent on BBC Test Match Special: \"England will look at their batting and think they should've scored another 20 runs and they maybe should've forced wickets more. \"They'll reflect on needing to be a bit sharper and more ruthless.\"More on this story",
