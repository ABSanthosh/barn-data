  "description": "Simon Hughes and Simon Mann review the first day of the ICC World Test Championship final at Lord's - the Home of Cricket - when fourteen wickets fell for little more than 250 runs. Australia predictably have the upper hand against South Africa's makeshift batting line-up after being bundled out themselves for 212. . England's T20 series whitewash of the West Indies is also assessed.
