  "text": "Cricket Australia has been left “disappointed” after the AFL’s access to Adelaide Oval was prioritised over South Australian cricketers’ hopes of hosting the Sheffield Shield final at the state’s premier venue.The final of the men’s domestic red-ball competition will instead be held at Karen Rolton Oval, on the city’s western fringe, starting on 26 March. The AFL has rights to the ground from 15 March each year.Cricket Australia chief executive Todd Greenberg, who took over from Nick Hockley this month, said the sport was barred from access to the ground for the proposed mid-week match between AFL rounds.“We are disappointed South Australia has been prevented from hosting the Sheffield Shield final at Adelaide Oval,” Greenberg said.“The Sheffield Shield final is a significant event for Australia’s national sport, and we believe Adelaide Oval would have been the most appropriate venue.”Adelaide open their AFL season with a clash against St Kilda at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday, and the drop-in pitch has already been removed ahead of the football season.Port Adelaide play Richmond at the ground on Saturday 22 March before the Crows host the Kangaroos eight days later on Sunday 30 March.South Australia haven’t won the Sheffield Shield title since 1996 and cricket officials hoped a pitch could be dropped back in between the AFL matches to accommodate the five-day final.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided by Instagram.
