And no doubt, Edwards will be pleased that her reign began with an eight-wicket win, especially as this was a homecoming of sorts for the former Kent captain.But while England experienced their first taste of victory in five months – spearheaded by a career-best unbeaten 81 from Sophia Dunkley, and featuring a wicket on debut for the 27-year-old Warwickshire seamer Em Arlott – there was only one star of Wednesday’s show: West Indies captain Hayley Matthews, who calmly brought up a century off the final ball of the visitors’ innings.An unbeaten 100 out of a team total of 146; 16 boundaries to Matthews while her teammates scored just five between them. Matthews is by now used to bearing the weight of the team she has captained for three years – epitomised by her refusal to take singles in the final over here, as she eyed up three figures – but the sensation is currently heightened by the mysterious absence of Deandra Dottin, who was omitted from the West Indies squad for this tour without explanation.“We’ve obviously got a very young group that played today,” Matthews said. “We’re missing so many of our experienced campaigners. We’ve got girls coming in from the domestic setup for the first time and I think it’s such a steep climb coming to international cricket. It is going to be tough for them sometimes.”If England had looked all at sea in the field against these same opponents in the World Cup last October, here the tables were turned, with two West Indian batters run out and the rest swinging wildly. None looked more clueless than the 20-year-old debutant Realeanna Grimmond, who was run out after obliviously wandering out of her ground.Matthews offered an explanation of sorts: “I was actually shouting, ‘keeper’s end, stay in your crease’. She thought I was saying, ‘look for two’. Maybe a bit of miscommunication and lack of awareness.”Hayley Matthews secured her hundred with the final ball of the West Indies innings. Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAEngland, in reply, strolled to victory – the only downbeat note being the duck scored by their new skipper, who edged a sweep behind and was sent packing by a smart West Indies DRS review. On the other side of the balance sheet, though, was the chanceless knock of 43 not out from her predecessor Heather Knight, seemingly quite content to find herself back in the ranks.If Edwards wanted to make a statement that things have changed since the disaster of the Ashes winter, she could scarcely have made a stronger one: a cap for Arlott; Issy Wong back playing in a full-strength England side after a two-year absence; leg-spinner Sarah Glenn on the bench; and the previously ever-present Sophie Ecclestone not even named in the squad.And her players responded in kind: England’s nemesis Qiana Joseph – who was dropped five times en route to the half-century which sent England packing from the 2024 World Cup – was dismissed at the first time of asking, well held by Linsey Smith at point. Sciver-Brunt then helped herself to catches at deep midwicket and cover, handing Wong and Arlott a wicket apiece, while Lauren Bell held on to a stunner at short fine leg.Rain clouds had earlier threatened to disrupt this match – but for now, the sun shines on England’s new-look era. They go again on Friday, in the second T20 at Hove.",
