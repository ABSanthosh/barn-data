  "text": "England captain Ben Stokes says he understands if the decision to bat Jacob Bethell at number three \"does raise a few eyebrows\", but insisted \"we're not picking people just to wind people up\".Bethell, 21, will make his Test debut in the series opener against New Zealand in Christchurch on Thursday (22:00 GMT, Wednesday).The Warwickshire left-hander has never made a century in senior professional cricket and not batted higher than number four in his 20 first-class matches.Asked about the potential for the Bethell decision to divide the opinion of supporters, Stokes said: \"You can totally understand it, but you've got to be true to yourself when you get given the opportunity to be able to make decisions.\"We've always done what we feel is right for the team. It's gone in our favour quite a lot, so I think we do know what we're doing.\"We're not picking people just to wind people up. We do know what we're doing. We do know what we look for, and when you're in a position to make decisions you've got to do it by your standards and your means.\"In a wide-ranging conversation with journalists in the city of his birth, Stokes explained why Bethell has been chosen at three, described his personal struggles on the tour of Pakistan last month and shared how he surprised his family in Christchurch.Bethell is one of the most exciting prospects in English cricket and has impressed in his 15 international white-ball appearances.Given his lack of experience and modest record in first-class cricket, the Warwickshire man was still a surprise selection for this tour. Due to be the back-up batter, Bethell will make his Test debut after wicketkeeper Jordan Cox was ruled out with a broken thumb.Ollie Pope will take the gloves and, in order to manage his workload, slide down from his regular position at number three to six. England could have opted to move Joe Root or Stokes himself up the order, but Stokes said the tourists \"didn't want to make it too messy\".England have regularly made surprising selection decisions since Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum took charge - pace bowler Josh Hull was given a Test debut in September after only 10 first-class matches - but the Bethell decision is the boldest.\"Beth's got the capability to be able to go out there, bat three and hopefully impact the game, like he has done throughout the summer in the white-ball team,\" said Stokes, who played golf with Bethell on Monday.\"We use a little wheel to make our golf groups,\" said Stokes. \"It was almost like the wheel knew - I was paired with him.\"After returning from Pakistan, where England lost 2-1, Stokes announced on social media that a gang burgled his house during the second Test, while Clare and their two children were at home. A 32-year-old man has since been arrested.Asked if he considered leaving the tour, Stokes replied: \"I did actually. It was my wife who told me not to. I always tell the lads that kind of stuff comes first. I asked my wife and she was adamant that I needed to stay out there.\"On the field, Stokes endured one of his \"hardest\" trips in Pakistan. Battling back from a hamstring injury, the all-rounder missed the first Test, then struggled in the final two.He apologised to the team after showing frustration for dropped catches in the second Test and was bizarrely lbw playing no shot in the second innings of the third. Afterwards, McCullum said England had to \"wrap our arms\" around Stokes.\"I got so individually focused on myself over a long period of time trying to get back from injury, I actually I did physically drain and ruin myself,\" said Stokes. \"That definitely had some kind of mental impact on me.\"It's made me realise that I can't take myself into that sort of area ever again, because not only does it have an impact on myself, but also has a massive impact on the team.\"There's no doubt that my frustration was showing when things weren't quite going our way. Everyone's sort of treading on eggshells around you, because they can sense it.\"The captain said he \"cleared the air\" with his players when they arrived in Queenstown to prepare for this series last week.Stokes had travelled to New Zealand before the England team to surprise members of his family who live in Christchurch.Stokes was born here in 1991, before moving to Wellington at the age of 10, then Cumbria aged 12 when his father Ged got a job as a rugby league coach. Ged passed away in 2020, but Stokes' mother Deb and brother James remain in Christchurch.\"This tour is more than just cricket for me,\" said Stokes. \"It's a chance to catch up with family who I don't get to see. You know, pretty much the whole of the Stokes family is in Christchurch.\"",
