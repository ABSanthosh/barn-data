As New Zealand captain Sophie Devine stepped out to block a delivery by Deepti, the bowler noticed a chance. With Devine still out of her crease and not attentive of the situation, Deepti threw the ball back to wicket-keeper Yastika Bhatia who dislodged the bails before Devine could return to her crease. Devine even swayed out of the way to avoid Deepti's throw back to Yastika.
