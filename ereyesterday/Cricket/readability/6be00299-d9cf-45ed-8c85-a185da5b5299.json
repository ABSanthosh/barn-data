The tournament hosts have now lost both their Group A fixtures and will be knocked out if New Zealand beat Bangladesh on Monday in Rawalpindi.That result would also guarantee India’s progress to the last four after their second victory of the tournament in Dubai. The backdrop to this fixture, which was expected to attract more than one billion worldwide viewers, was India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan, meaning a hybrid model for the staging of this tournament. Pakistan flew to the United Arab Emirates, where all of India’s games will be played, having lost their tournament opener to New Zealand in Karachi on Wednesday. They won the toss but lost Imam ul-Haq to a farcical run-out, although Saud Shakeel (62) and Mohammad Rizwan (46) steadied thing with 104 for the third wicket.India’s Axar Patel (centre) celebrates with Kuldeep Yadav after running out Pakistan’s Imam-ul-Haq. Photograph: Altaf Qadri/APHaving reached 151 for two in the 34th over, Pakistan’s batters badly lost their way, surrendering their last eight wickets for just 90 runs. Kuldeep Yadav took three for 40 and Kohli claimed a couple of catches to move on to 158 – the most by an India outfielder, leapfrogging Mohammad Azharuddin with 156.Kohli reached another benchmark when he batted, becoming the quickest to 14,000 ODI runs in his 287th innings and just the third overall after compatriot Sachin Tendulkar and Sri Lanka’s Kumar Sangakkara. The India captain put on 69 with Shubman Gill (46) after Rohit Sharma was bowled for 20 by Shaheen Afridi.Shreyas Iyer (56) came to the crease and his 114-run union with Kohli broke the back of the chase for India, who won their tournament opener by beating Bangladesh on Thursday. While Iyer and Hardik Pandya departed within successive overs, the only lingering doubt was whether Kohli would get to three figures.He did so with a customary blow through the covers after advancing down the track to slow left-armer Khushdil Shah, before soaking in the applause having gotten India home and hosed with seven overs to spare.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“It feels good to be able to back in that manner in an important game where we wanted to [effectively] seal our qualification into the semis,” Kohli said after collecting the player-of-the-match award.“My job was pretty clear – to control the middle overs, try and go after the seam bowlers and not take too many risks against the spinners but keep rotating strike,” he added. “Towards the end, Shreyas accelerated and I got a few boundaries away as well. It was more or less the way I play ODI cricket. So I was happy with the template.”",
