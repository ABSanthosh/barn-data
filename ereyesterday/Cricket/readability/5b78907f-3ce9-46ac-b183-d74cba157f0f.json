Ireland won the toss on Sunday and elected to field with the Chevrons moving to 73-3 before Madhevere and Sikandar Raza put them in a good position.Campher trapped Madhevere and followed it up with two wickets in two balls to swing the momentum in Ireland's favour.Sikandar Raza steadied Zimbabwe's innings and from 157-6 they were bowled out for 245 with an over remaining with Mark Adair claiming 4-54.Andrew Balbirnie fell for 11 before fellow opener Stirling and Campher took Ireland to 171-1.Lorcan Tucker (30*) and George Dockrell (20*) were at the creased as victory was sealed.\"I think we were better [than the first ODI] - there's no lull in that middle period, Sikandar and Wesley battled really well and that's when we were under the most pressure,\" said Stirling.\"I chucked the ball to Curtis and he really turned the game on it's head. I think 250 was about right for us to chase and we got there.\"",
