The ICC Board has opted to maintain the existing rules that impose fines and points deductions on fielding sides who fail to bowl an average of 15 overs per hour in the next edition of the WTC, which begins with England‚Äôs five-Test series against India in June.Stokes first raised complaints about the issue when England and New Zealand were docked three WTC points and all their players were fined 15% of their match fees after the tourist‚Äôs eight-wicket win in Christchurch last December. The England captain revealed he had been refusing to sign the over-rate sheets presented by the ICC‚Äôs match referee in protest at the system since the 2023 Ashes. England were docked 19 of the 28 WTC points they had won during the thrilling 2-2 series due to their slow over-rate. Continue reading...",

The conversation ranges from the origins of the Test match idea, with just three countries involved, how it expanded, chronicling key matches, turning points and characters, how the great 1970s West Indies and 1990s Australia were formed, and why Australia are consistently so much better than everyone else. Finally we consider if India can dominate in the same way and how the Test format can survive and prosper.
