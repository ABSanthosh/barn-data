    "description": "MCC is cosying up to Shah during World Test Championship between South Africa and AustraliaLord‚Äôs looks a little different this week. The grass is the same shade of green, the pavilion still terracotta red, but the International Cricket Council, which runs the World Test Championship, has papered over every last trace of everyone else‚Äôs branding, from the posters outside publicising Middlesex‚Äôs upcoming games, to the sponsors‚Äô logos spray-painted on the outfield. They‚Äôve changed every last hoarding and billboard around the ground, and reprogrammed the three big screens so that they display, throughout the game, the slogans of their own sponsors. ‚ÄúThums up Cola! Taste the Thunder!‚ÄùThey‚Äôve even installed six big bright-orange sofas in the Allen Stand, on behalf of Sobha Realty, which goes by the motto ‚ÄúArt of the Detail‚Äù. There were unconfirmed rumours that an apparatchik had been spotted taping over the egg-and-bacon stripes on the members‚Äô ties. Anything to make sure everything is arranged exactly as the ICC‚Äôs chair, Jay Shah, likes it. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Grumbles about formats and venues are forgotten as first South Africa‚Äôs quicks, and then Australia‚Äôs, make hay in Lord‚Äôs sunshineOver the week of lead-up to its third staging, the World Test Championship final has felt increasingly like something that counts. After two abandoned attempts to host it at Lord‚Äôs, having been diverted first to the Hampshire Bowl and then to The Oval, it is finally being held at cricket‚Äôs original headquarters. On the first day of the match, with a surge of people up St John‚Äôs Wood Road, whether for a sensible start time of 10.30am or spilling over into an occasionally sunny afternoon, forming an eventual crowd of more than 26,000, this at last felt like vindication of concept.Of course, cricket being cricket, this also means that the game‚Äôs biggest interests are right now lining up to sabotage it. The Indian board plans to take the next final to their cavern in Ahmedabad, where about 13 people will show up to watch, especially if it‚Äôs a neutral fixture. Even India Tests when Virat Kohli was playing drew paltry crowds there. Partly their move will be motivated by a thirst for prestige, partly by India having already lost two finals in England. It is comically being framed as a ‚Äúbid‚Äù, while everyone in cricket knows that that the BCCI does not do any bidding, but only has its bidding done. Continue reading...",

    "description": "On this week‚Äôs Stumped with Alison Mitchell, Jim Maxwell \u0026 Charu Sharma, the team ask whether Virat Kohli has finally completed cricket after getting his hands on the trophy that has eluded him throughout his stellar white ball career.He won the Indian Premier League with Royal Challengers Bengaluru after 18 years and over 260 matches, having first been drafted by them back in 2008, and he‚Äôs been loyal to them too - the only player to have played for just one team in all 18 IPL seasons.The team also reflect on the sad scenes in Bangalore, after eleven people died and dozens were injured in a crush as fans flocked to the Chinnaswamy stadium at an event to welcome the team back home to Bangalore. Plus, we hear from South Africa Test captain Temba Bavuma ahead of the World Test Championship final. Bavuma tells us that Kagiso Rabada has apologised to his teammates and that they're supporting him as much as they can following his recent one month ban from cricket after he tested positive for use of a recreational drug.Photo: Virat Kohli of Royal Challengers Bengaluru lifts the IPL trophy alongside teammates following the team's victory in the 2025 IPL Final match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings at Narendra Modi Stadium on June 03, 2025, in Ahmedabad, India.

    "description": "This week we discuss how new India captain Shubman Gill may lead the side. A former member of India‚Äôs coaching set up, R Sridhar, is our guest. He explains how Gill is a mix of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. It‚Äôs not just a new era for India, but also for England. Harry Brook is the new men‚Äôs white ball captain for a series of three ODIs and three T20s against West Indies. We ask whether Brook is the right choice to improve England‚Äôs poor form in limited overs cricket, and whether this extra responsibility could affect his Test form. Plus: the team also reflect on Sikandar Raza‚Äôs remarkable journey from playing for Zimbabwe in Nottingham on Saturday, to hitting the title winning runs in the Pakistan Super League in Lahore on Sunday.Photo: India's Shubman Gill celebrates after scoring a century during the third day of the first Test cricket match between India and Bangladesh at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on September 21, 2024.
