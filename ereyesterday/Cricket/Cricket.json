    "description": "This week is our 500th episode of Stumped. The show has been going for ten years, so Alison Mitchell, Jim Maxwell and Charu Sharma reflect on how the game has changed and developed over the last decade. India and New Zealand are through to the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy at the expense of Bangladesh and Pakistan. We look at where it went wrong for the hosts and celebrate Indiaâ€™s Virat Kohli who became the fastest player to score 14,000 One Day International runs. And after England's defeat against Afghanistan to knock them out of the tournament, we ask if Jos Buttler should remain as captain?Plus, after 16-year-old G Kamalani hit the winning runs for the Mumbai Indians in the Women's Premier League, we look at the pressure on young cricketers. Vice President of the Western Region Junior Cricket Association, Vanessa Pereira joins us and tells us she is worried about the risk of burnout in aspiring players.Photo: Alison Mitchell, Jim Maxwell and Charu Sharma reunited (Credit: Alison Mitchell)",
