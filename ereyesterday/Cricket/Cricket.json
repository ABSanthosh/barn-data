He also tells us about his cricketing journey from playing cricket for Italy to coaching Papua New Guinea.We hear from India’s greatest ever female batter Mithali Raj after she was awarded the lifetime achievement award at the BBC Indian Sportswoman of the Year awards. She tells us about her journey into cricket and the challenges she has faced.And we hear from South Africa men’s captain Temba Bavuma who shares his experience of being the first black African player to be appointed as permanent captain of the Proteas.Photo: Alana King of Australia reacts during day one of the Women's Ashes Test Match between Australia and England at Melbourne Cricket Ground on January 30, 2025 in Melbourne, Australia.

    "description": "Ahead of the third season of the Women's Premier League, Alison Mitchell, Jim Maxwell, and Charu Sharma hear from former England captain Charlotte Edwards and former India fast bowler Jhulan Goswami on what it’s like working together as coaches at Mumbai Indians after being great rivals in their playing days. Edwards, currently head coach at MI, also says she wants to ‘help’ English cricket and has urged the ECB to ‘get in touch’. It comes as the organisation conducts a review into the Ashes defeat to Australia. Following the recent success of India’s U19 side at youth level, Jhulan gives her opinion on whether she thinks that victory in Malaysia can help lead the senior team to victory at the Women’s World Cup in Autumn.
