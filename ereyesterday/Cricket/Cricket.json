After battling knee and foot injuries since midway through last year, Healy has been left on ice for the series as she attempts to regain full fitness for October‚Äôs ODI World Cup.Australia have traditionally used Beth Mooney as a wicketkeeper in Healy‚Äôs absence, given her permanent selection in the side means few changes to the XI need to be made.

    "description": "They should beat Afghanistan to progress, but the batters would have benefited from a hit-out against South AfricaIf you were an Australian supporter of a certain pragmatic bent, you might be quite pleased with a washout against South Africa at the Champions Trophy. With a win already banked, you slide past your most dangerous opponent in Group B without having conceded any advantage to them. It leaves you level with them on three points and guaranteed a semi-final as long as you can beat an Afghanistan team that, despite their recent advancements and the memorably close result last time you played an ODI against, you should still beat any time, anywhere across a format as extended as 50 overs.If you‚Äôre an Australian supporter of the sort of bullishness natural to Australian supporters, including any past or current Australian player, you would say that you always want to play the best teams because you‚Äôll beat them while having a grand old time in the process, and that sliding past your most dangerous opponent is just a missed opportunity to bank a second win, go to four points, and all but guarantee your semi-final before the final group game against Afghanistan comes into it.
