The conversation ranges from the origins of the Test match idea, with just three countries involved, how it expanded, chronicling key matches, turning points and characters, how the great 1970s West Indies and 1990s Australia were formed, and why Australia are consistently so much better than everyone else. Finally we consider if India can dominate in the same way and how the Test format can survive and prosper.
