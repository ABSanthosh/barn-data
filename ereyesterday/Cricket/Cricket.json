Edwards, currently head coach at MI, also says she wants to ‘help’ English cricket and has urged the ECB to ‘get in touch’. It comes as the organisation conducts a review into the Ashes defeat to Australia. Following the recent success of India’s U19 side at youth level, Jhulan gives her opinion on whether she thinks that victory in Malaysia can help lead the senior team to victory at the Women’s World Cup in Autumn.

The governing body added it was their intention to \"support the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) in fostering cricket development and ensuring playing opportunities for both men and women in Afghanistan\". An ICC working group, set up after the Taliban takeover in 2021, has met with representatives of the Afghanistan government and is keen to use its position and the sport of cricket to influence change in the country.Plus, Clint Wheeldon tells us how the Aussie triumph in the Women’s Ashes has been received in Australia and about the influence of spinner Alana King. We also hear from the Managing Director of England Women's Cricket Clare Connor on what she believes went wrong.And we ask if India coach Gautam Gambhir is beating England coach Brendon McCullum at his own game after their risky approach in the white ball series.Photo: Nahida Sapan, captain of Afghanistan Women's XI, leads out her teammates before the cricket match between Afghanistan Women's XI and Cricket Without Borders XI at Junction Oval in Melbourne on January 30, 2025.

If she wasn’t busy enough – “People think I must be mad, but I want to make a difference whilst I’ve still got the energy” – the former England captain has also just launched a foundation in her own name that seeks to help female cricketers in “under-served communities”.After 30 minutes of discussion about the state of the women’s game at home and abroad and her thoughts on that disastrous Ashes campaign we get round to the elephant on the phone line.
