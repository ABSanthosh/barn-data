    "description": "The 19-year-old opener has been locked in to face India but will have the most fearsome introduction with Jasprit Bumrah firing on all cylindersBefore Christmas has even hit, there is more anticipation about Boxing Day than usual, in more ways than one. Australia and India sit at 1-1 with two Tests to play, the first at the MCG where India won on their last two tours. The ticketing forecast says it will be a full house, the weather forecast says it will hit 40C, and while the latter may suppress the former, itâ€™s the first time that all tickets have been claimed since the Ashes match of 2013. Amidst all this stands a Test debut opening the batting for a 19-year-old, with Sam Konstasâ€™ spot in the XI confirmed on Tuesday by Australia coach Andrew McDonald.Older generations will remember Doug Walters debuting at 19, and some would remember Neil Harvey doing the same. There have been a few modern bolters at young ages, like Ashton Agar or Matthew Renshaw, and Konstas will have the benefit of a captain in Pat Cummins who debuted at 18. In terms of substantial modern batting careers, though, Konstas most brings to mind Phillip Hughes, who was playing Sheffield Shield cricket by 18, and Ricky Ponting who did the same at 17. Both were in the Test team by 20. Continue reading...",
