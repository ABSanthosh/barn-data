    "description": "Two big names from two remarkable stories in Test cricket are on the programme.New Zealand’s men created history by securing their first ever Test series victory in India - ending India’s run of eighteen consecutive Test series wins at home over a dominant period of twelve years. Rachin Ravindra, Player of the Match from the opening Test of the series, tells Alison there is nothing like a Test win for your country, how he was inspired by the ‘golden generation’ of New Zealand cricket - and his hopes of meeting Sachin Tendulkar.Pakistan Test captain Shan Masood tells Stumped how they arrested a slump in fortune to earn an incredible come-from-behind win over England - their first series win at home in nearly four years. Masood talks about the team finding “balance in the middle of chaos”, the precarious nature of captaincy, and the future of dropped batting star Babar Azam.Alison, Jim Maxwell and Charu Sharma all reflect on the recent success for both New Zealand and Pakistan.Photo: General view of play during an ICC Men's T20 World Cup match between Pakistan and New Zealand.

She tells us what New Zealand’s victory means to the country, as well as discussing how they defied expectations to triumph in Dubai.We reflect on how the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup was won, pick out the most memorable moments from the tournament and discuss cricket's omission from the 2026 Commonwealth Games, despite having featured in Birmingham last time out.Plus, the team discuss some of the more unorthodox methods of preparing a wicket. It’s after industrial fans, patio heaters and wind breakers were all used on the pitch in Rawalpindi ahead of the third Test between Pakistan and England.Photo: New Zealand's players celebrate with their winning trophy at the end of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup cricket final match between South Africa and New Zealand at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai on October 20, 2024.
