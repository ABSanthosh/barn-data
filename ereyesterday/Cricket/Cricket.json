    "description": "Opening batter on playing his shots and a star-studded team pushing for a fourth successive County Championship titleYou can sort through all sorts of numbers when discussing Surrey‚Äôs recent hold on the County Championship. There is the obvious one: three consecutive titles, a feat that had not been accomplished since Yorkshire‚Äôs run in the late-1960s. They have lost just one match at home across those three seasons, and the numbers on the accounts are pretty, too ‚Äì though that is no guarantee of on-field success. But this one works best: of the 26 players they used in the championship last season, 16 have international caps, 13 with Test pedigree.Dom Sibley watches the rotating cast come and go, be it the England red-ball lot who start their summers in south London or the Indian Premier League crew who return for its end. Sibley and Rory Burns were the only two ever-presents in Surrey‚Äôs 2024 campaign, their opening partnership, previously seen with England, kicking off a county batting lineup featuring Ollie Pope, Jamie Smith and Dan Lawrence.

After the turbulent years following the fallout from Azeem Rafiq‚Äôs revelations, relegation in 2022 and two years of fines, disappearing sponsors, a points deduction and strained relationships between players and management, an uncanny calm seems to have settled over the spikey old ground.There‚Äôs a new coach in town, a new captain, two new fast antipodean bowlers to pound into the Yorkshire turf in Jordan Buckingham and Ben Sears. The club are debt free after Sunrisers Hyderabad took a 100% stake in Northern Superchargers ‚Äì though an argument over demutualisation is brewing on the horizon. There‚Äôs even a new coffee machine in the press box. Continue reading...",
