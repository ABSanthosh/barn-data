With the team having been bowled out for 180 on the first day of the first Test against West Indies in Barbados, Australia‚Äôs quicks turned around and returned the favour, keeping West Indies to 190, the lead to 10, and making the match a one-innings shootout in an often chaotic day. The second Australian batting effort then stuttered to 65-4, before improving the score by stumps to 92, a lead of 82.Spare yet another thought for Shamar Joseph. In three career outings against Australia, the West Indies pace prodigy has been a bowling Mozart, but he runs towards a slip cordon with more drops than Ti√´sto. In the first innings after getting Sam Konstas lbw, his notional catchers put down chances from Cameron Green and Usman Khawaja in the space of 10 balls, and Nathan Lyon later in the innings.
