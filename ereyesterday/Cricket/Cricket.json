It is being reported that the ICC are looking to make it into a two tiered competition, which would lead to the biggest nations playing each other more often. The plans could see India, Australia, England, South Africa, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Pakistan in tier one. While the second tier would be made up of Bangladesh, West Indies, Ireland, Afghanistan and Zimbabwe - making a seven-five split across divisions.Plus, after Australia ended a ten year wait to win the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, the team discuss the significance of captain Pat Cummins and ask if India head coach Gautam Gambhir is still the right man to lead the side.Photo: Tahlia McGrath of Australia looks dejected as she leads players of Australia off the field following defeat to South Africa during the ICC Women's T20 World Cup Semi-Final between Australia and South Africa at Dubai International Stadium on October 17, 2024 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
