    "description": "Waves crashing. Cicadas singing. And always the burble of cricket on the radio, unifying summers and people with its gentle pleasures for an uncertain worldMy father was a man of his generation, which meant when summer rolled around and the cricket season started, he insisted on muting Channel Nine’s coverage and blasting the ABC’s radio commentary instead.Ours was a complicated relationship but one thing for which I’ll be forever grateful was the way my father shared his love for Test cricket with me. I grew up as a cricket obsessive. My love for the game survived childhood, adolescence, and even the realisation that, given I was batting No 11 for South Melbourne under-12s, my dream to open the batting for Australia was unlikely to be fulfilled.

    "description": "Rose Bowl rivals meet in ODI at Basin Reserve in WellingtonAny thoughts? Send James an Email2nd over: Australia 9-0 (Healy 6, Litchfield 1) Litchfield clips off her toes to get off the mark. Penfold is trying to find some movement and she’s pitching very full but a bit too wide. The next ball is given wide too and then the over correction is too short, Healy pounces and swivels a pull for four. Penfold finds her length with the final three balls of the over but the forward defensive strokes all come ominously out of the middle of the bat.1st over: Australia 2-0 (Healy 2, Litchfield 0) It’s a sprightly start from Rosemary Mair who beats Healy with a beauty that angles in and seams away late. Close! A leading edge from Healy somehow finds the gap between point and backward and the batters scamper a couple of runs. That could have easily gone to hand and they are the only runs off the over. Continue reading...",
