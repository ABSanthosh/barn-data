    "description": "Somerset’s Tom Banton registered the fifth highest score in history when dismissed for 371 against WorcestershireI’m not going to say I’m disappointed, but I’ve definitely scored more than that in both garden and corridor. My sense is Banton was given the hurry-up by Gregory because he played at pretty much everything this morning, but it’s been a decent enough start to the season. And how nice to see the fielders congratulate him as he departed, before raising his bat one last time snd surveying a scene he’ll remember forever. Three hundred and seventy-one; you’d take it.He has one swipe too many, edges, and is caught behind. That’s the end of a mind-boggling and potentially career-revitalising knock; well batted, young man, well batted. Somerset declare on 670-7. Continue reading...",
