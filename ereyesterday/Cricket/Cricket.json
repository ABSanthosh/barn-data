Even saying this sells him a bit short. Of the 86 bowlers to go past 200 Test wickets, none have done so at a lower average than Bumrah‚Äôs 19.4.

    "description": "Alison Mitchell and Jim Maxwell are at Lord's for the World Test Championship Final between Australia and South Africa. They are joined by Charu Sharma in India to delve into Test cricket's past, present and future. We hear about the history of the format, the challenges faced and what we can learn from its past with cricket journalist Tim Wigmore who has written a book called Test Cricket: A History. We assess where Test cricket is at now focusing on Australia and South Africa and hear from two legends who have been inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame. Former Australia opener Matthew Hayden and former South Africa captain Graeme Smith speak to Alison Mitchell about if they believe Test cricket is in danger. Plus, the team debate what needs to be done to save Test cricket and how will it look in the future.Photo: A general view as members look on from the Pavilion during match play of the first South Africa innings on Day One of the ICC World Test Championship Final 2025 between South Africa and Australia at Lord's Cricket Ground on June 11, 2025 in London, England.
