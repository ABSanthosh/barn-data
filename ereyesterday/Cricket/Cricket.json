    "description": "England have said T20 is their best format but we take confidence from playing at home and having 11 players who can deliver a knockout blowThis is what we play cricket for. Even though we‚Äôve built up a 6-0 lead in the Ashes, all three games have felt like they‚Äôre on a knife‚Äôs edge at points. England have got themselves into winning positions and just haven‚Äôt been able to land their knockout blow, and we‚Äôve managed to find a way to win the key moments and come away with the two points. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs down to our group being able to handle those big moments better but we do relish the pressure.We‚Äôre at a really good place in the team where someone always stands up and takes hold of the game. We‚Äôre lucky in that sense that we‚Äôve got great depth in our side, as well as a good balance of personalities and skill sets. That really helps win those pressure moments, knowing that you can take the game on and not be too scared to leave it to someone else. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Alison Mitchell, Jim Maxwell and Charu Sharma are joined by Zimbabwe‚Äôs first black cricketer, Henry Olonga, as we ask whether boycotts work in cricket?It‚Äôs in light of political pressure on England and South Africa to pull out of their matches against Afghanistan‚Äôs men at next month's ICC Champions Trophy. It's due to the Taliban regime's oppression of women, which includes a ban on playing sport. Olonga, alongside Andy Flower, took a stand against Robert Mugabe‚Äôs regime by wearing a black armband in the 2003 World Cup game against Namibia. It was to symbolise \"the death of democracy\" in the country. Henry's been living in exile from Zimbabwe ever since and told the programme the current situation has echoes of 2003 and that the International Cricket Council and international Governments should be the ones making the decision not to play, rather than the players. We also talk to Australia Ashes winner now commentator, Mel Jones, on the role she played on getting many of those women out of the country when the Taliban returned to power in 2021.

Anya tells us both teams will have a point to prove after their World Cup disappointments and she highlights the key players to look out for.The Stumped team debate whether there should there be a two-tier World Test Championship?

While the second tier would be made up of Bangladesh, West Indies, Ireland, Afghanistan and Zimbabwe - making a seven-five split across divisions.Plus, after Australia ended a ten year wait to win the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, the team discuss the significance of captain Pat Cummins and ask if India head coach Gautam Gambhir is still the right man to lead the side.Photo: Tahlia McGrath of Australia looks dejected as she leads players of Australia off the field following defeat to South Africa during the ICC Women's T20 World Cup Semi-Final between Australia and South Africa at Dubai International Stadium on October 17, 2024 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
