He leaves after four years in the role in order to 'pursue other challenges'. Allardice was appointed as Chief Executive in 2021 of the ICC and during his tenure has been involved in major developments including bringing the Men's T20 World Cup to the USA and the creation of the World Test Championship. The decision comes less than two months after India's Jay Shah became Chair and with the Champions Trophy due to get underway next month. The Stumped team discuss his legacy and who may be appointed in the role.Hobart Hurricanes have won their first Big Bash title largely thanks to lifelong Hurricanes fan Mitchell Owen who scored 108 in the final. Clint Wheeldon tells us more about the hometown hero and what this could mean for his cricketing career.Plus history has been made at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with a Women's Test Match taking place there for the first time since 1949. The Test celebrates the 90th anniversary of Women's Test Cricket. We are joined by David Studham who is the librarian at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to tell us about their collection.Photo: Geoff Allardice, former cricketer and ICC chief during day five of the ICC World Test Championship Final between Australia and India at The Oval on June 11, 2023 in London, England.

We ask if changes need to be made after England lost the Ashes at the earliest possible opportunity and have now lost all five matches they have played in the series. Plus we are joined by South Africa Men’s Head Coach Shukri Conrad after his side made it to the World Test Championship Final. He tells us if he thinks a two-tier system is a good idea, shares his message to the Australia team and we ask him if South Africa should boycott the Champions Trophy? He also shares why he made Temba Bavuma captain and highlights the pressure that the captain faces.Photo: South Africa head coach Shukri Conrad during the day 1 of the 2nd Test match between West Indies and South Africa at Guyana National Stadium on August 15, 2024 in Georgetown, Guyana.
