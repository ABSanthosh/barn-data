    "description": "Fifth Test, day two: Australia 181, India 185 \u0026 141-6India’s bowlers step up after Bumrah hurts backPant smashes 61 from 31 balls as wickets tumbleWhen the fourth Australia-India Test at Melbourne finished with an hour to go on the final day, those who love the long game were sated. The experience was hearty and nutritious, like working your way through a large slice of dense and worthy rye bread. The first two days of the fifth Test here, by contrast, have been a pure sugar rush. Eleven wickets on day one were followed by 15 on day two, as the match careered towards a conclusion though a winner remains unclear.India all out 185 was the first-day story, but somehow that turned into a four-run lead. Reading that sentence could only leave the assumption that Jasprit Bumrah must have made that happen, but as it turned out that was only true of the first 20%. It was Bumrah who made Usman Khawaja nick behind on the first evening, a wicket on the very last ball of the last over and it was Bumrah the next morning who drew the faintest forensically detected edge from India’s roadblock in Melbourne, Marnus Labuschagne.

Email our writers35th over: India 148-7 (Washington 7, Siraj 1) Mohammed Siraj at No9 is not a comforting prospect for India. So presumably Bumrah will bat last, if he must, to make sure that warm-up is next to his bowling warm-up? The Indian camp said he had back spasms, which might be manageable. Siraj gets a run first ball though, to fine leg, and Washington has a big square drive to end the over but misses out. Siraj on strike in Boland’s second over. Not good for India.The lead is 152.

We debate the apparent unrest in the India dressing room and the potential retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Jim Maxwell says that the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is now bigger than the Ashes. Plus, we discuss whether South Africa deserve to be in the World Test Championship final after comments were made questioning their perceived easy route to the final.And we are joined by Ed Stoddart who is the CEO of Stuart Canvas productions. They manufacture hover covers, which are used around the world. Ed tells us about the significance of the technology and the impact of climate change.

    "description": "We look back at the best of Stumped in 2024, which gives you a chance to listen to some of the standout moments from the last twelve months including our trip to New York. The USA co-hosted the Men’s T20 World Cup for the first time and we spoke to fans from around the world about how cricket can grow in America. Plus, we spoke to Bryan R Caine who is an umpire in the United States about his love of the game and how it can develop in the future. We also hear from one of the greatest batters of all time, the West Indies legend Brian Lara who joined Alison in the commentary box at Lord’s. He shared what it meant to him when he scored 400 not out for his country and if he believes Test Cricket is sustainable long-term. New Zealand won their first ever T20 World Cup, when they beat South Africa in the final. All-rounder Maddy Green took us back to that special day and shared the emotion she felt about finally getting that winners medal around her neck. Plus, the Stumped team debate whether reaching 100 Test caps carries the same significance it used to? And arguably England’s greatest ever bowler Jimmy Anderson finally hung up his boots this year, when he retired from international cricket. He joined the team to talk about retirement, personal loss and what is next for both himself and England.Photo: Cricket fans cheer and wave the Indian flag during the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 at Nassau County International Cricket Stadium at Eisenhower Memorial Park in East Meadow, New York on June 9, 2024(Photo by J.
