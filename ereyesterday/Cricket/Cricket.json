    "description": "Captain picked up groin injury in stand with Joe RootEngland ‘want to kick on to a score towards 500’Ollie Pope said it was his role as vice-captain to ensure Ben Stokes “doesn’t push himself to a ridiculous place” as the captain battles a groin injury that forced him to seek treatment towards the end of the first day of the third Test against India.After receiving attention from the physio with just under an hour to play, the captain’s movement was noticeably impaired for the remainder of the final session, but he played on as England reached stumps on 251 for four. There are no plans to send him for scans, the hope being that he will recover overnight and, alongside Joe Root – who is unbeaten on 99 – “really kick on and make it a score north of 400, towards 500”.

    "description": "Ben Stokes chose to bat but conditions and the opposition led to hosts’ slowest Test run rate in a session for three yearsHigh summer can be hard going at Lord’s. It was tough enough on the spectators, who worked up a sweat just standing in the queues to get in to the ground. If you had seats in the open terraces at the bottom of the Edrich, Compton and Mound Stands, where you get slow-roasted by the sun as it makes its way slowly above the pavilion, your best bet was to make for the shade round by the Nursery Ground. It was too darn hot to sit and watch cricket and a lot of the cricket wasn’t worth watching anyway. The conditions meant the players seemed to be on a go-slow, England’s run rate was sickly and India’s over rate appeared, at one point, to have given up and died.It was one of those afternoons when no matter what was actually happening out in the middle, any time you looked up to watch, someone always seemed to be playing a forward defence against Nitish Kumar Reddy. He runs in so slowly that it’s like watching an optical illusion. He almost seems to be moving backwards, like a man losing ground on a treadmill. The mysteries of the Lord’s pitch made medium pace all but unplayable, and the best of England’s batsmen were entirely unable to find their timing so, on the occasions they actually connected with the ball, it invariably clacked off the bat and dribbled into the outfield.

Former England men’s spinner and current England men’s U19s Head Coach, Michael Yardy, tells Stumped the future of English cricket is in good hands as his side prepare to face their Indian counterparts in a two-match Test series. He also gives us his take on India’s 14-year-old batting sensation, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, who’s been the standout player for the tourists so far. And, we debate whether South Africa’s stand-in captain Wiann Mulder did the right thing declaring himself just 33 runs short of Brian Lara's record for the highest individual score in a Test innings.Photo: Richa Ghosh and Jemimah Rodrigues of India celebrate hitting the winning runs following the 4th Women's Vitality IT20 match between England and India at Emirates Old Trafford on July 09, 2025 in Manchester, England.
