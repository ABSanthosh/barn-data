It is being reported that the ICC are looking to make it into a two tiered competition, which would lead to the biggest nations playing each other more often. The plans could see India, Australia, England, South Africa, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Pakistan in tier one. While the second tier would be made up of Bangladesh, West Indies, Ireland, Afghanistan and Zimbabwe - making a seven-five split across divisions.Plus, after Australia ended a ten year wait to win the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, the team discuss the significance of captain Pat Cummins and ask if India head coach Gautam Gambhir is still the right man to lead the side.Photo: Tahlia McGrath of Australia looks dejected as she leads players of Australia off the field following defeat to South Africa during the ICC Women's T20 World Cup Semi-Final between Australia and South Africa at Dubai International Stadium on October 17, 2024 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

    "description": "Alison Mitchell, Jim Maxwell and Charu Sharma discuss the record breaking Test Match between Australia and India in Melbourne. The teams now play each other in Sydney with the series 2-1 in favour of the Australian side who will win the trophy for the first since 2015 if they avoid defeat. We debate the apparent unrest in the India dressing room and the potential retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Jim Maxwell says that the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is now bigger than the Ashes. Plus, we discuss whether South Africa deserve to be in the World Test Championship final after comments were made questioning their perceived easy route to the final.And we are joined by Ed Stoddart who is the CEO of Stuart Canvas productions. They manufacture hover covers, which are used around the world. Ed tells us about the significance of the technology and the impact of climate change.
