A lacklustre high five with Sutherland confirmed Wolvaardt was indeed out, but McGrath knew that it was simply too little, too late.It was a moment that encapsulated the match, with disappointment and frustration written all over the faces of the Australians time and again as they tried to find a foothold with which to get themselves out of trouble.
