    "description": "Australia 104 and 12-3; India 150 and 487-6 decHosts suffer on brutal day in field and at creaseCricket probably doesn’t owe Virat Kohli anything. It has given him riches beyond imagination, influence beyond reason, recognition that has built into idolatry. But then, he has given cricket riches, both in the literal cash churned from his name and the intangible of what his story has added to the game. So if the game owed him anything, perhaps it was a lucky break, one generous chance at a century to ease the tension of a lean 18 months without one. Walking out with India two wickets down, 321 runs ahead, with Yashasvi Jaiswal immaculately set on 141 and Australia already wheezing, the game delivered one.The third day of this first Test saw the real Perth appear. Not the mild impostor of the two days prior, with their gentle temperatures and occasional cloud. By the middle of day three, even in the shade, the heat buffeted up against you like a herd of cattle jostling through a gate. Horrible stuff to bowl in, more horrible still for players who knew they had let a match slip with a bad batting hour of their own. Continue reading...",
