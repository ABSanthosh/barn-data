The USA co-hosted the Menâ€™s T20 World Cup for the first time and we spoke to fans from around the world about how cricket can grow in America. Plus, we spoke to Bryan R Caine who is an umpire in the United States about his love of the game and how it can develop in the future. We also hear from one of the greatest batters of all time, the West Indies legend Brian Lara who joined Alison in the commentary box at Lordâ€™s. He shared what it meant to him when he scored 400 not out for his country and if he believes Test Cricket is sustainable long-term. New Zealand won their first ever T20 World Cup, when they beat South Africa in the final. All-rounder Maddy Green took us back to that special day and shared the emotion she felt about finally getting that winners medal around her neck. Plus, the Stumped team debate whether reaching 100 Test caps carries the same significance it used to? And arguably Englandâ€™s greatest ever bowler Jimmy Anderson finally hung up his boots this year, when he retired from international cricket. He joined the team to talk about retirement, personal loss and what is next for both himself and England.Photo: Cricket fans cheer and wave the Indian flag during the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 at Nassau County International Cricket Stadium at Eisenhower Memorial Park in East Meadow, New York on June 9, 2024(Photo by J.
