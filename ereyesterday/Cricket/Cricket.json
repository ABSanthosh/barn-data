They are joined by Charu Sharma in India to delve into Test cricket's past, present and future. We hear about the history of the format, the challenges faced and what we can learn from its past with cricket journalist Tim Wigmore who has written a book called Test Cricket: A History. We assess where Test cricket is at now focusing on Australia and South Africa and hear from two legends who have been inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame. Former Australia opener Matthew Hayden and former South Africa captain Graeme Smith speak to Alison Mitchell about if they believe Test cricket is in danger. Plus, the team debate what needs to be done to save Test cricket and how will it look in the future.Photo: A general view as members look on from the Pavilion during match play of the first South Africa innings on Day One of the ICC World Test Championship Final 2025 between South Africa and Australia at Lord's Cricket Ground on June 11, 2025 in London, England.

    "description": "On this week’s Stumped with Alison Mitchell, Jim Maxwell \u0026 Charu Sharma, the team ask whether Virat Kohli has finally completed cricket after getting his hands on the trophy that has eluded him throughout his stellar white ball career.He won the Indian Premier League with Royal Challengers Bengaluru after 18 years and over 260 matches, having first been drafted by them back in 2008, and he’s been loyal to them too - the only player to have played for just one team in all 18 IPL seasons.The team also reflect on the sad scenes in Bangalore, after eleven people died and dozens were injured in a crush as fans flocked to the Chinnaswamy stadium at an event to welcome the team back home to Bangalore. Plus, we hear from South Africa Test captain Temba Bavuma ahead of the World Test Championship final. Bavuma tells us that Kagiso Rabada has apologised to his teammates and that they're supporting him as much as they can following his recent one month ban from cricket after he tested positive for use of a recreational drug.Photo: Virat Kohli of Royal Challengers Bengaluru lifts the IPL trophy alongside teammates following the team's victory in the 2025 IPL Final match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings at Narendra Modi Stadium on June 03, 2025, in Ahmedabad, India.
