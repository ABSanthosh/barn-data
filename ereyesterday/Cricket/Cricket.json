On a ­sultry night at the Dubai International ­Stadium, we got the entirely foreseeable answer. Pakistan’s tournament is India’s glory, by four wickets with six balls to spare: a triumph that felt as immaculately controlled as the months of sabre-rattling and politicking that preceded it.None of which is to diminish the acclaim due to India’s players: men of skill and men of character, men who step up and deliver under pressure.
