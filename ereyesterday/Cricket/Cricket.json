Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler or Ben Foakes: who should keep wicket for England‚Äôs Test team?That debate has lost relevance. When Jamie Smith went on paternity leave for the tour of New Zealand at the end of last year, Essex‚Äôs Jordan Cox was his replacement. When Cox fractured his thumb before the series, Durham‚Äôs Ollie Robinson was next on the call sheet, though Ollie Pope ended up with the gloves for all three Tests.

There is the obvious one: three consecutive titles, a feat that had not been accomplished since Yorkshire‚Äôs run in the late-1960s. They have lost just one match at home across those three seasons, and the numbers on the accounts are pretty, too ‚Äì though that is no guarantee of on-field success. But this one works best: of the 26 players they used in the championship last season, 16 have international caps, 13 with Test pedigree.Dom Sibley watches the rotating cast come and go, be it the England red-ball lot who start their summers in south London or the Indian Premier League crew who return for its end. Sibley and Rory Burns were the only two ever-presents in Surrey‚Äôs 2024 campaign, their opening partnership, previously seen with England, kicking off a county batting lineup featuring Ollie Pope, Jamie Smith and Dan Lawrence.
