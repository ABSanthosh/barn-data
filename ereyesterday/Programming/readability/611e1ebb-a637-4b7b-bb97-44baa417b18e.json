  "text": "It's even worse than it appears.. A big update for Bookmarks in the latest release of WordLand.# Upton Sinclair: ‚ÄúIt is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.‚Äù# We had the world conned into taking our ‚Äúdollars‚Äù and giving us cars, food, nice vacations, drugs, a huge military, all kinds of manufactured stuff for nothing, and we thought they were ripping us off! So we blew it up. The would-be ‚ÄúArt Of The Con‚Äù mastermind undid the biggest con in history.# The great thing about sports is that a lowly software developer can be richer than a fantastically rich team owner, if the developer's team is the Knicks. # Fight Club for Tech was a pet idea until I screwed something up and seemed to have lost control of it, but I just found it in the list of my WordPress sites, so I guess I can post to it again?# I think the shape of the intellectual world will be vastly different after AI, and that its impact will overshadow the web as the web made card catalogs irrelevant. I'm pretty sure whatever comes next won't look very much like what we're using now, but it will probably evolve from what we have, although it's impossible to know.# I have been writing the colorful saga of my sad depressed programmer friend on Facebook, and it was getting some interest from friends until I moved it into a group and now no one reads it, which makes me sad and depressed too because the story of my programmer friend took an interesting turn after he maxed out on space, got a call from the NBA commisioner asking if he would mind officiating the Knicks two playoff games in Boston this last week. My friend, was of course quite sad and depressed, but he was also exhausted and bored, so he said yes. Here he is before the first of two games, which partially thanks to his officiating were near-blowouts for the Celtics, and thus the Knicks are up 2-0 heading into tomorrow's game in New York.# Friend sadly officiating at the TD Garden in Boston.# I have to say the latest Baseline theme looks great!# Here's a blog post I just wrote, in the WordLand editor, and the writing experience was excellent. It took a long time and a lot of work to get it there, but it is there now. # But as the post says, it's not just a blog post, it's also a tweet. And it's not a miracle, it's just endless iteration over both sides, the reading and writing, until it felt right. So far all that's visible is the writing side. But I know something about reading too, having written a number of feed readers over the years, including the first one. üòÑ# With Scott Hanson on one side of this effort and me on the other, him the developer, me the user (ie writer of blog posts and tweets) -- we wrestled with WordPress themes. I wanted a minimal design, a place to start -- which is why the theme is called Baseline. It's a Christmas Tree without any ornaments. None. A fresh start. # There will be a release of this theme in a short while. I just wanted to boast a bit about what it can do.# Screen shot of the post rendered in Baseline theme.# The blog post viewed in the web. # Screen shot of the post being edited in WordLand.#",
