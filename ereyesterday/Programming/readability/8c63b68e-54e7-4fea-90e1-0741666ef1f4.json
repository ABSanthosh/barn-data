  "text": "While everyone likes flowers and chocolates, why not show your love for your favorite open source projects this Valentineâ€™s and give appreciation to the maintainers who keep them running? Many of the open source projects we rely on every day are maintained by dedicated volunteers. Sponsoring projects isnâ€™t just about altruism, itâ€™s about investing in the future. Many maintainers work on open source projects in their spare time. Sponsorships can help them dedicate more time to the projects you depend on. With financial support, maintainers can help cover costs such as development and hosting. When you sponsor a maintainer, youâ€™re helping them continue their work and letting them know you value the creativity and love theyâ€™ve poured into their project. For this Valentineâ€™s Day, letâ€™s show love to the maintainers who keep our favorite projects alive and thriving. The benefits of financial sponsorship Sponsorship is a tangible way to show support for the open source community. It can be a huge morale boost, as well as bring visibility and validation. Sponsored projects often gain more attention, leading to a virtuous cycle of more contributors and users, which results in better software for everyone. Getting started: How to best invest in open source Identify critical dependencies: Review your projectâ€™s dependencies to identify which open source libraries and tools are crucial to your operations. If you use tools like npm, pip, or maven, you can review their dependencies and prioritize which are critical to your projectâ€™s success. Evaluate the project activity: Check the recent and trending activity of repositories and look for signs of contributions, shipped features, bug fixes, active maintenance, and community engagement. Helpful metrics like recent commits, issue resolution, and community engagement are all good markers for where funding could help. Projects with a high impact but low funding could be great candidates to prioritize for sponsorship. Engage with the project: Take the opportunity to look at the issues and contribution guidelines. Try to understand their funding needs and how your support makes a difference. But also consider investing in ways beyond just financial support. You could provide bug fixes if you feel confident in your code. You could also take the time to tell someone about the project and why you think itâ€™s awesome. Return the love Maintainers can show love for their sponsors as well. Sponsors appreciate knowing their contribution is making a difference. Whether itâ€™s a simple mention on social media to acknowledge their contribution, featuring them on your GitHub Sponsors profile, exclusive updates and behind-the-scenes insights about your project and community, or even a brief personalized thank-you message, tokens of appreciation can help bring more funding your way. This Valentineâ€™s Day, letâ€™s show our favorite projects a bit more appreciation. Whether itâ€™s a heartfelt contribution to fix bugs or docs, spreading the word about why itâ€™s a great project and helping people use it, or a sweet one-time donation, every bit helps keep our beloved digital world turning. Ready to start sponsoring? Visit GitHub Sponsors and find the projects that matter most to you. Happy Valentineâ€™s Day to all the open source contributors and supporters out there! And remember, you donâ€™t need to wait for a special occasion like Valentineâ€™s Day to show your appreciation for maintainersâ€”every day is a perfect day to support open source! ðŸ’– Written by VP of Developer Relations Related posts Explore more from GitHub Docs Everything you need to master GitHub, all in one place.
