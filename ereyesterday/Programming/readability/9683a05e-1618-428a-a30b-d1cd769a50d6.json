Help 550k+ global senior developers each month stay ahead.Get in touch Listen to this article -  0:00 Software development is undergoing a fundamental shift. Senior developers, architects, and engineering leaders are contending with the rapid rise of generative AI, evolving platform architectures, and increasing demands for developer efficiency and autonomy. These challenges are urgent, and solving them requires insights rooted in real-world systems. InfoQ Dev Summit Boston 2025, taking place June 9-10, is designed to address these critical concerns. The event offers two days of curated, technical talks delivered by engineers actively working at scale. With over 27 sessions focused on helping teams navigate the next 18 months of software evolution, attendees will leave with the clarity and context needed to make better decisions. Deep Technical Talks Grounded in Practice The summit presents peer-reviewed sessions that provide actionable insights, not high-level overviews. Talks are chosen through the InfoQ editorial lens of \"what you should know\" and \"what you should do\", ensuring practical relevance. Highlights from the program include: Key Lessons from Shipping AI Products Beyond the Hype: Phil Calçado, Founder \u0026 CEO at Outropy, previously pioneered microservices architecture at SoundCloud, shares lessons learned from deploying an AI assistant to over 10,000 users. His session outlines the architectural and operational realities of building stateful, stochastic systems. Empathy Driven Platforms: You Build It, Let’s Run It Together: Erin Doyle, Founding Engineer at Quotient, explains how her team designed a self-service platform that improves psychological safety and reduces operational friction. Systems Thinking for Scaling Responsible Multi-Agent Architectures: Nimisha Asthagiri, Principal Data \u0026 AI at Thoughtworks, discusses how to scale multi-agent architectures using systems thinking while embedding ethical constraints into technical design. Thinking Like a Detective: Solving Cloud Infrastructure Mysteries: Brendan McLoughlin, Frontend Architect at CarGurus, presents techniques for identifying hard-to-diagnose infrastructure issues using structured investigative methods. The Ideal Micro-Frontends Platform: Luca Mezzalira, Principal Serverless Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS, and author of \"Building Micro-Frontends\", outlines scenarios where micro-frontends add value—and where they introduce unnecessary complexity. Building an Internal Developer Portal that Empowers Developers: Travis Gosselin, Distinguished Engineer of Developer Experience at SPS Commerce, explores how an internal developer portal helped boost productivity, reduce onboarding time, and enhance service ownership. These sessions reflect a broader focus on platform engineering, team productivity, and scalable architecture, all tailored to help teams make tangible progress on pressing priorities. Designed for Senior Engineers, Architects, and Team Leads The summit is structured for those setting direction, influencing technical strategy, or leading engineering teams. Attendees can expect to learn: Emerging architectural approaches and tools that are reshaping how modern teams deliver software Frameworks for assessing, piloting, and operationalizing new technologies at scale Real-world platform strategies successfully implemented in high-demand environments Case studies illustrating the impact of design decisions, trade-offs, and long-term consequences Informal opportunities to exchange ideas with peers in similar technical leadership roles. The format balances structured talks with time for peer exchange and in-depth discussion. For more details and to register, visit the conference website.
