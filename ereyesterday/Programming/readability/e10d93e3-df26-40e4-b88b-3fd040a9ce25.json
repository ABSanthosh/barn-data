  "text": "The new US administration has decided to eliminate the “X” option for gender/sex on passports. I have several non-binary friends, and I don’t see why they should have to select an option that makes no sense for them. I also don’t see how an “X” option on identity documents causes a material problem for anyone else. There’s not much I can do to object to this change, but one little thing is to add a comment on the Federal Register for such rule changes. There are three such pages: DS-11 new passport application: (deadline 3/17/25) https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/14/2025-02648/30-day-notice-of-proposed-information-collection-application-for-a-us-passport DS-82 passport renewal: (deadline 3/20/25) https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/18/2025-02697/30-day-notice-of-proposed-information-collection-us-passport-renewal-application-for-eligible DS-5504 name change or data corrections: (deadline 3/20/25) https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/18/2025-02696/30-day-notice-of-proposed-information-collection-application-for-a-us-passport-for-eligible It didn’t take me more than a few minutes to make a brief comment (essentially the first three sentences of this post) on all three. Pretty inconsequential compared to the problems facing my non-binary friends.",
