  "link": "http://www.developertea.com",
  "description": "This episode introduces a simple quadrant tool to visualise different working modes that a team or individual task might be in, based on levels of autonomy and definition. Understand how the quadrant is built using the X-axis of dependency (high to low) and the Y-axis of definition (high to low) to visualise different work modes. Explore how the bottom left quadrant represents work that is highly exploratory and highly dependent, often requiring collaboration across multiple departments. Learn how a \"spike\" usually fits into the bottom right quadrant, signifying autonomous exploration. Discover how the top left quadrant is for work that is highly dependent but highly defined, such as a migration project or adopting a new tool. Understand how the top right quadrant represents work that is the most defined and the most autonomous, typically a singular task assigned to an individual. Recognise that many development frameworks focus on optimising work to fit in the top right quadrant to improve flow by reducing dependencies. Consider that the top left quadrant is often the lowest value production due to high dependencies without creative thinking. Realise that exploratory work, if unguided, can be a liability, and it may be useful to involve more people in the exploration or ensure the individual has significant experience. Be aware that processes are often optimised for tasks in the top right quadrant, potentially leading to the avoidance of work in other quadrants.ðŸ“® Ask a QuestionIf you enjoyed this episode and would like me to discuss a question that you have on the show, drop it over at: developertea.com.ðŸ“® Join the DiscordIf you want to be a part of a supportive community of engineers (non-engineers welcome!) working to improve their lives and careers, join us on the Developer Tea Discord community by visiting https://developertea.com/discord today!ðŸ§¡ Leave a ReviewIf you're enjoying the show and want to support the content head over to iTunes and leave a review!
