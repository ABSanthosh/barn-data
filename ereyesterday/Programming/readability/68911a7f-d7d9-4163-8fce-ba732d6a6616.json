Marketplace PluginsTrader Verification Requirement on JetBrains Marketplace To comply with the Omnibus Directive 2019/2161, JetBrains Marketplace requires plugin vendors to declare whether they act as professional traders or not. This ensures that consumers are properly informed about the legal status of those offering plugins on the platform and their corresponding rights stemming from the EU consumer protection laws.The Digital Services Act (DSA) has introduced new verification steps for vendors classified as traders. What Has Changed Vendors who declare themselves as traders are now required to provide additional verification details that were not previously collected. This includes contact information, business or personal identification documents, and banking details. Vendors who have not completed this verification process are subject to suspension from JetBrains Marketplace services. Trader vs. Non-Trader: What’s the Difference? Before proceeding, it’s important to understand the difference between traders and non-traders: Trader is any natural or legal person acting for purposes related to their trade, business, craft, or profession — whether the plugins are free or paid. Non-Trader (peer-consumer) is a natural person offering plugins outside of a trade, business, or professional context. Some criteria that may indicate trader status include: Engaging in sales intended to generate profit Having a legal status that enables commercial activity Being subject to VAT Receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly You can find more details in the European Commission guidance. What Information Is Required? If you’re classified as a trader, JetBrains now asks you to provide the following information: Under the Main Information tab in your vendor account, you’ll need to enter your address, phone number, and email: Under the Trader Details tab, you’ll be asked for additional information based on the type of trader you are: Legal Entities: Entity name and registration number Individuals: Full name and a copy of your identification document In addition, all traders are required to provide their payment account details: All traders must also certify that their plugins comply with the applicable EU laws. In some cases, additional details may be requested to properly assess the provided information. Information Visible to Consumers End-users of your plugins will be informed whether consumer protection laws apply, based on your declared status. If you’re classified as a trader, your name, email, address, phone number and registration number (for the business legal entities) will be visible to users. Please note: it’s the vendor’s responsibility to declare their correct trader or non-trader status. This guidance is for informational purposes only — JetBrains cannot offer individual consultations on determining your status. Need Assistance? If you missed the deadline to provide the required information or believe your trader status was assessed incorrectly or has changed, please contact the Marketplace team at marketplace@jetbrains.com.
