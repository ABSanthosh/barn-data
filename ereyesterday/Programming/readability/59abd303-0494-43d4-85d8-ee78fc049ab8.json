  "text": "Authentication is a key requirement for any B2B software application, especially if software vendors are selling to enterprise clients who are likely to have strict authentication requirements for the vendors they use. However, building authentication for a B2B application is typically complex and resource-intensive due to the data models required, the provisioning and managing accounts, and additional security and scale concerns. Julianna Lamb is the Co-Founder and CTO of Stytch which is building an all-in-one platform for identity and access management. She joins the podcast with Gregor Vand to talk about the platform. Gregor Vand is a security-focused technologist, and is the founder and CTO of Mailpass. Previously, Gregor was a CTO across cybersecurity, cyber insurance and general software engineering companies. He has been based in Asia Pacific for almost a decade and can be found via his profile at vand.hk.
