  "text": "Have I Been Pwned (HIBP)- the popular data breach notification service founded by security researcher Troy Hunt, has launched a major front-end redesign aimed at improving breach visibility and laying the groundwork for future capabilities. In an interview with InfoQ, Hunt highlighted automation, family account enrollment, and improved enterprise workflows as immediate next steps, while calling for stronger breach disclosure norms across the industry. The update introduces a modernized user experience and several new pages focused on helping both individuals and organizations more easily monitor exposed credentials and domains. Hunt emphasizes that the update was not merely a technical overhaul but a response to the evolving needs of the user base. He mentions that after interacting with users worldwide, a recurring theme emerged: the desire for HIBP to be more approachable and user-friendly.  Hunt says the rebuild also lays the groundwork for future capabilities - including support for passkeys and delegated account management that reflect emerging security trends and real-world usage patterns. One example he cites is the ability to enroll family members’ email addresses, aimed at users who act as informal tech support for others. The version 2.0 update introduces several new front-end features aimed at improving usability and situational awareness. The redesigned Search page offers faster response times and a cleaner layout, while a new Breach page (below) provides a clearer breakdown of breach details. Source: troyhunt.com The new dashboard page (below) consolidates a user’s monitored email addresses and domain results into a single view, providing persistent visibility into breach activity without requiring a new search each time. Source: troyhunt.com Paying subscribers who manage and monitor multiple domains can view who within their organization has been impacted using the overhauled domain search experience. Furthermore, Hunt discusses the rationale behind specific, smaller changes, such as the removal of username and phone number search support from the website. He explains that these features were initially introduced for specific incidents but were rarely utilized thereafter. The decision to remove them was based on factors like parsing difficulties, notification limitations, and user confusion. With growing demand from both individuals and organizations - including those managing large sets of users and domains - automation, visibility, and responsible disclosure are seen as ongoing priorities for the application. InfoQ reached out to Troy Hunt to learn more about the motivations behind the release and where he sees HIBP evolving next. InfoQ: Do you see HIBP evolving as authentication shifts toward passkeys, federated identity, and AI-driven security tooling? Troy Hunt: These are all great steps forward, but don’t really change the likelihood of data breaches occurring. They do change the impact of them (i.e. passkeys instead of passwords means no reuse and account takeover due to a leaked password), but it won’t stop all your other PII from being exposed. InfoQ: Now that the release is live, what capabilities or use cases are you most excited to explore next? Hunt: This is going to sound really boring, but the next priority is to automate requests that we’re currently manually processing - namely enabling resellers to manage their customers and allowing our Director customers to create quotes without raising tickets for us. This has been a bit of an unfortunate reality with running a service that now has paying customers where we need to help them navigate corporate compliance and procurement regimes, and we want to delegate that work away to automated processes as fast as possible. I’m genuinely excited about now adding features such as the ability to enroll family members' email addresses for people like me who play tech support for everyone else. InfoQ: In your view, what areas of breach notification or data protection remain underserved and what innovations might we see in the next few years? Hunt: This is a massive one for me and I’ve literally been travelling the world talking to governments and law enforcement agencies about this: Disclosure. So often, data breach victims simply aren't told about their exposure and usually, that's a completely legal position for the company to take. I wrote about it in depth in September: The Data Breach Disclosure Conundrum. About the Author Matt Foster",
