  "text": "Illia Polosukhin is a veteran AI researcher and one of the original authors of the landmark Transformer paper, Attention is All You Need, which he co-authored during his time at Google Research. He has a deep background in machine learning and natural language processing, and has spent over a decade working at the intersection of AI and decentralized technologies. His current venture is called NEAR AI, and He’s focused on building open-source infrastructure, tools, and products for Agentic, privacy-preserving AI systems. He joins the podcast with Kevin Ball to discuss his journey, the origins of the Transformer model, the vision for user-owned AI, document-oriented development, and much more. Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders. He co-founded and served as CTO for two companies, founded the San Diego JavaScript meetup, and organizes the AI inaction discussion group through Latent Space.
