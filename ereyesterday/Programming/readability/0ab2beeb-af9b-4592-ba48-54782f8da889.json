  "text": "It's even worse than it appears.. I bet Bezos wishes he owned Twitter instead of Musk.# Lots of Yankees fans at the Garden yesterday to see the great Knicks team of last year show up for the first time. The game in Boston on Tuesday was disheartening. It's a new team with the core of last year's team. And when the fans started roaring when there was nothing happening on the court, last night at the (NY) Garden, it was because the Yankees had scored in the World Series game 2794 miles away in Los Angeles. This is the inconvenience of being a Knicks fan who hates the freaking Yankees. We have to share an NBA team. The Knicks are much more like the Mets than that other team. That's why it's so incredible to see the 2024 Knicks be able to manage both ends of the court, and completely shut down a team that last year beat them in playoffs, the Pacers, just like last year, but better. A validation of everything. Now the team has to stay healthy. But, even if they don't fly the Nazi flag at Trump's rally tomorrow, you know that they want to, and some of them probably brought them. It's a funny time for the Garden. The owner of the Garden btw is James Dolan. We try to overlook that he owns the Knicks and he seems to be cooperating by staying out of the our faces. But he is known as a vile man to the people of New York.# BTW if you're thinking why don't we just go for the Nets. As I've said here many times, there aren't actually any Nets fans to speak of in NY. That was the huge self-parody Kevin Durant did when he claimed there was some kind of rivalry between the Nets and the Knicks. Really unfortunate unforced error he could have just asked a few people where are all the Nets fans. # So when the Dodger hit the walk-off grand slam last night, half of me was ecstatic because the Yankees were beaten, but oops, but I hate it even more that the freaking Dodgers won. This World Series is unique in that I desperately want both teams to lose. What do you do with that??# It probably does no good to cancel your Washington Post subscription. It's hard to imagine Bezos would lose any money from a complete writedown. Any loss would offset gains he would receive from selling a tiny bit of Amazon stock, it would wash out on his balance sheet.# You can't hurt him with money. In fact I'm pretty sure we can't hurt him in any way. So why not keep the reporters employed, for once the seem to be doing the right thing and keeping us in the loop on why they're doing the awful thing they're doing. Usually we're kept in the dark. #",
