A common challenge in data-focused organizations is how to make data accessible to the wider organization, without the need for large data teams. Metabase is an open source business intelligence tool that focuses on data exploration, visualization, and analysis. It offers a lightweight deployment strategy and aims to solve common challenges around data-driven decision making. A key aspect of its interface is that it allows users to interact with data with, or without, SQL. Sameer Al-Sakran is the founder and CEO of Metabase. He joins the show to talk about the challenge of data accessibility, the evolution of the data analytics field, key lessons from his 14 years leading Metabase, why the platform uses the Clojure language, and much more. Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by Metabase. Sean’s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler. He has published works covering a wide range of topics from AI to quantum computing. Currently, Sean is an AI Entrepreneur in Residence at Confluent where he works on AI strategy and thought leadership. You can connect with Sean on LinkedIn. .",
