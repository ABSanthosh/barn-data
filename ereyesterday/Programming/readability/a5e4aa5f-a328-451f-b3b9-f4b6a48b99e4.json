  "text": "Grand Theft Auto III is a 2001 an open-world action-adventure game developed by Rockstar Games and it had a profound impact on both gaming and popular culture. Its success cemented video games as a dominant form of entertainment and storytelling, and paved the way for future blockbuster franchises. The game was also a technological milestone that redefined what was possible in open-world game design. It was one of the first fully 3D open-world games to offer seamless exploration, blending mission-based gameplay with a living, breathing city. The game was originally released on PlayStation 2 and PC but never had an official Sega Dreamcast version. However, the homebrew community embarked on the goal of porting the game to the Dreamcast, and recently released the port to much acclaim. Falco Girgis and Stef Kornilios Mitsis Poiitidis are developers on the GTA3 Dreamcast port. They join the podcast to talk about the Dreamcast hardware and the heroic task of porting GTA3 to the console. Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders. He co-founded and served as CTO for two companies, founded the San Diego JavaScript meetup, and organizes the AI inaction discussion group through Latent Space.
