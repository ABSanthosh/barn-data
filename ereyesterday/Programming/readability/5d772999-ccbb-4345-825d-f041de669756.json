  "description": "It was so predictable. Shortly after Pete Rose died, baseball rescinded his lifetime ban, and now he can be inducted into the Hall of Fame. I grew up with a Pete Rose ethos, why shouldn't I go for it all? I feel so sad that he couldn't have gotten the acceptance he so totally deserved. How could we not forgive him? He was Charlie Hustle! ❤️ A role model in so many ways, and like all heroes he had fatal flaws. You may think he set a bad example for kids, but I say the opposite. You don't give kids enough credit. What he taught was that a man with average athletic ability could will himself to achieve. He had more hits than any baseball player ever. Pete Rose was Charlie Hustle.",
