  "text": "We are excited to announce the general availability of GitLab Duo Self-Hosted for Code Suggestions and Chat. An optional capability for self-managed customers with a GitLab Duo Enterprise subscription, GitLab Duo Self-Hosted supports deployment flexibility across multiple platforms, including on-premises infrastructure or in private clouds and secure cloud environments through AWS Bedrock and Azure OpenAI. GitLab Duo Self-Hosted empowers teams to innovate with AI while helping them maintain control over sensitive data and intellectual property. Security concerns have been a major barrier to AI adoption in regulated industries. In our Global DevSecOps Survey, more than half of the respondents said that introducing AI into the software development lifecycle is risky. With GitLab Duo, we gave organizations a way to ship more secure software faster with AI throughout the entire software development lifecycle. GitLab Duo Self-Hosted expands the availability of GitLab Duo AI features to organizations with stringent data privacy requirements, offering flexibility in both AI large language model (LLM) selection and deployment options. The earliest adopters of GitLab Duo Self-Hosted include organizations in the public sector and regulated industries – e.g., financial services, automotive, and healthcare. These organizations seek to gain the competitive advantage of AI by integrating AI-powered development tools into their environments, while also giving security teams the control they need. As one U.S. government agency says: “After selecting GitLab as the cornerstone of our agency-wide DevSecOps platform, we chose GitLab Duo Self-Hosted to further advance our software factory capabilities. GitLab Duo’s ability to operate in air-gapped environments and provide granular control over our data was crucial to delivering secure AI-powered features. This unified approach streamlines our workflow and strengthens security, allowing us to leverage AI for increased productivity while meeting strict compliance requirements.” Architect secure AI deployments GitLab Duo Self-Hosted enables GitLab Duo features that leverage a curated selection of leading AI LLMs, including those from Anthropic, Mistral, and OpenAI. Here are the LLMs supported by GitLab today: On-premises - Mistral models with the vLLM serving platform AWS - Mistral and Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet via AWS Bedrock Microsoft Azure - OpenAI GPT models via Azure AI We are evaluating more models to support in the near future. Learn more about the LLMs we support. GitLab Duo Self-Hosted deployment options include on-premises installations powered by the open-source vLLM framework, as well as private-cloud deployments via services like AWS Bedrock and Microsoft Azure AI. This flexibility helps organizations to architect AI solutions that align with their unique security, compliance, and performance requirements. Simplify AI/ML implementation GitLab Duo's AI abstraction layer standardizes and simplifies the integration of the chosen LLM to a feature, mitigating the burden of implementing AI/ML technologies. This enables companies to streamline their AI adoption efforts and enhance the developer experience, free from the complexities of integrating and maintaining multiple tools. Maintain control of sensitive data By isolating your GitLab instance, AI gateway, and LLMs in your own environment or country of choice, GitLab Duo Self-Hosted makes it possible that sensitive data and intellectual property remain within your designated perimeter. Granular control over data locality helps enable adherence to strict data residency regulations, while adopting AI capabilities in secure settings. Whether you use GitLab Duo Self-Hosted in a completely air-gapped environment with vLLM or leverage a supported private cloud, you can control all aspects of the deployment to include the geographic location of components. By eliminating the reliance on external APIs and providing full visibility into all request and response logs, GitLab Duo Self-Hosted helps even the most regulated organizations confidently adopt AI capabilities and meet the most stringent compliance obligations.

By eliminating the reliance on external APIs and providing full visibility into all request and response logs, GitLab Duo Self-Hosted helps even the most regulated organizations confidently adopt AI capabilities and meet the most stringent compliance obligations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStart an interactive tour of GitLab Self-Hosted by clicking on the image below:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://gitlab.navattic.com/gitlab-duo-self-hosted\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/2VpxB3n1RmKvOYYuWWc41G/71de49c5aba30e07e6d93b00aa086eef/Screenshot_2025-02-20_at_7.00.34_AM.png\" alt=\"GitLab Duo Self-Hosted tour screenshot\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"get-started-with-gitlab-duo-self-hosted-today\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003eGet started with GitLab Duo Self-Hosted today \u003ca href=\"#get-started-with-gitlab-duo-self-hosted-today\"\u003e\u003csvg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M12.2426 3.75736C11.4615 2.97631 10.1952 2.97631 9.41416 3.75736L7.99995 5.17157C7.60942 5.56209 6.97626 5.56209 6.58573 5.17157C6.19521 4.78105 6.19521 4.14788 6.58573 3.75736L7.99995 2.34314C9.56205 0.781046 12.0947 0.781046 13.6568 2.34314C15.2189 3.90524 15.2189 6.4379 13.6568 8L12.2426 9.41421C11.8521 9.80473 11.2189 9.80473 10.8284 9.41421C10.4379 9.02369 10.4379 8.39052 10.8284 8L12.2426 6.58578C13.0236 5.80473 13.0236 4.5384 12.2426 3.75736Z\" fill=\"#333333\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M10.5355 5.4645C10.926 5.85502 10.926 6.48819 10.5355 6.87871L6.87863 10.5356C6.4881 10.9261 5.85494 10.9261 5.46441 10.5356C5.07389 10.145 5.07389 9.51188 5.46441 9.12135L9.12127 5.4645C9.51179 5.07397 10.145 5.07397 10.5355 5.4645Z\" fill=\"#333333\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M3.75742 9.41422C2.97637 10.1953 2.97637 11.4616 3.75742 12.2426C4.53847 13.0237 5.8048 13.0237 6.58584 12.2426L8.00006 10.8284C8.39058 10.4379 9.02375 10.4379 9.41427 10.8284C9.8048 11.219 9.8048 11.8521 9.41427 12.2426L8.00006 13.6569C6.43796 15.219 3.9053 15.219 2.3432 13.6569C0.781107 12.0948 0.781107 9.56211 2.3432 8.00001L3.75742 6.5858C4.14794 6.19527 4.78111 6.19527 5.17163 6.5858C5.56216 6.97632 5.56215 7.60948 5.17163 8.00001L3.75742 9.41422Z\" fill=\"#333333\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re ready to advance your AI journey while addressing security and data privacy, \u003ca href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/sales/\"\u003ereach out to us\u003c/a\u003e to help set up GitLab Duo Self-Hosted in your environment today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
