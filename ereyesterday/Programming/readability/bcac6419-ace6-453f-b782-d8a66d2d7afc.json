Unlike traditional rule-based or generative AI, which are limited to predefined or reactive tasks, agentic AI processes vast information, models uncertainty, and makes context-sensitive decisions, mimicking human-like problem-solving. Crew AI is a platform to build and deploy automated workflows using any LLM and cloud platform. The company has rapidly become one of the most prominent in the field of agentic AI. João Moura is the founder at Crew AI and he joins the show with Sean Falconer to talk about his company. Sean’s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler. He has published works covering a wide range of topics from AI to quantum computing. Currently, Sean is an AI Entrepreneur in Residence at Confluent where he works on AI strategy and thought leadership. You can connect with Sean on LinkedIn.
