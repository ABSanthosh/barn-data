  "description": "This episode introduces the concept of dimensional reframing as a tool to gain new perspectives on problems and facilitate decision-making by considering a new dimension.â€¢ Learn how adding a new dimension to a problem can overcome limited perception and lead to new insights.â€¢ Discover how applying the dimension of time to bug management can help prioritise and address a manageable number of bugs within a specific period.â€¢ Explore how considering your energy levels can inform your approach to personal tasks, matching tasks to your available energy.â€¢ Understand how frameworks like Getting Things Done (GTD) use the dimension of context to make tasks more actionable.â€¢ Learn how the KonMari method employs the dimension of joy to fundamentally change how you decide what items to keep.â€¢ Understand that the key to effective dimensional reframing is choosing a dimension that you care about and that helps you make decisions.â€¢ Discover that dimensional reframing can be applied to both individual items and lists of items.ðŸ“® Ask a QuestionIf you enjoyed this episode and would like me to discuss a question that you have on the show, drop it over at: developertea.com.ðŸ“® Join the DiscordIf you want to be a part of a supportive community of engineers (non-engineers welcome!) working to improve their lives and careers, join us on the Developer Tea Discord community by visiting https://developertea.com/discord today!ðŸ§¡ Leave a ReviewIf you're enjoying the show and want to support the content head over to iTunes and leave a review!
