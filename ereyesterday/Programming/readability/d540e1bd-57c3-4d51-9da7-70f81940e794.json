It’s designed to offer a more secure and standardized alternative to Node.js, with native TypeScript support. Deno 2.0 just released and it’s a significant update, focusing on improved compatibility with Node.js and addressing developer feedback. Some of the key features are backwards compatibility with Node.js and npm, native support for package.json and node_modules, and a stabilized standard library. Luca Casonato is a Software Engineer for Deno and he spoke about the project on Software Engineering Daily in 2023. We’re excited to have Luca join the show again to talk about the many changes introduced in Deno 2.0. Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders. He co-founded and served as CTO for two companies, founded the San Diego JavaScript meetup, and organizes the AI inaction discussion group through Latent Space.
