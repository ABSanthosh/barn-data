  "text": "AWS recently announced exportable public SSL/TLS certificates from AWS Certificate Manager, addressing a long-standing community request. This update allows users to export certificates along with their private keys for use beyond AWS-managed services. Exportable public certificates enable customers to deploy ACM-issued certificates on Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and on-premises hosts, supporting AWS, hybrid, and multicloud workloads. Channy Yun, lead blogger at AWS, explains: The exportable public certificates are valid for 395 days. There is a charge at time of issuance, and again at time of renewal. Public certificates exported from ACM are issued by Amazon Trust Services and are widely trusted by commonly used platforms such as Apple and Microsoft and popular web browsers such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Previously, users could only create public certificates within AWS Certificate Manager or import certificates issued by third-party certificate authorities (CAs) for use with AWS services, such as Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), CloudFront, and API Gateway. However, there was no way to export these certificates or create and manage certificates for external services or EC2 instances. Corey Quinn, chief cloud economist at The Duckbill Group, published a long article, \"AWS Certificate Manager Has Announced Exportable TLS Certificates, and I'm Mostly Okay With It,\" reviewing the new feature. Quinn writes: The pricing is quite reasonable. It costs either $15 per domain, or $149 for a wildcard certificate. That seemed a bit expensive to me, until I remembered what these things used to cost–and apparently still do. $400 per certificate isn’t at all uncommon from trustworthy vendors (...) ACM’s pricing is a comparative steal. While many cloud practitioners question the benefits of the new solution over free options like Let's Encrypt, Wojtek Szczepucha, solutions architect at AWS, highlights the main targets of the announcement: Meeting regulations and compliance from a governance perspective. Simpler to manage from an operations perspective. It's not invented out of thin air, but rather based on customers asking for it. While the ability to export has been well received by the community and the new certificates are currently valid for over a year, the SSL/TLS certificate lifespans are expected to shrink to 200 days next year, 100 days in 2027, and only 47 days by 2029, as previously reported on InfoQ. When customers renew certificates on AWS Certificate Manager, they are charged for a new certificate issuance. Yun adds: You can configure automatic renewal events for exportable public certificates by Amazon EventBridge to monitor certificate renewals and create automation to handle certificate deployment when renewals occur. (...) You can also renew these certificates on-demand. Quinn warns: At least at launch, this feature doesn’t support ACME for automatic renewal, which means there’s likely to be an inherently manual process to renew them. While you can automate the entire certificate issuance dance via AWS APIs, I’ve worked with enough enterprise software to know how this is going to play out: it’s a manual process. Customers have to choose to make a certificate exportable before it’s issued, and there is no option to go back and retroactively export certificates that are already in use. This ensures that there is no default export of certificates with their private keys. The ability to issue exportable public certificates was one of the main announcements of the recent re:Inforce conference. During the 3 days in Philadelphia, the cloud provider introduced other new security capabilities and services, including multi-party approval for logically air-gapped vaults in AWS Backup and the new AWS Security Hub for risk prioritization and response at scale.
