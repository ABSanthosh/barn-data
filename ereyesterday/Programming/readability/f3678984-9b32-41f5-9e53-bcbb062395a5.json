They discuss the various tools that let them optimize models for edge devices, how the ecosystem is maturing to support more use cases, and how low code can help simplify the number of domains you need expertise in to run AI on the edge.Episode notes:Infineon is a global semiconductor company for power systems and IoT.You can connect with Clark and Alexander on LinkedIn.Congrats to Lifeboat badge winner hdsenevi for their answer on Unrecognized font family 'Roboto' - React Native iOS.",
