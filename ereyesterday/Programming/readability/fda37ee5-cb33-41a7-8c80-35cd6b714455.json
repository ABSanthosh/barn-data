We’ve just released the first edition of the JetBrains Qodana Software Quality Report which looks at key findings from 2024. We decided to conduct this research to gain a deeper understanding of best practices for delivering quality software today, and how companies of different sizes and maturity levels determine when their product is production-ready. To this end, we surveyed 808 software developers, QA engineers and other technical professionals to document real-world feedback from all corners of the software development community. This, resulted in unexpected findings all of which are unpacked in this comprehensive, 26-part report. View Report A taste of what’s inside The report showcases a shift in intensity with regards to code quality, as products evolve from launch to maturity, which we can see in a marked increase in using quality gates, testing priority and  The use of automated quality gates increased from 27% in the development stage to 40% after launch. The larger the development team, the more priority was placed on automated tests.  52% of partipants said they faced technical challenges and 45% said organizational and process challenges, even if there was companywide consensus on implementing code quality measures. The argument for improving quality processes was clear in terms of returns cited and offers a compelling narrative for how software development is evolving with improved product reliability and performance and so much more.  Read the full report to get these and other details, as well as:  Best and worst practices: A snapshot of how software quality practices are managed, and the key factors influencing decision-making during software releases. Perspectives specific to product maturity and company growth: Insights into how the stage of a project and the company’s size shape its approach to code quality. Quality investment trends: Analysis of when and why companies choose to invest more in quality. Challenges and solutions: A look at the common hurdles in the release and quality assurance process, and some unconventional strategies for overcoming them.
