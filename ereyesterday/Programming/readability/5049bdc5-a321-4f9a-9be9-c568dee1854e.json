  "text": "Powerful CI/CD for DevOps-centric teams IntelliJ TeamCityHow the IntelliJ Infrastructure Team Cuts Build Execution Time by 30% With TeamCity Introduction JetBrains is known for developing some of the world’s most popular IDEs, including IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and WebStorm. Supporting this development is a dedicated infrastructure team that ensures hundreds of developers can efficiently build, test, and release these products. At the core of their workflow is TeamCity, JetBrains’ own CI/CD solution, which powers build automation, testing, and scalable infrastructure management. Example of a build chain in TeamCity To understand how TeamCity supports this large-scale development process, we spoke with the IntelliJ Infrastructure team about their approach to managing CI/CD pipelines for 700–800 developers, running thousands of daily builds, and optimizing workflows to deliver fast and reliable releases. The challenge: scaling CI/CD for hundreds of developers With a large team continuously pushing changes, maintaining fast, reliable, and scalable CI/CD pipelines is a complex task. The IntelliJ Infrastructure team requires a solution capable of handling thousands of builds per day without overloading resources while leveraging smart automation to reduce manual effort and ensure high-quality code delivery. Additionally, their CI/CD setup must support a diverse infrastructure, including on-premises servers, AWS, and macOS, Linux, and Windows agents. Managing hundreds of thousands of automated tests while minimizing flaky test failures is another critical challenge. TeamCity Grafana dashboard To meet these demands, the team relies on TeamCity, JetBrains’ own powerful CI/CD solution, which provides the scalability, flexibility, and automation needed to streamline their development workflows. “We build IDEs and everything related to them in TeamCity, like internal services, services for statistics, etc. I’m very used to TeamCity and feel like it’s a hammer in my hand: you can do anything with it.” Dmitry Panov, IntelliJ Infrastructure Technical Team Lead Read the full case study to learn how TeamCity helps the IntelliJ Infrastructure team to manage the CI/CD process for 700+ engineers, while cutting the build time by 30%.
