When the company realized that their game would not achieve commercial success, they changed direction and repurposed the communication tool into a new product which eventually became Slack. Slack was launched in 2013 and is now ubiquitous in workplaces around the world. Shruti Kapoor is a Lead Member of the Technical Staff at Slack. She’s worked on features including Huddles, the recent redesign of Slack, and currently works on accessibility. She joins the podcast to talk about her path into frontend engineering, the frontend tech stack at Slack, the developer tooling, how Slack evaluates new technologies, and more. Josh Goldberg is an independent full time open source developer in the TypeScript ecosystem. He works on projects that help developers write better TypeScript more easily, most notably on typescript-eslint: the tooling that enables ESLint and Prettier to run on TypeScript code. Josh regularly contributes to open source projects in the ecosystem such as ESLint and TypeScript. Josh is a Microsoft MVP for developer technologies and the author of the acclaimed Learning TypeScript (O’Reilly), a cherished resource for any developer seeking to learn TypeScript without any prior experience outside of JavaScript. Josh regularly presents talks and workshops at bootcamps, conferences, and meetups to share knowledge on TypeScript, static analysis, open source, and general frontend and web development.
