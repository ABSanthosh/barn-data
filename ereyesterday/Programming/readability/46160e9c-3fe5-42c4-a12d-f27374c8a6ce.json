Josh Goldberg is an independent full time open source developer in the TypeScript ecosystem. He works on projects that help developers write better TypeScript more easily, most notably on typescript-eslint: the tooling that enables ESLint and Prettier to run on TypeScript code. Josh regularly contributes to open source projects in the ecosystem such as ESLint and TypeScript. Josh is a Microsoft MVP for developer technologies and the author of the acclaimed Learning TypeScript (O’Reilly), a cherished resource for any developer seeking to learn TypeScript without any prior experience outside of JavaScript. Josh regularly presents talks and workshops at bootcamps, conferences, and meetups to share knowledge on TypeScript, static analysis, open source, and general frontend and web development. Sponsors This episode of Software Engineering Daily is brought to you by Jellyfish, the software engineering intelligence platform powered by a patented allocations model and boasting the industry’s largest customer dataset. You know, one of the biggest shifts in the past year or so is the adoption of genAI coding tools like GitHub Copilot. And engineering leaders are trying to figure out if their teams are actually using it, how much they’re using it, and how it’s affecting the business. Are they shipping more? Is more roadmap work being done? How do you know beyond anecdotes and surveys? That’s why Jellyfish introduced the Copilot dashboard in 2024 in partnership with GitHub…and since then they’ve analyzed data from more than 4200 developers at more than 200 companies. Want to know an interesting finding? Developers are shipping 20.9% more with Copilot.",
