DOWNLOAD MPS 2025.1 EAP Check out the major new features in this release: Project view performance As a result of fixing MPS-38299 and MPS-37938, navigation in the logical project view has been substantially improved. Optionally create languages without a generator The New Project wizard now allows users to create a language without an empty generator. This covers the cases where a generator will not be needed in the project and prevents users from needing to manually delete the generator. Enhanced transactional property cell The CellModel_TransactionalProperty editor cell now supports the same properties as ordinary CellModel_Property cells, like readOnly and empty text, which encourages broader usage of the transactional property cell. Build language as generation target Based on a request from one of our customers, we smoothed the build language so that it can now be used as a target for generation. This opens the possibility for anyone to extend the build language in MPS or to create alternatives. A simple test language has been provided as an example to provide guidelines. Numerous bug fixes You can find a full list of the issues we’ve fixed here. Your JetBrains MPS team Subscribe to MPS Blog updates",
