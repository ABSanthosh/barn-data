Working together we came up with a well-rounded list of organizations for moderators to consider donating to, representing a variety of causes that are meaningful to members of the Stack Exchange community.We would like to offer a huge thank you to every community member who contributed to the Stack Exchange network in 2024! Giving your time, energy, and expertise to build this collective knowledge base is deeply appreciated. These donations particularly celebrate the moderators who do much of the unsung maintenance work that keeps all the moving parts across the network in place. Moderators, the passion you devote to the sites you moderate and contribute to has positively impacted learners all around the world, and we are proud to give back to our broader global community on your behalf to further amplify that impact.",
