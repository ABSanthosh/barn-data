It can take considerable engineering time to address non-functional concerns like retries, state synchronization, and distributed coordination. Event-driven models aim to simplify these issues, but often introduce new difficulties in debugging and operations. Stephan Ewen is the Founder at Restate which aims to simplify modern distributed applications. He is also the co-creator of Apache Flink which is an open-source framework for unified stream-processing and batch-processing. Stephan joins the show with Sean Falconer to talk about distributed applications and his work with Restate. Sean’s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler. He has published works covering a wide range of topics from AI to quantum computing. Currently, Sean is an AI Entrepreneur in Residence at Confluent where he works on AI strategy and thought leadership. You can connect with Sean on LinkedIn.
