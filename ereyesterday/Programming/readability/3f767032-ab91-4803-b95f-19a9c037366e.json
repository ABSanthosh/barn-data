  "text": "At the recent Google Cloud Next 2025, the cloud provider announced the preview of Firestore with MongoDB compatibility. This new feature introduces support for the MongoDB API and query language, enabling users to store and query semi-structured JSON data within Google Cloud’s real-time document database. Firestore with MongoDB compatibility is backed by a serverless infrastructure featuring single-digit-millisecond read performance, automatic scaling, and high availability. Minh Nguyen, senior product manager at Google Cloud, and Patrick Costello, engineering manager at Google Cloud, write: Firestore developers can now take advantage of MongoDB’s API portability along with Firestore’s differentiated serverless service, to enjoy multi-region replication with strong consistency, virtually unlimited scalability, industry-leading high availability of up to 99.999% SLA, and single-digit milliseconds read performance. According to the cloud provider, Firestore uses disaggregated compute and storage layers that scale independently. The compute layer supports multiple APIs, with the new Firestore with MongoDB compatibility API joining the existing Firestore Native and Firestore with Datastore compatibility APIs. Source: Google Cloud documentation The Firestore backend automatically replicates data across availability zones and regions. If a replica fails, the system instantly fails over to a healthy one, ensuring no downtime or data loss, while processes like automatic scaling continue uninterrupted. Nguyen and Costello write about future developments: Coming soon, we will also offer data interoperability between Firestore’s MongoDB compatible interface and Firestore’s innovative real-time and offline SDKs. This can allow developers to maximize existing libraries and tools from both of the MongoDB and Firestore developer communities. Documents with the supported query and projection operators and supported features by MongoDB API version are now available, as well as a list of limitations and behavior differences, with text search operators currently not supported. Google Cloud is not the only cloud provider supporting MongoDB-compatible API: Microsoft offers Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB, while AWS provides Amazon DocumentDB with MongoDB compatibility. Besides the preview of Firestore with MongoDB compatibility, Google Cloud Next saw various new database capabilities, including expanded Oracle services, a SQL Server modernization solution, generative AI capabilities in AlloyDB, and agentic programming with MCP. Andi Gutmans, VP \u0026 GM for databases at Google, writes: The future of AI-powered agents and apps isn't just coming – it's being built now, with your operational data at its core. We unveiled a significant leap forward for databases, designed to empower you to redefine what's possible in your industry. Firestore with MongoDB compatibility is available as part of the enterprise edition, and it supports different driver versions, including Java 5.x, Node.js 5.x and 6.x, and Go 2.x. The recording of the Google Cloud Next session covering the capabilities and use cases of the new option is available on YouTube. About the Author Renato Losio",
