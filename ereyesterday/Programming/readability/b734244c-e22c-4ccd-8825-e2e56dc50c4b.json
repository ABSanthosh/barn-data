Not surprisingly AWS — the biggest cloud services provider — is also getting in on the act.What is bedrock?Its AI offering is called Bedrock and the following blurb from it’s website describes what Bedrock is.Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon via a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications, simplifying development while maintaining privacy and security. With Amazon Bedrock’s comprehensive capabilities, you can easily experiment with a variety of top FMs, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and create managed agents that execute complex business tasks — from booking travel and processing insurance claims to creating ad campaigns and managing inventory — all without writing any code. Since Amazon Bedrock is serverless, you don’t have to manage any infrastructure, and you can securely integrate and deploy generative AI…",
