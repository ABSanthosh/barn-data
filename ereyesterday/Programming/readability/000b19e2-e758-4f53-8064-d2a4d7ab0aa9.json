Alfred Jones, VP of hardware engineering at Meta Reality Labs, joins Pascal Hartig (@passy) on the latest episode of the Meta Tech Podcast for a discussion on the realities (no pun intended) of building MR hardware. Jones shares his strategy for avoiding choice paralysis. With so many options out there, how do you choose the right display technology, battery, and thermal budget (and do so at the right price point)? He also discusses what makes passthrough such a challenge, gives an inside look into dogfooding MR hardware at Meta, and ponders what the future holds for mixed reality.
