  "description": "When people said they didn't know Kamala well, they weren't kidding. She didn't start broadcasting until three months before the election. That's not even one season of Abbott Elementary or Wheel of Fortune. Of course they didn't know her. We should be marketing the hell out of this shit all the time so when we choose a candidate the people will already know and like them. I listened to a pathetic Daily Blast podcast yesterday where Greg Sargent and his guest kept saying \"we gotta figure this out.\" The answer is staring you in the face. Dems are only on the air for a few months every four years. Of course the other side spins you like crazy. You all are clinging to the \"gotcha\" model of journalism. There are no more gotchas. We've known that since Access Hollywood. Fetterman is the only Dem I know of who practices this now. (There are others, AOC and Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin have come to mind since I wrote that. There will be others.) Get on the air and relax and say what you really think. And when the Repubs lie, say it like that -- they're lying. When you say nothing people think you agree with them. Big point. The Gotcha Era is finally over. Thank god. Send a link to this piece to every Democratic Party influencer. Let's get going. I'll kick in $100 as soon as they reboot KamalaHQ. BTW, there should never again be a Democratic nominee who doesn't host their own podcast. Let's start there. Trump made a real impression when he signed the stimulus checks. I bet that got him a few votes.",

Well that won't do for Scripting News readers who are a discerning lot, very loyal, but that wouldn't last long if I did rude stuff like that. So here I am at the bottom of the page quietly encouraging you to sign up for the nightly email. It's got everything from the previous day on Scripting, plus the contents of the linkblog and who knows what else we'll get in there. People really love it. I wish I had done it sooner.
