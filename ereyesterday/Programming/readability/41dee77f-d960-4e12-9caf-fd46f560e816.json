  "text": "Teardown is a 2022 sandbox puzzle game developed and published by Tuxedo Labs. The game revolves around the owner of a financially stricken demolition company, who is caught undertaking a questionable job and becomes entangled between helping police investigations and taking on further dubious assignments. The game stands out for its technical achievements, particularly its use of voxel-based rendering, which enables highly interactive and fully destructible environments. Dennis Gustafsson is the Founder of TuxedoLabs and the creator of Teardown, among other games. In today’s episode, Dennis speaks with Joe Nash about his 20-year history in game development, his passion for physics in games, Teardown, the advantage of using voxels, and much more. Joe Nash is a developer, educator, and award-winning community builder, who has worked at companies including GitHub, Twilio, Unity, and PayPal. Joe got his start in software development by creating mods and running servers for Garry’s Mod, and game development remains his favorite way to experience and explore new technologies and concepts.
