  "text": "IntelliJ IDEA – the IDE for Professional Development in Java and Kotlin Early Access ProgramThe IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 Early Access Program Is Open! The Early Access Program (EAP) for IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 has now officially begun!  We’d like to share a glimpse of what we’re working on for the upcoming release and invite you to join us on this exciting journey over the coming weeks.  There will also be a small change in the way we’ll deliver our EAP blog posts this time around. Read on for the details! Download IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 EAP 1 A reminder of what the EAP is all about What EAP builds are The Early Access Program is a long-standing tradition that gives our users early access to the new features we’re preparing. By participating, you get a first look at what’s coming and a chance to help shape the final release through your feedback. EAP builds are free to use, though they may be less stable than the final release versions. You can learn more about the EAP and why you might want to participate here. How we’ll be changing our EAP communication For quite some time, we’ve published EAP blog posts weekly alongside new builds. This time, we’re modifying our communication approach – instead of weekly updates, we’ll be publishing digest posts highlighting more substantial and meaningful improvements. This way, you’ll get clearer, more complete updates without having to read in detail about every small incremental change. It will still be easy to track new features as they appear – each EAP build is accompanied by release notes, where all changes are listed. Newly added features are highlighted in green to make them easy to spot. Your valuable feedback and ideas Something that will never change is the value of your feedback. With this in mind, we want to make it as easy as possible for you to share your thoughts directly from the IDE. If you encounter a bug or have an idea about how your experience could be improved, simply go to the Help menu and select Submit Feedback. You can also report any issues or suggestions through our issue tracker, where they will be reviewed by our team. What we’re planning for IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 Now, let’s take a look at our plans for v2025.2. The list below reflects our current intentions and areas of focus, but it is not set in stone. Software development is a dynamic field, and plans may evolve as we learn more, rearrange our priorities, and incorporate feedback from across our teams and community. Key themes we are investing in for this release include: Ongoing quality improvements Beyond adding new functionality, we also dedicate a lot of our time to fixing known issues and strengthening the overall reliability and performance of the IDE. Remote development enhancements There will be significant focus on further refining the remote development experience, including smoother local file editing, improved tool window behavior, better handling of settings and plugin management, and enhancements to the flow when accessing remote development via the Toolbox App. Spring ecosystem updates Our efforts will be concentrated around support for Spring Modulith, improved GraalVM runtime support, and preparations for the upcoming Spring 7 release. Notable UI improvements The most notable expected changes in the IDE UI include reworked indexing progress bars, an updated parameter info popup, and more. Better plugin management We are working on improvements to the way both bundled and non-bundled plugins are handled, making it easier to manage and customize your IDE environment. HTTP Client improvements Continued refinement of the built-in HTTP Client includes a reworked request generation process, neater completion for variables, and cleaner handling of query parameters to streamline your workflow. Bundled Workspaces We’re now putting the final efforts on Workspaces and preparing the plugin to become a bundled functionality. Maven 4 support  We’re preparing the IDE for full compatibility with Maven 4 from day one, ensuring smooth integration with the changes being introduced throughout the Maven 4 release cycle. K2 mode’s further evolution  Building on the progress made so far, we remain committed to refining and improving the new architecture – addressing remaining limitations, ensuring reliable language support and better performance, and improving feature parity with K1 mode. There’s even more to come! Additional improvements and features will be announced as development progresses through the EAP digests. For the changes that made it to the first EAP build, please refer to the release notes. We’re looking forward to sharing more with you as IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 continues to take shape.  Your feedback, insights, and early testing are what make the EAP so valuable – not only to us, but to the entire IntelliJ IDEA community. Stay tuned for the upcoming EAP digest posts, and thank you for being part of this process. Happy developing! Subscribe to IntelliJ IDEA Blog updates Discover more",
