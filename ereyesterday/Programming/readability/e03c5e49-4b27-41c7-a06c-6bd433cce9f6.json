These hands-on sessions focus on real-world projects and solutions, guided by hosts who are either members of the JetBrains Kotlin development team or certified Kotlin trainers. These workshops will take place on May 21, 2025, in Copenhagen, and will cater to various experience levels, from introductory to advanced. Check out all workshops What is the format for KotlinConf Workshops? Each workshop lasts 8 hours and ensures that participants receive individual attention and support from hosts. All participants will also receive materials in advance to help them prepare. Additionally, participants will receive a certificate of attendance, which can be beneficial for professional development or employer reimbursement. Workshop levels KotlinConf workshops can be divided into three main levels: Introduction and overview – Ideal for those new to Kotlin or looking to expand into new target platforms, like extending Android app development skills to the server side. Intermediate – Focuses on specific areas like concurrent programming and backend development, suitable for developers with existing Kotlin experience. Advanced – Addresses complex topics for seasoned developers aiming to master advanced concepts. Featured workshops Some of the most popular workshops are: Asynchronous Programming with Kotlin Coroutines  This workshop is conducted annually and always sells out first! Hosted by Sebastian Aigner, Developer Advocate and host of Talking Kotlin, and Vsevolod Tolstopyatov, Lead of Kotlin Libraries at JetBrains.  Who is it for? Those who are seeking to improve their understanding of asynchronous programming, write better concurrent systems, and manage data streams with Kotlin coroutines. What you will learn: Asynchronous programming concepts and how they differ from blocking code. Fundamentals of coroutines, including suspending functions, coroutine contexts, and structured concurrency. Kotlin Flows, including the differences between hot and cold flows and their relation to reactive streams. Techniques for writing safe concurrent systems and handling asynchronous data streams. You’ll also have the opportunity to get answers to all your in-depth Kotlin coroutines questions right from the source. Buy ticket Refactoring to Functional Kotlin Transform object-oriented Kotlin code into a functional style that’s better suited for modern architectures. This workshop is hosted by Duncan McGregor and Nat Pryce, authors of Java to Kotlin: A Refactoring Guidebook and Kotlin trainers certified by JetBrains. Who is it for? Developers familiar with Kotlin who want to explore functional programming techniques and learn how to refactor object-oriented code to adopt a functional style. What you will learn: Thinking in a functional way: focusing on data, calculations, and actions. Migrating from mutable objects to immutable data classes. Converting business logic into a functional domain model. Choosing between functions and methods. Implementing functional error handling. Applying the “Expand and Contract” refactoring technique to ensure safety across multiple commits. Buy ticket Deep Dive into Kotlin Multiplatform Explore advanced techniques for seamless code sharing across platforms. This workshop is led by Konstantin Tskhovrebov, Developer of Compose Multiplatform at JetBrains, and Pamela Hill, Developer Advocate at JetBrains. Who is it for? Developers experienced in Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose (Jetpack or Multiplatform) who want to advance their skills in app quality, performance optimization, and debugging. What you will learn: Native integrations for splash screens, notifications, file handling, and more. Advanced techniques for iOS targets, Kotlin/Swift interoperability, and debugging. Code quality practices, including code coverage with Kover, modularization strategies, and techniques for fixing memory leaks. Performance optimization methods through testing and app size reduction. Building CI/CD workflows. Buy ticket Hands-On Kotlin Web Development with Ktor Boost your JVM backend development by building HTTP applications in Kotlin and Ktor 3.0. This workshop is hosted by Leonid Stashevskii, Lead of Ktor Development at JetBrains, and Anton Arhipov, Developer Advocate at JetBrains. Who is it for? Ideal for those new to Kotlin backend development or looking to deepen their understanding of RESTful services with Ktor. What you will learn: The essentials of the Ktor framework. How to handle HTTP requests and work with WebSockets. How to use the Exposed library for database interactions. How to implement authentication mechanisms and logging. How to test APIs using Ktor’s testing capabilities and the Testcontainers library. How to write Ktor plugins and contribute them to the Ktor ecosystem. Buy ticket Other workshops include: Building Shared UI with Compose Multiplatform – Learn to share user interfaces across mobile, web, and desktop platforms. Spring Boot with Coroutines and Virtual Threads – Get the most out of Spring Boot with low latency, high throughput, and resource efficiency. Extracting, Transforming, and Analyzing Data with Kotlin – Leverage Kotlin for data-centric tasks with simple, convenient tools that integrate seamlessly into your native ecosystem, making data work more intuitive.
