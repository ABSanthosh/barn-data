  "text": "Supercharge your tools with AI-powered features inside many JetBrains products NewsOpenAI o1, o1-mini, and o3-mini models now available in JetBrains AI Assistant JetBrains AI Assistant streamlines your workflow and lets you focus on problem-solving instead of writing boilerplate and performing repetitive tasks. Now, we’ve added access to OpenAI o1, o1-mini, and o3-mini models to offer an even more adaptable and personalized experience with AI Assistant. What’s special about OpenAI o1? OpenAI’s o1 series of models are designed to spend more time thinking before they respond. It means they can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and math. Features of OpenAI o1 series include: o1 is trained with reinforcement learning to perform complex reasoning across various fields. Through training, the models learn to refine their thinking process, try different strategies and recognize their mistakes, producing an internal chain-of-thought before responding to the user. The latest o1 model supports both text and image inputs and produces text outputs including Structured Outputs. How OpenAI o1 works For complex reasoning tasks o1 is a significant advancement and represents a new level of AI capability. Reasoning tackles complex issues by: Working out the problem step by step. Restating the problem to clarify assumptions. Trying to apply a framework or approach. Thinking through different meanings of the question to pick the most likely option. Rejecting ideas or paths that don’t make sense. How to try OpenAI o1 Select OpenAI o1 from the drop-down menu on the right of the AI chat and start customizing the AI chat’s responses to your specific workflow. OpenAI o3-mini and o1-mini If you’re looking for a faster and more affordable reasoning model, OpenAI o3-mini and OpenAI o1-mini are great options, designed to excel at coding, science, and math. The o3-mini model is OpenAI’s most recent small reasoning model, providing high intelligence at the same cost and latency targets of o1-mini. o3-mini also supports key developer features like Structured Outputs, Function calling, Batch API, and more. Explore OpenAI’s latest models We’re excited to bring OpenAI’s latest advancements to you for a more adaptable and personalized experience. We can’t wait to see what you build!
