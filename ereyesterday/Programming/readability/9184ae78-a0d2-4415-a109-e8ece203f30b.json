Events Livestreams Marketplace PluginsJetBrains Plugin Developer Conf 2025 – Call for Speakers Plugin Developer Conf is back this November! We’re looking for speakers to share their insights with the JetBrains plugin development community. Submit your talk by July 10, 2025. What is JetBrains Plugin Developer Conf? Plugin Developer Conf is a free, live, online event hosted by JetBrains, created for and shaped by the plugin development community. It’s a one-day virtual gathering focused on all aspects of building and managing plugins for JetBrains products. The first-ever Plugin Developer Conf took place last year, bringing together over 2,500 online attendees and featuring sessions from eleven experienced speakers who shared practical insights on plugin testing, localization, user feedback, and more. This year, we’re gathering the community once again to exchange ideas, lessons, and strategies for building better plugins. On November 5, 2025, we’ll host the next edition of the conference, and we’re currently putting together the agenda. We’re now looking for speakers! Whether your talk covers building and maintaining plugins, overcoming challenges, or sharing best practices — we’d love to hear from you. Your experience could help fellow plugin authors on their journey. What type of talks are we looking for? You’re welcome to submit any talk related to plugin development or JetBrains Marketplace, but here are a few topics we’re especially interested in: Finding a plugin idea Developing a plugin Navigating the approval process with the Marketplace team Marketing and monetizing a plugin Managing user feedback and support Maintaining plugin compatibility and handling technical issues Overcoming any challenges you may have encountered on Marketplace Best practices for aspiring plugin developers Anything that does not fit the list above but is related to plugin development and management To give you an idea, here are some talks from 2024: Experiences building a Language Server Protocol plugin Be kind and localize! Implementing localization in JetBrains plugins Handling user feedback: A case study with GitHub Actions Manager What’s the format for talks? All talks will be presented live in English and can run for 30 or 45 minutes, followed by an optional 5–10 minute Q\u0026A. We’ll schedule your session during business hours in your time zone and are happy to support you with dry runs, demo feedback, and presentation prep if needed. Talks will be streamed and recorded, then shared on JetBrains YouTube, newsletters, blogs, and other official channels. You’re welcome to use a slideshow, live demo, or any format that best suits your content. As a thank-you, selected speakers will receive a 1-year personal JetBrains All Products Pack and, if you’d like, we’ll also help promote your blog, project, or course alongside your talk. The Call for Speakers will remain open until July 10, 2025. Not sure if your talk idea will fit? Reach out to elena.kerpeleva@jetbrains.com and we can discuss!
