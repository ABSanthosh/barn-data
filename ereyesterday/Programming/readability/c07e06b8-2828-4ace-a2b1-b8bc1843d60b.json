At the beginning of 2025, the Algorithm and Code Training School (ACTS) camp is moving to an exciting new location – Serbia! While our summer camp in Romania was a great success, we’re taking things to the next level with an even more intensive competition format. This camp is perfect for young coders aiming to win medals at international informatics competitions.  📍 Location: Serbia.📅 Dates: January 25 – February 2, 2025 (these dates are subject to change)  🎯 For: High school students between the ages of 16 and 20.💫 Experience level: Prior participation in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), the European Junior Olympiad in Informatics (EJOI), or similar international competitions.🎉 What to expect: 7 days of intensive training, contests, and fun.  🏫 Organizers: Constructor University and Neapolis University Pafos, with support from the JetBrains Foundation. Want to join? Here’s how: Fill out the application on our website. Show off your skills in our Youth Challenge Coder track. Registration is open until November 18. Stand out in the selection process, and earn your spot at our intense 7-day winter camp! Why Should You Join? To improve your chances in competitions: ACTS summer camp participants went on to win four gold, four silver, and five bronze medals at IOI 2024. To learn from the best: Train directly with world-class experts, including ICPC World Champion Pavel Mavrin and ICPC Gold Medalist Mikhail Pyaderkin. To take advantage of global networking opportunities: Join a worldwide community of exceptional young programmers, and build lasting friendships with like-minded peers. What our campers say “If you want to get gold at IOI, meet a lot of cool people, or just win a water gun and compete in rolling toilet paper as fast as possible, the ACTS camp is the right place for you. I’ve gained lots of new memories and knowledge, and I definitely recommend the camp to everyone else.” —Eliška Macáková, International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) Gold Medalist, International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) Silver Medalist, Slovakia. “It was quite fun. I got to meet a lot of other competitive programmers from the region. We played board games, talked, solved problems together, and overall, it was quite nice. Feels like an IOI before the IOI. The lectures were nice, too. I definitely recommend applying for the camp.”  —Nemanja Majski, International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) Silver Medalist, Serbia “I really enjoyed the ACTS camp. Besides the various contests and the compelling and well-taught lectures, I also learned a lot about Romanian history and culture and made very good friends from all across Europe. I feel like the ACTS camp was a great preparation for IOI and maybe future CP contests.”  —Simon Bachran, International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) Bronze Medalist, Germany Ready to level up?
