Whether you’re celebrating the milestones of the past year or gearing up to tackle new challenges, these enhancements are here to support your knowledge-sharing community in meaningful ways.This release is packed with tools to help your community thrive in 2025 and beyond. Dive into the details below to explore everything we’ve rolled out!Let’s take a moment to acknowledge the incredible contributions that kept your community thriving in 2024. Your 2024 Stacked, available for qualifying teams only, goes beyond the numbers, offering an interactive snapshot of engagement and impact. It’s more than a retrospective—it’s a chance to celebrate the collaboration, curiosity, and camaraderie that define your team.Our redesigned weekly digest emails bring actionable, personalized insights right to your inbox. These new, personalized digests keep you in the loop and empower users to contribute more effectively and include five key components:Summary: Each user will see a persona-driven wrap-up of how they helped their community during the prior week.SME Progress: If SME auto-assign is enabled, users will see the top two tags they are progressing on toward becoming a SME.Your Reminders: Users will see a list of service product nudges and reminders so they can follow up and take the primary actions to support a thriving community.Unanswered Questions: Leveraging the algorithm used on the homepage, the top unanswered questions will be surfaced to the user based on their activity and tag preferences.Account Configuration Nudges: Users will receive smart recommendations on account configurations—like setting up notifications for MS Teams/Slack or watching tags—based on where users are in their journey with Teams.We’ve fine-tuned OverflowAI to deliver precise, relevant summaries and to guide users toward the best possible answers—or help them craft better questions when needed.Prompting for OverflowAI Enhanced Search has been updated to ensure that results are both accurate and relevant. If relevant context is found, OverflowAI Enhanced Search will deliver a summary. However, if no relevant results are available, the system will prompt users to post their question.This will create clarity in the search summary experience by indicating when OverflowAI is answering a question versus when it is summarizing and by encouraging them to post a new question if the summary doesn’t answer their question.In addition, OverflowAI thread summarization in both Slack and Microsoft Teams integrations has been updated to be more personalized and focused, eliminating generic phrasing and unnecessary content. These updates will give users clearer, more concise outputs when asking questions and receiving summarized answers. Once summarization has been completed, an updated success message will unfurl the summary and encourage users to review, verify, and add tags to OverflowAI answers to ensure knowledge integrity.In this release, we’re bringing Stack Overflow for Teams to Microsoft 365. The Stack Overflow for Teams Microsoft Graph Connector allows organizations to bring trusted, team-validated knowledge from Stack Overflow for Teams directly into Microsoft 365, where it can be accessed seamlessly by development teams and other technical users.With this connector, content such as questions, answers, and top answers from Stack Overflow for Teams is indexed and made searchable within Microsoft 365 Copilot. Developers can simply ask technical questions in natural language within Copilot and receive summarized responses sourced from their organization’s internal Stack Overflow knowledge base. Each answer includes links to the original Stack Overflow for Teams content, making it easy for users to dive deeper into topics if needed. This setup excludes data from the public Stack Overflow platform, ensuring only internal, organization-approved knowledge is referenced.For organizations using Microsoft 365, this integration improves the accuracy and accessibility of developer resources, enhancing the efficiency of internal technical support and knowledge sharing. Developers benefit from reduced context-switching, as they no longer need to jump between applications to find reliable, organization-specific insights. With Stack Overflow for Teams content readily available in the Microsoft 365 experience, teams can streamline workflows, access accurate knowledge, and boost productivity directly within the tools they use every day.NOTE: The Stack Overflow for Teams Microsoft Graph Connector is currently in public preview. Please direct any questions or feedback to the Microsoft team.For additional details on the improvements above and other updates with the latest release, view the 2025.1 release notes.",
