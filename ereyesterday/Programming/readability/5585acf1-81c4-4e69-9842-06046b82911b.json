  "text": "Roblox has introduced Cube 3D, a generative AI system designed for creating 3D and 4D objects and environments. It enables the generation of 3D models and scenes from text inputs, with plans to expand its capabilities to support image-based input in the future. A beta version of its mesh generation API is already accessible within Roblox Studio and as an in-experience Lua API, allowing developers to integrate it into their projects. Cube 3D employs a novel approach to 3D tokenization, representing objects as discrete tokens similar to the way text is processed in language models. This allows the system to predict and generate complete 3D structures in an autoregressive manner. The model can be used for both single-object generation and complex scene layouts, making it a scalable tool for different applications. By training on native 3D data, Cube 3D ensures compatibility with game engines, allowing seamless integration into interactive environments. Developers using Cube 3D can generate 3D models by providing simple text descriptions. The mesh generation API can create objects offering a streamlined approach to asset creation. This capability allows developers to focus on refining other aspects of their projects while automating the initial stages of model generation. Roblox envisions Cube 3D evolving into a more advanced tool capable of generating entire scenes with multiple input modalities, including text, images, and potentially audio. According to the company, the long-term objective is to achieve 4D generation, where objects interact dynamically within virtual environments. This would enable more immersive digital experiences by allowing AI-generated assets to respond to environmental changes and user interactions. Reactions to Cube 3D have been mixed. Supporters highlight its speed, open-source availability, and potential. User @locust_eatr posted a demo saying: Not bad on my first try. Will have to get it colored somewhere else but it was very fast and the result is pretty good! While critics argue that Cube 3D prioritizes investors over the community. Some users on X have dismissed it claiming it threatens traditional 3D modelers. @cotton_vs_candy user shared: This is genuinely such a crazy thing to implement considering the amount of people on Roblox who do 3d modeling for commissions or even free. Some people even learned how to 3d model because of developing on Roblox how shameless. The release of Cube 3D aligns with Roblox’s broader commitment to open-source AI research and development. The company has previously contributed to open-source projects, including its involvement in ROOST, a nonprofit focused on digital safety. By making Cube 3D open-source, Roblox aims to encourage collaboration and innovation within the AI and game development communities. The system is available as open-source software on platforms such as GitHub and Hugging Face. About the Author Daniel Dominguez",
