  "text": "This week's Java roundup for March 17th, 2025 features news highlighting: the GA releases of JDK 24 and Apache Kafka 4.0; the March 2025 edition of the Payara Platform; Spring Security CVEs; and JavaOne 2025. JDK 24 Oracle has released version 24 of the Java programming language and virtual machine, which ships with a final feature set of 24 JEPs. More details may be found in this InfoQ news story. JDK 25 Build 15 of the JDK 25 early-access builds was also made available this past week featuring updates from Build 14 that include fixes for various issues. Further details on this release may be found in the release notes. For JDK 24 and JDK 25, developers are encouraged to report bugs via the Java Bug Database. GraalVM In conjunction with the release of JDK 24, the released of GraalVM for JDK 24 by Oracle Labs delivers new features such as: Graal Neural Network (GNN), a new static profiler that \"provides a new generation of machine learning-powered profile inference\" (available only on Oracle GraalVM); SkipFlow, a new experimental extension to Native Image static analysis that \"tracks primitive values and evaluates branching conditions dynamically during the analysis process;\" and an optimized Foreign Function and Memory API in Native Image with new specialized upcalls for direct method handles. More details on this release may be found in the release notes and the upcoming GraalVM for JDK 24 release stream on YouTube. InfoQ will follow up with a more detailed news story. BellSoft Liberica The release of Liberica JDK 24, BellSoft's downstream distribution of OpenJDK 24, includes 2,597 bug fixes in the JDK and 175 bug fixes in JavaFX. Developers may download this latest version from this website. Project Loom Build 25-loom+1-11 of the Project Loom early-access builds was made available to the Java community this past week and is based on Build 13 of the JDK 25 early-access builds. This build improves the implementation of Java monitors (synchronized methods) for enhanced interoperability with virtual threads. Spring Framework It was a busy week over at Spring as the various teams have delivered milestone releases of Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Authorization Server, Spring for GraphQL, Spring Integration, Spring AMQP, Spring for Apache Kafka and Spring Web Services.There were also point releases of Spring Batch and Spring for Apache Pulsar. Further details may be found in this InfoQ news story. The Spring team has disclosed two CVEs that affect Spring Security: CVE-2025-22223, Spring Security Authorization Bypass for Method Security Annotations on Parameterized Types, a vulnerability, potentially causing an unauthorized bypass, due to Spring Security not correctly locating method security annotations on parameterized types or methods. This assumes that: the @EnableMethodSecurity annotation is being used; and a method security annotation is being used on a parameterized superclass, interface or overridden method, but not on the target method. CVE-2025-22228, Spring Security BCryptPasswordEncoder Does Not Enforce Maximum Password Length, a vulnerability in the matches(CharSequence,String) method, defined in the BCryptPasswordEncoder class, will incorrectly return true for passwords larger than 72 characters should the first 72 characters be the same. Josh Long, Spring Developer Advocate at Broadcom, has tweeted that March 24, 2025 marks 21 years since the formal GA release of Spring Framework 1.0. Payara Payara has released their March 2025 edition of the Payara Platform that includes Community Edition 6.2025.3, Enterprise Edition 6.24.0 and Enterprise Edition 5.73.0. All three releases provide bug fixes, security fixes, dependency upgrades and two improvements: the ability to specify the global context root for any deployed application using the payaramicro.globalContextRoot property; and a CORBA update to use the new implementation of Jakarta Concurrency 3.1 instead of synchronized blocks. This edition also delivers Payara 7.2025.1.Alpha1 featuring full support for the Jakarta EE 11 Core Profile, released in December 2024, along with the same improvements in Payara Platform 6. More details on these releases may be found in the release notes for Community Edition 6.2025.3 and Enterprise Edition 6.24.0 and Enterprise Edition 5.73.0. Apache Software Foundation The release of Apache Kafka 4.0.0 delivers bug fixes, many improvements and new features such as: client support for subscribing with the new SubscriptionPattern class; and the ability for developers to rebootstrap clients based on timeout or error code. Further details on this release may be found in the release notes. Hibernate The fifth beta release of Hibernate ORM 7.0.0 features: a migration to the Jakarta Persistence 3.2 specification, the latest version targeted for Jakarta EE 11; a baseline of JDK 17; improved domain model validations; and a migration from Hibernate Commons Annotations (HCANN) to the new Hibernate Models project for low-level processing of an application domain model. More details on this release may be found in the release notes and the migration guide. The second alpha release of Hibernate Search 8.0.0 ships with: fixes discovered in the Alpha1 release; an alignment with Hibernate ORM 7.0.0.Beta4 that implements the Jakarta Persistence 3.2 specification; and dependency upgrades to Lucene 10.1.0, OpenSearch 2.19 and Elasticsearch Client 8.17.3. Further details on this release may be found in the release notes. Kotlin The release of Kotlin 2.1.20 provides new features such as: a new K2 compiler kapt plugin that is enabled by default for all the projects; and an experimental DSL that replaces the Gradle Application plugin that is no longer compatible with the Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle plugin. More details on this release may be found in the release notes. RefactorFirst Jim Bethancourt, principal software consultant at Improving, an IT services firm offering training, consulting, recruiting, and project services, has released version 0.7.0 of RefactorFirst, a utility that prioritizes the parts of an application that should be refactored. This release delivers: improved rendering of class maps and cycles using the 3D Force-Directed Graph; and limiting the cycle analysis to 10 cycles that will be parameterized in the future. Further details on this release may be found in the release notes. JavaOne 2025 JavaOne 2025 was held on March 18-20, 2025 at the Oracle Conference Center in Redwood Shores, California. This three-day event consisting of keynotes, presentations and hands-on labs, is organized by Oracle and the developer relations team. The session catalog provides all of the details. Details on Day One of JavaOne, in conjunction with the formal release of JDK 24, may be found in this InfoQ news story. InfoQ will follow-up with additional news stories.
