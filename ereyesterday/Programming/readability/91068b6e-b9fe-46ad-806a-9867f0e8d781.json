  "text": "On the Apigee team at Google Cloud, we're dedicated to providing the strategies and tools our customers need to build robust and effective API ecosystems. One of the most critical aspects of building a successful API ecosystem is providing both producers and consumers with ways to discover APIs. We’re commonly asked to explain the difference between two distinct yet deeply connected parts of the Apigee platform that help with this: the Apigee API hub and Developer Portals. While at first glance it may appear these tools perform a similar function, they’re actually designed to address different needs, for different personas. It's vital to recognize how the Apigee API hub serves as the core, truth-bearing engine that empowers and elevates the functionality of developer portals, and serves as the essential backbone for your agentic strategy.Apigee API hub: The source of truth for all APIs across the enterprise It’s helpful to think of the Apigee API hub as the central nervous system of your API program. By providing a centralized place to catalog all the APIs and API data in your organization (regardless of API style, lifecycle stage, or hosting environment) the Apigee API hub can become the authoritative source of \"enterprise truth\" providing the foundation for governance and consistency, allowing your teams to prevent sprawl, build better APIs, and ultimately deliver better experiences for your users. It’s important to note that the Apigee API hub is primarily focused on the needs of API producers within your organization – platform engineers, API architects, security practitioners, and of course the developers responsible for building and managing APIs. For these users, the Apigee API hub is the single source of truth, encompassing:A comprehensive landscape of all your APIs and metadata: The Apigee API hub can automatically discover and catalog all your APIs, creating a unified repository with rich metadata. This includes information about API lifecycle stages, versions, specifications, and documentation– providing a complete and accurate view of your API ecosystem. This comprehensive and machine-readable data is precisely what AI agents need to understand and interact with your enterprise systems, serving as the essential registry of services.Centralized governance based on standards: The hub enables you to establish and enforce consistent governance across the API lifecycle. By maintaining a single source of truth, you can effectively ensure consistent quality and adherence to standards, manage security, track API maturity, and make informed decisions about API strategy, such as identifying APIs that could be monetized. This unified source of truth is crucial for establishing governance not just for human developers, but also for controlling and securing how AI agents access and utilize your API portfolio, ensuring consistency across security, API style, and data formats.Enhanced internal collaboration: The hub fosters internal collaboration by providing a centralized and consistent source of API information. This promotes API reuse, reduces redundancy, and streamlines development workflows.Developer Portals: Tailored experiences for API consumers Developer Portals, in contrast, are like a storefront through which API consumers – the developers building applications – discover and interact with your APIs. It's crucial to recognize that not every API produced within an organization is intended for external consumption. The Apigee API hub, as the superset, manages all APIs, while Developer Portals expose a carefully selected subset of those APIs, using your own customized styling and branding. To be truly effective, these portals must be powered by the \"enterprise truth\" residing in the Apigee API hub. Portals offer a curated and user-friendly subset of the hub's capabilities, focused on seamless API consumption:Truthful and effective API discovery: Developer portals rely on the accuracy and completeness of the metadata from the Apigee API hub to enable developers to easily find the APIs they need.The \"off-ramp\" for API consumption: The Apigee API hub acts as the control center, providing a governed \"off-ramp\"(example) to selectively publish specific APIs and their associated \"enterprise truth\" to Developer Portals. This ensures that only approved and relevant APIs are made available for consumption.Unlock your API's potentialThe Apigee API hub and Developer Portals, though distinct, form a unified system. The hub's comprehensive catalog and \"enterprise truth\" directly empower and drive the portal experience for developers, and now, critically, serve as the indispensable foundation for your burgeoning AI agent strategies.By understanding the Apigee API hub's role as the central repository for API producers and the foundational core for agents, and the Portal's role as a consumer-focused subset with a governed \"off-ramp\", organizations can fully unlock their APIs' potential and accelerate innovation.Streamline API management with Apigee API hub and Developer PortalsGet started with Apigee API hub, and import APIs from your existing Apigee projects, laying the groundwork for your agentic future.Get started with Apigee Developer Portals.Try out this sample on GitHub that shows how to onboard unmanaged APIs to the hub and publish the documentation to a developer portal.On July 31, 2025, join us to discover what the hub does and how the portal works.Can't make it to the live event?
