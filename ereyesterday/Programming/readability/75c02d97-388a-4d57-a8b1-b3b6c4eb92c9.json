Nah. this shit is hard. when it's done it looks simple. but these pieces must fit together. that's why it's soooo stupid to throw out all the interop, because it's going to take you forever to recreate it, if you ever can, which you probably can't. this is the lesson that activitypub and atproto are teaching once again. and the people who are dealing with this have probably known it a long time. it would be so much faster to use something that already works and is widely supported. this is why we used mp3 in rss to make podcasting. we could have said oh shit i don't understand how mp3 works, so let's create one that does only what podcasting needs. only of course it'll turn out that podcasting needs everything that mp3 already does. accept a win. don't feel compelled to reinvent everything. you'll find out it wasn't as easy as it looked.",
