  "text": "Jack Dongarra is an American computer scientist who is celebrated for his pioneering contributions to numerical algorithms and high-performance computing. He developed essential software libraries like LINPACK and LAPACK, which are widely used for solving linear algebra problems on advanced computing systems. Dongarra is also a co-creator of the TOP500 list, which ranks the world’s most powerful supercomputers. His work has profoundly impacted computational science, enabling advancements across numerous research domains. Jack received the 2021 Turing Award “for pioneering contributions to numerical algorithms and libraries that enabled high performance computational software to keep pace with exponential hardware improvements for over four decades.” He joins the podcast with Sean Falconer to talk about his life and career. Sean’s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler. He has published works covering a wide range of topics from AI to quantum computing. Currently, Sean is an AI Entrepreneur in Residence at Confluent where he works on AI strategy and thought leadership. You can connect with Sean on LinkedIn.

You scramble to troubleshoot, but the complexity of your microservices environment makes it nearly impossible to pinpoint the problem quickly. That’s why Chronosphere is on a mission to help you take back control with Differential Diagnosis, a new distributed tracing feature that takes the guesswork out of troubleshooting. With just one click, DDx automatically analyzes all spans and dimensions related to a service, pinpointing the most likely cause of the issue. Don’t let troubleshooting drag you into the early hours of the morning. Just “DDx it” and resolve issues faster. See why Chronosphere was named a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Observability Platforms at chronosphere.io/sed. Understanding the details of infrastructure tools matter, and there is no better way to understand that than looking directly at the code. Open source codebases give everyone the ability to inspect, audit, and contribute to the software they use, enhancing trust and transparency. Bitwarden is a trusted open source and end-to-end encrypted security solution that empowers businesses and individuals to securely manage and share information online. Made by developers like you, Bitwarden offers open source solutions for virtually every credential management use case, from secrets management to password management and passwordless. Developers can even securely manage their ssh keys with the new Bitwarden ssh agent! Get started on your open source security journey today and start your free trial at Bitwarden.com!",
