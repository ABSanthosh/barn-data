  "text": "Atlassian recently announced that it is consolidating its IT Operations offering and transitioning Opsgenie’s capabilities into JIRA Service Management and Compass. Vivek Iyer, Head of Product—IT Operations at Atlassian, announced this in a blog post. Iyer provided the context around Atlassian’s Opsgenie acquisition in 2018: it was to help customers run their critical services with quality alerting and on-call management. Atlassian then launched Jira Service Management in 2020, which combined IT, development, and business teams on a single platform. With this \"full transition\", Opsgenie’s operations capabilities will be shared across Jira Service Management and Compass. With AI-powered features, customers can prevent more incidents, resolve incidents faster, and enhance productivity. Leveraging Atlassian Compass’s alerting and on-call features, the DevOps team will integrate contextual alerting within the internal development platform. Source: The Evolution of IT Operations and Opsgenie Iyer mentioned that Atlassian continuously enhances this platform with AIOps capabilities, such as AI-driven alert grouping, automated alert resolution, and PIR creation. The /sysadmin subreddit on Reddit quickly saw opinions from the tech community regarding this announcement. One post explored tools for alert escalation and on-call rotations as an after-effect of this announcement. One of the Reddit users StatusGator commented, We have an Opsgenie integration and have seen a number of our customers simply move to Jira Service Management. These are usually the largest companies that are slow-moving and have Atlassian contracts already. I've noticed the well-funded startups moving to firehydrant.com and Incident.io and the bootstrapped companies moving to BetterStack.com The post also mentioned PagerDuty. Another Reddit user Forgery, pondered on the approach of companies losing existing paying customers instead of keeping the existing stuff running, I don't understand this trend where companies risk losing existing paying customers when it seems so trivial to keep the current stuff running. …The OpsGenie change seems to be in the same vein: lots of work to migrate and they're raising prices. The one thing Atlassian did right when they bought OpsGenie in the first place was they lowered prices to keep their customers. Iyer elaborated on the transition timeline and referenced Opsgenie migration resources for the IT administrators. New Opsgenie purchases will be stopped on June 4th, 2025. This applies to purchases directly from Atlassian, partners, and resellers. Access to Opsgenie will end on April 5th, 2027. Any unmigrated data will be deleted by this date. Thanking the Opsgenie customers for their trust since 2012, Iyer has provided a link to the Atlassian Community Forum, where existing customers can get relevant information.
