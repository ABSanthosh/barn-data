While humans can build long-term semantic relationships, AI systems often rely on fixed context windows, leading to loss of important past interactions. Zep is a startup that’s developing a memory layer for AI agents using temporal Knowledge Graphs, enabling agents to retain long-term contextual information. It was founded in 2023 and was part of the Y Combinator batch of Winter 2024. Daniel Chalef is the Founder of Zep. He joins the show with Kevin Ball to talk about the challenge of contextual memory in AI, temporal knowledge graphs, ambient AI agents, and more. Be sure to check out Graphiti on GitHub and read the Zep White Paper on arXiv. Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by Zep. Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders. He co-founded and served as CTO for two companies, founded the San Diego JavaScript meetup, and organizes the AI inaction discussion group through Latent Space.",
