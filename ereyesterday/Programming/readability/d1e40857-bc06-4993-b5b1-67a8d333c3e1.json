If the Dems were competitive they would run ads now with Senator Tillis talking about the damage the new Repub bill will do to Americans, emphasizing this is a Republican speaking, taking one for the country. # Another criticism of the Bluesky API. They make each developer do the support for Open Graph metadata, when it would be much more efficient for them to support it on their end. I would be happy to give them the code. It's not that complicated. But translating the OG format, which for crying out loud is a huge standard, into their arcane format which is only supported by Bluesky, is going in the wrong direction, and frankly is ridiculously arrogant. Show a little humility. Facebook is huge, and the format isn't just used by Facebook, everyone uses it. # When I was having trouble getting into my AWS account last week, I ordered a Yubikey, which everyone says is the best way to go. I thought I'd set it up first thing Monday morning (ie now) but it turns out it's a major undertaking? Why does this have to be so hard? I guess I'll find out, but not today. I want to make some progress on my development project first. Maybe later. # Advice from a longtime developer. # If you think \"I should do a backup,\" do it. Now, don't wait. # Make it really easy to do a backup. Choose a menu item that's always available when you're working.# The reason is karma. God hears all your thoughts. When that thought pops into your head and you don't do a backup, or don't do it soon enough, He crashes your data, and you think \"I should have done a backup when I thought of doing it.\" Even this doesn't please Him. At that moment it's even more urgent that you do a backup. # My hippie uncle taught me this. God has a terrible sense of humor, and thinks it's really funny when you have a good thought and ignore it. When something didn't work he would say that's God goofing on me. # In this case, we're talking about is the Programmer God. There are all kinds of gods, a baseball god, a basketball god, and very specifically a Knicks god. That god has the absolutely worst sense of humor of them all and by worst I mean best. #",
