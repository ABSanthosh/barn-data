  "description": "I just thought of a good example of a question you could bring to ChatGPT. Here's the prompt. I'm thinking of driving from NYC to Jacksonville, FL. I want to do it in four days with stopovers in three places that have good places to ride a bike and a Citibike-style bike rental. Choose three places on the trip, I don't mind going out of my way. It gave me three places to stop, Washington DC, Raleigh NC and Charleston SC. In each case it told me about the bike-sharing services and notable bike trails. A logical next question would be to ask it to find hotels in each place that are reasonably priced and near an interesting place to ride. It also offered information about weather considerations. It's not necessarily a great time of year for bike riding. I'm not actually planning a trip south, I just used it as an example because I've done this trip a number of times and was curious how things had developed. Another question I used to have when cross-country driving, where can I find a Starbucks not too far off the route I'm on. If you were plotting the progress of public information systems, AI is strictly on a continuum of services that have developed over the years that make information more accessible in the way you want it. It actually answers questions you have in the way you think of asking them. Here's a link to the response. I've heard that sometimes people have trouble accessing these files.",
