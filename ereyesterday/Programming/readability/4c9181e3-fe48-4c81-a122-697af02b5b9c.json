OpenJDK It was a busy week in the OpenJDK ecosystem in which JEPs that have been Targeted and Proposed to Target for JDK 24 and drafts that have been promoted to Candidate status. JEP 485, Stream Gatherers, is the fifth JEP confirmed for JDK 24. Four JEPs have been Proposed to Target and will be under review during the week of October 28, 2024. More details may be found in this InfoQ news story. JDK 24 Build 21 of the JDK 24 early-access builds was made available this past week featuring updates from Build 20 that include fixes for various issues. Further details on this release may be found in the release notes. For JDK 24, developers are encouraged to report bugs via the Java Bug Database. Project Loom Build 24-loom+9-96 of the Project Loom early-access builds was made available to the Java community this past week and is based on Build 20 of the JDK 24 early-access builds. This build improves the implementation of Java monitors (synchronized methods) for enhanced interoperability with virtual threads. Jakarta EE In his weekly Hashtag Jakarta EE blog, Ivar Grimstad, Jakarta EE Developer Advocate at the Eclipse Foundation, provided an update on Jakarta EE 11, writing: Some great news! I am happy to announce that IBM has filed a Compatibility Certification Request (CCR) for Jakarta EE 11 Core Profile with Open Liberty 24.0.0.11-beta. This means that we have an implementation that implements the specification and passes the TCK so we will be able to release Jakarta EE 11 Core Profile. Red Hat is also just around the corner with a release of WildFly that passes the Core Profile TCK as well. The road to Jakarta EE 11 included four milestone releases with the potential for release candidates as necessary before the GA release in 4Q2024. Spring Framework It was also a busy week over at Spring as the various teams have delivered numerous first release candidates and point releases on Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Authorization Server, Spring Session, Spring Integration, Spring Modulith, Spring Batch, Spring AMQP, Spring for Apache Kafka and Spring for Apache Pulsar. More details may be found in this InfoQ news story. Open Liberty IBM has released version 24.0.0.11-beta of Open Liberty featuring: new messaging and authorization support for InstantOn, the Open Liberty implementation of Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace (CRIU); and a new webModuleClassPathLoader configuration attribute for improved enterprise application class loader control that is referenced by a web module Class-Path attribute. Pending approval of their Compatibility Certification Request, this version will serve as the first compatible implementation of the Jakarta EE 11 Core Profile. Helidon Version 4.1.3 of Helidon ships with notable changes such as: the addition of a context propagator implementation for Zipkin in the Helidon Tracing component to propagate trace information across threads within a Helidon server; the ability to configure camel case or snake case for built-in meter names in the Helidon Metrics component; and a fix within the findNewLine() method, defined in the DataReader class, that returned a maximum value instead of new line index when there are multiple lone carriage return characters in the same buffer. More details on this release may be found in the changelog. Apache Software Foundation The release of Apache Pulsar 4.0.0 delivers notable changes such as: a new load balancer algorithm, AvgShredder, designed to unload bundles to maintain the range of broker resources within a configured threshold; and enhanced broker-level metrics that monitor and analyze the behavior of a Pulsar service. More details on this release may be found in the release notes. Versions 4.8.1 and 4.4.4 of Apache Camel, both LTS releases, ship with bug fixes, dependency upgrades and new features: a new ThreadPoolFactory interface to propagate OpenTelemetry contexts; and a a new starter to easily expose a Jolokia endpoint that monitors Camel on Spring Boot applications. More details on these releases may be found in the release notes for version 4.4.4 and version 4.8.1. JHipster The release of JHipster Lite 1.21.0 provides bug fixes, dependency upgrades and enhancements such as: use the changelog path from the Spring Boot LiquibaseProperties class rather than injecting it with the Spring Framework @Value annotation; and a reformatting of Vue.js, React.js and Angular.js files with Prettier, an opinionated code formatter. More details on this release may be found in the release notes. About the Author Michael Redlich",
