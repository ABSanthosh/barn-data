    "description": "In the past, sellers were responsible for managing and fulfilling their own tax obligations. However, more and more jurisdictions are now requiring marketplaces such as Etsy to collect the tax from buyers and remit the tax to the relevant authorities. Etsy now plays an active role in collecting tax from buyers and remitting it all over the world. In this post, I will walk you through our tax calculation infrastructure and how we adapted to the ongoing increase in traffic and business needs over the years. The tax calculation workflow We determine tax whenever a buyer adds an item to their Etsy shopping cart. The tax determination is based on buyer and seller location and product category, and a set of tax rules and mappings. To handle the details of these calculations we partner with Vertex, and issue a call to their tax engine via the Quotation Request API to get the right amount to show in our buyer's cart. Vertex ensures accurate and efficient tax management and continuously updates the tax rules and rates for jurisdictions around the world. The two main API calls we use are Quotation Request and DistributeTaxRequest SOAP calls. When the buyer proceeds to payment, an order is created, and we call back to Vertex with a DistributeTaxRequest sending the order information and tax details. We sync information with Vertex through the order fulfillment lifecycle. To keep things up to date in case an order is canceled or a refund needs to be issued later on, we inform the details of the cancellation and refunds to the tax engine via DistributeTaxRequest. This ensures that when Vertex generates tax reports for us they will be based on a complete record of all the relevant transactions. Etsy collects the tax from the buyers and remits that tax to the taxing authority, when required. Generate tax details for reporting and audit purpose Vertex comes with a variety of report formats out of the box, and gives us tools to define our own. When Etsy calls the Distribute Tax API, Vertex saves the information we pass to it as raw metadata in its tax journal database. A daily cron job in Vertex then moves this data to the transaction detail table, populating it with tax info. When reports and audit data are generated, we download these reports and import to Etsy’s bigdata and the workflow completes. Mapping the Etsy taxonomy to tax categories Etsy maintains product categories to help our buyers find exactly the items they're looking for. To determine whether transactions are taxed or exempt it's not enough to know item prices and buyer locations: we have to map our product categories to Vertex's rule drivers. That was an effort involving not just engineering but also our tax and analytics teams, and with the wide range of Etsy taxonomy categories it was no small task. Handling increased API traffic Coping with the continuous increase in traffic and maintaining the best checkout experience without delays has been a challenge all the time. Out of the different upgrades we did, the most important ones were to switch to multiple instances for vertex calls and shadowing. Multiple Instance upgrade In our initial integration, we were using the same vertex instance for Quotation and Distribute calls. And the same instance was responsible for generating the reports. This report generation started to affect our checkout experience. Reports are generally used by our tax team and they run them on a regular basis. But on top of that, we also run daily reports to feed the data captured by Vertex back into our own system for analytics purposes. We solved this by routing the quotation calls to one instance and then distributing them to the other. This helped in maintaining a clear separation of functionalities, and avoided interference between the two processes. We had to align the configurations between the instances as well. Splitting up the quotation and distribution calls opened up the door to horizontal scaling, now we can add as many instances of each type and load balance the requests between instances. Eg: When a request type lists multiple instances, we load balance between the instances by using the cart_id for quotations and receipt_ids for distributes I.e. cart_id % quotation_instance_count Shadow logging Shadow logging the requests helped us to simulate the stress on Vertex and monitor the checkout experience. We used this technique multiple times in the past. Whenever we had situations like, for example, adding five hundred thousand more listings whose taxes would be passed through the Vertex engine, we were concerned that the increase in traffic might impact buyer experience. To ensure it wouldn't, we tested for a period of time by slowly ramping shadow requests to Vertex: \"Shadow requests\" are test requests that we send to Vertex from orders, but without applying the calculated tax details to buyers' carts. This will simulate the load on vertex and we can monitor the cart checkout experience. Once we have done shadowing and seen how well Vertex handled the increased traffic, we are confident that releasing the features ensures it would not have any performance implications. Conclusion Given the volume of increasing traffic and the data involved, we will have to keep improving our design to support those. We've also had to address analytics, reporting, configuration sync and many more in designing the system, but we'll leave that story for next time.",

    "description": "One of our Guiding Principles at Etsy is that we “commit to our craft.” This means that we have a culture of learning, in which we’re constantly looking for opportunities to improve and learn, adopt industry best practices, and share our findings with our colleagues and our community. As part of that process, Etsy recently adopted Jetpack Compose – Android's modern toolkit for defining native UIs – as our preferred means of building our Android app. The process of adoption consisted of a gradual expansion in the size and complexity of features built using Compose, eventually culminating in a full rewrite of one of the primary screens in the app. The results of that rewrite gave us the confidence to recommend Compose as the primary tool for our Android engineers to build UIs going forward. Adoption Our engineers are always investigating the latest industry trends and technologies, but in this case a more structured approach was warranted due to the central nature of UI toolkits in the development process. Several engineers on the Android team were assigned to study the existing Compose documentation and examples we had used in prior builds and then create a short curriculum based on what they learned. Over several months, the team held multiple information sessions with the entire Android group, showing how to use Compose to build simple versions of some of our real app screens. Part of our in-house curriculum for learning Jetpack Compose via small modules. Each module built upon the previous module to build more complex versions of various features in our real app. Next, our Design Systems team started creating Compose versions of our internal UI toolkit components, with the goal of having a complete Compose implementation of our design system before major adoption. Compose is designed for interoperability with our existing toolkit, XML Views, providing an uncomplicated migration path that enables us to start using these new toolkit components in our existing XML Views with minimal disruption. This was our first chance to validate that the performance of Compose would be as good as or better than our existing toolkit components. This also gave the wider Android community at Etsy a chance to start using Compose in their day-to-day work and get comfortable with the new patterns Compose introduced. A partial list of the design system components our team was able to make available in Compose. Our Design Systems team also made heavy use of one of Compose’s most powerful features: Previews. Compose Previews allow a developer to visualize Composables in as many configurations as they want using arbitrary test data, all without having to run the app on a device. Every time the team made a change to a Design Systems Composable, they could validate the effect in a wide range of scenarios. After a few months of building and adopting toolkit components in Compose, our team felt it was time for a more significant challenge: rebuilding an entire screen. To prevent inadvertently causing a disruption for buyers or sellers on Etsy, we chose a heavily used screen only available in our backend for development builds. This step exposed us to a much wider scope of concerns: navigation, system UI, data fetching using coroutines from our API, and the orchestration of multiple Compose components interacting with each other. Using Kotlin Flows, we worked out how to structure our business and UI logic around a unidirectional data flow, a key unlock for future integration of Compose with Macramé – our standard architecture for use across all screens in the Etsy app. With a full internal screen under our belts, it was time to put Compose in front of real users. A few complex bottom sheets were the next pieces of our app to get the Compose treatment. For the first time, we exposed a major part of our UI, now fully written in Compose, to buyers and sellers on Etsy. We also paired a simple version of our Macramé architecture with these bottom sheets to prove that the two were compatible. A bottom sheet fully using Compose hosted inside of a screen built using Views. After successfully rolling out bottom sheets using Compose, we saw an opportunity to adopt Compose on a larger scale in the Shop screen. The existing Shop screen code was confusing to follow and very difficult to run experiments on – limiting our ability to help sellers improve their virtual storefronts. Compose and Macramé held the promise of addressing all these concerns. The Shop screen, fully built using Compose. In just around three months, our small team completed the rebuild. Our first order of business was to run an A/B experiment on the Shop screen to compare old vs. new. The results gave Compose even better marks than we had hoped for. Initial screen rendering time improved by 5%, and subjective interactions with the Shop screen, like taps and scrolls, were quicker and more fluid. User analytics showed the new screen improved conversion rate, add to cart actions, checkout starts, shop favoriting, listing views, and more – meaning these changes made a tangible, positive impact for our sellers. For the engineers tasked with coding the Shop screen, the results were just as impressive. An internal survey of engineers who had worked with the Shop screen before the rewrite showed a significant improvement in overall developer satisfaction. Building features required fewer lines of code, our respondents told us, and thanks to the Macramé architecture, testing was much easier and enabled us to greatly increase test coverage of business logic. Similar to what we learned during the development of our Design System components, Compose Previews were called out as a superpower for covering edge cases, and engineers said they were excited to work in a codebase that now featured a modern toolkit. Learnings We've learned quite a lot about Compose on our path to adopting it: Because of the unidirectional data flow of our Macramé architecture and stateless components built with Compose, state is decoupled from the UI and business logic is isolated and testable. The combination of Macramé and Compose has become the standard way we build features for our app. Colocation of layout and display logic allows for much easier manipulation of spacing, margins, and padding when working with complex display logic. Dynamic spacing is extremely difficult to do with XML layouts alone, and requires code in separate files to keep it all in sync. Creating previews of all possible Compose states using mock data has eliminated a large source of rework, bugs, and bad experiences for our buyers. Our team found it easier to build lazy-style lists in Compose compared to managing all the pieces involved with using RecyclerView, especially horizontal lazy lists. Interoperability between Compose and Views in both directions enabled a gradual adoption of Compose. Animation of Composables can be triggered automatically by data changes–no writing extra code to start and stop the animations properly. While no individual tool is perfect, we’re excited about the opportunities and efficiencies Compose has unlocked for our teams. As with any new technology, there's a learning curve, and some bumps along the way. One issue we found was in a 3rd party library we use. While the library has support for Compose, at the time of the Shop screen conversion, that support was still in alpha stage. After extensive testing, we decided to move forward using the alpha version, but an incompatibility could have necessitated us finding an alternative solution. Another learning is that LazyRows and LazyColumns, while similar in some respects to RecyclerView, come with their own specific way of handling keys and item reuse. This new lazy list paradigm has occasionally tripped us up and resulted in some unexpected behavior. Conclusion We’re thrilled with our team’s progress and outcomes in adopting this new toolkit. We’ve now fully rewritten several key UI screens, including Listing, Favorites, Search, and Cart using Compose, with more to come. Compose has given us a set of tools that lets us be more productive when delivering new features to our buyers, and its gradual rollout in our codebase is a tangible example of the Etsy team's commitment to our craft.",

    "link": "http://www.developertea.com",
    "description": "This episode explores the complex landscape of receiving advice in your career, particularly during uncertain times. It offers insights on how to critically evaluate feedback and external information, prepare for potential negative outcomes outside of your control, and adapt your focus to thrive in a changing industry.Explore why the vast amount of advice you receive throughout your career, including feedback from bosses and peers, platitudes, anecdotes, data, opinions, and facts, will shape your thinking.Discover that even people you trust and consider authoritative may give advice you shouldn't listen to. Sometimes, all the positive signals and feedback you receive may not predict negative career events like layoffs or not getting a promotion.Learn not to stop listening to feedback, but instead listen for themes and common threads that resonate with your gut intuition.Understand the importance of contextualising people's assertions, testing them, and putting them through the wringer. However, even when following great advice and testing it, you might still experience negative events like a layoff, as luck and chaos agents are often at the helm and are not under your control.Discover why it is important to not only prepare for luck but also to prepare for failure modes – situations that go poorly regardless of your upfront actions.Learn that resilience, preparation, and the ability to absorb impacts (becoming antifragile) are likely to happen because you recognise what happens in the margins and prepare for eventualities you may not think are likely, rather than solely from receiving good advice.Consider that there are no real silver bullets or secret answers in career advice; moments of wisdom shared by others are often just a snapshot of one experience.Learn to make decisions within your limited context and apply advice dynamically, considering how it changes with environmental shifts and plays out in unlucky scenarios.Discover the advice to be a little bit more skeptical of the advice you believe the most and a little more accepting of advice that might seem counterintuitive or on the fringes.Explore the crucial shift in focus from developing skills to emphasising ownership and responsibility to combat fear about the industry changing and your skills potentially losing value due to factors like AI or layoffs.Understand that taking responsibility means being willing to be the accountable person and figuring out how to achieve goals, which doesn't necessarily require having the skill yourself but rather being willing to supervise, verify, or import skills.Recognise that ownership and responsibility are difficult to export or outsource, and a human in the loop is critical for taking ownership and finishing the job, unlike trying to hold an AI accountable.Learn the practical advice to drive conversations with your manager towards growing your scope of responsibility, accountability, and ownership, which builds trust and reliability beyond just your skill set.Understand that your perception of the criticality of your tasks and meetings is usually inflated, and the ramifications of not attending are often much smaller than you imagine.Discover a tactical method to evaluate your obligations (meetings, tasks) based on their pliability (ease of being moved or changed) and volatility (risk/negative effect of changing it) to help you manage your time.Learn to be ruthless in identifying how you spend your time.📮 Ask a QuestionIf you enjoyed this episode and would like me to discuss a question that you have on the show, drop it over at: developertea.com.📮 Join the DiscordIf you want to be a part of a supportive community of engineers (non-engineers welcome!) working to improve their lives and careers, join us on the Developer Tea Discord community by visiting https://developertea.com/discord today!.🧡 Leave a ReviewIf you're enjoying the show and want to support the content head over to ratethispodcast.com/devtea and leave a review!.

Melo 2.0. Might make sense if he was LeBron, but he's not and LeBron's game is boring anyway. Let's do this well, win or lose.",

If the Trumps keep making demands, like demanding that they stop admitting students from outside the US, the students the US government rejects could still go to Harvard, be taught by the same teachers, collaborate and socialize with other Harvard-quality students, without interference from Trump. I imagine there are a few countries that would be willing to help. If you want to really make a point, open it in China.",

Further reading In the mid-to-late 2000s, you either knew, or were, that kid in grade school. You know. The one who could put games on your graphing calculator. You may be surprised to learn that some of these people didn’t exist totally in a vaccuum. There was in fact a thriving scene of hackers who had bent these calculators to their will, writing games, math software, and more generally hacking on the platform just for the sake of it. True to my interests, it’s all deeply embedded, pushing the limits of platforms that were obsolete when they were released. I’ll take you through some of the highlights of Texas Instruments calculator hacking done over the past two and a half decades, along with an explanation of why these projects are so technically impressive. This is xkcd #768. There are also 768 bytes in the RAM buffer used to hold TI display bitmaps. This is not a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence with xkcd. (source) Note Wow, it’s been a while since I’ve written anything. In the space of a year I’ve gotten a new job, bought a house, moved. Life comes at you fast. Thanks to everyone who has emailed to check on me—and I apologize for not being super responsive over email. I do plan to continue the articles I’ve started! The platform Throughout the 90s and 2000s, TI released a succession of z80-based graphing calculators. You might have heard of the z80—it was an improved version of the Intel 8080 developed by Zilog. Yeah. It’s old.1 They were quite nice 45 years ago when they were released! All TI calculators generally had similar low-end specs: z80 processor usually clocked at 8 or 10MHz—and note that the z80 can only retire one instruction every 4 cycles. 96x64 black and white LCD (a few models had a larger screen but this was by far the most common. The latest models finally have higher resolution color screens.) A link port which (ab)used the 2.5mm headphone jack connector Generally, 32KB of RAM, and on the 83+ and later, anywhere from 100KB to 2MB of flash storage (“archive”) TI’s operating system “TI-OS” (they call it “EOS” but nobody else does). TI-OS has: Arithmetic and graphing engine TI-BASIC scripting language On the models with flash, support for launching large “apps” stored exclusively in flash Needless to say, this is the very definition of a constrained environment. The most popular graphing calculators were of course the TI-83/84 Plus, which every American student for the past decade and a half has probably seen. I will use “TI-84 Plus” throughout here because it’s very likely the model you’re familiar with; however, it was more often referred to as the TI-83 Plus because they were basically identical. The 84 Plus had USB and a redesigned case, but the system was the same. Programming model The z80 assembly2 programming environment was pretty spartan: there was no supervisor or memory protection, so if you had a bug you were probably going to crash the calculator (the dreaded “RAM Cleared” message). The z80 is an 8-bit machine, with 16-bit pointers, so although archive was technically memory mapped, it wouldn’t all fit—it was actually paged in to a 16KB “window”: This diagram is heavily simplified, but you’ll notice the lack of any horsepower at all. There were several guides for learning assembly, but the best was by Sean McLaughlin, Learn TI-83 Plus Assembly in 28 Days. TI provided a very good SDK documentation about subroutines provided by TI-OS (and official support for Asm() programs), and with that you pretty much had free rein over the system. Software projects Those who followed calculator hacking news will surely recognize the individuals I’m calling out here, either by their name or, more likely, by their handle. For my own part, I was almost entirely a lurker, largely due to the influence of my parents who were not keen on talking to people online. (Remember, high school.) I was, however, a pretty good self-taught calculator programmer—more on that in a later article… Note A fair number of these links are starting to rot because development happened 20 years ago. Please do email me with corrections if you find a newly dead link. And of course massive kudos to the Internet Archive for preserving it all! Phoenix Easily the most famous3 graphing calculator game is Phoenix by Patrick Davidson. It’s a top-down space shoot-em-up similar to the arcade game Galaxian. The reason it is famous is not because it is fun—although it is—nor because it’s well implemented—although it is. Rather, this game is famous because it is one of the oldest, and Patrick and others have ported it to nearly every single z80 calculator ever released. Grayscale on the TI-84 Plus The first thing I remember being really wowed by was an RPG game called Desolate by Patrick Prendergast (tr1p1ea), which boasted four level grayscale. On top of that the game was not just a tech demo; it had a fully featured storyline and pretty good sprite art.4 Most emulators were able to detect that the application was doing grayscale and produce a clean rendering of it How was this possible on a device with only a black and white screen? The answer was that if you flickered pixels on and off fast enough, they would appear gray. Naïve attempts at this led to horrible jittery messes and found it difficult to get over 3 colors (black, white, gray). In contrast, Durk Kingma’s grayscale library that Desolate used achieved really nice 4-gray art by careful timing and by dithering the flickered pixels so that not all were on or off at once. Graphics consumed the majority of the compute budget for the game—but such is life for most video games! Game Boy emulator for the TI-84 Plus TI wasn’t the only company using z80 processors. The original Game Boy used them too! A natural question arises: maybe, possibly, could you run a Game Boy game on a calculator in some sort of hypervisor? Brendan Fletcher (calc84maniac) put a ton of engineering into TI-Boy SE, which does exactly that! A Game Boy cartridge is fairly large—Pokémon Red’s ROM is 1MB—so TI-Boy solves this by packing the ROM into a “shell” flash app using a PC program. Of course, you had to bring your own Game Boy cartridge ROM. The next problem is that many Game Boy cartridges have more RAM (up to 128KiB) than the TI-84 Plus (32KiB). (The Game Boy had only 8KiB built in, but cartridges could supply extra.) Here we’d seem to be stuck: how can you possibly emulate extra RAM? Xavier Andréani (critor) observed that TI calculators did in fact have extra RAM because the ASIC containing the z80 had more RAM than was exposed by default. TI-Boy reverse engineered the special commands to the hardware to bank-switch these into address space! The result is impressive: TI-Boy playing Legend of Zelda (via ticalc.org) Shells On calculators released before the TI-83 Plus, there was no official way to launch assembly language programs. These calculators had to be hacked using various techniques. The solution for end users was a shell - a launcher program that handled the annoying bits of transferring control from the OS. Many shells also provided additional routines a program could call. On the TI-82, the Ash shell accomplished this by sending a specially-crafted memory backup to the calculator. When the calculator next handled a keypress, the memory image redirected the CPU into the setup code. In a sense, this technique is one of the oldest exploits for any TI calculator. The shell that you are most likely to remember is MirageOS for the 84+. MirageOS was a popular tag-along with games shared peer-to-peer with a link cable, because the games needed it to run. It was also a flash app, so it persisted through RAM clears. I remember not being entirely clear on why its splash screen was so elaborate when I first encountered it, but now I appreciate the artwork! Shells got more elaborate over time, culminating in Doors CS by Christopher Mitchell (KermMartian), which had icons for assembly programs, a cursor-based UI, and a bunch of routines for programs to use. TI-84+ USB mass storage driver The 84+ had a really wacky USB port: it was an On-the-Go port, very obscure when it was released. This technically meant that the 84+ could act as a USB host. Dan Englender’s Usb8x supplied the missing driver code, allowing you to use a mouse (of questionable utility), keyboard, or more importantly, a flash drive. The calculator’s boot code provided low-level USB routines for get/send, but the impressive part is the upper USB stack including the mass storage and FAT16 driver “msd8x”—all, of course, in z80 assembly! Usb8x enabled, among other things, a hilarious demo: Michael Vincent may be one of the only people to have ever watched The Matrix on his calculator. (via ticalc.org) KnightOS Drew DeVault (SirCmpwn) was working on a promising project replacing TI-OS entirely with a from-scratch Unix-inspired, multitasking system called KnightOS. The cool part about this system is that it drew a lot from the multitasking paradigms we take for granted on a Mac or Linux box, but did it all with barely any help from the hardware. Programs were relocatable, there was preemptive multitasking, and there were loadable libraries that worked exactly like shared objects do in Unix. There was also a “real” filesystem with directories, flash wear leveling, and a protocol to connect to a computer. (It even has its own USB PID—0xCA1C.) Of course, the whole thing was all carefully implemented in z80 assembly, and kernel and library routines documented the contents of each register. It’s not vaporware; there’s autogenerated builds you can download and install on your calculator, and the source is on GitHub. Unfortunately its broad scope prevented it from achieving a stable release, but the bones are there and they are cool. I actually contributed a little to this project: I remember just having learned about synchronization primitives (mutexes and condition variables) and I easily knew enough about the z80 to be able to implement them for KnightOS. The Axe Parser project As you might imagine, there are two problems with writing assembly programs. First, you generally need a PC to do it properly, and most budding programmers were in school for most of their day. Second, and more importantly, z80 assembly is pretty arcane if you’re coming from BASIC. With the Axe Parser5, Kevin Horowitz (Quigibo) attempted to solve these problems by creating a new programming language that compiled into native code on the calculator. Axe is an app that reads a “TI-BASIC program” written with the built-in editor, but Axe redefined the grammar and semantics to provide a language that was very well suited to writing games. It’s quite an elegant solution: using the built-in editor means Axe didn’t have to ship an editor for its language. Rather, Axe is a compiler—it spends its engineering budget on producing better assembly code, with pages and pages of forum threads devoted to optimization. And further, Axe is extensible with new primitives provided as “Axioms”—plugins that further manipulate the grammar of the language. Here’s a hello world program in Axe. The Str1 token has been co-opted into a 16-bit pointer variable—this compiles on-calculator to an assembly program called HELLO! :.HELLO :\"Hello World\"→Str1 :Disp Str1 Unity: Native code on the TI-81 The TI-81 was an absolute potato of a calculator. Not only did it lack archive memory, it also lacked a link port, and lacked the Asm() command, meaning you were stuck with TI-BASIC. Stuck, that is, until Ben Moody (floppusmaximus) released Unity, a loader that exploited a buffer overflow in the primitive TI-OS, then installed itself to help load other assembly programs. With no link port, how did you get Unity or other assembly programs on the calculator? You typed them in, by hand! The installation instructions are reminiscent of typing in BASIC programs out of BYTE magazine: I suspect Randy Compton, who originally discovered the OS bug, did so by dumping the ROM with physical disassembly. z80 assembly is extremely amenable to reverse engineering because it’s hand-written. Operating system hacks While most projects ran on TI-OS, some ran up against TI-OS in order to make the hardware do things that TI preferred they didn’t do. There were scruples. Most people wanted to avoid the ire of Texas Instruments because (a) even the threat of lawyers tends to have a chilling effect on high school students and (b) people generally wanted to avoid besmirching the community’s image. And so there were certain things that were mostly considered off-limits, namely programs that were designed to help cheat on tests. Signing keys Really all anyone wanted to do was run their own code on their own hardware. TI had a crude but effective cryptographic signature check for apps and operating systems, which used the Rabin cryptosystem. They had released the signing key for TI-83 Plus apps as part of the SDK. However, the other keys that allowed signing OS images for the 83+, 84+, and apps and operating systems for the TI-89, were still secret. Using math against calculator enthusiasts—what did TI expect to happen?! Ben Moody realized that the state of the art in 2009 was enough to directly crack the ten year old 512-bit keys. His post (enigmatically titled “Fun Number Theory Facts”) revealed that he had found the prime factors of the public key for the 83+ operating system. Initially flabbergasted, the community threw together a BOINC cluster which cracked all the remaining keys in a few weeks without breaking a sweat. Texas Instruments threw a tantrum, lobbing legal threats that were, frankly, 100% bullshit abuses of the DMCA. The Electronic Frontier Foundation intervened on the hobbyists' behalf, explaining to TI that there is nothing illegal about knowing the prime factors of certain integers. The whole thing earned its own Wikipedia article. Today, you can easily find these keys on any enthusiast site, including right here. arTIfice Fairly recently (late 2020), TI decided what everyone really needed was a cold shower, and announced they’d be disabling all this assembly business with a software update for the TI-84+ CE (the newest color calculator), dubiously claiming that this would improve exam security, etc, etc.6 To quote Lionel Debroux: This slam shuts [sic] a golden age of over two decades (!) of native code being officially supported on at least one actively maintained TI graphing calculator. […] Like all true calculator enthusiasts, we have hard feelings about the matter. The community had always been nice to TI - nothing really damaging for TI’s business was ever released over 20+ years! - but a moral barrier has probably been broken today… As an olive branch they offered Python bindings; everyone immediately pointed out that Python is wicked slow in embedded environments and absolutely cannot replicate what native code can do.7 If you’ve read this far, you’ll note this isn’t the first time TI has been a little tone-deaf toward enthusiasts. Enter arTIfice8 - a proper jailbreak for these calculators. You simply install the CabriJr geometry app, and open a special data file with it, and suddenly you’re presented with a menu allowing you to run whatever you like. What’s cool about this is that it’s a jailbreak, not just a sweet hack that uses the hardware. Just like you may be familiar with jailbreaking an iPhone or Xbox, starting from within the sandbox and getting out, this abuses bugs in the wildly complicated CabriJr geometry app (signed and blessed to run by TI) to reenable arbitrary code execution and literally pop a shell or install hooks into the OS.9 The arTIfice exploit is just 927 bytes, and it packs a simple UI and loader in behind the shellcode. Being this small, the underlying exploit is probably the lowest hanging fruit of plenty of zero-days in this and other TI software. So yeah, now exams are secure, or something. Whence from here? For every project I listed, there were ten others that I didn’t. (And if I missed yours, I mean no disrespect!) The breadth and depth of tinkering is staggering: I haven’t even touched the scene for the ARM-based Nspire. There are always challengers to Texas Instruments' entrenchment in high schools; Casio in particular has made some attractive devices. There has been a modest amount of scene releases for Casio calculators as well. The startup Numworks makes calculators based on a very capable STM32F429 microcontroller. Until recently, the Numworks had an open-source operating system and I had half-hoped that it might spark a renaissance of handheld calculators. The hardware is available and pretty nice, but they’ve closed the source code license, so I don’t think it will see any grassroots adoption by the calculator scene. But no matter the platform, the steady stream of bored nerds in high school cannot be quenched, and they will have the support of smart engineers with free time. In the true hacker spirit, I suspect people will continue to push the boundaries of whatever hardware they find in their hands. Further reading Casual readers may wish to browse ticalc.org’s news (which goes back to 1997) for the most interesting news, or spelunk in their massive archives. Or, dive into the phpBB rabbit holes of the community’s forums, some dead and some still thriving! ticalc.org: one part forum, one part news source, three parts massive archive of nearly all software released for any TI calculator Cemetech: fairly formal, moderate amount of chatter but with pretty good signal to noise ratio and with very knowledgeable people. Still very active. Omnimaga: less formal, lots of projects, with a sprawling offtopic section and very elaborate forum signatures. Datamath: a large “online museum” with hardware teardowns, reverse engineering, and documentation of nearly every calculator ever released. TI-Planet: a French forum that was linked a lot, with a large downloads section and active community; unfortunately I don’t know much about it firsthand because I don’t speak French. calc.org (Wayback link): also used to be called Dimension-TI. A now-defunct forum and download host. Unfortunately it was before my time and I don’t know much about it. Oh, and other calculator nerds: keep me honest. Corrections welcome by comment or email. A popular hobbyist project is to build your own homebrew z80 computer, precisely because it is so simple that you can understand the foundations of the system. My favorite is probably Jim MacAurthur’s beautiful minimal z80 in a laser cut case with a hand crank to single-step instructions! ↩︎ The z80 generally made life pretty difficult for people who attempted to make a good C compiler for it. I believe I have the only remaining copy of HITECH-C for DOS, which was actually a decent C compiler. As I said, more on that in a later article. ↩︎ Your fame results may vary. Seemed this way to me, anyway. ↩︎ It’s good enough to have garnered at least a few fan ports to ZX Spectrum and some old Soviet computers. ↩︎ Wow, the Axe user manual takes me back—it was my first exposure to xkcd! ↩︎ Feels like they got advice from the Playstation Linux team. ↩︎ As far as I can tell, they are likely using MicroPython—implementing a Python from scratch would be a huge task—but I can’t find any MIT license disclosure. ↩︎ Holy moly does this page cause my CPU fans to spin… ↩︎ I’ll point out that all these hooks were already possible and remain supported by the OS itself; it’s how apps like Inequalz (which graphs inequalities) work - they hook the graph equation screens and the drawing routines, using official APIs. ↩︎",

    "description": "Table of Contents Sniffing traffic Dissecting traffic with Wireshark Inspecting the firmware Why doesn’t this camera support RTSP? Pwning the camera Low hanging fruit first Getting root Reversing the protocol Static analysis with Ghidra Strings: a bounty of information The Charlie Scrambler Dynamic analysis with gdb Feeding the watchdog Charlie strikes again A brief history of the Baichuan protocol Neolink: a new client Getting the video data Wrap it in maroon and white, er, RTSP Testing it with Blue Iris Future work Way back in late 2019, I dissected a Reolink B800 IP camera to demonstrate the various parts of an embedded Linux system. It’s fairly nice hardware, actually—it has a 4K video sensor, a microphone, power over Ethernet, and is nominally waterproof. And yes, it runs Linux. It came in a “kit” of six cameras and an NVR (a dedicated recording box that also powers the cameras). Unfortunately, the NVR is pretty anemic: it’s clearly an existing model with slight changes to support 4K cameras, and it struggles to support more than one viewer at a time. However, I bought these cameras because I believed they supported open standards such as ONVIF, so I’d just swap the NVR for a copy of Blue Iris running on my server. At the time, the Reolink support page clearly indicated that all of their non-battery-powered cameras supported RTSP. After the system was installed, it became apparent that the cameras did not in fact support RTSP—the only port open on them was port 9000. Then, barely outside my return window, Reolink updated their support page to say that the cameras would only work with their 8-channel NVR or proprietary viewer apps. This was, in the immortal words of Bill and Ted, bogus. Heinous. Most non-triumphant. Bogus enough that I decided to pwn the camera, reverse engineer the protocol, and write my own software to get the video stream. The end result is a new piece of open-source software called Neolink, which allows Blue Iris, Shinobi, or other NVR software to receive video from unmodified Reolink cameras. Here’s how I did it. Sniffing traffic As a first step, I fired up Wireshark and captured traffic between the camera and its official Reolink PC client1. The only thing that jumped out to me was the appearance of a sync word at the beginning of each packet, 0xf0debc0a. (In little endian, this is 0x0abcdef0.) On a lark, I Googled this, and actually found a project on GitHub from 2015 which was attempting to retrieve data from Swann cameras! A quick look at the code told me that although they share the sync word and packet header, the protocols for my camera and these older cameras were very different. The payload appeared to be encrypted in my captures. Furthermore, the code wouldn’t even run due to some questionable pointer juggling. Time to extract what I could—the header layout was correct—and move on. Dissecting traffic with Wireshark Always, always spend time developing debug or analysis tools. In my experience, such tools immediately pay back your time investment by a factor of 4 or more. With what I knew, I was able to write a “Baichuan” protocol dissector for Wireshark using Mika’s awesome tutorial. This was easy and fun: Wireshark lets you write dissectors in Lua (disclaimer: your definition of fun may vary). Now Wireshark could show me the payload lengths and message IDs. Not much, but it was a start. Inspecting the firmware In order to figure out whatever encryption and/or obfuscation the protocol was using, I planned to reverse engineer the firmware. I felt pretty confident that the underlying video was using a well-known protocol (especially since the camera seemed to have dedicated video encoding hardware). So “all” I’d have to do is reverse engineer the rest of the protocol. Easy peasy, right? Why doesn’t this camera support RTSP? As a quick aside, it’s natural to wonder why this camera doesn’t support RTSP and/or ONVIF. After all, plenty of other Reolink cameras do. Because I’d like to give them the benefit of the doubt, I’ll propose the possibility that Reolink ran out of storage on this camera and had to axe some features. After all, a 16MB flash chip would cost a whole 20 cents extra. This is just a cost-saving measure and definitely not vendor lock-in, hmmm? Pwning the camera Right, onward. With the protocol not immediately accessible, it was time to crack this camera open. My previous disassembly of the camera has already indicated that it uses SPI NOR flash—bog standard for a small Linux system like this. I was wanting to try out a really neat little SOIC socket I had discovered and ordered on Taobao a little while back. I desoldered the flash and soldered on a socket instead. The camera was now pwned, permanently—there was nothing I could do to brick it (I could always just reflash it with flashrom) and there was nothing Reolink could do to stop me from running my own code on it (since I had control of the first instruction executed, if need be2). With the flash now conveniently socketed, I dumped it and used binwalk to inspect the layout. Here’s the flash layout—the nice round byte offsets that engineers tend to pick.3 Bootloader, Linux uImage, squashfs rootfs, and JFFS2 persistent partition. DECIMAL HEXADECIMAL DESCRIPTION -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 67266 0x106C2 eCos RTOS string reference 1769472 0x1B0000 uImage header 3604480 0x370000 Squashfs filesystem, little endian 7798784 0x770000 JFFS2 filesystem, little endian This also lines up nicely with this visualization of the flash image, made by a neat little tool called BinVis. binwalk also conveniently offers to unpack the filesystems it finds. Low hanging fruit first My first order of business was to find the actual camera binary. It was pretty easy to find; it’s sitting in its own directory at /mnt/app/dvr. The dvr binary also had an accompanying dvr.xml, which looked like a configuration file. A little grepping later, and… sure enough, here were the magic words ONVIF and RTSP! # .... push_server=\"pushx.reolink.com\" push_server_port=\"9501\" support_3gnet=\"0\" support_intelligence=\"0\" support_smartsearch=\"0\" support_onvif=\"0\" support_rtsp=\"0\" support_bc=\"1\" support_3dnr_config_interface=\"1\" default_3dnr_config=\"1\" # .... I suspected these were simply feature flags dictating to the software which features to enable. What if I just changed these zeros to ones? Rebuilding the rootfs wasn’t quite as easy as extracting it, but I cobbled together a command through trial and error. I wanted to get the squashfs format exactly the same as the one reported by binwalk, so that I could be sure that the stock kernel would mount it. Since I was mostly flying blind without a UART console, I didn’t want any trouble. $ mksquashfs new-squashfs-root/ new-squashfs.img -comp xz -b 262144 -all-root -noappend $ dd if=new-squashfs.img of=pwned.bin bs=1 seek=$((0x370000)) conv=notrunc $ flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=2232H,port=A -w pwned.bin Alas, it was not to be this easy. The camera exhibited a remarkable lack of behavioral reform: no new ports opened, nothing. For comparison, I downloaded and unpacked a firmware update for a different Reolink camera that did support RTSP. The dvr binary for that camera was nearly 8 megabytes, while my victim’s was only a little over 3. Clearly, the engineers compiled out the unneeded bits. Getting root Fine. If Reolink has compiled the extra functionality out, then the least the camera could do is give me a shell. While I was here, I decided I’d make some, ahem, extra modifications. A quick Google did not yield prebuilt binaries of the tools I was looking for. Instead, I checked out a fresh copy of Buildroot and quickly set it up for a baseline MIPS configuration with static linking, then asked for copies of gdbserver, busybox with all the fixin’s, and strace: $ make qemu_mips32r2el_malta_defconfig $ make menuconfig # (with appropriate edits made) $ make busybox gdb strace Thirty minutes later, I had my tools. In the rootfs tree that binwalk had extracted, there’s the usual assortment of startup scripts in /etc/init.d. With my tricked-out Busybox copied to /bin, and a symlink created named telnetd, I added an extra line to one of the startup scripts: # Get a shell /bin/telnetd -l /bin/sh Fingers crossed, I reinstalled the flash and powered the camera. $ telnet 192.168.1.187 Trying 192.168.1.187... Connected to 192.168.1.187. Escape character is '^]'. /mnt/app # Mwahahaha. Reversing the protocol What to do with my newfound power? I planned to start with a static analysis of the firmware, first reverse engineering the encryption scheme. If I got stuck, I could interrogate the camera binary as it executed. Once I could undo the encryption, I’d be able to see what the actual protocol was like. Static analysis with Ghidra The traditional hobbyist tool for static analysis, IDA free edition, is no good here, because my binary is for MIPS, which the free IDA refuses to disassemble. Instead, the tool of choice is Ghidra, an astoundingly good open-source reverse engineering suite released by the NSA. Now, normally saying “I ran a binary the NSA gave me” will get you laughed out of the room. But Ghidra has been open source for a while now, so I feel reasonably safe installing it from the Arch Linux repository. If this website looks like it’s made by a government agency, it’s because it is. Ghidra is awesome. Seriously, this is a piece of software you’d have to pay $10000 for, and it should be your go-to for reverse engineering work. In addition to the disassembler and analyzer, Ghidra also includes a decompiler, which prints pseudo-C code instead of leaving you digging through MIPS assembly. It also re-analyzes in realtime as you annotate function arguments with type information and names. These features easily cut my time spent reverse engineering in half. So, armed with Ghidra and a false sense of confidence stemming from never having done any reverse engineering before, I went spelunking in the Baichuan binaries. Strings: a bounty of information There’s a reason most reverse engineers start by examining the strings in an unknown binary—it’s a technique that works. In my case, checking for strings in the desktop client and the firmware’s server yielded debug print statements, function names (which Ghidra automatically annotated), and a couple other oddball strings that I’ll talk about in a minute. Both codebases were clearly built around a shared proprietary “BCSDK” library. Searching for crypt yielded a couple of candidate functions that purported to perform encryption: Well, no RSA here, or anything resembling “real” encryption, except AES. (And I could find any AES keys embedded in the app in short order.) But what’s this string stuck nonchalantly in the middle of the others? That’s not a function name. I hit find-references and read the code that uses it. The Charlie Scrambler Ghidra took me to this gem of a function: Technically, this is the decryption function; there’s another one that works in reverse. It only takes a second to understand what’s going on here: the “encryption” scheme is simply: XOR the data with the string Charlie is the designer of P2P!!, then mix up the bytes. This isn’t encryption. This is just a scrambler. Bravo, Charlie, your “design” is permanently encoded in this protocol for all time. Don’t roll your own crypto, kids. Unfortunately, the Charlie Scrambler is only called from UDP functions (see the cross-reference at the bottom of the Ghidra window). This meant it wasn’t my pigeon; my camera uses TCP. At this point I had no idea which of the other “encryption” functions were the right one for my camera, so it was time to bring out my next weapon. Dynamic analysis with gdb With my shell access waiting, my next move was to attach a debugger and control the dvr program remotely from my workstation using my cross-compiled gdbserver and strace tools. My Busybox included an FTP server and a TCP wrapper: $ /bin/busybox tcpsvd -vE 0.0.0.0 21 ftpd / -w -A tcpsvd: listening on 0.0.0.0:21 With this setup I could push whatever tools I wanted to the camera filesystem, even though I hadn’t packed them into the firmware. I went through this process manually about twice before it became really tedious. This is the kind of thing it’s possible to automate with expect, a Tcl (!) program that pretends to be a console user. I scripted these interactions, which reduced the connect, tool push, and gdb setup to a simple: $ ./start-debug.exp An added benefit of this setup is that I could stick whatever gdb commands I wanted to run at startup at the end of the script, instead of writing a dedicated GDB script. These dynamic printf commands simply print in the GDB console when the camera hits a breakpoint, helpful for knowing which functions are being called without halting the camera: send_gdb \"dprintf *0x478908, \\\"_Nets_Without_Password_Login_V20\\\\n\\\"\" send_gdb \"dprintf *0x4780ac, \\\"FUN_004780ac\\\\n\\\"\" send_gdb \"dprintf *0x6310f0, \\\"Md5_string_encrypt\\\\n\\\"\" Feeding the watchdog After attaching and halting the dvr daemon, the camera promptly crashed and reset. After some quick investigation, the camera had a watchdog enabled at /dev/watchdog—a very common setup for embedded devices. I was doing open heart surgery on this software—I didn’t need some two-bit peripheral wandering by and hitting it with an AED! Busybox ships with a watchdog minder, so I simply fired it up: $ watchdog /dev/watchdog Problem solved. Charlie strikes again After my breakpoint was hit, I knew which encryption function I was dealing with: Nets_XmlEncryption. This was immediately good news, because after figuring out the encryption, I was likely dealing with nice ordinary XML, not some crazy half-baked bag of C structs. I took a look at the decompiled function in question in Ghidra, annotating as I went. Sure did look familiar… No engineering lessons had been learned during the redesign, and the influence of Charlie was alive and well! Here is the Charlie Scrambler back in force, but without the mixing step, and with a shorter key. Fine, whatever. Implementing the Scrambler in my Wireshark dissector didn’t take very long—although I was briefly baffled by a header of varying length depending on the message type. Once implemented, I was greeted with this glorious sight: Again, I highly recommend writing plugins for Wireshark. You can do it in Lua (or C if you’re that hardcore), and it only takes a couple hours to have a really nice debug tool. A brief history of the Baichuan protocol I won’t bore you with the gory details, but I’ll summarize my findings. The Baichuan protocol has had several iterations over the years. The very oldest seem to be UDP-based, using a proprietary SDK called TUTK, illicit copies of which can conveniently be found on GitHub. This is no longer used; it’s not even present in the camera code. The next variant is indeed a plaintext “bag of structs”, which consists of a header and a body specified by a message ID in the header. This “legacy variant” is briefly used on the B800 so that both clients can negotiate an upgrade to the “modern variant,” which is the scrambled XML-based scheme you see above. On top of this, modern messages can optionally have a payload. A certain XML message switches the entire message ID into “binary mode,” which supplies a raw data stream in subsequent messages. When the client sends a video-start command, the camera replies with a binary stream containing raw H.265 video. On top of that, the payload can also be more encrypted XML, separate from the main XML for some reason. On the whole, it’s really quite a pain to parse. Neolink: a new client Once my Wireshark dissector was humming along, it was time to write a new client. I wanted my software to be fast, high-level, and correct, since it would be part of a security system setup. That’s right: I rewrote Reolink’s software in Rust. Well, not exactly. Neolink is a new client completely from scratch. It speaks the same Baichuan protocol as the camera, and it extracts the video and forwards it to another real NVR client like Blue Iris over RTSP. The parsing code is somewhat hairy4, but other than that, it’s straightforward. Getting the video data Here’s all the client is capable of right now. It’s pretty easy to read if you want to look at the source. Send a legacy login message to get the camera to “upgrade” to modern messages. Note: this uses plain MD5 encryption for your password, another, um, interesting design choice. Use a password that isn’t in a rainbow table! Send a modern login message to actually authenticate to the camera. Send a start video request: let start_video = Bc::new_from_xml( BcMeta { msg_id: MSG_ID_VIDEO, client_idx: 0, encrypted: true, class: 0x6414, }, BcXml { preview: Some(Preview { version: xml_ver(), channel_id: 0, handle: 0, stream_type: \"mainStream\".to_string(), }), ..Default::default() }); sub_video.send(start_video)?; Spit out the binary data when it’s received: loop { let msg = sub_video.rx.recv_timeout(self.rx_timeout)?; if let BcBody::ModernMsg(ModernMsg { binary: Some(binary), .. }) = msg.body { data_out.write_all(binary.as_slice())?; } } Wrap it in maroon and white, er, RTSP5 For this part of the program I reached for Gstreamer, which ships with an RTSP server. Gstreamer is… complex. However, their examples are fantastic; they even provided a sample RTSP server in Rust! The general approach for feeding Gstreamer data from an arbitrary part of your program is to use a block called an appsrc. This lets you get a callback whenever Gstreamer wants data, or alternatively just push data whenever you have some and let Gstreamer handle scheduling it. The latter approach is the one I went with here, since the camera doesn’t wait for a signal to send video data. I wrapped everything in a Gstreamer pipeline: appsrc name=baichuan is-live=true emit-signals=false max-bytes=0 ! h265parse ! rtph265pay name=pay0 Testing it with Blue Iris The moment of truth arrived… could Blue Iris connect to my RTSP server and actually display the video? You bet. I present… me! In glorious 4K! Future work I’ve been soak-testing Neolink for a while now and I think it’s pretty stable. Going forward I’m packaging it up as a real Windows service (not a command line program) to run alongside Blue Iris on my server. Go look at it and download it for yourself! I’m also interested in getting Neolink working with other “NVR only” Reolink cameras, of which there are quite a few. So far I haven’t purchased any other hardware, so if you have one of these cameras, please get in touch so we can test it. It might Just Work out of the box. Port scan your cameras! If they have port 9000 available, chances are good that they speak the Baichuan protocol. This project was a “just right” intro to reverse engineering. Low-security systems like these let you teach yourself the principles without actively trying to thwart reverse engineering. I taught myself a lot, and I hope it provides a lot of value for folks who own these cameras. Finally, some shameless self-promotion: embedded Linux systems are actually pretty approachable! If you’d like to learn how to do this kind of thing, you might be interested in my Mastering Embedded Linux series, designed to help you become an expert in hacking low-cost embedded Linux systems just like this camera.

    "title": "MinorMiner: we turn your kid's maths homework into Bitcoin",
    "link": "https://robertheaton.com/minor-miner/",
    "description": "Hello! Hello! Welcome, welcome. My name is Hobert Reaton, and I’m here in this shabby motel conference room to present you with yet another once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity. Look at this picture. Tell me what you see: Do you see learning? Self-improvement? The future leaders of our country? I’ll tell you what I see: wasted computing power. Between the ages of 5 and 18, the average child in full-time education completes about 5 maths worksheets a week. Each worksheet has 20 questions. This means that over the course of their school career, every single one of our kids performs about 80,000 calculations. At the moment we completely waste their work. A student figures out that 5+5=10 and 7x7=49. This motivates them; they’re energised by their success. But then what do we do with the fruits of their labour? Nothing! We throw the fruit away, to rot in the void. “We knew that already,” we tell our children. “Your ideas don’t matter.” Unlike the rest of society, I believe that kids deserve to feel appreciated. I believe that their achievements are valuable. That’s why I founded MinorMiner. What is MinorMiner? MinorMiner is a platform that allows school-age children to monetise their maths homework by using it to mine Bitcoin. Yes, you heard me. We send children their homework, they crunch through it, and then together we transform their sweat into digital gold. This isn’t some rinky-dink incentive program where we bribe children to care about multiplication. Homework is the essential raw material that feeds our machine. We need these kids. No kids; no Bitcoin. In order to understand the innovation that makes MinorMiner possible, we first need to understand how Bitcoin is mined today. Right now, people mine Bitcoin by using computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The puzzles look like this: Take the list of the Bitcoin transactions that have occurred since the last Bitcoin was mined. Check that they’re all correctly authorized and that none of them spend money that the creator doesn’t have. Choose a string of extra letters and numbers to add on to the end of this list (a nonce). This is your attempt to solve the puzzle. Pass the list and your extra characters through an extremely complex function called the SHA-256 hash function (technically you pass it through the function twice). The hash function chops and slices and spins and dices the input around, seemingly (but not actually) at random. At the end it spits out a number The puzzle that you’re trying to solve is: what combination of letters and numbers from step 2 cause the output from step 3 to be less than some small target number? Step 1 Collect valid Bitcoin transactions since last block Step 2 Add nonce Step 3 Pass transactions and nonce through hash function Step 4 Check if hash output is less than target NO - try again with new nonce Publish solution and claim reward YES - new bitcoin block mined! There’s no elegant way to solve these puzzles. The only thing for Bitcoin miners to do is to guess inputs to step 2, over and over and over again, until they find one that happens to satisfy the criteria in step 4. When a miner guesses a right answer we say that they’ve “mined” a new “block”. They attach their solution to the blockchain to show that they’ve verified the transactions in the block, and they’re rewarded with new bitcoin. Their work, along with a couple of extra steps that I’ve hand-waved over, ensures that the blockchain stays safe and secure. However, it also requires an incredible amount of electricity - around 150TWh per year, or 1% of the world’s total energy consumption. What if there was a better, more efficient way to achieve the same thing? This is where MinorMiner and school-aged children come in. “But Bitcoin mining sounds hard!” I hear you wail. “My child has only a rudimentary grasp of basic algorithms!” True, true - but the magic is that the children on our platform don’t need to know how to mine Bitcoin, and they won’t even know that they’re doing it. Our team has converted the SHA-256 hashing algorithm used by the bitcoin blockchain into a sequence of elementary arithmetic questions that even the dullest dullard can answer. Solving a blockchain puzzle used to require understanding and executing a SHA-256 hash. Now all it takes is skipping through a few trillion simple brainteasers. 5+3=? 10*5=? Is 102 bigger than 67? (y/n) And so on The kids do these sums - we take care of the rest. How does the MinorMiner platform work? The heart of MinorMiner is a centralised system that manages our mining. The system decomposes a SHA-256 hash computation into simple arithmetic questions, and works out which of these questions need answering next. Simple enough - but how do we get the questions to the kids? Three words: online maths quizzes. You see, MinorMiner also has a maths learning platform that we sell to schools all over the world. Our platform isn’t particularly good, but we give department heads a generous revenue share and so this tends not to matter. Once a teacher (or “distribution associate” as we like to call them) is set up on MinorMiner, they assign a quiz to their class as homework. In the evening their children (or “computation partners”) log into the MinorMiner portal and answer their quiz for the day, which consists of whatever questions our hashing system needs doing next. By way of compensation their distribution associate doesn’t give them a detention. We collect their answers and use them to continue calculating a hash. When one partner finishes their quiz, the next partner continues calculating from where they left off. We have to be careful - a hash is a delicate thing. One tiny mistake in one tiny step and - poof! - the whole calculation is completely, irreversibly screwed. That’s why send each calculation to two separate computation partners. If their answers disagree then we escalate to a slightly older partner to adjudicate. We maintain a rating for each partner based on their accuracy. If their rating drops below 4.3 stars then they are invited to undergo additional training to help them get back to the standard expected for MinorMiner partners. If such improvement is not forthcoming then they are invited to seek maths education elsewhere. Any questions so far? No? Then it’s time for me to show you our real technological breakthrough. CUDAAAAGH We write our mining code using a Python library called Centralized Underage Distributed Arithmetic - Automated Assignment And Group Hashing (CUDAAAAGH). CUDAAAAGH allows us to distribute any complex computation across an infinitely-scalable pool of computation partners. We’ve open-sourced it on GitHub and PyPi. To use it, we run pip install CUDAAAAGH and then use its CUDAAAAGHInt class everywhere we would normally use Python’s standard integer type. Aside from that, we write all of our code as normal. When we execute our program, CUDAAAAGH automatically offloads any arithmetic computations to our network of computation partners, instead of burdening our own CPUs. For example: from CUDAAAAGH import CUDAAAAGHInt x = CUDAAAAGHInt(5) y = x + CUDAAAAGHInt(10) # Behind the scenes, this sends the calculation \"5+10\" to a computation # partner. Execution pauses until we receive an answer. print(f\"The answer is: {y}\") # =\u003e 15 This works for all integer operations. For complex operations like XOR, CUDAAAAGH breaks them up into simpler additions and multiplications that will be more familiar to our computation partners. It then combines their answers behind the scenes to calculate the requested XOR: from CUDAAAAGH import CUDAAAAGHInt x = CUDAAAAGHInt(0b010100100) y = x ^ CUDAAAAGHInt(0b111100101) print(y) # =\u003e 321 And before you ask - yes you can absolutely use CUDAAAAGH to train AI models. Stick around until the end for more details. I know what you’re thinking: this is genius, it’s revolutionary, but Bitcoin mining is a game of speed. Is CUDAAAAGH fast enough? And to you I say: hell yes it’s almost fast enough, if you go by our 5-year projections and use our heterodox assumptions about the direction of the world economy. Hold onto your cheque books everybody. It’s time to mine Today, calculating a hash takes the MinorMiner platform about 7 billion operations. An off-the-shelf ten-year-old can perform one addition every 10 seconds. Including a generous sleeping allowance, this means that they can compute 1 hash every 2,000 years. On the other hand, specialized mining rigs can compute 1 hash every 0.00000000001 seconds, and new blocks are mined every 10 minutes. These numbers don’t work for MinorMiner - yet. Fortunately MinorMiner is in a fundamentally strong position in the value chain. We’re fuelled by exhaust work that was previously completely wasted, which means that we don’t need to be uber-efficient in order to be competitive. However, we do still need to complete each hash within the time it takes for a new block to be mined. Otherwise, even if we find a successful hash that would have mined us a block and won us some Bitcoin, someone else will have mined that block already. This is why MinorMiner’s number one focus is on turbo-charing our hashrate. Let me tell about our top three strategies: parallelisation, curriculum optimisation, and teacher incentive alignment. 1. Parallelisation First, parallelisation. Right now, a single partner works on a single hash. This means that even though adding more partners allows us to calculate more hashes at the same time, it doesn’t decrease the end-to-end time it takes to calculate a single hash. However, we can distribute work between computation partners far more cunningly than we do today. We can split up the calculations required to compute a hash into independent chunks, and we can give the chunks to different computation partners to work on in parallel. Once all of the chunks are done, we can combine them and take a big leap forward in a single hash, instead of many small leaps in lots of different hashes. Spreading out work like this allows us to decrease the time it takes us to calculate a single hash. This will significantly increase our competitiveness. “But Hobert, SHA-256 can’t be parallelised!” I hear you squawking. “It uses a sequential block structure, where the output of each block is the input to the next block! This means that you can’t calculate later blocks until you’ve first calculated earlier ones. This makes parallelisation impossible!” You’re right, oddly-well-informed heckler! Most implementations of SHA-256 can’t be usefully parallelised. However, remember that CUDAAAAGH breaks bitwise operations like AND, OR, and XOR into a large number of additions and multiplications. Many of the sub-calculations inside a single XOR operation are in fact independent and don’t depend on each other. This makes them easy to parallelise and get the massive speedups I’ve been promising. For example, here’s our current, naive implementation of XOR: class CUDAAAAGHInt: def __init__(self, val: int): self.val = val def __xor__(self, other: 'CUDAAAAGHInt') -\u003e 'CUDAAAAGHInt': result = CUDAAAAGHInt(0) # Calculate the value of each bit, and use bit-shifting to combine # them using standard integer arithemtic. for i in range(max(self.bit_length(), other.bit_length())): bit_self = self._ith_bit(CUDAAAAGHInt(i)) bit_other = other._ith_bit(CUDAAAAGHInt(i)) xor_bit = bit_self + bit_other - CUDAAAAGHInt(2) * bit_self * bit_other result += xor_bit \u003c\u003c CUDAAAAGHInt(i) return result def _ith_bit(self, i: 'CUDAAAAGHInt') -\u003e 'CUDAAAAGHInt': return CUDAAAAGHInt((self.val \u003e\u003e i.val) \u0026 1) def bit_length(self) -\u003e int: return self.val.bit_length() This implementation is serial and slow - just look at that for-loop! But now look even closer. Notice how each pass through the loop is entirely independent of all others. This means that we can calculate the value of each bit separately, in parallel, then combine all the results once we’re done. We can even compute bit_x and bit_y in parallel inside each loop. Combining these tricks gives us a parallel implementation that looks something like this: import asyncio class CUDAAAAGHInt: def __init__(self, val: int): self.val = val async def __xor__(self, other: 'CUDAAAAGHInt') -\u003e 'CUDAAAAGHInt': # Calculate a single bit XOR at position i async def compute_bit_xor(i: int) -\u003e 'CUDAAAAGHInt': bit_self_task = asyncio.create_task(self._ith_bit(CUDAAAAGHInt(i))) bit_other_task = asyncio.create_task(other._ith_bit(CUDAAAAGHInt(i))) bit_self = await bit_self_task bit_other = await bit_other_task xor_bit = bit_self + bit_other - CUDAAAAGHInt(2) * bit_self * bit_other return xor_bit \u003c\u003c CUDAAAAGHInt(i) # Determine the number of bits to process max_bits = max(self.bit_length(), other.bit_length()) # Calculate all bits concurrently tasks = [compute_bit_xor(i) for i in range(max_bits)] all_bits = await asyncio.gather(*tasks) # Sum the results result = CUDAAAAGHInt(0) for bit in all_bits: result = result + bit return result async def _ith_bit(self, i: 'CUDAAAAGHInt') -\u003e 'CUDAAAAGHInt': return CUDAAAAGHInt((self.val \u003e\u003e i.val) \u0026 1) def bit_length(self) -\u003e int: return self.val.bit_length() This will reduce the time it takes for us to calculate the XOR of two numbers M and N by a factor of about log2(max(M, N)). We’re mostly dealing with 32-bit integers, so this is a 5x speedup. I’m sure you’ve all noticed that we could use a map-reduce approach to turbocharge that last sum as well. I’m also sure that a couple of you have noticed that we could write a monad that allows us to elegantly parallelise everything, everywhere. I’m even more sure that one of you has already emailed me an implementation of this monad, written in a Lisp dialect that you designed yourself. Fair warning to that person - I am unlikely to read it. 2. Curriculum optimisation A 5x speedup in our xor implementation is very, very, deeply impressive, but it’s still a hack. Decomposing XOR calculations into additions and multiplications is fundamentally inefficient, and it imposes a hard ceiling on our performance. In order to achieve true speed and elegance, we need to perform the XOR directly, without splitting it up. The reason that we don’t do this already is because most children can’t calculate even a basic 8-bit XOR. I know! I was as shocked as you when I found out. But these kids aren’t stupid; their ignorance isn’t their fault. They’re being let down by a broken system that fails to teach them the skills they need to compete in today’s highly-specialised economy. This is why we’ve successfully lobbied to have XOR calculations added to the first grade syllabus, starting in the coming autumn term. We’ve produced a textbook containing all the important bitwise operations that every 7 year-old should know, including XOR, AND, OR, and bitshifts. This will allow us to ask our computation partners truly useful questions like What is 2136782 ^ 2136821?, instead of spoonfeeding them piles of simpler calculations. We predict that this will lead to a further hashrate speedup of approximately 100x, and we expect to start seeing results in Q1 next year, after the end-of-unit quizzes start to bite. “Teach a man to hash and you’ll etc etc.” But why stop with XORs? Think about how legacy mining has evolved over the last decade or so. The first Bitcoins were mined on normal computers, with normal CPUs. Nowadays all bitcoins are mined using specialised computers called ASICs, hardwired to calculates hashes and nothing out. In order to compete, we have to train human ASICs. Kids need to learn how to calculate a SHA-256 themselves, end-to-end. This is why we’re such vocal supporters of SB-1337 - “No Child Left Unmined.” SB-1337 will replace the outdated year 7 maths syllabus with an in-depth, end-to-end course on calculating SHA-256 hashes by hand. It will allow us to stop sending students trivial additions and multiplications, and send them real maths instead: Question 1: What is the SHA-256 hash of 01003ba3edfd7a...? (3 marks) Question 2: What is the SHA-256 hash of 01003ba3edfd7b...? (3 marks) We’ll be able to turn their homework directly into bitcoins, with no intermediate calculations required. At this point all we’ll need to do is scale. Which brings me to our final speedup technique: Teacher Incentive Alignment 3. Teacher Incentive Alignment At first some of our new Distribution Associates (or teachers, as they’re known as in the legacy system) were…hesitant to embrace our new, hash-centric curriculum. Fortunately this changed when they learned about our Teacher Incentive Alignment program (TIA). TIA allows us to compensate Distribution Associates for their hard work, using a sliding-scale fee for every billion hashes produced by their Computation Partners (or, “students”). With TIA, whenever we profit, they profit. The Computation Partners profit too of course, through the invaluable knowledge and practice that they get by participating in MinorMiner. We’ve found that Distribution Associates who are in the TIA program set 1,000,000% more homework questions than those who are not. For example, one particularly keen associate set their partners the following quiz: Question 1 of 1,471,126,723 What is the SHA-256 hash of 01003ba3edfd7a...? (0.0000000001 marks) Question 2 of 1,471,126,723 What is the SHA-256 hash of 01003ba3edfd7b...? (0.0000000001 marks) (and so on for 1,471,126,721 more questions) Some Associates were initially concerned that their Computation Partners might balk at such ambitious workloads, despite all the knowledge and hands-on-experience and so on that it would give them. They worried that some Partners might cheat and use specialized mining software to do their hashing homework for them. Fortunately we were able to use spreadsheets and a lot of winking to help most of them realise that this might not actually be a problem. MinorMiner would like to make it clear that we do not in any way condone cheating. Use of our Homework Submission APIs and their associated SDKs is strictly prohibited. So in short - yes, we are going to be fast enough. Through parallelisation, curriculum optimisation, and teacher incentive alignment, we believe that we are extremely well-positioned to speed up and scale massively in the coming years. Then what? From Bitcoin to AI After we’ve perfected the bitcoin use-case, we’ll pivot straight to AI. We’re already extending CUDAAAAGH with pytorch bindings that will allow users to run their training and inference code using our unique computing platform. Most children don’t know much matrix algebra, but matrix algebra is just addition and multiplication wrapped up in funny symbols. All we need to do is implement matrix multiplication using CUDAAAAGH and we’ll be very, very golden. And if our next legislative priority (SB-80085) passes, matrix algebra will soon be on the year eight curriculum too. It’s curriculum optimisation all over again. def matmul(m1: CUDAAAAGHMatrix, m2: CUDAAAAGHMatrix) -\u003e CUDAAAAGHMatrix: # (Implementation left as an exercise for the reader, you get # the joke by now) Applying CUDAAAAGH to AI raises some delightful philosophical questions. Were you already deeply confused about whether sufficiently advanced AI models should count as conscious beings? Are we going to be morally obliged to care about their welfare? How much more confusing do these questions become if the AI models are an emergent property of billions of children doing their maths homework? And what will we do after AI? Cloud computing, ladies and gentlemen, cloud computing. Children are commodity hardware. Our big, audacious goal is to implement an entire computer using them. Everywhere that a computer normally has an electron, we’ll replace it with a school-aged child doing their maths homework. CPUs become specialised children performing incredibly-specialised operations. Hard-drives become arrays of children remembering 1s and 0s. Motherboards become lines of children deciding what messages to send to the others. Think about the implications! Free computers for everyone! That’s all I have to say today, thank you for listening. Believe in children! Invest in the MinorMiner pre-seed! Form an orderly line! Make your cheques payable to “Hobert Reaton.” No madam, there’s no “LLC” at the end. Just “Hobert Reaton.” I also accept cash and a wide range of memecoins. Here’s my wallet address. Thank you. CUDAAAAGH is available on GitHub. It can also be installed from PyPi using pip install CUDAAAAGH although I can’t imagine why on earth you would do this.",

    "description": "My wife and two little boys sometimes go on trips to see friends or family for whom my presence isn’t strictly required. While my wife books the flights I make a show of weighing up my options and asking if it’s really OK if I don’t come. Eventually I’m persuaded that it truly would be the best thing for all of us for me to have five to seven days to myself with no nappies and all Nintendo. My wife hits the “Pay Now” button and when the confirmation email comes through I call my secretary and tell him to clear my calendar. When no one answers I remember that I have neither a secretary nor all that much going on, so instead I find a prestige TV series, a selection of local takeaway menus, and a short but immersive video game. This time I messaged my buddies and asked them what I should play. Steve gushed about a game called Cocoon; Morris said that he’d played it a year ago and it was “alright.” Sold. One month later there were hugs, kisses, wave goodbye to taxi, shut the door, where’s the HDMI cable, how did it get under the sink, do I have a Nintendo Account, what’s my password, whatever I’ll make a new one, right let’s do this, estimated download time 45 minutes, start on tax returns, am I relaxed yet? Eventually I was able to boot up Cocoon. I learned that I was going to play as a little bee guy who has to solve artsy puzzles in a lonely, abstract world for no adequately explained reason. Bee guy makes his way through the world using four glowing orbs. He can pick orbs up, carry them around, and put them back down on switches in order to open doors and unfold bridges - standard orb stuff. However, bee guy soon learns that the orbs also contain other worlds, which he can jump in and out of to help with his puzzles. If he jumps inside one orb-world whilst carrying another one then he can put orb-worlds inside each other. He can even - towards the end - put a world inside itself. Conundrums ensue. By the end of Day 1 of my vacation I was having about three-quarters as much fun as I’d hoped. Cocoon’s atmosphere was absorbing and its puzzles made me smile; I only wish there had been a little bit of a story and not just a fuzzy metaphor for entropy and decay. Still, I kept going, trekking through crumbling ruins and overbearing symbolism. By the end of Day 2 I was 51% through the game. I started the next puzzle and got completely stuck. I was surely just tired, I thought, so I watched an episode of The Sopranos and went to bed. The next morning I got up at 6am, made some coffee, and went into my office to crack on. But I was still stuck. I spent an hour filling a bin bag with toys that I didn’t like, since no one was around to stop me. I tried again. Still stuck. Then I realised. I didn’t know how to solve the puzzle, but I did know how to write a computer program to solve it for me. That would probably be even more fun, and I could argue that it didn’t actually count as cheating. I didn’t want the solution to reveal itself to me before I’d had a chance to systematically hunt it down, so I dived across the room to turn off the console. I wanted to have a shower but I was worried that if I did then inspiration might strike and I might figure out the answer myself. So I ran upstairs to my office, hit my Pomodoro timer, scrolled Twitter to warm up my brain, took a break, made a JIRA board, Slacked my wife a status update, no reply, she must be out of signal. Finally I fired up my preferred assistive professional tool. Time to have a real vacation. How I wrote a Cocoon solver In order to write a Cocoon solver, I needed to: Model the game’s logic using a Finite State Machine Use this model to work out the sequence of actions that would get me from a puzzle’s start to its end 1. Model the game’s logic Cocoon’s mechanics are simple but elegant. In the first level you find an orange orb sitting on a stand. You pick it up, obviously, and start to carry it around. You come to a gate with an orb-stand next to it. You put the orb down on the stand and the gate opens. You pick it up again and continue through the gate. Eventually you come to a small reflecting pool with a special-looking orb-stand in the middle. There’s no obvious path forward, so you put your orange orb down on the stand. You stand next to it and press A, because that’s the only button in the game that does anything. You watch yourself dive into the orb, and land in another world. You’re now inside the orange orb. You start to walk, You find a new, green orb, which you use to keep solving puzzles and opening doors and moving forwards through the orange orb-world. Throughout the course of the game you find a total of four orbs, and the final puzzles require you to lug them all around and dive in and out of them in just the right order to get across the next bridge. An example: in one puzzle you need to bring your red orb to the top of a vine so that you can use it to reveal a magic walkway to get to the next area. However, you can only climb up vines while holding your green orb, and you can only hold one orb at a time. This means that you can’t carry the red orb up the vine. The solution is therefore to pick up the red orb, dive inside the green orb, drop the red orb, jump out, use the green orb to climb the vine, dive back inside the green orb, retrieve the red orb, and jump back out. In order for my solver to analyse Cocoon, it would need to be able to programatically manipulate a copy of it. My solver would need to know how the world was laid out, what actions were allowed, and whether it had finished solving its puzzle yet. The easiest way to do this wasn’t to have the solver interact with the real game, but to instead write a new, stripped-back copy of it that contained all its logic but none of the graphics. This was made easier by the fact that each of the puzzles that I got stuck on could be represented as a finite state machine. A finite state machine is a system that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The system is able to transition between some pairs of states using a set of known rules. Most games with a large 3-D world can’t be modelled as a FSM because they have too many possible states and too many possible transitions. The player can be in a near-infinite number of slightly different locations; so can their enemies. The player might have a huge number of items they could be carrying and past actions they could have taken, each of which could affect the world in some important way. Some parts of the game may depend on timing and agility, which are hard to represent in a FSM. In most game levels there’s too much going on for a simple model like an FSM. However, Cocoon’s is a simple world. There are no enemies. The only items you can carry are 4 orbs. And whilst its 3-D landscape is lovely to look at, it masks a simple topology that can be modelled as a small graph - a collection of nodes (important locations like orbs and switches) and edges (pathways that connect nodes that are immediately accessible from each other). Beyond these characteristics, the exact layout of the world rarely matters. This means that a “state” in Cocoon is easy to define and manage. A state is defined by the combination of: The node you’re nearest Which orb you’re holding Where the other orbs are (possibly a few other things, depending on the exact puzzle) Transitions between states are similarly constrained. Players can transition between game states via only a small set of actions, such as: Walking to an adjacent node Picking up or putting down an orb Jumping in or out of an orb This means that it’s relatively simple to write a program that: Defines the layout of a puzzle world Defines the state that the game is currently in Is able to transition between states Knows how to identify a goal state Once I’d written this program, I had a representation of the game that I could programmatically manipulate. I could tell my game to do things like “take such-and-such an action” or “tell me all the possible next actions that can be taken from the current state.” This meant that I could use my simplified game to analyse and solve the real one. 2. Work out how to get from the start to the goal state To solve a puzzle I needed to find a sequence of actions that would take me from the puzzle’s start state to its goal state (for example, opening a door). This was a job for an algorithm called Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS starts at an initial state in an FSM and simultaneously takes a step to every new state that can be reached from it. For example, suppose that a puzzle starts with bee guy holding the green orb, next to a door and to a corridor to another section. My solver takes steps both through the door and down the corridor, and begins keeping track of each path. From each of these new states, it takes another step to each further state that can be reached from them. It keeps stepping and tracking the expanding number of paths that it’s exploring, until one of its paths reaches a goal state (for example, a state in which a particular orb is on a particular stand, which opens a bridge to the next area). At this point the solver stops, and returns the path that led to the goal state. Because the solver takes a single step down every possible path at once, the first path to the goal state that it finds is guaranteed to be the shortest one possible. I can then input the sequence of actions that my solver returned into the real game (for example: pick up red orb, walk to orb holder, put down red orb, etc), and move on to the next level, without having to do any thinking whatsoever. Here’s my code. How hard are these puzzles really? My solver stops as soon as it has reached the goal state. However, I was also interested in fully mapping out every possible sequence of actions one could take inside a puzzle. I wanted to see how big and hard the puzzles actually are. To do this I wrote a script that explores every possible state and transition. It keeps stepping through states transitions, even after one of its paths has reached a goal state. It only stops when none of the paths it’s exploring have any available actions that lead to a new state that it hasn’t seen before. This script generates a new graph, in which each node is a state and each edge is a transition. The graph shows every single sequence of actions that you can take inside the puzzle. For example, here’s the puzzle that I found hardest, represented as a graph of states and transitions: Drawing a fully-expanded FSM graph like this shows how small and simple Cocoon’s puzzles really are once you write them down. That path on the right, between the green and red nodes, requires you to put one orb inside another orb, then inside another orb, and then shuffle them around just-so. This is a counter-intuitive strategy and hard to find if you’re playing the game like a normal person. However, writing everything down makes it obvious. Writing everything down makes all actions visible and strips away all of the misleading heuristics that make humans focus on some strategies and completely miss others. It reduces a puzzle to “find a path from the green dot to one of the red dots,” as you saw above, which can be solved by a moderately gifted two year-old. To be very facetious, Cocoon is a fluffy layer of graphics and game mechanics on top of an unbelievably simple maze. This isn’t meant as a knock on the game. Cocoon is a tidy mind-bender that wasn’t designed to withstand exhaustive search. If you write a program to solve your Cocoon puzzles for you then you’re only cheating yourself. Or at least, you would be if writing such a program wasn’t so much fun. Life lessons Real life isn’t a finite state machine though. All my solver really proves is that small, low-dimensional problems can easily be solved using exhaustive search. By contrast, the world has an infinite number of states. It’s hard to be sure which properties are important, and the allowed transitions between states are terribly defined. No problem of any importance can be reduced to a tiny graph, which means that even the most determined two year-old won’t be able to help with any of the big challenges in your life. However, you don’t need to fully explore all possible solutions in order to benefit from systematic search. As I’d feared, the process of writing my solver forced me to consider the game with so much rigour that I’d solved all 3 challenges that I used it for before I’d finished programming them in. When I came to encode every location and transition on the map in my program I was forced to pay attention to each of them individually for at least a few seconds, even the ones that the game had tricked me into ignoring. This helped me see that some of the nodes and actions that I’d thought were irrelevant were actually the key to the whole thing. That evening I talked to my family on the phone. I showed them all the diagrams I’d created and all the fun I’d had. They showed me pictures of them inside St. Peter’s Basilica. My son asked if I’d beaten my game. I explained that I’d transcended it by creating a mathematical representation of its entire possibility space. He asked if that meant “no.” Here’s the code to my solver, but you should really just play the game properly.",

    "description": "I use my webcam constantly for streaming and I'm pretty familiar with all the internals and how the camera model on Windows works. I also use OBS extensively, so I regularly use the OBS virtual camera and flow everything through Open Broadcasting Studio. For my podcast, I use Zencastr which is a web-based app that talks to the webcam via the browser APIs. For YouTubes, I'll use Riverside or StreamYard, also webapps. I've done this reliably for the last several years without any trouble. Yesterday, I started seeing the most weird thing and it was absolutely perplexing and almost destroyed the day. I started seeing regular pauses in my webcam stream but only in two instances. The webcam would pause for 10-15 seconds every 90 or so seconds when access the Webcam in a browser I would see a long pause/hang in OBS when double clicking on my Video Source (Webcam) to view its properties Micah initially said USB but my usb bus and hubs have worked reliably for years. Thought something might have changed in my El Gato capture device, but that has also been rock solid for 1/2 a decade. Then I started exploring virtual cameras and looked in the windows camera dialog under settings for a list of all virtual cameras. Interestingly, virtual cameras don't get listed under Cameras in Settings in Windows: From what I can tell, there's no user interface to list out all of your cameras - virtual or otherwise - in windows. Here's a quick PowerShell script you can run to list out anything 'connected' that also includes the string \"cam\" in your local devicesGet-CimInstance -Namespace root\\cimv2 -ClassName Win32_PnPEntity | Where-Object { $_.Name -match 'Cam' } | Select-Object Name, Manufacturer, PNPDeviceID and my outputName Manufacturer PNPDeviceID---- ------------ -----------Cam Link 4K Microsoft USB\\VID_0FD9\u0026PID_0066\u0026MI_00\\7\u00263768531A\u00260\u00260000Digital Audio Interface (2- Cam Link 4K) Microsoft SWD\\MMDEVAPI\\{0.0.1.00000000}.{AF1690B6-CA2A-4AD3-AAFD-8DDEBB83DD4A}Logitech StreamCam WinUSB Logitech USB\\VID_046D\u0026PID_0893\u0026MI_04\\7\u0026E36D0CF\u00260\u00260004Logitech StreamCam (Generic USB Audio) USB\\VID_046D\u0026PID_0893\u0026MI_02\\7\u0026E36D0CF\u00260\u00260002Logitech StreamCam Logitech USB\\VID_046D\u0026PID_0893\u0026MI_00\\7\u0026E36D0CF\u00260\u00260000Remote Desktop Camera Bus Microsoft UMB\\UMB\\1\u0026841921D\u00260\u0026RDCAMERA_BUSCam Link 4K (Generic USB Audio) USB\\VID_0FD9\u0026PID_0066\u0026MI_03\\7\u00263768531A\u00260\u00260003Windows Virtual Camera Device Microsoft SWD\\VCAMDEVAPI\\B486E21F1D4BC97087EA831093E840AD2177E046699EFBF62B27304F5CCAEF57 However, when I list out my cameras using JavaScript enumerateDevices() like this// Put variables in global scope to make them available to the browser console.async function listWebcams() { try { const devices = await navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices(); const webcams = devices.filter(device =\u003e device.kind === 'videoinput'); if (webcams.length \u003e 0) { console.log(\"Connected webcams:\"); webcams.forEach((webcam, index) =\u003e { console.log(`${index + 1}. ${webcam.label || `Camera ${index + 1}`}`); }); } else { console.log(\"No webcams found.\"); } } catch (error) { console.error(\"Error accessing media devices:\", error); }}listWebcams(); I would get:Connected webcams: test.html:11 1.

I am a random person on the internet and you got here by googling, so if you mess up your machine by going into RegEdit.exe, I'm sorry to this man, but it's above me now. Where did LSVCam.dll come from, you may ask? TikTok Live Studio, baby. Live Studio Video/Virtual Cam, I am guessing.Directory of C:\\Program Files\\TikTok LIVE Studio\\0.67.2\\resources\\app\\electron\\sdk\\lib\\MediaSDK_V109/18/2024 09:20 PM 218,984 LSVCam.dll 1 File(s) 218,984 bytes This is a regression that started recently for me, so it's my opinion that they are installing a virtual camera for their game streaming feature but they are doing it poorly. It's either not completely installed, or hangs on enumeration, but the result is you'll see hangs on camera enumeration in your apps, especually browser apps that poll for cameras changes or check on a timer. Nothing bad will happen if you delete the registry key BUT it'll show back up when you run TikTok Studio again. I still stream to TikTok, I just delete this key each time until someone on the TikTok Studio development team sees this blog post. Hope this helps!© 2025 Scott Hanselman. All rights reserved.",

    "description": "See the canonical version of this blog post at the Microsoft Open Source Blog! Ten years ago, Microsoft released the source for MS-DOS 1.25 and 2.0 to the Computer History Museum, and then later republished them for reference purposes. This code holds an important place in history and is a fascinating read of an operating system that was written entirely in 8086 assembly code nearly 45 years ago. Today, in partnership with IBM and in the spirit of open innovation, we're releasing the source code to MS-DOS 4.00 under the MIT license. There's a somewhat complex and fascinating history behind the 4.0 versions of DOS, as Microsoft partnered with IBM for portions of the code but also created a branch of DOS called Multitasking DOS that did not see a wide release. https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS A young English researcher named Connor \"Starfrost\" Hyde recently corresponded with former Microsoft Chief Technical Officer Ray Ozzie about some of the software in his collection. Amongst the floppies, Ray found unreleased beta binaries of DOS 4.0 that he was sent while he was at Lotus. Starfrost reached out to the Microsoft Open Source Programs Office (OSPO) to explore releasing DOS 4 source, as he is working on documenting the relationship between DOS 4, MT-DOS, and what would eventually become OS/2. Some later versions of these Multitasking DOS binaries can be found around the internet, but these new Ozzie beta binaries appear to be much earlier, unreleased, and also include the ibmbio.com source.  Scott Hanselman, with the help of internet archivist and enthusiast Jeff Sponaugle, has imaged these original disks and carefully scanned the original printed documents from this \"Ozzie Drop\". Microsoft, along with our friends at IBM, think this is a fascinating piece of operating system history worth sharing.  Jeff Wilcox and OSPO went to the Microsoft Archives, and while they were unable to find the full source code for MT-DOS, they did find MS DOS 4.00, which we're releasing today, alongside these additional beta binaries, PDFs of the documentation, and disk images. We will continue to explore the archives and may update this release if more is discovered.  Thank you to Ray Ozzie, Starfrost, Jeff Sponaugle, Larry Osterman, our friends at the IBM OSPO, as well as the makers of such digital archeology software including, but not limited to Greaseweazle, Fluxengine, Aaru Data Preservation Suite, and the HxC Floppy Emulator. Above all, thank you to the original authors of this code, some of whom still work at Microsoft and IBM today! If you'd like to run this software yourself and explore, we have successfully run it directly on an original IBM PC XT, a newer Pentium, and within the open source PCem and 86box emulators.  © 2025 Scott Hanselman.
