  "text": "Posted by Joseph Lewis – Android Developer Relations Technical Writer, and Niharika Arora – Android Developer Relations Engineer We're kicking off Spotlight Week with a deep dive into passkeys! This week we're partnering with the Chrome team to feature exciting announcements, insightful resources, and expert guidance on how to build seamless and secure authentication experiences for your apps. Throughout Spotlight Week: Passkeys, we'll share content to help you understand and implement passkeys effectively. Expect technical deep dives, best practices for user experience, case studies from successful implementations, and answers to your questions. Here's what we'll cover during Spotlight Week: Passkeys: Monday, Nov 18: Get started with passkeys We'll start off the week with resources to help you begin passkey integration. Check out these resources to get started! Key resources include a quick video on passkey basics, updated UX guidelines for Credential Manager and passkeys, and an in-depth server-side implementation guide. We will introduce you to the Identity hub, a comprehensive resource for passkeys, passwords, Sign in with Google, authorization, and much more. Understand passkeys in 4 minutes Tuesday, Nov 19: Updated passkeys developer guides We'll share updated passkeys developer guidance, including migration guides, a new troubleshooting guide, and more. Highlights include a guide on migrating from legacy APIs to Credential Manager, technical details on FIDO2 attestation format changes, and a troubleshooting guide for common Credential Manager errors. Developers can also share feedback through a passkeys survey to influence future improvements. Wednesday, Nov 20: New Credential Manager features We'll go over some of the new Credential Manager capabilities, including improvements to autofill, single-tap sign-in, and the new Restore Credentials feature. Key updates include showing Credential Manager results as autofill suggestions, single-tap sign-in, Signal API for Chrome desktop and a Restore Credentials feature, which allows users to conveniently recover their saved login information in case of device loss or upgrades, ensuring uninterrupted access to their accounts. With Android 15, these additions streamline user authentication and reinforce security, making it easier for users to manage and access their credentials securely. Thursday, Nov 21: Passkeys #AskAndroid On Thursday at 9AM PT Spotlight Week: Passkeys will feature an #AskAndroid session to address your most pressing passkey questions. We'll also share case studies with Tokyu and X, highlighting their successful deployments of passkey authentication. Friday, Nov 22: Learn more about passkeys We'll close out the week with learning pathways for passkeys on Android and Chrome, insights from partners, and a new Compose sample app for Credential Manager with Android best practices and built using Compose. We hope you'll join us in exploring these resources to learn how to elevate your app's security and user experience. We're excited to share this journey with you!",
