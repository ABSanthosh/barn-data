  "text": "Posted by Robbie McLachlan, Developer Marketing In our latest film for #WeArePlay, which celebrates the people behind apps and games, we meet Hyojeong - the visionary behind the app NomadHer. She’s aiming to reshape how women explore the world by building a global community: sharing travel tips, prioritizing safety, and connecting with one another to explore new destinations. What inspired you to create NomadHer? Honestly, NomadHer was born out of a personal need. I started traveling solo when I was 19 and have visited over 60 countries alone, and while it was an incredibly empowering and enriching journey, it wasn’t always easy—especially as a woman. There was this one moment when I was traveling in Italy that really shook me. I realized just how important it was to have a support system, not just friends or family, but other women who understand what it's like to be out there on your own. That’s when the idea hit me— I wanted to create a space where women could feel safe and confident while seeing the world. The focus on connecting women who share similar travel plans is a powerful tool. Can you share feedback from someone who has found travel buddies through NomadHer? Absolutely! One of my favorite stories comes from a woman who was planning a solo trip to Bali. She connected with another ‘NomadHer’ through the app who had the exact same travel dates and itinerary. They started chatting, and by the time they met up in Bali, it was like they’d known each other forever. They ended up traveling together, trying out new restaurants, exploring hidden beaches, and even taking a surfing class! After the trip, they both messaged us saying how the experience felt safer and more fun because they had each other. It’s stories like these that remind me why I started NomadHer in the first place. How did Google Play help you grow NomadHer? We couldn’t connect with the 90,000+ women worldwide without Google Play. We’ve been able to reach people from Latin America, Africa, Asia, and beyond. It’s incredible seeing women connect, share tips, and support each other, no matter where they are. With tools like Firebase, we can track and improve the app experience, making sure everything runs smoothly. Plus, Google Play's startup programs gave us mentorship and visibility, which really helped us grow and expand our reach faster. It’s been a game-changer. What are your hopes for NomadHer in the future? I want NomadHer to be more than just an app—it’s a movement. My dream is for it to become the go-to platform for women travelers everywhere. I want to see more partnerships with local women entrepreneurs, like the surf shop owner we work with in Busan. We host offline events like the She Can Travel Festival in Busan and I’m excited to host similar events in other countries like Paris, Tokyo, and Delhi. The goal is to continue creating these offline connections to build a community that empowers women, both socially and economically, through partnerships with local female businesses.
