  "text": "Implementing the new release of Qualcomm Linux: Key Features and UpdatesSince the initial release of Qualcomm Linux on the QCS6490, Qualcomm Technologies has made significant strides in expanding its support for embedded developers. With the Qualcomm Linux 1.3 release, we are introducing multiple new System on Chips (SoCs), namely the Qualcomm QCS5430, Qualcomm IQ9, and Qualcomm IQ8 series with single distribution across multiple SoCs. This unified approach simplifies development and ensures consistency across different hardware platforms.Qualcomm remains committed to upstreaming, with numerous patches submitted for various SoCs in both the kernel and user space. This dedication ensures that our solutions are not only cutting-edge but also well-integrated with the broader open-source community.Take a look at some of the key features and enhancements introduced in Qualcomm Linux 1.3 release:OTA: OSTree with Rollback SupportWe have enabled OSTree with rollback support, providing a robust mechanism for over-the-air updates. This feature ensures that devices can be updated seamlessly while maintaining the ability to revert to previous versions if needed.Boot from SD Card The ability to boot from an SD card offers flexibility and convenience, especially during development and testing phases.nmcli for WLAN Configuration To simplify the configuration of Wi-Fi, we have introduced nmcli, a command-line tool that allows for easy network management.Multiple Virtual Machines Using KVM Hypervisor The release supports multiple (real-time and non-RT) virtual machines using the KVM Hypervisor, enhancing the versatility of our solutions.SDK Updates Our SDK updates now include Docker/container support, Python bindings, new Python-based samples, solutions infrastructure, and microservices.For more details, please refer to the Qualcomm Linux 1.3 release notes.Join our Qualcomm Developer Discord to stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance our offerings and support the embedded development community.Author: Shammi Khattar serves as the Senior Director of Product Management in Qualcomm’s Industrial and Embedded IoT Business Unit.
