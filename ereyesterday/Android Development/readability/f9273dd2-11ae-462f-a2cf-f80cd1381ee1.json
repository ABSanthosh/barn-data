  "text": "News JetBrains IDE Services, the enterprise suite of products dedicated to improving developer productivity across an entire organization, is now available in the cloud! By offering a JetBrains-managed service, IDE Services Cloud simplifies license management, enhances security, and provides seamless scalability, ensuring that organizations can focus more on development and less on administration. As part of this update, all products under the IDE Services umbrella are now available to customers on a SaaS basis. This includes: License Vault, a solution to efficiently manage IDE licenses at scale. This service also includes options like pay-as-you-go licenses that let you instantly scale your usage and floating mode, which allows you to reassign any available licenses to other developers in your organization. IDE Provisioner, a solution to securely manage IDE and plugin distribution across all your dev teams and propagate presets for developer workplace management that offers higher degrees of both compliance and centralization. AI Enterprise, a solution that allows you to have fine-grained control over how JetBrains AI Assistant is used by your developers. This includes the ability to choose a desired LLM provider, connect using your company API keys, and allow or disable access to JetBrains AI Assistant on a per-team and per-developer basis. Code With Me Enterprise, a solution that allows you to run real-time, secure, and compliant collaborative programming sessions inside your own organization with access controls that are compatible with your security and compliance practices. All of these products are now available as a managed service by JetBrains. Customers can pick any or all of these products and access them via a single IDE Services control panel. The relevant statistics and analytics data are also available via the IDE Services administrator’s UI, which contains dashboards with usage reports for each module, providing insights into how the service is used within your organization. Security-first approach JetBrains has selected AWS as its core cloud provider for IDE Services Cloud. The security, reliability, and scalability of AWS mean that we are confident in offering the service to all of our business and enterprise customers. “Our customers trust IDE Services to streamline IDE configuration and support software development teams across their entire organization. We built this platform with enterprise-grade security as a foundational priority, ensuring a reliable and scalable solution for our enterprise customers to take their development teams’ productivity to the next level.” Ernst Haagsman, Head of Product, JetBrains IDE Services To get started with JetBrains IDE Services Cloud, you can begin by claiming your free 30-day trial here. Alternatively, you can reach out to our Sales team for a demo or to ask any additional questions you might have. You have the choice to use IDE Services for just one product within the suite or multiple products all at once. Trials for additional products can be started independently, either directly from within the product or by sending a request to our Sales team. Get Started with IDE Services Cloud Floating License Server end of life As part of this update, we are making License Vault our default solution for JetBrains license management. This means that the legacy Floating License Server will be discontinued and taken out of service on December 31, 2025. All customers who are currently using Floating License Server for managing licenses and who wish to continue utilizing floating licensing will need to move to License Vault (part of JetBrains IDE Services) by December 31, 2025. License Vault offers enhanced scalability, pay-as-you-go options, and the ability to reuse licenses efficiently. Simply visit this link to start your free 30-day License Vault Cloud trial, or reach out to our Sales team to request access to an on-premises version of License Vault and more information on the migration options. Alternatively, managing licenses directly through JetBrains Account remains another cost-effective solution. Subscribe to JetBrains Blog updates Discover more",
