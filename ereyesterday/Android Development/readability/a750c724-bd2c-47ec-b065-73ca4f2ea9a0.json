  "text": "Community Read this post in other languages: The PHP ecosystem is driven by passionate developers building tools that power everything from content management systems right the way through to testing libraries and database layers. Behind each project is a dedicated team working to modernize code, improve performance, and move the ecosystem forward. The fact that many of these teams choose PhpStorm to support their work is a source of pride for all of us at JetBrains and serves as proof of the positive impact on the wider PHP community of our free and discounted license program for open-source contributors. This post highlights standout PHP projects and the people behind them. Whether they’re debugging complex systems or maintaining test suites, PhpStorm helps streamline workflows, reduce friction, and free up time for what matters most – building. PHPUnit Sebastian Bergmann started PHPUnit as a university project, prompted by a discussion with a professor who thought that a tool like JUnit could not be implemented for PHP. Since then, PHPUnit has been the backbone of PHP testing for over two decades and has shaped how PHP developers write and maintain tests. It remains the go-to testing framework for PHP projects of all sizes. I tried every PHP IDE until I got my hands on PhpStorm – the first one that made me more productive, not less. It felt like home right away. I can’t imagine working without its code navigation and refactoring tools. — Sebastian Bergmann, PHPUnit creator The latest release, PHPUnit 12, prioritizes code clarity. A major improvement is the clear distinction between test stubs and mock objects via dedicated APIs. This architectural shift simplifies test code maintenance and readability. Looking ahead, PHPUnit will introduce support for the Open Test Reporting format – a modern, extensible alternative to JUnit XML. Initial support is planned for PHPUnit 12.2 (June 2025), with JUnit XML being deprecated in PHPUnit 13 and removed in PHPUnit 14. Doctrine DBAL Doctrine DBAL is a widely used database abstraction layer that gives PHP developers a portable, object-oriented API to interact with SQL databases. It powers a wide range of applications and frameworks across the PHP ecosystem. I use PhpStorm daily to run PHPUnit tests locally with various configurations, interact with different databases, manage Docker containers, and run static analysis. — Sergei Morozov, Doctrine DBAL maintainer While the project is mature and provides most of the essential functionality, ongoing work includes a fundamental rework of schema management, addressing limitations of the original architecture, and ensuring better support for evolving SQL standards and database platforms. CodeIgniter CodeIgniter was created as a lightweight, high-performance PHP framework that prioritizes simplicity and developer freedom. It empowers developers to build on their own terms without rigid conventions – a core philosophy that continues to define its appeal. CodeIgniter v4 maintains the core principles of its predecessor while embracing modern software development practices, such as robust testing and integration with tools like PHPStan, Psalm, and Rector. One of CodeIgniter v4’s key strengths is its alignment with PHP best practices, allowing PhpStorm to work seamlessly out of the box – no extra plugins needed. The IDE instantly understands CodeIgniter’s patterns and conventions, offering intelligent code completion that streamlines development. This built-in compatibility creates an exceptionally productive experience for our contributors. — Michal Sniatala, CodeIgniter contributor The team continues to evolve CI4, focusing on performance, modularity, and a smooth developer experience. Upcoming releases aim to stabilize task and queue packages, expand the modular package library, and improve compatibility with the latest PHP versions – all while maintaining the project’s original vision. Joomla! Joomla! is a powerful open-source content management system sustained by a global community of volunteers. Its mission is to provide a multilingual, flexible, and secure platform that empowers individuals, small businesses, and nonprofits to publish and collaborate online – all without the steep learning curve of alternative systems. PhpStorm’s static code analyzer helped me clean up docblocks and better manage the framework. It understands Joomla deeply, making development smoother. — Hannes Papenberg, Joomla Maintainer PhpStorm shows me how files are connected, catches syntax errors early, and allows me to focus on actual client needs. It gives me a massive advantage over other web developers who don’t see the value of using it in their daily processes. — Adam Melcher, Joomla Contributor As a Joomla core developer, PhpStorm has helped me in so many ways. The step debugger, which I use pretty much every single day, helps track down bugs, understand code flows, and generally, seeing what is going on under the hood is precious. The Joomla plugin adds an extra layer of usability as it understands the Joomla codebase and makes navigating the code a lot easier. — Roland Dalmulder, Joomla Contributor Looking ahead, Joomla 6 is scheduled for release on October 14, 2025. It will bring further codebase modernization, better SEO tools, and a built-in health checker – continuing Joomla’s mission to make publishing on the web more inclusive and flexible. These projects represent just a small part of the global open-source effort, but they reflect the values we admire most: curiosity, craftsmanship, and care for the developer community. While each project has its own focus, they all rely on consistent, powerful workflows to maintain high standards and move forward with clarity – and JetBrains is proud to support them in this endeavor. If you’re an open-source developer, you might be eligible for a free or discounted PhpStorm license – read more about the available options to see if you qualify. In June, we hosted PHPverse 2025 – a special online event celebrating the passion and progress of the PHP community. The event brought together some of the community’s most influential voices for a day of inspiring talks, live discussions, and insights into the language’s evolution and future. It was a day of learning, reflection, and celebration – and we’re truly grateful to everyone who joined us! Subscribe to JetBrains Blog updates Discover more",
