    "description": "Affordable couchettes, wonderful scenery and good company make up for the teething problems en routeAt 6.45pm on Wednesday, the Good Night Train trundled out of platform 3 at Brussel-Zuid station. It departed 40 minutes late due to trespassers on the tracks, but the train soon picked up pace, the golden lights of the Belgian capital sweeping through the carriages where groups were stashing skis, families were settling young children and solo travellers stood at the open windows swapping names and stories amid the clamour and confusion on board. This was the inaugural European Sleeper service from Brussels to Venice … only the train wasn’t going to Venice.Two days earlier, passengers had received an email explaining that the train would be running only as far as Verona, and that a regular Trenitalia service would take us on to Venice. Then, on the evening of departure, we learned that owing to unspecified Italian bureaucracy, the train wouldn’t enter Italy at all, but would be terminating at Innsbruck, with two connections taking us to Verona and then on to Venice.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kuppelaufzug",
    "description": "Opened in 1913, Hanover's Neues Rathaus (New Town Hall) has a stately dome befitting a palace. In order to provide convenient access to the observation deck 100 meters above the ground, the dome comes with an elevator. To avoid obstructing the grand inside of the dome, engineers opted for a particularly novel design. The Kuppelaufzug (\"Dome Elevator\") follows the side of the dome on an irregular, roughly parabolic path. Although there are other diagonal elevators, such as at the Eiffel Tower, none of these follow a curved route. Likewise, other \"curved elevators\" do not use traditional cables and railings alone, rather being assisted by racks, for instance at the Gateway Arch. Also unlike the Gateway Arch, this elevator does not keep itself level. Instead, it tilts to the side with its passengers as it ascends.  At some points along the shaft, the elevator has as little as under five millimeters of clearance from the wall. Although it has five stops, only the top and bottom ones are usually open to the public. Remarkably, the original elevators, which was installed in 1908, accomplished all this with wooden rails. In 2008, it was replaced by a more modern iteration with tube rails from the Hanoverian company Lutz. The reconstruction proved trickier than expected. The elevator car bumped into the shaft multiple times during construction—once with the Mayor of Hanover inside.  Eventually, they worked out the kinks, while adding a few extra features in the process. Thanks to a wireless connection using coded radio, the elevator can safely transport passengers to the bottom even in the machine room loses power. Best of all, the elevator car has a floor that can become transparent, offering passengers a view of the inside of the dome as they zoom upward.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dronkenput",
    "description": "Middelkerke is a seaside resort on the Belgian coast between Nieuwpoort and Ostend. Between 1890 and 1900, the population increased from 1,100 to 2,000. To supply the growing population with drinking water, the city council decided to build a reservoir in 1897. It was designed by the famous engineer Arthur Vierendeel, creator of the Vierendeel Bridges. Just as the cistern was nearing completion, on December 1, 1897, it began to sink into the soggy soil, tilting it at an angle of 12°, and ultimately making it unusable. All attempts to straighten it out failed, and no one wanted to tackle its demolition. Twenty years later, in April of 1918, a photo was taken of the odd structure, turning it into a tourist attraction. This new purpose has ensured its survival to this day. In the meantime it has taken on the name Dronkenput, literally \"drunken well.\" Today, it can be considered the most sloping building in Belgium. In 2002, the reservoir was listed as a historical monument, as one of the oldest preserved concrete reservoirs in Belgium. It has not been altered or renovated in any way, making it an exceptional example of the use of concrete at that time.",
