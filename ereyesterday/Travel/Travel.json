    "description": "Idyllic scenery is just part of the appeal of a break that is also about sustainability, meeting locals and maintaining pathsArmed with gloves and pruners, my friend and I are near Pythara waterfall above Chora – the capital of the Greek island of Andros – and we are cutting back thorny and overhanging vegetation. We’re helping out the local volunteer association, Andros Routes, which has been restoring a network of ancient mule tracks, from the coast to the interior and its low mountains. The tracks form part of a new walking holiday that allows us to explore the pretty island on foot – and give something back, too.The eight-day trip with Ramble Worldwide takes you from the south-east to the north-west, from Ormos Korthiou to Gavrio, via Chora on the east coast, with accommodation in low-key hotels and luggage transfer between them. Daily routes are only suggested: guests can choose full-on trekking days or easy circular walks, customising the holiday to suit energy levels and using buses or taxis to skip sections if desired. Along the way you can choose to help with the maintenance of the paths (secateurs and gloves are delivered to your hotel). Continue reading...",

    "description": "The Galician city on the Atlantic coast has the EU’s largest fishing port, which provides its many bars and restaurants with a spectacular trawl of oysters, clams and musselsRocks thrashed by Atlantic waves have famously bestowed names such as “end of the world” and “coast of death” on Galicia, Spain’s north-western region. But there is a calmer, more intimate side to this coastline, that of the many rias (inlets). Legend has it that they resulted from the imprint of God’s hand when he made the world, and, temptingly, they nurture superlative shellfish. This lures me to Vigo, the largest fishing port in the EU, which spills down a hillside into a sheltered estuary lined with marinas, industrial docks, jetties, a fishing port and a cruise terminal.The magic formula is the combination of fresh river water and salty seawater, which creates a nutrient-rich paradise for succulent crustaceans and cephalopods. I soon learn, too, that Vigueses are joined at the hip to the sea – and have been for centuries. Passion for el mar rules: “We are all men of the sea,” as one local tells me, and trawler-loads of ocean fish join shellfish on the plates of Vigo’s many taverns, tapas bars and restaurants.

Now, the former prison is a reminder of the human rights abuses that took place during the White Terror, a period of political repression that begin in the 1950s and did not end until 1991. Another prison from the same period, now called Green Island Human Rights Culture Park, has also been designated as a museum and memorial site.   Every cell of the prison is open and in its original state, down to the fading padded walls, and documents and educational materials give visitors insight into the state of mind of prisoners who spent time incarcerated here.",

    "description": "Towering over the streets of Basel, Switzerland, Hammering Man is a mechanical sculpture that captures the beauty of labor in perpetual motion. Designed by American artist Jonathan Borofsky, this 42-foot (13-meter) kinetic artwork swings its hammer tirelessly, a poetic ode to workers and artisans worldwide. Installed in 1989, this sleek and minimalist figure is part of Borofsky’s global Hammering Man series, which includes similar sculptures in Seoul, Frankfurt, and Seattle. Each iteration has unique dimensions and context, but all share a common purpose: to celebrate the dignity of work and the human spirit’s ceaseless drive to create. In a fun twist, Hammering Man doesn’t work 24/7. The sculpture “rests” at night and on Swiss Labor Day (May 1), when its hammer stops swinging—a respectful nod to the workers it honors.",
