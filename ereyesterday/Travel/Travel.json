    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bargain-stone",
    "description": "St. Peter's Collegiate Church, by far the oldest in England's Wolverhampton, has shrouded origins in the Anglo-Saxon era. Even more mysterious than the church itself are some of the ancient objects lying in its churchyard. The Bargain Stone, located on the south side of the church just inside the railings surrounding it, is one of the only standing stones to have a hole in it. Its name comes from the old practice of merchants shaking hands through its hole as a symbol of their deals with each other. Wolverhampton was once an important market town, especially for Welsh drovers who came to sell sheep. Yet the true mystery of the Bargain Stone is its origin. It is most certainly not a tombstone, as all the others in the churchyard lie flat on the ground. It is also probably not a prehistoric megalith. The most likely theory is that it is the heavily eroded remains of a gargoyle which fell off the church in the 17th century. The hole is presumably its mouth, which would have functioned as a drain pipe.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ernst-thalmann-monument",
    "description": "The Ernst Thälmann Monument is one of the last artistic remnants in Berlin that recalls the “good old days” of the Geman Democratic Republic (GDR), as most other statues and sculptures have been removed. The monument is part of Ernst Thälmann Park, a protected historical site created in 1987 on the grounds of a former gasworks. The park was a socialist prestige project commemorating Berlin’s 750th anniversary. The statue, designed by Russian artist Lev Kerbel, was a colossal work. Made from 272 bronze pieces, the monument stands 14 meters tall, 15 meters wide, and weighs 50 tons. Its sheer size was one reason it was not dismantled after political changes, though its removal was often debated. The brutal design was certainly not meant to genuinely honor Thälmann’s memory, but rather to symbolize the superiority of Communist ideology. In 2014, it was officially declared a protected landmark of contemporary history. Today, the Ukrainian granite around the statue is fragile and the base is covered in graffiti, though admirers have repainted inscriptions like “Ernst Thälmann” and “Rotfront” in red. Withered red carnations are also occasionally placed at the site. Locals humorously nicknamed the monument “Ernst Lehmann Monument,” blending Thälmann’s name with Lenin's due to its resemblance to the Russian revolutionary.",
