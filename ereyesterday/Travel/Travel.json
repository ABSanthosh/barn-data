    "description": "Photography, writing, painting and music learning holidays have all ignited our readers’ creative spark, at retreats from Snowdonia to Sicily• Tell us about your favourite mountain trip – the best tip wins a £200 holiday voucherWider Horizons is an outdoor gathering in Berkshire dedicated to reigniting young attendees’ (18 to 30 years old) creative spark through workshops, music, ceremony and movement. On the glorious July afternoon I arrived, oak trees cast elongated shadows on the soft earth, a gentle breeze stirred the tall grass, and I found myself surrounded by a group of eccentric, vivacious young adults. A key element of the weekend is transformation: Wild Woman circles channelled sacred rage into empowerment, Forest Play turned ennui into childlike wonder, and poetry workshops used the surrounding woodlands as inspiration. My phone lay untouched, my mind grew quiet, and from that place of silence, the words poured out of me like rainfall. This year’s event is from 22-28 July. The full price is £250 with early-bird discounts available into June.Jade Serna Continue reading...",

    "description": "The opening of the V\u0026A East Storehouse and Sadler’s Wells East mark the transformation of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park into an exciting new creative hub for the capitalThere’s a collective intake of breath as the curator slowly unzips the white garment bag to reveal the treasure within: a white military-style jacket embellished with gold buttons and epaulettes, worn by Elton John on his 1981 World tour. To my left, laid out on a table, are a gold Versace bag and a pair of daintily embroidered blue silk shoes dating from the 1720s. To my right, a Vivienne Westwood corset and a Balenciaga pink taffeta evening dress from the 1950s. It’s a fashion lover’s fever dream and it’s all here, at my fingertips.I’m at the V\u0026A East Storehouse in east London, a radical new museum experience that allows anyone to order up any item from the V\u0026A’s vast collection – for free – and to examine it at close quarters. Housed in the former Olympics Media Centre, on the edge of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, this lofty warehouse space gives unprecedented access to more than 250,000 objects, from an 11m wide stage cloth designed by Picasso to a cross-section of a maisonette from the Robin Hood Gardens council estate in Poplar. Gone are the glass cases, white walls and carefully curated exhibits of a traditional museum space. Instead, visitors are invited to look behind the scenes of a working museum, to wander among open shelves stacked high with deliriously eclectic objects and to peer into the workshops where conservators are at work. The effect is part Ikea showroom, part Victorian cabinet of curiosities. It’s bold, slightly bonkers and I love it. Continue reading...",

    "description": "One wouldn’t expect a visit to a Buddhist nunnery to be a foodie adventure, but the journey to Nagi Gumba (also known as Nagi Gompa) in Shivapuri National Park certainly challenges expectations. The drive winds up steep, narrow dirt roads, hugging the cliff’s edge, requiring a bit of faith in your hired driver. Some visitors opt to hike, trekking through the forest path. Either way, motorized transport can only take you so far, as the nunnery requires a final short uphill walk through the trees. At the top, cloud-level panoramic views of Kathmandu Valley are stunning, even with the hazy air. The peaceful surroundings and the friendly welcome from the nuns quickly dissolve any lingering anxieties from the ascent. A lesser-known highlight of this enchanted visit is the opportunity, with prior arrangement, to tour the grounds and share a simple meal prepared by the nuns—a traditional Nepali menu of rice and daal, mixed vegetable curry, saag, and paneer. Here, over 100 nuns have renounced ordinary life, dedicating themselves to meditation, chanting, and study in this serene retreat high above the modern world below. And if you ask, you may even leave with some Buddhist wisdom to take home, like: “Do good things. Say good things. Have a good heart.”",

    "description": "Sitting prominently on the hillside above the Beppu Seven Hells, this castle was rebuilt in the 1950s to replicate its original design, which stood there several centuries earlier. It provides visitors with the most stunning view of the city, sea, and Shikoku beyond (hint: ascend to the top most floor and step out the window onto the balcony for even better 360-degree views). The interiors are unlike any other castle in Japan, with furnishings, shrines, taxidermy, vintage artworks, kyudo bows and arrows, and more. You might even be invited to meet the castle’s protector: an albino python.",
