    "description": "Away from Crete’s sandy shores, tall peaks dominate the landscape, offering great skiing without the crowds – or ski liftsAt the summit of Mount Ida on Crete, I discovered a stone chapel with a frozen free-standing bell leaning against it – it was as if time had stood still. Outside winter, Eastern Orthodox priests and worshippers hike to the highest point on the Greek island, and services are held in the chapel. But it was February, when Ida is often buried under several metres of snow and only mountaineers and skiers climb the almost 2,500-metre peak. I took a moment to admire the 360-degree panorama – the Aegean Sea to the north, the Libyan Sea to the south. There was no one else in sight.Akis Parousis, my guide, claimed that on a clear day you can see the lights of Alexandria in Egypt from here before he skied off, racing through the fresh, light powder. I took one last glance at the horizon, where a marine blue sea met a pale blue sky, and set off in pursuit. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/american-star-propeller-hub",
    "description": "Designed by William Francis Gibbs for the United States Lines, the SS America was once a symbol of luxury and American pride. It first launched in 1939, and in the decades that followed, the ship served many roles, including as a soldier transport during World War II, and a ferry after that. (During that time, it also went by several other names, including the USS West Point and the SS Australis, Italis, Noga, Alferdoss, and American Star.) Just before it was set to be converted into a hotel and restaurant, tragedy struck and instead this ship became a wreck off the coast of the Canary Islands. During its time on the water, SS America went by several other names, including USS West Point, SS Australis, and SS Italis. In 1993, the ship was in Greece, and going by the name American Star. After over 50 years of service, it had been sold, stripped down, and painted, and was going to be used as a floating hotel in Thailand. Because of its age and size, the ship was not allowed in the Suez Canal, and had to take the long way from Greece to Thailand, traveling around the Cape of Good Hope. But it never made it that far. While traveling through the Atlantic Ocean, the American Star and the smaller boat towing it hit a storm. The tow lines broke, and attempts to reattach them failed. The luxury liner drifted away and eventually ran aground on the sandy cliffs of Fuerteventura. The waves managed to break it in half in less than 48 hours, making it impossible to move. The ship has remained at that spot ever since. It was visible to tourists until 2008, at which point it completely fell apart and sank to the bottom of the sea, where it is now an artificial reef. There are ways to see a part of this ship without going underwater though, thanks to a Canarian artist who secured and displayed one of the ship's propeller hubs on the walkway to the beach in El Medano. It offers a great story known by only very few, as it is not even displayed on the island that it crashed near.",

    "title": "'The Journey' in Durham, England",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-journey-durham",
    "description": "Although easy for pub and theatergoers to miss or simply ignore, The Journey is a sculpture built by County Durham local Fenwick Lawson. It shows a moment in the local history: a group of monks carrying the body of St. Cuthbert, Durham's patron saint, to the cathedral in 995, marking the city's foundation. Lawson creates art using wood and chainsaws, and the resulting sculptures are often coated in bronze. He felt his work needed to be more fulfilling, and decided to redefine it to \"engage with the human condition\" rather than simply making art for art's sake. Many of his later works deal with questions of religion and humanity. On one level, The Journey shows St. Cuthbert’s body being moved to the site of what is now the cathedral after monks fled from a Danish invasion. The grief of the monks carrying Cuthbert's coffin from Lindisfarne is visible, a reminder of the pain involved in Durham becoming the saint's final resting place. Although a religious pilgrimage is an odd object to place outside a prime location for clubbing in Durham, the fact the statue is often covered in vomit and using as a public urinal on account of weekend club-goers makes it a curious addition to the surrounding Nando’s, Chiquito, and Gala Theatre. In some ways, its public but innocuous persona in a city filled with beauty is part of what makes it so fascinating.",
