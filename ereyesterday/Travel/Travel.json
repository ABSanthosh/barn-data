    "description": "A U-boat bunker located in the Nyhavna port district in northern Trondheim, Norway, stands as a testament to the city’s wartime history. It was constructed during Nazi Germany’s occupation of Norway in World War II, when the city became the hub of the most important German Naval base in the Northern Atlantic. The bunker, with its colossal concrete walls, was one of two sister bunkers built at the site to shelter German submarines participating in the Battle of the Atlantic. In 1943, an American bomber fleet targeted the facility. Although the bunkers remained unharmed, the surrounding area was left in ruins. After the war, the Norwegian Navy took control of the facility, continuing to use Dora as a submarine base. However, as it became evident that the bunker was too massive for the needs of the Norwegian Navy, it was sold to private investors and repurposed for civilian use in the 1960s. Today, this massive structure safeguards a hidden treasure of cultural heritage. Its unique microclimate ensures stable temperature and relative humidity, making it ideal for long-term storage. As a result, several archives and collections from various cultural and museum institutions are housed within its walls. In addition to its archival functions, the bunker also accommodates offices and a bowling alley. Despite its apparent durability, Dora I faces challenges from the harsh Scandinavian climate and marine exposure, which have caused visible decay on its concrete surface, adding to its characteristic aura of history.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bones-in-jars",
    "description": "At first glance, Beaver Dam, Wisconsin seems like a place filled with quintessential small-town American charm. The town’s motto is “Life here is good,” and the most famous resident of Beaver Dam is the actor Fred MacMurray, star of such family-friendly fare as My Three Sons and Flubber. However, much like Fred MacMurray’s performance in Double Indemnity, a wholesome exterior can conceal darkness underneath. And in Beaver Dam, one local young artist is bringing gothic horror to his hometown through his storefront, Bones in Jars. The artist’s name is Wesley Kratz-Gullickson, and his goal with Bones in Jars is not only to provide himself with studio space, but to give people who felt like they didn’t fit in elsewhere the chance to feel safe. After graduating from University of Wisconsin-Superior, Wesley moved back to his hometown, and opened Bones in Jars in October 2023 right in the center of Beaver Dam’s downtown business district. The store primarily features Kratz-Gullickson’s work, which is a melange of the cute and mundane cut with the arcane and occult. Inspired by classic horror movies and Lovecraftian touches, the artist works in several media, such as cryptid-themed monster masks, jewelry made from bones (in jars), and dioramas with artistic displays of insects. A selection of the work is on display in the storefront itself, amidst antique and furniture stores. In addition to his own work, the store also includes displays from like minded guest artists, who as the store puts it, have “a flair for the odd and unique.” The goal is to provide a space for local artists so that their work can be displayed and sold closer to home. Kratz-Gullickson also offers classes in town for people who are interested in unusual crafts, such as bug pinning \u0026 display, bone jewelry, and owl pellet dissection and display. Although Bones in Jars would perhaps feel more at home in a larger city, Beaver Dam offers the affordable space and diverse set of shops that has allowed the store to fit in to the larger community, even with an offbeat selection. As for Kratz-Gullickson himself, he seems proud to have brought his vision onto Front Street. As he responded in an interview upon the store’s opening, “I really wanted to create a space where the weirdos could go that I wish we would have had when I was a teenager.”",

    "description": "An increasing interest in Henry VIII and the new BBC drama about his reign have boosted visitor numbers for castles and palaces used as filming locations and connected to the kingA capricious and cruel autocrat handing out privileges and punishments, women struggling to assert themselves, the populist mob at the gate – and through it all a decent man, we hope, steers a hazardous course. The first two books of Hilary Mantel’s epic Wolf Hall trilogy became a BBC series in 2015, and now the six-part finale, The Mirror and The Light, is airing, covering the last years of Thomas Cromwell, until his downfall at the hands of his tyrannical boss, Henry VIII.At the locations where the original action took place, and those used in the series, there is rising excitement about a sharp increase in website traffic and visitor numbers. The Tudors, it seems, are still box-office gold. The Tower of London, where both Anne Boleyn and Cromwell ended their days, saw visitor numbers rise by more than a third in 2023. History itself is booming, driven by podcasts such as Empire, presented by Anita Anand and William Dalrymple, and Radio 4’s You’re Dead to Me. Dominic Sandbrook and Tom Holland of The Rest Is History podcast sold out London’s Royal Albert Hall in October. When a pair of donnish historians get a rock star reception, something significant is happening. According to a survey conducted in May by rail booking agent Trainline, 75% of respondents hoped to visit a historical attraction in the year ahead. Continue reading...",

    "description": "This cosy homestead offers all the simple pleasures for a winter escape: great scenery, log burners, no wifi and a pile of paperbacksThe lane gets steeper and narrower, the roar of the river louder. We turn to cross the old stone bridge and, two farm gates later, are bouncing up through a forest of gnarly oak and moss-swaddled boulders to emerge on a grassy belvedere by the old farm. The last rays of sun are touching the distant peaks of Cadair Idris. There is not another dwelling in sight … unless that speck on the far hillside might be a house?Inside there is a slate floor polished by two centuries of Welsh feet. In the rooms beyond we find a pair of log-burners, two cast-iron baths and several well-worn rugs and sofas. Best of all, there’s a kitchen humming with warmth from an Aga, a guitar and many piles of books. Later, I stand outside on the sheep-cropped lawn, watching the millstream cascade into a pool and think: “I’m getting under that … probably, at some point.” And: “This is perfect.” Continue reading...",
