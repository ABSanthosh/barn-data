    "description": "With tuition from West End pros, this week-long singing break in southern Spain hits all the right notes‘Do you prefer alto or soprano?” asks Steve Moss, poised at his electric piano. My mind goes blank. I’m usually more of a pinot grigio girl, but that’s not the answer the former musical director of Les Misérables is looking for. Although I struggle to carry a tune in a bucket, I’m an enthusiastic karaoke singer, a big musical theatre fan and a shameless show-off, so Sing the Greatest Showman, a residential singing retreat in Spain, is right up my street.Founded by Zane Rambaran, a veteran concert promoter with his roots in musical theatre, Sing Eat Retreat offers a choice of breaks here throughout the year (from Sing Les Mis to Sing Mamma Mia), with 30  hours of tuition by West End professionals. (In October, Sing The Sound of Music will be held in Salzburg too, with guests recording tracks in a studio and performing in the actual movie locations. I’ve already packed my dirndl.)

    "description": "Christianity, especially Roman Catholicism, has a legacy of patronage, resulting in artistic works like the Book of Kells, Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel ceiling, and Andrei Rublev’s icons, among others. As European colonialism expanded, these artistic practices spread alongside Christianity. In Mexico, as the colony of New Spain, art became a powerful tool in the conversion of indigenous peoples to Christianity. Local gods were assigned to equivalent saints; churches were built atop the ruins of temples and objects of worship; indigenous art styles were only allowed to survive in service of Catholicism. As the colony became more Europeanized, religious art followed the Baroque, Churrigueresque, and other popular styles (mostly from Spain). The art of what would later become Mexico amassed a large number of both local and imported crucifixes, biblical paintings, and fancifully carved church items like altarpieces, pulpits, and confessionals. In the art museum of the Archdiocese of Monterrey, many such objects can be found, especially those that came from churches in what is now Nuevo León. The displays begin with works from the Colonial period, mostly the 18th and early 19th centuries. Most are paintings, though carvings and furniture also appear. Following Mexico’s independence in 1821, the collection includes vestments, thuribles, and artworks made by priests, novices, and other clergy. Secular artistic trends are often reflected in religious items as well. Works from the late 20th and 21st centuries sometimes show modernist influences and even abstraction in depictions of the crucifixion or the Holy Trinity. The museum also includes a significant library, the bulk of which was donated in 2015 by the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM). It was inaugurated in 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdowns and named in honor of Monsignor Francisco Plancarte y Navarrete, Archbishop of Monterrey from 1912 to 1920.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/burke-building",
    "description": "The Burke Building is a historic building along the famous Escolta Street, once the financial and shopping capital of the Philippines in the early 20th century. The building was designed by the preeminent architect of that time, Tomas Fernandez Arguelles, in art deco fashion. Named after cardiologist William J. Burke, this site housed the department store Heacock’s, among others. The building was damaged during World War II and underwent renovation. The Burke Building was built in 1919, a period of rapid engineering advancement and the growing popularity of high rises, and at five stories, it is one of the tallest buildings in Escolta. In it, the developer installed the first elevator in the country—an Otis brand, imported from France, equipped with a brass cage that had to be closed manually. A marker is installed on the wall beside the entrance to commemorate this milestone.",
