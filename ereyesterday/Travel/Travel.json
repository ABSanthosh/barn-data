    "description": "The resort is extending its bucket-and-spade appeal to a new generation with a raft of investment, a series of new festivals and some original offerings on the food and accommodation frontCleethorpes Pier, circled by the local gull squad, looks at its picture-postcard best. Ahead of the lunch crowd making for Papa’s Fish \u0026 Chips restaurant, I’m taking a seat in the pier’s ballroom to hear seaside historian Kathryn Ferry talk about her latest book, Twentieth Century Seaside Architecture.Ordering a pot of tea, I’m taken back to my student days. Back in the late 1990s, the ballroom hosted Pier 39, a sticky-floored nightclub where getting your heels wedged in the planks after too many vodkas was considered par for the course. Following a shift waitressing at a nearby fish restaurant, our girl gang would douse our hair in Charlie Red body spray to mask the fug of haddock before dancing the night away where the Humber estuary meets the North Sea.

    "description": "They wear traditional dress, play ancient melodies on violins and accordions, but the women of this island outpost ensure that it is more than just a living museum“Welcome to Kihnu. We are not a matriarchy,” says Mare Mätas as she meets me off the ferry. I’ve stepped on to the wild and windswept Kihnu island, which floats in the Gulf of Riga off Estonia’s western coast like a castaway from another time. Just four miles (7km) long and two miles wide, this Baltic outpost is a world unto itself that has long been shielded from the full impact of modernity, a place where motorbikes share the road with horse-drawn carts, and women in bright striped skirts still sing ancient sea songs. But Kihnu is no museum – it’s a living, breathing culture all of its own, proudly cared for by its 700 or so residents.Mare, a traditional culture specialist and local guide, promptly ushers me into the open back of her truck and takes me on a whistlestop tour of the island, giving me a history quiz as we stop at the museum, the lighthouse, the cemetery and the school.

    "description": "The Campus Theatre is an operational single-screen Art Deco theater located in the Lewisburg, Pennsylvania Historic District. It shows a mix of new wide releases, arthouse films, and classics, with selections rotating nearly every day. Opened in January 1941, the theater was built by the Stiefel brothers—Russian emigrees who operated a number of theaters across the region—and based on designs by architect David Supowitz. It was owned by the Stiefel family until 2001 when a film professor at nearby Bucknell University purchased it and converted it into a nonprofit. The nonprofit partnered with Bucknell to purchase the building in 2006 and renovate it in keeping with its original Art Deco design. The reonvation project, which also included upgrades to the auditorium’s projection and sound systems, was completed in 2011. In a nod to a bygone era, the volunteer-run theater offers affordable tickets and concessions. It also has regular BYOB showings where patrons over 21 can bring their own beer or wine.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-seven-headed-palm-tree-of-cachiche",
    "description": "Hidden in Cachiche, a village locally renowned for its legends of witchcraft, stands the “Palmera de Siete Cabezas” (Seven-headed Palm Tree), a bizarrely-shaped palm that carries an ominous prophecy. Unlike ordinary palms, this wizened tree has grown in a twisted formation, as if it were a petrified serpent with multiple “heads” spread across the ground rather than reaching skyward. According to local legend, a 106-year-old witch prophesied on her deathbed that the city of Ica would face destruction when the palm’s seventh head fully grew. Since then, locals periodically prune this seventh head to prevent a catastrophe. Some claim the prophecy was fulfilled in 1998, when the seventh head was allegedly left uncut. That year, the city of Ica suffered a great flood caused by “El Niño”, a meteorological phenomenon that typically brings heavy rainfall and floods across the Peruvian coast, but rarely to Ica itself. Today, the tree itself is a popular site for those attracted to the haunting story and shape of this tree. Also, many travelers simply go to count the heads of the palm tree for themselves. Nearby, there is a park that honors the town’s heritage of curanderas (healers) and witches, including Julia Hernández Pecho, the woman said to be the one that made the prophecy about the seven-headed palm.",
