    "description": "The hike offers dramatic views of the Swiss Alps’ ‘murder wall’ – and poignant insights into the climbers who first braved it. For the son of one of those pioneers, it had a special resonanceA few years ago, my dad told me of a mountain where I could easily sense another world. “There is a special air and light,” he had said, vaguely. “You just have to walk close to it to feel and see it. Stand in one place and just look up.”The mountain on my dad’s mind that day was the Eiger, Switzerland’s 3,970-metre ogre of limestone and ice. Like few others, the peak exerts a gravitational pull on climbers and it remains the chief symbol of the Bernese Oberland; its most notable feature, the 1,800-metre north face, is the largest in the Alps. This gigantic slab looms over the village of Grindelwald, to the south-east of the town of Interlaken, appearing at sunrise as an immense black spectre in a valley of green. Continue reading...",

    "description": "With tuition from West End pros, this week-long singing break in southern Spain hits all the right notes‘Do you prefer alto or soprano?” asks Steve Moss, poised at his electric piano. My mind goes blank. I’m usually more of a pinot grigio girl, but that’s not the answer the former musical director of Les Misérables is looking for. Although I struggle to carry a tune in a bucket, I’m an enthusiastic karaoke singer, a big musical theatre fan and a shameless show-off, so Sing the Greatest Showman, a residential singing retreat in Spain, is right up my street.Founded by Zane Rambaran, a veteran concert promoter with his roots in musical theatre, Sing Eat Retreat offers a choice of breaks here throughout the year (from Sing Les Mis to Sing Mamma Mia), with 30  hours of tuition by West End professionals. (In October, Sing The Sound of Music will be held in Salzburg too, with guests recording tracks in a studio and performing in the actual movie locations. I’ve already packed my dirndl.)

    "description": "Jewish people have been living in Rome for over 2,000 years. In 1555 a Papal decree confined the entire community to a ghetto near the Tiber. Here, some of the city’s cucina ebraica staples were perfected and codified: chrysanthemum-shaped carciofi alla giudea (fried artichokes), puffy fritters, rich ricotta crostatas. Lately, alas, Rome’s Ghetto Romano has been resembling a stage set for tourists with restaurants resting on their greasy laurels, and lines at the classic Pasticceria Boccione stretching for blocks.  Where do actual Romans go for cucina erbarica? Follow them to this no-frills cafeteria in the unglamorous part of Trastevere near its famous Sunday flea market, Porta Portese. A combination tavola calda (deli with prepared food) and fresh pasta takeout shop (the name means “there’s pasta…and pasta!”) the homey spot with a few tables inside and some on the sidewalk delivers a primer of Rome’s Jewish flavors undiluted for tourists—and certified kosher.  The huge selection behind the glass counter is daunting but the briskly friendly young staffers will annotate the food in English (or Spanish or French). Yes, there are fried carciofi in season (from winter to early spring) as well as blazing-red roasted peppers, fried marinated zucchini called concia, and plump rice-stuffed tomatoes. Among the pastas, choose the delightful cacio e pepe lasagna. And pay special attention to fish specials, such as orata (sea bream) roasted under a layer of thin-sliced potatoes, and aliciotti con indivia, an iconic Jewish dish of fresh anchovies baked in a casserole under a cap of slightly bitter green curly escarole. No way around it, you’ll order too much and won’t regret it a bit.",

    "description": "Seeking “trendy new places” that are genuinely good in the Eternal City is usually as futile as searching for Andy Warhols at the Vatican Museum—and yet. Those craving a break from nose-to-tail Roman menus will be thrilled with the vivid modern Sicilian flavors of Giano located on Via Liguria.  The main thing to know about Giano is that it’s the first Roman outpost of the unstoppably creative Sicilian chef Ciccio Sultano, who holds two Michelin stars at his restaurant Duomo in Ragusa. But though Giano’s menu includes a few of his signature hits, the food here is not overwrought and the prices are fair given the stellar ingredients and the kitchen’s laser-sharp focus.  The glamorous wood-paneled dining room with playfully clubby vibes and plush seating is a perfect setting for a classic negroni. Sip it while perusing the menu that reads like a paean to Sicilian almonds, citrus, and seafood. A good place to start is the white grouper carpaccio with wild fennel and orange, or the silvery flash-cooked sardines curled around an agrodolce Sicilian-Arab filling of pine nuts and raisins.   Currently the most thrilling pasta in Rome? Sultano’s legendary spaghetto taratatà, named for the sound of rattling sabers. The toothsome pasta is sauced with lemon, ground pine nuts, and shaved tuna bottarga, and is served with a flourish of grouper tartare under a crunchy topping of bread crumbs. After splitting a main course featuring rich tuna belly or Nerodi black pig from a heirloom Sicilian breed, enjoy the dessert “menu” presented as cute Polaroid photos of the sweets on offer. Yes, you’ll want Sultano’s scandalously rich ricotta cannoli served with a sorbet of Avola almonds.",
