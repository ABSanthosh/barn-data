There, a bright red spider web; here, some luminescent fungi; now a twinkling tortoise, Timothy, sheltering by the wall. I am exploring the gardens of Gilbert White’s House in Selborne, Hampshire, which is holding a light trail with a difference this month.Gilbert White (1720-1793) is considered the father of ecology, one of the first people to observe living creatures in their own habitats, rather than studying dead specimens. He discovered the role of earthworms; developed the idea of the food chain; and identified species including the harvest mouse, noctule bat, chiffchaff, wood warbler and willow warbler.

    "description": "Today, the beautiful Smecere Forest is the site of a popular cross-country skiing trail, and BMX track. People flock here from Latvia and abroad to train and compete, giving the place a positive energy. However, the forest has a dark past. In 1941, when the Nazi troops arrived in Latvia, and the local Jewish population began to be arrested and annihilated, it was the site of a mass shooting. Approximately 700 hearts stopped beating here.  After the war, the area was marked with a monument to commemorate the \"Soviet people who had died in the hands of German occupants and bourgeois nationalists,\" but this monument did not survive. The striking granite monument seen here today in the shape of a skull is the work of sculptor Gvido Buls and was erected in 1993 when Latvia had regained its independence from the Soviet Union. Next to it, the memorial stone states that this is a place to remember the residents of Madona and surroundings who were killed in the summer of 1941 following the arrival of the Nazi soldiers.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bemisie",
    "description": "In 2022, Warsaw's Bemowo district welcomed six new residents in some of its most-visited spots. These tiny bronze sculptures, known jointly as \"Bemisie\" (\"misie\" is a Polish word of endearment meaning \"cute little bears\"), were actually a winning project proposed by the locals in a participatory budgeting program. All six bears represent different themes related to Bemowo's past and current traditions. Most of them revolve around its sports and military heritage, as this area of Warsaw has always had ties with the Polish Army. Bemik, located in the park surrounding abandoned 19th-century fortifications known as Fort Bema, invites passers-by to try kayaking on the preserved moat. Ratowniś, a bear lifeguard, stations next to a swimming pool. Latacz, located by a primary school in the close vicinity of the former military airport Babice, sports a stylish aviator hat. Radarek commemorates the now-demolished transatlantic telegraph installations built in this area in the 1920s, while Watek poses as a student of the nearby Military University of Technology. Last but not least, Ringo, also placed by a local school, pays tribute to Włodzimierz Strzyżewski, a Bemowo resident who invented the game of ringo in 1959. Due to their minuscule dimensions, Bemisie can be hard to spot, but it only adds to the fun. Taking a walk around the district to find them all is a perfect way to learn more about this relatively little-known part of Warsaw.",
