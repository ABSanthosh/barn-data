    "description": "We travelled 3,000 miles by bus and train to what is currently the eastern limit of independent overland travel‘I think this is as far as we can go,” I say, glancing down at the military post, barely 100 metres from the Zakagori Fortress, the forced endpoint of our day hike through the Truso valley in northern Georgia. Beyond the fortress lies disputed land, a seemingly endless expanse of yellowing pastures swelling beneath ice-capped peaks, where only a few wandering sheep dare to roam. Just beyond our line of sight is Russia.We started our hike with a bumpy taxi ride to the abandoned village of Kvemo Okrokana, not far from our guesthouse in the town of Kazbegi. But in truth, our adventure began six weeks earlier at Leeds train station. From there, we hopped between trains, night buses and marshrutki (shared taxis) to reach this remote eastern edge of Europe. Continue reading...",

We joined them at a batik workshop, where Mavis Thompson showed us how to dip our chosen designs into melted wax, and stamp a length of cream cotton. After dyeing the fabric using natural pigments, we plunged it into boiling water to remove the wax. As the cotton had to be sun-dried between each stage, we sat on low stools and watched the other Global Mamas produce larger, more complex designs. Our vibrantly coloured tablecloths are a reminder of a happy afternoon with Mavis and the mamas.Helen Jackson Continue reading...",

    "description": "The Tongariro Alpine Crossing in New Zealand is a 19-kilometer hike that takes visitors between Mount Ruapehu and Mount Ngauruhoe. After reaching the summit of Red Crater, a volcanic cone sitting nearly 2,000 meters above sea level, hikers are treated to dazzling views of electric blue and green lakes below. Known as Ngarotopounamu in Maori, the Emerald Lakes owe their brilliant colors to the presence of volcanic minerals. Steam can be seen emerging from geothermal vents nearby, giving the area a sulfurous smell. Hikers pass Mount Ngauruhoe on the way to the lakes, an active cone volcano that last erupted in 1977. Lord of the Rings fans may recognize Mount Ngauruhoe as Mount Doom, the fictional volcano where the \"One Ring\" was forged.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/elogio-de-horizonte",
    "description": "This controversial 10-foot-high abstract concrete sculpture, Praise of the Horizon, was originally a tribute to the skyline, which creator Eduardo Chillida described as “the homeland of every man.” The concrete arms symbolize reaching out and hugging where sea meets sky. Chillida designed the sculpture in 1985, and considered many locations in Spain and France until Gijón offered him a cliffside spot at Cerro de Santa Catalina. The park here was previously a military fortification. Construction involved first creating an expanded polystyrene model offsite. This was used as the model for the sculpture's pine wooden molds, which was then transported over 300 kilometers and assembled in Gijón. Concrete was poured inside the wooden molds, and that in turn is supported by a metal framework inside. The total price tag came out to 1.2 billion pesetas, of which Chillida only received 5 percent. As such, many citizens criticized the sculpture's high cost after it was inaugurated in 1990. Typical of abstract art, Elogio del Horizonte was also ridiculed for its appearance considered ugly, and it earned the nickname \"King Kong's toilet.\" Over time, the sculpture has been viewed more fondly as a defining symbol of Gijón. Its 30th anniversary was celebrated with an exhibition at the park. Today, it is a popular site to view the ocean and coastline, and has become noted for how the sounds of the sea are amplified from its inside. Instead of coming from down below, the noise is projected from the incomplete ring at the top of the sculpture. Chillida did not intend this effect, and only discovered it after completion.",
