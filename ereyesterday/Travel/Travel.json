    "description": "A challenging solo hike through stunning Provençal scenery is eased by lovely inns, dining by the seaside and leaving the planning to the expertsBehind Cassis beach, the castle-topped cliffs glint red-gold in the late afternoon sun. Couples stroll on the sand, kids play on the carousel, pastel-coloured buildings reflect in the still waters of the old harbour. In the main square, lined by plane trees, a group of elderly men concentrate on a game of petanque. It’s a charming slice of Provençal life, a world away from the Cote D’Azur’s more glitzy hotspots. In summer, tourists flock to the narrow streets and pretty coast, but off season the buzz is gentler, with weekenders feasting on bouillabaisse along the water’s edge.I grab a seat at a bar overlooking the Med and check out my walking route for the next day. Cassis is in the heart of the Calanques national park – an extraordinary place of steep fjord-like limestone inlets, deep green pines and turquoise sea – perfect for exploring on foot. It’s a fitting finale to a solo self-guided hiking trip with Macs Adventure, which has taken me from the Sainte-Baume mountains down to the Riviera over six days. While my hiking legs have been put to the test with up to six hours of walking each day, I’ve not had to worry about logistics. The routes are plotted on the app and my luggage is transferred ahead, leaving me to simply enjoy the scenery. Continue reading...",

    "description": "France does many foods exceptionally well, but certain areas offer unique and exceptional culinary experiences. We select 10 delicacies and the best regions in which to try them Of course you can enjoy exquisitely crafted patisseries all over France, but Paris is home to many of the country’s best pâtissiers, and many of the individual gateaux have a connection to the city. As you delve into the layers of almond sponge, ganache and buttercream that form the opera cake, you may see how it was inspired by the ornate balconies of the Palais Garnier opera house; while the Paris-Brest, a wheel-shaped choux, was first made in 1910 to commemorate the famously brutal cycle race. Seek out a rum baba – a brioche-like treat soaked in rum‑infused syrup – and you might be told the story of how it was created by Nicolas Stohrer, the chef of the exiled Polish king Stanislas. The patisserie that bears his name has been at 51 rue Montorgueil since 1730 and is officially classed as a historic monument. Continue reading...",

And yet, Tal Barahi Temple is a two-story pagoda built on an island in Pokhara, India's Phewa Lake.  The temple is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Barahi. Barahi is known in Nepal as a manifestation of Durga, a major Hindu goddess, and Amija, a group of deities representing female ancestors.  Visitors can access the island by private boat or kayak. The island offers beautiful views of the Annapurna range and World Peace Pagoda on clear days.",

It is home to the 100-ton Rycom aquarium in an otherwise unassuming location for marine wildlife.  This 100-ton aquarium houses fish representing the region's native marine inhabitants. More than 1,000 fish representing dozens of species are located within the aquarium, along with spineless aquatic invertebrates like sea cucumbers and stars. The aquarium overlaps with the first-floor elevator, giving shoppers a chance to observe animals like the endangered Napoleon wrasse. Two-inch clownfish can be seen mingling with zebra sharks reaching nearly 14 feet in length, while massive moray eels swim alongside schools of damselfish and cardinalfish.  Staff from the nearby Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium care for the Rycom aquarium, ensuring the safety of endemic fish and quality of the mall facilities.",
