    "description": "The new direct daytime route, via Strasbourg, sweeps through enchanting landscapes from vineyards to forests. But some say it needs to be quicker still if the train is to be more attractive than flyingUntil last week, my most recent trip from Paris to Berlin on a direct daytime train was way back in early 2015 with RZD Russian Railways. The train had a Polish restaurant car with a quirky menu featuring caviar, kangaroo steak and South African wines. The journey between the two capital cities was scheduled to take 13 hours, and despite dawdling along the way, we arrived in Berlin bang on time. It was a day with breakfast by the Seine, lunch (without caviar) on the train as we crossed the Rhine and nightcaps by the Spree in Berlin.More recently, the only direct service between Paris and Berlin has been a thrice-weekly overnight train. Branded as a Nightjet, there is nothing jet-like about it. It takes even longer than the Russian daytime train did 10 years ago. But as of last week, there is now a faster direct option. Germany’s national rail operator Deutsche Bahn and its French counterpart SNCF have just launched a much faster direct daytime Paris to Berlin train. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Rain isn’t the only thing that’s biblical in these parts … We explore a holy land of walks, pubs and crystal-clear night skies in CarmarthenshireThere’s no room at the inn in Bethlehem, Carmarthenshire. Because there’s no inn. No shops. Only a former post office turned private residence. I can see a few barns, but there’s not much else in this tiny linear village. The official population is almost 200, though only a few dozen live in the centre. There’s a primary school that closed in 1999 and now serves as the village hall. Some people still come to post Christmas cards here to get the local postmark, organised by a small local group who stamp the envelopes that can then be posted in a little red postbox by the village hall.I find the chapel, first built in 1800, down a side road, a couple of hundred yards to the south. The settlement was originally called Dyffryn Ceidrich (Ceidrich’s Valley), but after the chapel was baptised Bethlehem – a common enough name for a house of worship in Wales during its nonconformist heyday – it came to denote the area too. The stone building is tall and austere, with long, thin windows; it would have been the focal point of community life and – as any reader of Caradoc Evans’ My People will know – quite possibly a hotbed of sin, prejudice and hypocrisy. There are some weathered gravestones, with a smattering of Thomases, Davieses and Joneses, and in the morning mist it’s quite atmospheric. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tsuruya-bakery-salad-bread",
    "description": "Since the 1960s, Tsuruya Bakery has been making sarada pan, or \"salad bread\" in the town of Kinomoto in Japan's Shiga prefecture. Salad bread, the bakery's flagship item, consists of a long, soft white bun that is split and smeared with kewpie mayonnaise and pickled radish, and sold for ¥180. The bakery claims to sell 500 sandwiches per day, primarily to locals but also to tourists, many traveling to Kinomoto specifically for this unique treat.   Salad bread was invented after World War II as an initiative to increase the caloric value of lunches for school children. The first iteration of salad bread consisted of bread, mayonnaise, and cabbage, but the cabbage ended up making the bread soggy, thus unappealing to the discerning tastes of local children. In order to give the sandwich a better shelf life, the bakery swapped out the fresh cabbage for pickled radish. While salad bread is probably Kinomoto's best-known food item, it is not the Tsuruya Bakery's best-seller. That distinction goes to its sandouitchi or \"sandwich\": two pieces of fresh-baked sliced round white bread with a single piece of fish-based \"ham\" and smear of kewpie mayonnaise. Like many other iconic mononyms, it is known for being simple yet undeniable, and a crowd favorite.   Tsuruya Bakery is a must-stop for visitors to Kinomoto, a town that was once an important resting point on the trails from Kyoto to Kanazawa during the Edo period. Nowadays, the tranquil town of fewer than 9,000 residents receives mostly national tourists visiting nearby Lake Biwa, but it has more to offer than just historic sandwiches. Kinomoto is also home to the fourth-oldest sake brewery in Japan, family run and now operated by its 14th generation sake master. There are also small-scale soy sauce breweries in Kinomoto who have been producing soy sauce for decades, as well.",

    "description": "The Puppetry Art Center of Taipei, is a unique cultural institution that offers visitors a deep dive into the world of traditional puppetry, including glove puppetry, string marionettes, shadow puppets, and more. Established in 2000, this center provides an immersive experience into the history, techniques, and performances of puppetry, offering a rare glimpse into Taiwan's traditional puppet theater and the global puppet arts community.  Puppetry is a cherished art form in Taiwan, with roots extending back to ancient Chinese cultural practices and regional folk traditions, and the Taipei Puppet Museum serves as both a repository of this heritage and a center for its continued development. Visitors can observe intricate hand-carved glove puppets used in traditional Taiwanese opera. This form is iconic in Taiwan and is characterized by intricately crafted puppets manipulated by hand, often in performances that tell historical stories, folktales, or mythological dramas. The museum’s collection features puppets from various parts of Asia, including Taiwan, China, Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia. Visitors can explore the evolution of puppetry from traditional roots to more contemporary forms, examining how new storytelling techniques have been integrated into this traditional art. The exposition includes videos of stop-motion animations, and more tactile-experiences where the visitor can wear and try different puppets.",
