    "description": "Forty women joined the first ‘Hostel Hoolie’ – an exhilarating programme of hillwalking, climbing, running and socialising in Scotland’s Cairngorms‘Do you run in the dark?” “How do you stop chafing?” “Does menopause affect your flexibility?” “What snacks do you take on the hill?” It’s the first night of the inaugural “Hostel Hoolie” – a women’s outdoor adventure weekend in Braemer in the Cairngorms – and in a living room packed with 40 guests, the conversation is flowing thick and fast.Outside it’s wild and windy; there have been snow-closed roads and rural diversions, but the long journeys are quickly forgotten. Most women have come alone, though you wouldn’t know it. This weekend is a collaboration between two outdoor adventure companies: women’s trail running and hillwalking specialist Girls on Hills, and The Adventure Syndicate, a trio of epic cyclists who put on madcap events on two wheels throughout the year. Both organisations frequently partner with Hostelling Scotland, and we’re staying at the newly reopened Braemar Youth Hostel. Adding to the fun is yoga teacher Lindsay Warrack, and a hired sauna from Stravaig Saunas set up in the woods outside the hostel. Continue reading...",

    "description": "The former fishing village on the Ligurian coast was once a favourite with the wealthy British set. Now instead of tennis and tea parties, it offers scenic treks and seafood feasts in glorious spring sunshine‘Why don’t the inglesi come here any more?” The question was asked by a customer at Caffè Roma in the seaside town of Alassio, whose pre-second world war British population could reach 5,000.There are several reasons, I think. From the late 19th century, wealthy Britons would arrive in October to escape the winter cold, stay until May, and then head home before the torrid Italian summer. These days, British people with that kind of wealth probably winter between Zermatt and the Caribbean. But neither has Alassio great appeal to more ordinary Britons wanting a summer holiday: August temperatures can hit the high 30s, crowds and prices surge and, as in so many Italian resorts, the sands are taken over by beach concessions from Easter to September.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-san-colombano-collezione-tagliavini",
    "description": "The Museo San Colombano – Collezione Tagliavini in central Bologna features the unusual sight of a Renaissance-era church decorated with frescoes and filled with harpischords, pianos, and other keyboard instruments. The story of how this museum came to be housed within a deconsecrated church is complicated. Originally, the site held a church built in the seventh century, though little of the original structure remains. In 1591, an oratory was built on top of it, and later its interior was decorated with frescoes. The church closed in 1798 under Napoleonic rule, but it reopened in the 1800s, and was deconsecrated in 1959. The instrument collection, unrelated to the church’s history, was created by organist and musicologist Luigi Ferdinando Tagliavini. It began in 1969, when Tagliavini purchased a 16th-century spinet and a 17th-century harpsichord. Over time, he amassed more than 90 functional instruments, most of which were keyboards. In the early 2000s, Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna undertook a project to renovate four historic buildings, including the Oratory of San Colombano, and convert them into museums. During renovations, a 13th-century fresco of the crucifixion was discovered in a crypt. When the San Colombano Complex opened as a museum in 2010, it featured Tagliavini’s donated instrument collection. The museum remains hidden on a side street within Bologna’s city center. Its unassuming exterior and secluded location mean few visitors know about it, but those who pay the admission fee are rewarded with a uniquely spectacular museum.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/duwisib-castle-namibia",
    "description": "This red-stone castle emerges from the desert in the middle of nowhere. It’s built in the neo-romantic style, but served its romantic purposes for just seven years. In 1907, German army captain Hansheinrich von Wolf fell in love with Jayta Humphreys, a wealthy American. He had Duwisib Castle built for her, a grand structure with 22 rooms, a great hall, and a luxurious courtyard spa. The architect Wilhelm Sander designed and built the castle for 250,000 gold Marks. It was erected in just two years, an enormous effort as Von Wolf had all building materials come from Germany. They had to be hauled through the desert by horse and carriage all the way from the Luderitz harbor. Artisans were hired from around Europe, including Italian bricklayers and carpenters from Sweden and Ireland. Herero servants worked at the castle, who were enslaved by the Germans after the 1904-1908 Herero wars. The Von Wolf couple had a luxurious lifestyle, and named themselves baron and baroness. They bred horses, using imported Australian and British stock, and acquired a total of 20,000 hectares of land. Herds of wild horses in the region are said to descend from the Von Wolf stalls. In 1914, the First World War broke out. Von Wolf with his wife attempted to travel to Europe, but their ship got redirected to Rio de Janeiro where they got detained. After they were released a couple of months later, Von Wolf was enlisted to fight at the front. He fell within two weeks, 4th of September 1916, at the Battle of the Somme. Jayta never returned to the fairytale home. She stayed in Germany, remarried, and eventually fled back to New Jersey during the second world war. She never laid claim on the castle. It was sold numerous times, went bankrupt and deteriorated. The Namibian government bought the ruin in 1978, and in 1991 it was renovated and declared a national monument. The Great Hall still has the original grandeur, with hunting trophies and paintings. The dining room, winter, and summer bedrooms have their original German furniture. The courtyard has a lush green garden with palms and Jacaranda trees. An Eden in an otherwise brown and arid place.",
