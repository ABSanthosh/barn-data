    "description": "These ancient rocks have inspired myth and mysticism for millennia, and a new book and festival celebrate their enduring powerThe first bluebells are out along the Dart gorge, creating a faint purple haze under the twisted oak trees. I’m on my way to Luckey Tor, one of Dartmoor’s most hidden rock stacks, which sits by the river, shrouded in vegetation like Sleeping Beauty’s castle. It’s not the easiest of walks. The path peters out as I get deeper into the gorge, and the final approach to the tor involves clambering and hopping over large mossy boulders and navigating huge shelves of rock that border the river.The first sight of it is unforgettable. A small stream, the Row Brook, runs in front of it, like a moat. The tor looms up squarely from the valley floor, dwarfing everything around, framed in a grassy clearing that is a popular place to bivouac. Its position is unusual. Most tors are at the summit of a hill, dominating the views for miles around, standing grandly in the landscape, devoid of trees. Luckey Tor is sequestered in the folds of the Dart valley, and in the summer is mostly obscured by foliage; when you find it, you feel as though you’ve entered a secret kingdom. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Five hours by ferry from Split – and a world away from the clubs of Hvar – the islands’ wooded hills, pine-shaded beaches and transparent waters are buzzing with natureThe sound of a baby crying echoes eerily in the night sky, seemingly coming from the uninhabited Zaklopatica islet that faces the terrace of our holiday rental in Lastovo. “Do you think that’s a bird?” I ask my husband. “At this time of night? Doubt it,” he says.Fast forward a couple of days and we’re in a park ranger’s motorboat bumping around the far-flung Lastovo archipelago in the Adriatic. All its 46 islands (including the main Lastovo island), islets and reefs were declared a nature park in 2006. By luck, I’m with the ornithologist whose discovery of the nesting sites of some of the Mediterranean’s most endangered birds – yelkouan and Scopoli’s shearwaters – was instrumental in Lastovo getting the official protection it deserves.

    "description": "Several earthen mounds are some of the last remains of Gordion, the ancient capital of Phrygia. At nearly 175 feet tall, the largest of the hills, the \"Midas Mound,\" was named for Gordion's most famous ruler, who was excavated by a team of archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1950s. A large burial chamber made from juniper, cedar, and pine beams was found inside, sheltering the remains of a man, along with precious artifacts of wood and bronze. The tomb is dated to the mid 8th century BC, and allegedly belonged to his father, Gordias. Today, the tumulus mound sits across the road from the small Gordion Museum. A somewhat cramped and long tunnel cuts through the middle of the mound, leading to the ancient wooden beams of the chamber. Astonishingly well-preserved under rubble and dirt, these remains claim the title of world's oldest standing wooden structure.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-devils-column",
    "description": "The Devil's Column in Prague is a mysterious and weathered stone structure found near the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in the Vyšehrad area. The column is shrouded in legend and local lore, blending Gothic intrigue with a unique supernatural tale. The structure itself is an odd formation of three stone segments, stacked together yet slightly misaligned, which only adds to its air of mystery and otherworldliness. According to local legend, the column was tossed here by the devil himself. According to the most popular version of the tale, the Devil's Column was the result of a wager between a local priest and the devil. The story says that the priest, struggling with personal debts, made a deal with a devil, betting that he could complete a mass before the devil would bring a column all the way from St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. If the devil won, he would claim the priest's soul. If the priest won, he would be freed from his debts. The devil took on the challenge and embarked on his journey to Rome to steal a massive column. But for some reason, the Devil didn't reach the Vatican. Maybe he was too scared of entering the Vatican, or maybe too tired. Instead, he stole the column from another church in Rome: Santa Maria in Trastevere. Then, he sped back to Prague, but high in the heavens, St. Peter himself saw the devil cheating and decided to intervene. St. Peter proceeded to throw the devil into the sea, critically slowing his way back to Prague. For this delay, when the devil was nearing his destination, the priest managed to finish his mass. Enraged by his defeat, the devil threw the column through the roof of the nearby Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, where it shattered into three pieces. The story is so popular that the tale is portrayed in a mural inside the church, depicting St. Peter fighting with the devil carrying the column on his back. The fragments of the column were allegedly moved from inside the church to the nearby park where they sit today.",
