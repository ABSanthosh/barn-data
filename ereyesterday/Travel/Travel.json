    "description": "From coffee and cake right on the beach to oysters straight from the sea, our tipsters share their favourite places to eat with a view of the wavesFor years, the elegant art deco southern pavilion at the sea end of Worthing Pier housed a dodgy nightclub. After Covid, it reopened, now owned by south coast restaurant business Perch, having been restored back to its 1930s glory. It’s like having lunch on an ocean liner. There’s a great menu, with plenty of the things you’d expect at a seaside cafe, and good service. I spent years working on arts, culture and regeneration projects to bring Worthing into the 21st century while respecting what makes the town special – it feels like this is everything we aimed for.

    "description": "Tracing part of an ancient highway in Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire – now the A1 – proves rich in stories going back 2,000 yearsAfter a while it is clear that someone, or something, is following us. A figure, some distance back. But here’s the thing: it doesn’t appear to draw any closer, or get further away. It seems to remain, matching our pace, just at the edge of vision – at the edge of the dusk now descending over the grand Lincolnshire parkland surrounding Burghley House. When we stop, the figure vanishes. When we set off again, it returns. A shrouded shape; a shadow stalking our steps.Perhaps it shouldn’t be a surprise. The old Roman highway we’ve been intermittently tracing from Water Newton to Stamford is a nine-mile track layered with history. Now overgrown and concealed, it was once a bustling leg of a great north-south thoroughfare that has run, in some form or another, like a backbone through the body of Britain for at least 2,000 years. A unique assemblage of ancient trackway, Roman road, medieval path, pilgrim route, coach road and motorway. Today, hereabouts, its modern incarnation – the A1 – loops west, leaving, as it does in many places, forgotten, discontinued ghost highways to their own devices. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/besucherbergwerk-abraumforderbrucke-f60",
    "description": "At 260 feet tall and over 1600 feet long, the Abraumförderbrücke (overburden conveyer bridge) F60 is the largest vehicle ever constructed by size. Its length is over 1.5 times the height of the Eiffel Tower, and has been appropriately nicknamed the \"lying Eiffel Tower.\" Between 1969 and 1991, five such conveyer bridges were built by East German state-run combine TAKRAF for lignite mines in the Lusatia coalfields. A conveyer bridge serves to remove the upper levels of earth, known as overburden, to expose the ores underneath. They tend to be extremely large to maximize efficiency, and extremely long because they deposit the overburden on the opposite side of the mine. In order to move around to different parts of the mine, conveyor bridges are situated on rails and are thus considered vehicles. For that purpose, the F60 has 760 wheels on two bogies, yet it can manage a top speed of less than half a mile per hour. As such, it only needs a few hundred feet of track at once on which to operate, with another vehicle dedicated to removing and laying it. The F60 still has an operating range of less than four miles because it relies on limited electric cables for power. The entire machine needed a crew of 14 to operate. The F60 at the Klettwitz-Nord open-pit mine was the last of its model constructed, between 1988 and 1991. It was also the first to be decommissioned, after operating for just 15 months, because the power plants and briquette factories the mine was meant to service closed down after German reunification. In order to restore the local environment, the mine was flooded to form an artificial lake. To revitalize the area's economy, the F60 was moved to adjacent higher ground, where it is now a \"visitors' mine\" showcasing the area's mining history.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/corbeille-of-nefta",
    "description": "The Corbeille of Nefta (La Corbeille de Nefta) is a unique natural and historical site located in the oasis town of Nefta in southern Tunisia, near the Algerian border. Known for its stunning beauty, the natural springs here water nearly half a million date palms, one of the largest collections of the trees in the world, as well as ancient irrigation channels, which have sustained the local population for centuries. The name \"Corbeille,\" which means \"basket\" in French, refers to the shape of the area, which resembles a basket as it dips into the surrounding desert landscape, creating an oasis of lush greenery amidst the arid environment. The Corbeille of Nefta is a testament to the ingenuity of ancient agricultural techniques, particularly the traditional methods of water management that have been employed in the region for generations. The oasis is sustained by a system of underground water channels, known as qanats, which bring water from deeper underground sources to irrigate the land. Historically, the Corbeille of Nefta has been a hub of life and trade. Its palm groves and fertile land have long been central to the local economy and way of life.  Nefta is famous not only for its oasis but also for its importance as a cradle of Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam. Sufism, with its emphasis on inner purification, spiritual closeness to God, and the seeking of divine truth, has had a profound influence on Nefta. The city is home to several important Sufi shrines and landmarks, the most famous being the shrine of Sidi Bou Ali, a revered Sufi saint, which attracts pilgrims from across Tunisia and beyond. These sacred sites serve not only as places of worship but also as centers of learning, where Sufi teachings on spirituality, ethics, and divine love are passed down through generations.  Nefta, considered the second holy city of Tunisia, is sometimes called the \"Kairouan of the South.\" The city also hosts a festival of traditional and mystical music, known as Rohuanyet.",
