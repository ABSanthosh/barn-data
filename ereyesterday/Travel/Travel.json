    "description": "The Via delle Valli is a series of 50 trails aiming to tempt mountain-lovers away from the region’s hotspots and towards lesser-charted countryThick white cloud hangs outside the windows of Rifugio Segantini, a mountain hut 2,373 metres up in the Italian Alps. But it is shifting, revealing glimpses of the majestic Brenta Dolomites before us: a patch of snow here, a craggy peak there. The view is tantalising, and a couple of times I have run outside in a kind of peekaboo farce to see the full display, only for it to pass behind clouds again.The refuge – cosy, wooden-clad and packed with hikers – is named after the Italian landscape painter Giovanni Segantini, who was inspired by these mountains. His portrait hangs on the walls and his name is embroidered on the lace curtains. A simple stone building with blue and white shutters in Val d’Amola, the refuge is dwarfed by its rugged surrounds, with Trentino’s highest peak, the snow-capped 3,556-metre Presanella, as a backdrop. The entries in the guestbook are entirely by locals. Continue reading...",

Seasoned travellers explain how to stay happy and hunger-free, whether you’re trekking in Thailand or on a mini-break in BerlinThis spring, I spent five weeks travelling around Mexico – my longest time away from home since becoming a vegan two and a half years ago. It was a learning experience: lots of incredible vegan food, gallons of fall-back guacamole and the odd cheese-related disaster. This is what I found out about being a vegan on holiday, and the advice I received from more seasoned vegan travellers. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Built in 1631, the Prasat Nakhon Luang, or \"royal city castle\" in English, is an architectural and archaeological wonder with a history spanning the various dynasties of Siam. Now a temple, it is a significant piece of Thailand's Buddhist and Hindu religious heritage. King Prasat Thong of the fourth Ayutthaya dynasty of the same name ordered the palace to be built, modeling it after a Khmer palace commonly believed to have been Cambodia's Angkor Wat, while a more academic suggestion says it was most likely the Baphuon Temple. The castle served as a temporary royal residence when the king made the annual pilgrimage to Wat Phra Phutthabat, upstream in Saraburi. Additionally, it was a venue for other religious ceremonies throughout the dynasty. After the Ayutthaya Empire fell, the castle was left abandoned and ruined until the 19th century when it was repurposed by locals as a Buddhist site of worship. The relic \"Buddhapāda\" (Buddha's footprints) was enshrined in a new temple built on top of the ruins of the once-royal palace. King Chulalongkorn visited the site in the late 19th century and ordered a complete mapping of the site alongside renovations. Today, the ruins draw in temple-goers from all over the country who make pilgrimages to the Buddha's footprints, as well as pray to the statue of Ganesha enshrined at the entrance. One can walk around the ruins and explore what once was a majestic palace, through corridors and towers flanked by ancient Buddha statues.",

    "description": "In the small Georgian town of Tsinandali, tucked behind the elegant House Museum of Aleander Chavchavadze, where manicured gardens and wine cellars shine a light on Georgia’s aristocratic past, lies something far stranger — the partial remains of a statue of Vladimir Lenin. Notably, his head! What remains today is easy to miss, and seems strangely out of place. It’s a haunting fragment of history, hidden in plain sight. There are no plaques or signage explaining why the head was left behind. It simply lingers, almost like a secret the town doesn't like to talk about. Georgia likely had dozens of statues and busts of Lenin during the height of Soviet influence. Most are long gone. This is one of the last remnants of a bygone era.",
