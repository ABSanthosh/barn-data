    "title": "This Turkey Church Is Just One Way People Celebrate the Humble Bird",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/history-of-the-turkey-thanksgiving",
    "description": "This article is adapted from the November 9, 2024, edition of Gastro Obscura’s Favorite Things newsletter. You can sign up here. Walk into a church and you’ll likely find the usual iconography: Christ on the cross, a serene Virgin Mary, perhaps an angel or two. But in East Yorkshire, England, another figure joins these icons on a chapel’s decor: the turkey. St. Andrew’s Boynton Church is the final resting place of the Strickland family, an aristocratic bunch based in Yorkshire. Its most famous member, William Strickland, was a British navigator who claimed to have introduced the turkey to England in the mid-1500s. This accomplishment is celebrated throughout the family’s chapel: Bibles sit atop a turkey-shaped lectern, a sculpted bird perches over a family memorial, and light filters inside through a stained-glass turkey window. I have been obsessed with the turkey chapel ever since I learned about it a few years ago. Not only is it incredible for a waddling bird to take center stage in a church, but I’ve never seen the humble turkey get this kind of respect. After all, the turkey gets a bad rap. When Ben Franklin suggests it as a candidate for the national bird in the musical 1776, it’s a punchline. And every Thanksgiving, there are turkey haters spouting the same gripes: It’s dry. It’s bland. It’s filler between show-stopping sides. But I’m here to say the turkey deserves better. With the right preparation—I’m partial to Samin Nosrat’s buttermilk-brined roast turkey recipe—it can have the perfect balance of juicy meat and crisp, seasoned skin. And, in my opinion, it’s the best sandwich meat, always serving as a complementary team player with other fillings. Beyond its flavor, however, the turkey has a long ceremonial history in North and Central America. Archaeological evidence in Guatemala suggests the Maya domesticated Meleagris gallopavo (a species also known as the Mexican turkey) as early as 300 BC. In the time since, the turkey has played a key role in rituals ranging from traditional dances to presidential pardons. Read on for some of our favorite turkey traditions. Hopefully, they’ll make you a bit more grateful for this big, beautiful bird. Gods and Sacrifices Turkeys played a key role in rituals among ancient Mesoamerican civilizations. In fact, the birds were likely first domesticated for ceremonial use before being bred for their meat. In 2018, researchers examined turkey bones dated to between 300 BC and 1500, from areas stretching from Northern and Central Mexico to Yucatán. They noticed that the bird’s remains were rarely found in domestic refuse and instead were excavated from temples and human graves. In pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican codices, turkeys appear in the form of the god Chalchiuhtotolin, (or “jade turkey”) and are mentioned as part of Aztec ritual sacrifices. Highly valued, the birds were even among the gifts Moctezuma presented to Hernán Cortés before the conquistador betrayed him. Seeing the turkey for the first time, the Spanish thought it looked like a plain peacock and gave it the name pavo, a shortening of pavo real (“peacock”). Turkey Dances You can still see the ceremonial importance of the turkey in traditions like the Guelaguetza festival of Oaxaca, Mexico. The annual July event celebrates Indigenous cultures, with crafts, food, and lots of dancing. In small parades known as calendas, performers hoist papier-mâché turkeys while bird-shaped figures shoot fireworks. Even the festival’s ritual dances celebrate the turkey as a revered gift, with performers often holding live birds or puppets while they whirl around. Turkey Drives When you hear “turkey trot” now, it probably brings to mind those go-getters who, instead of sleeping in and watching the Macy’s Day Parade with a coffee or mimosa on their couch, choose to wake up early for a run on Thanksgiving Day. But at the first “turkey trot” in 1912, it was the turkeys doing the running. A crowd of 30,000 attendees came to Cuero, Texas, to watch farmers herd flocks of 5,000 to 10,000 turkeys into town. The tourist event was recreating the bygone tradition of the turkey drive, when livestock owners would guide their flocks on the long journey from farm to market. Dating back to the 17th century, turkey drives were an essential tradition in the age before refrigeration and trucks. Though herding turkeys came with its own unique challenges—such as the birds’ instinct to roost at the first sight of darkness, even if that darkness came from an artificial source like a covered bridge—the turkey was a fine long-distance walker. In her book More Than a Meal: The Turkey in History, Myth, Ritual, and Reality, Karen Davies writes, “The bird’s amiability, vigorous constitution, and long, strong legs made these drives possible.” Turkey Pardons Though Ronald Reagan was the first U.S. president to use the term pardon when sparing a turkey in 1987, the tradition of pardoning a bird at the White House may go back to Abraham Lincoln. According to a popular (and possibly apocryphal) story, the Lincoln family received a turkey as a gift for their Christmas dinner in 1863. They didn’t count on Tad, the president’s son, adopting the bird as a pet. Tad named him Jack and trained the turkey to follow him around the White House. When it came time to slaughter Jack, Tad petitioned his father for a reprieve and received it—in the form of an official letter that Tad was able to show the head chef. Today, a monument to this merciful moment stands in Hartford, Connecticut. Commissioned by the city’s Lincoln Financial Group, the turkey sculpture is part of a series commemorating the achievements of the firm’s namesake. But just what happens to a turkey after it’s pardoned by an American president? For years, they were sent to Mount Vernon, but the practice was suspended when staff said the birds’ size disrupted the historical accuracy of the site: The 50-pounders were a far cry from the smaller birds of the 1700s. The modern turkeys’ large size also means their post-pardon lives tend to be short. Bred to be plump and fattened with corn and soybeans, modern turkeys are too unhealthy to survive more than a few months past their pardon date. This led to some depressing coverage in 2001, when ABC News visited Virginia’s Kidwell Farm, then the home for pardoned turkeys. “We usually just find ’em and they’re dead,” a farmer said, noting that one died within days of reaching the farm. Today, the pardoned turkeys often head to agriculture or veterinary schools to receive care for the rest of their lives. Last year’s turkeys, Liberty and Bell, made a home at the University of Minnesota College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/new-discovery-pompeii-ancient-dna",
    "description": "A woman wearing an ornate golden bracelet holds a four-year-old child tenderly in her lap. The father and their son sit nearby. It’s the year 79, and the family is huddling under the staircase of their lavish three-story home in Pompeii, preparing for their last moments together. On the second day of the eruption of Italy’s Mount Vesuvius, the so-called Home of the Golden Bracelet is buried, and the family parishes, the mother still holding her child in her arms. At least that’s how the story has been told for the last 50 years. Now, a new paper, published in the journal Current Biology, reveals DNA evidence that is rewriting this popular story and several others. “Sometimes these more intuitive narratives aren't always the correct ones,” says coauthor Alissa Mittnik, who took part in the research while she was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University. “The stories behind these people might be way more complex.” In 1974, the two adults and two children were found on the ground floor, hiding under the staircase of their home. Like many victims of the catastrophe, impressions of their remains were preserved as plaster casts. These eerie casts depict what position people were in in their last moments—whether attempting to flee, clutching possessions, or shielding a loved one. The casts were so detailed you can see the outline of one of the child's eyelids—but despite the preserved physical details of those who died, much of their story remained unknown. Now, by analyzing ancient DNA extracted from small bone fragments preserved in 14 casts that are undergoing restoration, researchers have unearthed a wealth of new information about these people of the past. For example, that wasn’t a family in the house, at least not in the traditional sense. Genetic analysis showed the four individuals were all male—and all unrelated. “This is not the nuclear family of mother, father, and two children,” says Mittnik, who is now at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. “Now, there are countless other possibilities of who they could have been.” Two other casts long assumed to be of sisters, or mother and daughter, were also determined to include at least one genetic male. “This study illustrates how unreliable narratives based on limited evidence can be, often reflecting the worldview of the researchers at the time,” stated coauthor David Caramelli at Universita di Firenze in Italy, in a press release. Researchers also looked into the Pompeiians’ ancestry, revealing a diverse community. Most descended from recent immigrants from the eastern Mediterranean. Roman archaeologist Steven Ellis at the University of Cincinnati, who was not involved in the study, sees this as one of the most important findings of the new work. “We can start to imagine a more cosmopolitan kind of city,” he says. While archaeological evidence has already suggested Pompeii was a diverse, worldly community—based on what we know about their food, names, and jewelry—these genetic findings add a new level of confidence. “It’s quite a novel way of getting to an old question,” he says. The new research not only rewrites common misconceptions of the past—it provides a hint of what future analysis may reveal. Since the mid-18th century, two-thirds of Pompeii has been excavated. When excavations were halted in 1960, the secrets of the remaining third were left buried in ash. In 2017, necessary conservation efforts began on the city's perimeter, allowing for limited excavation of new areas. The digs revealed a fast-food restaurant and two new skeletons, among other discoveries. “They're exposing a little bit to protect a lot,” says Ellis, “and to provide longer-term protection for the city.” While unearthing the past is exciting, many scholars advocate for leaving a significant area buried for future generations of scientists to explore. This new paper is evidence that there is always more to learn from the excavations and artifacts of the past—including the plaster casts. It also is a lesson in the great value new technologies can provide, if we’re willing to wait. “What we're finding is that we now have new questions, new approaches, and new technologies to do some new work and to find out some new information,” says Ellis. “But those new questions are always going to be continuing, so it's good to have something for the future.” While genetic work has been ongoing in Pompeii prior to this study, working with ancient human DNA is particularly tricky, says Mittnik. It is easily contaminated by the DNA of modern humans who come in contact with it, including excavators and archaeologists. Also, this fragile DNA—which is best preserved in cold, arid conditions—is easily degraded in the Mediterranean climate, and was already exposed to extreme heat from the eruption. All together, this creates a challenging task. “We really had to wait until the methods were good enough to ensure that we can retrieve DNA that we can make sure is actually authentic, ancient DNA from these individuals,” says Mittnik. When it comes to deciding what to leave untouched in Pompeii, she adds, “I think it completely makes sense to keep our scientific descendants in mind.”",
