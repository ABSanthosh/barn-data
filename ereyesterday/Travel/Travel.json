    "description": "The lakeside resort of Zell am See is big on outdoor fun, hearty food and stunning viewsWe could feel the carefree spirit in the crisp air the moment we stepped off the train at Zell am See. It’s in the town’s DNA. Pleasure seekers have been coming to this lake and mountain resort in search of clean air, crystal waters and Alpine adventures ever since the railway connected what was then a mere village to Salzburg and beyond in 1875. We’d come to walk, bike a little, swim a bit and reward ourselves with Austrian cuisine – at a restorative, schedule-free pace.We passed bakeries, hiking shops and the Romanesque church in the old town on the way to our hotel, before joining the 10km tree-lined promenade that rings the lake. Waffle and ice-cream stands, terrace cafés, strollers and couples holding hands, the glistening lake… It felt like we had gone back in time. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Stockholm’s archipelago is a joy in summer but harder to get around at other times as ferries reduce their services. But that could change with the launch of a new trail linking 21 islandsOn this windless autumn Saturday, the landscape is curiously hushed. Occasionally, a tiny chorus of coal tits gathers to chat in the pines above my head, but otherwise it’s soundless, the muffled stillness willing me to slow my pace. As the track turns from soil to sand, I skitter over smooth grey rocks to reach a crescent of chalky powder. As I strip down to my swimsuit and slip into the shiveringly crisp water, the sun breaks through and I’m suddenly swimming through rhinestones, amazed to have the coastline to myself.I’m hiking, solo, two hours south of the Swedish capital, along the Stockholm Archipelago Trail, a 167-mile (270km) path that has been gradually opening, section by section, this summer before its official launch later this month. It came about thanks to a chance conversation between Marie Östblom, a project manager for the Stockholm Business Region, and Swimrun co-founder Michael Lemmel, and when all sections are completed later this month, the trail will run between Arholma in the north and Landsort in the south, linking 21 islands.

In 2001, the building at 200 S. 36th Street was dedicated to him and now houses the University's Fine Arts Department. Outside the building, there are silhouettes of all eight Addams Family members, created by Lindsay Falck from the School of Design. Originally in the Addams courtyard, they were later moved to the corner of 36th and Walnut. The Kelly Family Gates outside the Charles Addams Fine Arts Hall, designed by Mark Leuders in 2003, also honor Charles Addams with fifty-six bronze hands engaged in various artistic activities inspired by Thing T.

    "description": "Model ship making is an art almost as old as that of making regular-sized ships, as these models were often used to convince admirals and other investors into building the real deal. While most of the large ships have sunk now, many of the models can still be found across the world. However, the art has not died out and several places in the world still make these models. The Model Shipyard is one such a place. Hailing from a unsuspecting office building in Mossel Bay, the Model Shipyard is an interesting mix between museum and place of work. The setup is done in such a way that guests can come by and take a look at the process as well as see pictures of past ships that were made by the company. You won't find many ships on display, as they all go to their new owners once complete. But there is always one or two in the making.",
