    "description": "South of the Amalfi Coast is a rugged wonderland of quiet paths through chestnut woods and vineyards. It’s all perfect for contemplating ancient yarns, spotting wildlife and enjoying local fareIn the silence of the chestnut woods, rays of sunlight ignite the patches of pink cyclamen and crocus. There are fungi of various kinds dotted around, including one that is a perfect sphere of bright orange pushing its way up out of earth. I sit on a rock and after a while I hear a gentle grunting noise, the sort of contented chunter made by a snorer having a light snooze. It’s not me. A pair of wild boar are approaching, moving through the shadows, noses down, short tails flicking continuously. It’s a mother and baby, so close I can see the dust on their backs. I move my hand towards the camera, but wily Old Ma spots the movement and they take off at a blistering pace, charging downhill, bristling with indignation.I continue walking uphill, and after a mile or so stop at a paw print in a patch of mud. Large dog or wolf? There are no human boot marks that might accompany a canine. Nor is there anyone around to ask. Eventually, I reach a viewpoint on top of Monte Stella, the highest summit for many miles at 1,131 metres. Out west is the dark surface of the Tyrrhenian Sea where Odysseus reputedly battled his way home from Troy, narrowly surviving temptation by the dreaded Sirens at an island, Isola Licosa, just hidden from my view by the curve of the coastline. I can see as far as the distant ragged peninsula of Amalfi on the northern horizon but there are no ships in sight. I am alone. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/feb/26/walking-pilgrimage-thomas-hardys-dorset",
    "description": "My mother wrote about the meandering trails from the novelist’s cottage, through countryside loaded with literary references – now I’m following in her footstepsThe banks by the lane are white with snowdrops and a mistle thrush sings in the bare orchard. The writer Thomas Hardy grew up in the thatched cottage at the end of this track. His earliest poem, Domicilium, describes the house as it was in 1800 when his great-grandfather built it. The gardens were wilderness and the lane “a narrow path shut in by ferns”. This cottage, where Hardy wrote Far from the Madding Crowd, is the starting point for a 220-mile hike, the Hardy Way. I’ve walked round much of Dorset on this literary footpath, but I’m here now on a more personal pilgrimage.The last time I visited this cottage near Dorchester was with my mother, Kim Taplin, who died last year. This month, Dorset-based Little Toller publishes a new edition of her first book, The English Path. It’s about footpaths in English literature. Exploring the work of nearly 200 authors and artists, Kim shows the cultural importance of paths in connecting us to each other and to nature. Paths were crucial for work, love, worship and inspiration. “Without them,” she says, “Hardy could not have written, nor Constable painted, what he did.” Continue reading...",

    "title": "How Cold War Spying From Space Connected the Galaxy to Utah",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/space-capsules-from-cold-war-spying",
    "description": "Harold Mitchell watched from the cockpit of his plane as a spacecraft fell from the sky. Four thousand feet above him, the spacecraft glinted in the sun as it dangled from a parachute. Mitchell called out to the crew in the cargo hold—they had to get ready to catch it. The men, all from the U.S. Air Force, opened the back of the plane and extended a set of poles with a rope and hooks at the end. Mitchell flew them closer, and the parachute disappeared under the nose of the plane. A series of bangs like gunfire rang out as the parachute hit the rope, causing a series of shock-absorbing loops to snap apart. They had successfully caught the hurtling object. The crew then reeled in their catch and hauled it into the plane. Moments later, a gold-plated space capsule sat on the floor in front of them. The year was 1960, the capsule was called Discoverer 14, and it was one of the first of its kind. They didn’t know it at the time, but they had just opened the door for future scientists. A week earlier, Discoverer 13 had become the first object ever retrieved from Earth’s orbit when Navy divers pulled it out of the ocean near Hawai'i. Similar capsules would later become key tools for space exploration, returning astronauts and pieces of the solar system for study back on Earth. And eventually the Pacific Ocean would be replaced by the Utah desert. But the true intention behind the first of these spacecraft redelivered to Earth was actually for spying—a purpose that was hidden from the public for decades. After the mid-air catch of Discoverer 14, the capsule was secretly loaded into a plane in Hawaii, and shipped to Rochester, New York. An unmarked truck took the capsule to a darkened room in a secure facility. Using wrenches and ratchets, a team opened the capsule, revealing the deeply guarded secret inside: a large roll of Kodak film. Kodak workers inspected the film by feel in the dark. They processed it, carefully labeled the photographs, and handed them off to the CIA. The photographs contained images of airports, factories, construction sites, and more, deep within the borders of the Soviet Union. This was the CORONA project, which conducted reconnaissance using satellite-based cameras during the Cold War. Spying had just been taken into the Space Age. Launching rockets into space and catching returning capsules are both impossible to hide, so the U.S. Department of Defense publicly called the program “Discoverer,” said to be testing new spaceflight technologies. These early spying spacecraft “provided absolutely invaluable intelligence that was not obtainable by any other means,” says James David, curator of space history at the Smithsonian. Originally, the U.S. used planes for photographic reconnaissance. But in 1960, those flights stopped after the Soviets shot down a U-2 spy plane and captured pilot Francis Gary Powers. CORONA and its successors allowed the U.S. to keep eyes on the Soviet Union, and David says the spying spacecraft helped keep the Cold War from turning hot. Extraordinary measures were taken to keep the project secret. Engineers built the capsule with a special valve that was plugged with salt. If recovery planes or Navy divers failed to grab the capsule, the salt dissolved, sinking the spacecraft to the bottom of the Pacific. And while Harold Mitchell went on TV after his catch of the “Discoverer” capsule, the Kodak engineers processing the film had to keep quiet. “The word ‘Kodak’ was not supposed to be associated with any of these things,” says David McDowell, a former Kodak engineer. He and his coworkers had to travel incognito, and when they met with General Electric—the company that built the capsules—they were brought in the back door. They were not even allowed to tell their families about their work until the program was declassified in the 1990s. In the 1970s, CORONA was replaced by the GAMBIT and HEXAGON systems, which flew dozens of missions through the ’80s. GAMBIT and HEXAGON imagery is still mostly classified. “For some reason, they’re still spooky about how good the images were,” said Robert Shanebrook, another former Kodak employee. The programs were extremely successful, and buckets of film regularly fell from space for over 20 years. After the last HEXAGON spacecraft fell to Earth in 1984, capsule returns became more rare. Reconnaissance satellites began using digital imaging, and the U.S. replaced crewed capsules with the Space Shuttle in the early ’80s. Until SpaceX’s first Dragon spacecraft launched in 2010 carrying small satellites and a wheel of cheese, the Russian Soyuz was the only capsule that flew regularly. In fact, the U.S. didn’t return any capsules to Earth for almost two decades. But something else brought the need for the technology back. In September 2004, a helicopter pilot took to the skies above Utah, hoping to catch a capsule falling from space. Sandy Freund had just started working as an engineer at Lockheed Martin and eagerly awaited the catch. It was the final stage of the Genesis mission, NASA’s first attempt to bring a scientific sample back from space since the 1970s. The Lockheed-built capsule held tiny particles of solar material trapped in delicate wafers. “[Samples] can do so much more in the laboratories here on Earth than they can do on board a spacecraft,” says Freund. “They rewrite history books.” But something went wrong. The mistake had actually been made before Freund arrived at Lockheed, and even before the Genesis capsule launched three years earlier. A component involved in deploying the parachute was installed incorrectly. The parachute failed as the capsule fell through the atmosphere, and the spacecraft impacted the desert floor at a speed of over 100 mph. Scientists salvaged some samples from the wreckage, and Freund learned valuable lessons. She began studying ways to prevent similar failures, which she applied to later sample-return missions. One of these was Stardust, which successfully carried particles from comet Wild 2 back to Earth in 2006. Freund later joined the team of OSIRIS-REx, the NASA-led mission that brought back fragments from the asteroid Bennu in 2023. After struggling to open the capsule, they finally succeeded in January 2024. “You get a sense of pride from having just a small part in that,” says Freund. NASA is now hoping to bring back samples from Mars, which are already packed up and sitting on the Martian surface after being collected by the Perseverance rover. And developments in the private sector hint that we may see more capsules falling from the sky in coming years. In February 2024, Varda Space Industries announced that they had recovered their W-1 capsule from orbit at the Utah Test and Training Range, the same site where the Genesis and Stardust capsules fell to Earth. It turns out the Utah desert is an excellent place to conduct the catch, since it’s sparsely populated and there’s no salt water to potentially damage the materials. Varda is using the same methods in order to test systems to produce pharmaceuticals in space, since microgravity can enable production techniques that are difficult or impossible to accomplish on Earth. A few days after the recovery, Varda engineer Andrew McCalip posted a pair of pictures on social media. In the picture on the right, he stands next to the recovered W-1 capsule in Varda’s California factory. On the left, he stands next to the Discoverer 13 capsule, sitting in the Smithsonian. Those early Cold War spy missions pioneered the technologies used by Varda and NASA scientists to deepen our connection to space. Through their work, the Utah desert now links the Earth to the rest of the solar system. And if Varda and other companies with similar ambitions are successful, we may start to see more capsules like these falling from space on a regular basis—but maybe with fewer secrets inside. Maybe.",

    "description": "On July 9, 1864 as the 9:50 p.m. train from Fenchurch Street pulled into Hackney station at 10:11 pm, two bank clerks entered a first-class carriage and discovered it awash in blood—the scene of the world's first murder on a railway. Though neither the attacker nor the victim were present at the scene, the victim was discovered shortly after, unconscious and severely injured by the tracks between Hackney Wick and Bow Stations. Thomas Briggs, a nearly 70-year-old bank clerk, had boarded the train at Fenchurch Street, and during his journey fell victim to a brutal assault and robbery that left him mortally wounded.  Though Briggs’ gold watch and chain were missing, indicating a motive of robbery, the bloody carriage contained Briggs’ bag and stick and a single clue: a black beaver hat. This hat was recognized as belonging to Franz Muller by an acquaintance who also shared a photo of Muller. Soon after, a jeweler came forward with a description of a German man who matched the photo and had recently exchanged a gold chain—a chain later identified as belonging to Briggs. A warrant was immediately issued for Muller's arrest.  Though Muller had fled to New York, detectives followed, reaching the city three weeks ahead of Muller, who had taken a slower ship. Muller was apprehended, Briggs' watch in his possession, and extradited to England, where he was found guilty and publicly executed. Today, at 129 Cadogan Terrace in East London, a blue plaque remembers this dark chapter in railway history. The plaque marks the location of what was, at the time, the Mitford Castle pub, where the mortally wounded Briggs was carried after the attack.",
