    "description": "Walking and cycling tours, family holidays, great places to stay, blockbuster exhibitions and more launching this yearThe Cilento coast in Campania has long attracted Italian holidaymakers, but overseas visitors tend to head further north to the better-known Amalfi coast. That is starting to change – the Natural Adventure Company reports that UK Google searches for the Cilento coast are up 110% over the past 12 months. The company has run a self-guided walking holiday there since 2022 (from £915 for eight nights’ B\u0026B and three dinners). Continue reading...",

    "description": "The team behind the much-loved restaurants explore the places that inspired their ‘Bombay comfort food’ dishesWhen Shamil Thakrar talks about Bombay, he has a favourite word: palimpsest, “something reused or altered but still bearing visible traces of its earlier form”. In fact, Shamil has been (fondly) banned from using it by his cousin Kavi, with whom he co-founded Dishoom, the hugely successful group of Bombay-inspired restaurants, 15 years ago.But palimpsest is an apt word to describe Bombay – or Mumbai, as it is known internationally – the port city on India’s west coast, where multicultural influences eternally trickle in without erasing the layers of what came before. Two eras of imperial rule, two waves of Persian migration, a Hindu majority and a large Muslim community, people from every Indian state, language and ethnicity rubbing shoulders with one another, Maharatis, Gujeratis, Punjabis, Goans; 19th-century gothic architecture alongside art deco, neoclassical opposite mid-century, and the onward march of new development along every major road. And it is absolutely its own place, of itself: “Everything has coalesced here and become ‘Bombayified’,” says Shamil, as we wander around Colaba, the southernmost tip of the old city.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/icherisheher-cat-house",
    "description": "Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, is a feline paradise not unlike Istanbul. There are stray cats everywhere, a cuddly symbol of the city. In the heart of its old town stands the grand Chain Building, part of which pays subtle homage to the local cat population. Easy to miss if you don't know it's there, the so-called Cat's House of Icherisheher is a work of art consisting of two faux windows and sandstone sculptures: one with a pair of children, a boy and a girl, looking up with a kitten, and another with a trio of cats. The names of this installation vary, but typically referred to as either the \"Monument to Lovers and Cats\" or Pişiklər və Uşaqlar (\"Cats and Children\"). Some locals and tour guides claim that there is a sad legend behind this artwork, a story about a strict judge who once lived at the house with his two children and cats. According to it, one day, a cat fell out of the window, and the judge punished his children by pushing them out of the window. For his cruelty, the judge was then cursed for eternity. The artwork, however, is simply a monument to Baku and its beloved cats. It was created by sculptor Tarverdi Guliyev in 1994, commissioned by Eldar Mikayilzade, a renowned carpet artist whose designs have also been featured on Azerbaijani manat banknotes.",

    "description": "Pere Lachaise Cemetery covers an impressive 110 acres. In this vast expanse one will find many monuments and memorials dedicated to both heroes and casualties of various conflicts. One such unsettling shrine, which can be found on the exterior wall that surrounds the burial ground, depicts men and women crying out in agony. The images of the slaughtered are rather ethereal, appearing as ghostly figures emerging from the stonewall. This commemoration goes by many names. The one that is most often cited is 'The Victims of Revolutions,' however, it is frequently misidentified as \"The Wall of the Fédérés\" or Communard's Wall. In the later part of the 19th century, nearly 150 political objectors, made up of both men and women, where lined up against this wall in the burial ground and massacred. These martyred activists, referred to as Communards, were resisting the forces of the Franco-Prussian War. Their unpretentious monument can be located in the south-eastern corner of the cemetery.  French sculptor Paul Moreau-Vauthier (1871 - 1936), who happens to be laid to rest inside the cemetery, repurposed the original bullet-ridden stones from the massacre. His depiction of the travesty also heavily emulates the events, with a woman standing in front to protect those behind from the ensuing gunfire. On the lower left-hand side is a quote from the French author and novelist Victor Hugo (1802 - 1885)\" \"What we ask of the future, what we want from it, is justice, not vengeance!\"",
