    "description": "Pull on your walking boots and immerse yourself in magnificent scenery on these long-distance trails, chosen by our tipstersThe best ever walk I’ve been on was actually two weeks of walking, along the GR11 on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees from Candanchú to La Guingueta d’Àneu. We got the train to France, packed food for a week and restocked half way, and wild camped each night. So not only was it the best trip ever, it was also cheap and eco-friendly. Each evening we’d camp by a lake, and start our day with an (incredibly bracing) dip. It is so incredibly beautiful and peaceful, and there’s lots of friendly refuges along the way if you want a chat, a bed and hot food. The route is challenging, but doesn’t require any specialist equipment. At the end, all I wanted to do was carry on walking. Rachel Continue reading...",

    "description": "Language exchange holidays are wasted on the young. I had a great time with my host – sans youthful embarrassment about my accent – and more adults are doing the sameOn the terrace of a brasserie on Rue Cler, a chic Parisian market street, I’m chatting over a tongue-lubricating glass of Sancerre with Sébastien de Lavalette, 33, a French travel company head and my language exchange partner.Sébastien compliments my French accent, or at least I think he does: “You don’t have that mouth-full-of-bread accent that many British people have”, as I order in my middle-of-the-road restaurant French. Sébastien, who was raised in Paris but whose family hails from Périgord, reminisces about his teenage foreign language exchanges in Spain. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Located just outside the medieval coastal city of Piran, Slovenia, along the country’s Adriatic coastline, is the Sečovlje Saltpans Natural Park. The park is one of the last saltpans in the Mediterranean, where salt is harvested by hand using a method going back centuries. People and nature began co-creating these salt pans as early as the Roman period. By the Middle Ages, these saltpans were in frequent use and ruins of medieval workers' homes can be seen in the southern part of the park, known as the Fontanigge. The Fontanigge saltpans were still in use as recently as the 1960s. The northern section of the Sečovlje Saltpans Natural Park, known as the Lera, still produces salt today. In the Lera, workers still use wooden scrapers to rake the salt into piles, a method that has remained virtually unchanged since the Middle Ages. The arduous process yields four different kinds of salt: first salt, traditional salt, Piran salt, and fleur de sel or the \"salt flower.\" The Sečovlje Saltpans Natural Park is also rich in biodiversity. Brine shrimp swim in the water and nearly 300 species of birds come here every summer to nest. A variety of plants also thrive in the saline-rich conditions. The gorgeous Sečovlje Saltpans Natural Park in Slovenia is a natural and historical marvel and well worth a visit. Be sure to grab some local salt!",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lake-atanasovsko",
    "description": "Outside the ancient Thracian city of Nessebar, Bulgaria, is a picturesque pink lake: Lake Atanasovsko. Just a stone’s throw from the Black Sea, the lake is one of the few places in the world where visitors can enjoy a dip in a pink lake. Lake Atanasovsko covers about 28 square miles, but only a small section of the lake is actually pink. Located near the Burgas Saltpans (spelled Бургаски солници in Bulgarian), the pink hue in this part of the lake is likely thanks to Dunaliella salina, a microalgae that thrives in the high-salinity environment. This alga produces red-colored carotenoids that give the water its distinctive color. The pink water and lake mud are both thought to have healing properties, and many bathers cover themselves in mud before cleaning off in the rosy waters. In addition to its Instagram-ready pink waters, Lake Atanasovsko is a critical habitat for rare and endangered bird species. Since the lake doesn't freeze in winter, many waterfowl, such as Dalmatian pelicans, mallards, ospreys, and white herons, wait out the cooler months here. The lake is also Bulgaria’s largest salt producer, and workers harvest some 40,000 tons of sea salt here annually. With its pink waters, saltpans, and rich biodiversity, Lake Atanasovsko is an unmissable, little-known gem of the Bulgarian coast.",
