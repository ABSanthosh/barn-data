    "description": "Less than an hour from Rome, Nepi and the northern Lazio region is an under-the-radar cultural and historic hub – and councillors are working with the local community to welcome more visitorsStanding on the top of the huge fortress, looking over the rolling landscape, it’s easy to see why Nepi was a prized possession for Roman emperors, medieval popes and Renaissance dynasties. Defended on two sides by river channels and with a commanding position over rich agricultural land and abundant water springs, the town, less than an hour north of Rome, has been a witness and a contributor to history for over two millennia.Much of that history has been marked by intrigue, violence and war. Most famously, Nepi was ruled by the 15th-century Spanish cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, who gave it to his daughter Lucrezia after he became Pope Alexander VI. Lucrezia stayed at the fortress (today known as the Borgia Castle) following the murder of her second husband in 1500. These days, things are a lot more laid-back. I’m sitting outside the Bar Centrale in the town’s elegant Piazza del Comune, facing the imposing town hall, built on the orders of the Farnese family after they took up residence here in the mid-1500s. With me is Paolo Paoletti, who has just been elected for a second term as Nepi’s councillor responsible for culture and tourism. While I sip an espresso and tuck into a cream-filled pastry, Paolo tells me about his plans to develop tourism here and across the Tuscia region. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Over nine million trees have been planted in the east Midlands’ National Forest, where mines once churned up the land, offering great cycling routes that explore villages and industrial heritageYou couldn’t make it up. As early autumn darkness deepened around Whistlewood Common – tealights a-flicker, guitars twanging around the campfire – I found myself sitting between Peter Wood and Gill Forrester. It was a pincer movement of nominative determinism: Wood, a woodworker and teacher of heritage crafts; Forrester, community and wellbeing manager at the National Forest. Both – along with members of the Whistlewood community – were singing the praises of planting trees.The National Forest is the Midlands’ great rewilding. In 1991 this ambitious environmental project launched to green-up an area of 200 square miles and connect the remnants of two ancient forests: Needwood in Staffordshire and Charnwood in Leicestershire. Back then, scarred by years of coal mining and clay extraction, this was one of the least-wooded parts of Britain – only 6% forest-covered. But in summer 2024, having planted 9.5m trees, the National Forest hit 25%. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/peljesac-bridge",
    "description": "This Croatian bridge may be one of the most politically controversial bridges ever built. Its existence owes much to both the way in which Yugoslavia was subdivided and the necessity for Croatia to comply with the requirements of the Schengen Convention. Pelješac Bridge provides an uninterrupted link between the southeastern Croatian semi-exclave and the rest of the country. It allows vehicles to bypass the short coastal strip at Neum, which is part of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The bridge spans the sea channel between the northern Croatian mainland and the Pelješac Peninsula, allowing the possibility of driving entirely through Croatian territory and bypassing any border crossings. Because of the nature of Schengen area controls, this avoids at least three border checkpoints. The Croatian and Bosnian border forces previously had to make extensive checks upon each exit and entry into and out of their respective territories, resulting in long delays. The bridge was proposed in 1997 and the planning stage began in 2000. Initially several Bosnian politicians  bitterly opposed the building of the bridge, originally planned to be only 115 feet high above the water, because that would have made it impossible for large ships to enter the harbor at Neum—even though the harbor can't actually accommodate  ships of that size. Bosnian legislators wrote a letter demanding that Croatia should \"stop attacking the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a maritime state and stop all activities on building an illegal and politically violent bridge project.\" Much of the bad feeling was probably left over from the conflict between ethnically Croat separatists (supported by the newly created state of Croatia) and Bosnians in the 1990s (the so-called \"war within a war\"). The Bosnians had previously demanded control of the port of Ploče in exchange for allowing Croatia to link up with the Pelješac enclave via 12 miles of highway. Following a change in design, Croatia stated that the expected height of the bridge of 180 feet would allow all ships to using the existing sea route to pass under the bridge, and that any ship taller than that which intended to dock at a port in Bosnia and Herzegovina could dock instead at Ploče. Controversy seemed to rage until 2017 but eventually the tender for construction was let to a Chinese company for 278 million euros with the majority coming from the EU cohesion fund despite objections from Bosnia. The final design (by Slovenian engineer Marjan Pipenbaher), as constructed, had an overall length  of 7,887 feet It comprises 13 individual spans, seven of which are cable-stayed. The two pylons around the main navigation channel are 322 feet above sea level and 728 feet above the seabed. It is a beautiful bridge, with a beautiful backdrop, but seems a very expensive solution to a problem which will be solved when Bosnia joins the EU  in a few years time. Meanwhile it  provides an attractive \"punctuation\" to the drive from Split to Dubrovnik.",

    "title": "Oxford Huguenot Fort in Oxford, Massachusetts",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oxford-huguenot-fort",
    "description": "Along Main Street in Oxford, Massachusetts, near the historic district is a small historical marker nestled among the bushes and leaves. It describes a Huguenot settlement on the top of Mayo’s Hill, which can be reached by the aptly named Huguenot Road directly next to it. The settlement in question can be found little over a mile up the road. Unlike many other historic New England settlements and villages, no buildings or homes from the period remain. Instead, a small field, a few stone structures, some information, and a lone monument are all that remains of a fort built by French Protestant refugees whose story would later end in tragedy.  When King Henry IV of France signed the Edict of Nantes in April 1598, the Protestant Huguenots were finally given the right to worship freely in the predominantly Catholic country after much discrimination and chaos of the 16th century. However, in October 1685, King Louis XIV issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, which revoked the previous edict and made French Protestants vulnerable to persecution and violence. Gabriel Bernon was a prominent Huguenot merchant who fled the country in 1686 and purchased some land in Massachusetts from investor Robert Thompson in London, who in turn previously purchased the land from Nipmuc spiritual leader Wullumahchein also known as Black James.  Bernon and roughly 40 other refugees he met in London arrived in Boston in 1688. While Bernon lived in the city with his family, the other settlers walked to the Oxford area on foot to establish their new home. Shortly after arriving, King William’s War broke out between England and France the same year which was the North American theater of the Nine Year’s War in Europe. The settlers built a fort with construction finished in the early 1690s. The settlers managed to live in relative peace with other colonists and their Native American neighbors, but tragedy struck on August 25, 1696, when a small Nipmuc war party attacked the homestead of an English family not far from the French settlement. John Johnson alongside his three children were killed with only his wife and brother surviving in an event now-called the Johnson Massacre. As the Nipmuc were allied with the French, tensions arose and fearing an attack from both the English and their respective Native American allies, the Huguenots abandoned the fort not long after the massacre. Bernon himself also left Boston after the settlement was abandoned going to Rhode Island. Several years later the original settlers attempted to return to Oxford and rebuilt the settlement but with the outbreak of Queen Anne’s War in 1702, hostilities resumed and the fort was abandoned yet again, this time permanently.  As the years went by, the Huguenot fort fell into decay being reclaimed by the wilderness and its building materials most likely being repurposed by the English settlers until only a few stone structures remained. In 1881, a group of women living in Oxford formed the Huguenot Memorial Society and in 1884, the descendants of Bernon and the commander of the fort Andre Sigournay dedicated a granite monument which stands to this day inside a small park. The story of the Huguenot settlement is an interesting albeit tragic one of refugees who escaped persecution and violence in their homeland only to find warfare and tragedy in their new home. As Massachusetts was predominantly colonized by the English, French settlements are a rarity with most French history in New England being found north around Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. If you have an interest a relatively forgotten aspect of Massachusetts history regarding French settlements, the Huguenot Fort is with worth a visit.",
