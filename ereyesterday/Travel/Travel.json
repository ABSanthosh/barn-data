    "description": "Ghost-hunters will love the grisly tales that cling to these medieval manors, ancient burial grounds and chilling castles, chosen by a gothic horror novelist – and all are open to visitorsBlickling Hall is a handsome house that boasts gothic architecture and plenty of atmosphere. However, the old Tudor house that once stood here is what truly made its ghostly name. It is said that Anne Boleyn continues to haunt her childhood home, carrying her own severed head as she walks the corridors. Sir John Fastolf, an English soldier and the owner of Blickling estate in the 15th century (believed to be the inspiration for Shakespeare’s Falstaff) is also said to haunt Blickling. Today, visitors can roam numerous museums, stay in charming cottages or explore the 1,600 acres of woodland, parkland and farmland. nationaltrust.org.uk Continue reading...",

I was a student in Warsaw, and spent my savings on a train ticket to Berlin – not for migrant work, but to see the 200 masterpieces at the Neue Nationalgalerie on loan from the New York Museum of Modern Art.In 2017, while in the US, I rushed to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The very first painting I saw was a personal delight because the artist was a woman, Paulina Ołowska, and Polish. Continue reading...",

    "description": "In a city famous for its cemeteries, one of the strangest is easy to miss. Its tombs are scattered in locations that seem improbable for interments: an antique shop, an old hotel, a museum. But these tombs have never held human occupants. Standing less than a foot tall, each is a meticulously handcrafted miniature facsimile of one of New Orleans’s famous above-ground mausoleums. Launched in 2017, NOLA Tiny Tombs offers an unconventional (and free) self-guided wander through the “City that Care Forgot,” leading the curious to places of historical and cultural interest. Each Tiny Tomb is a tiny work of art, sculpted and handpainted by artist Lady Delaney, whose work blends art, history, and immersive elements, and whose other offerings include puzzle games and social media treasure hunts. When creating the tombs, Delaney conducted extensive research in the New Orleans cemeteries, modeling her sculptures on their architecture, but also incorporating references to New Orleans multiculturalism, weaving German, French, Irish, African, and Chocktaw inspiration into the tombs’ names and stories. Players are invited to imagine the character within each tomb through a corresponding website “archive” on Delaney’s website. The list of Tiny Tomb locations is updated yearly as new sites are added or tombs are moved.",

There are thought to be just under 4,000 tombs in the area, dating from the 13th to the 7th centuries BC. The area is of archaeological significance, and it is also a nature reserve, Riserva Naturale Orientata Pantalica).
