There’s a regal air about this venerable ski resort in the Veneto region’s north-west, epitomised by its classy Corso Italia, a pedestrianised thoroughfare and favourite passeggiata meeting place.

    "description": "Whether you’re into proper winter adventures, such as snorkelling in Iceland, or just a bit of après-ski, our readers’ tips include something for everyoneWaking up to a pink Arctic sunrise over endless fir trees from my bunk on the overnight train from Stockholm to Abisko was the perfect start to a winter adventure. The STF Abisko Turiststation served as our base for every snow-related activity that you can imagine: I tried snowshoeing, husky sled driving and cross-country skiing. Equally enjoyable was warming up by one of the many fireplaces and gazing out at the beautiful frozen lake. And, due to the location where a climate phenomenon results in some of the clearest skies in Europe, it was also a wonderful place to watch the northern lights. Scandinavia is famously expensive but staying in the clean, comfortable dorm and cooking in the well-equipped kitchen helped with the costs.Pippa Continue reading...",

    "description": "The Grand Mosque of Mopti, also known as Komoguel Mosque, is a prime example of Sahelian and Niger Valley architecture that stands 15 meters tall and is made out of mud brick. This mosque was built in the 1930s, on the site of an older mosque that had been built in the early 20th century. The construction project was led by M. Cocheteaux, the French Resident Administrator of the Mopti region, who based the design on the Great Mud Mosque of Djenné, which is located about 50 miles to the southwest. Maintenance of this historic mosque is a community effort. Every year, people come together to refresh the structure's covering with a new layer of mud and rice straw. Some are locals, but others travel long distances to take part in the work. In 2009, the Grand Mosque of Mopti was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.",

    "description": "The name Miguel Hernández is applied to numerous structures and institutions around Alicante and Elche on Spain's Costa Blanca. These include the airport serving Alicante and the university based in Elche. Hernández was one of the most important poets (amongst many poets and artists) who fought, wrote, and worked for the Republican government during the Spanish Civil War.  After the war, Hernández was not able to flee Spain like many others who had fought against the fascist regime. He was arrested and imprisoned. Years of fighting and poor treatment had left him weak, and Hernandez died in 1942, after succumbing to tuberculosis while in Alicante Prison. He was just 31 years old. Since 1977, close to Hernández's childhood home (now itself a museum), the streets of San Isidro, a suburb of Orihuela, have been adorned with murals commemorating many aspects of the life, works, and death of Miguel  Hernández, the local boy who became a hero. Some of the works are by renowned street artists. The centerpiece is a street art version of Picasso's Guernica. The suburb has adopted the title of \"open-air museum.\" While some show signs of age, others are regularly maintained and updated. The effect is magnificent and a sight not to be missed.",
