    "description": "Portugal’s greenest region, an Algarve food truck and a monastery stay on the Camino de Santiago are among our tipsters’ highlightsChus, who owns the local bar where I used to live in Galicia, shuts every September and decamps to Portugal. This entails a journey of 10 miles to the seaside town of Moledo. On his recommendation we caught the ferry across the wide estuary and reached Moledo within 20 minutes. The town beach is sheltered by a fortress island and Monte de Santa Trega. It’s popular with Spaniards who can’t resist the lower prices on this side. Moledo has a long season because it’s a haven for kitesurfers. Think Donegal with warm weather. Chus recommended Hotel Porta do Sol (doubles from about €110). As with most things, he was right. Well-appointed and unpretentious. A bit like my old local.Tom Continue reading...",

    "description": "A wave of immigration during the communist years has seen a slow burn for Vietnamese food – from beef noodles to green rice ice-cream – in the Czech Republic’s capitalAn older Asian woman is hunched over a gas burner serving noodles, a young couple in the distance shuffle piously into a tiny Buddhist temple, and a perpetual gaggle of families emerge from a Vietnamese supermarket armed with giant sacks of rice. It is a scene as authentically Vietnamese as I could expect to find. But I am not in Vietnam or even Asia. I am in Prague.Sapa, or Little Hanoi as it is affectionately known, is the hub of the Czech Republic capital’s Vietnamese community, and is a far cry from the spires, dumplings and beer-sploshed splendour of the historical centre. Tucked inconspicuously on its outskirts, this city within a city is where the nation’s Vietnamese people come to stock up on spices, eat plates of bun cha or sell inordinate amounts of large, fluffy geese.

    "title": "The Cyclone in Brooklyn, New York",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-cyclone",
    "description": "The Coney Island Cyclone, built in Brooklyn in 1927,  was the brainchild of two Russian immigrant brothers, Jack and Irving Rosenthal. It was built near the site of the nation’s first commercially successful coaster, the 1884 Switchback Railway. The Rosenthal brothers continued as innovators in the amusement industry, managing and later owning the successful Palisades Amusement Park in Bergen County, New Jersey. The Cyclone roller coaster would go on to outlive all of its rival Golden Age coasters.  The Cyclone was declared a New York City landmark in 1988, along with the Statue of Liberty, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the World Trade Center. In 1991, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today the Cyclone is the only operational wooden roller coaster left on Coney Island and one of the last Golden Age rollers in the world.   The Cyclone is classified as a “gravity ride of the wooden track twister type.” A chain carries the three 4,000-pound, eight-person cars up to the first and highest plunge of 85 feet. After the initial drop, the cars then travel on their own momentum for the duration of the ride. The little cars speed along 2,640 feet of track, twisting through 6 turns and 12 drops. Riders are subjected to 3.75 g of force as the cars approach speeds of up to 60 miles per hour. It’s all over in just a minute and fifty seconds. On its annual opening day, the Cyclone celebrates with speeches, dedications and a traditional egg cream christening of the front car by Brooklyn’s Borough President. The park offers free admission for the first 100 Cyclone riders, with some people even queueing up the night before to be the first to ride. There have been so many tales told about the Cyclone that it is sometimes hard to tell fact from fiction. Famous American aviator Charles Lindbergh has been quoted as saying that his ride on the Cyclone was more thrilling than his historic first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean. (Whether that was true or not, it did make for great publicity.)",

    "description": "A catafalque is a decorated wooden framework that supports the coffin of a distinguished person during a funeral. But the catafalque in the local church in La Torre de Esteban Hambrán, Spain is more than that. It is a most unique example of funerary art from the Baroque era. It is the only example in the world of this kind of funerary monument. This impressive piece of art is a perfect example of the Spanish Baroque style and at the same time a reminder that death awaits us all. This incredible piece of funerary art was lost for decades. Back in 1936, it was removed from the main nave of the temple and hidden in some sort of warehouse within the church tower so that it would not be damaged during the Spanish Civil War. It was hidden so well that it was not found until 1985 when during renovation work of the Santa María Magdalena church a group of workers came across it. After some restoration work, it was finally exposed in November of 1985, resuming the tradition of only exposing it during the month of November. The catafalque, which the local town hall claims has an unidentified author, was created in 1753 and belongs to the Brotherhood of the Holy Souls. It has a three-sided semi-hexagonal shape with a height of 5.30 meters and a length of 9.60 meters. The structure is embellished with five levels' worth of panels of oil on canvas paintings. All of the paintings allude to death and many of them include a short, sarcastic funerary poem.",
