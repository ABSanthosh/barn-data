    "description": "A path in the Madonie natural park once used by itinerant friars takes present-day hikers on mountain trails through a terrain rich in wildlifeDespite walking for three days, we’ve seen no one. Not a single hiker, dog walker or shepherd. Instead, golden eagles have circled lazily overhead, stags have boldly held our gaze, and rare blue butterflies have flitted around our booted feet. The silence here is deep and dense, broken only by birdsong.This is the Madonie national park, also known as the Sicilian Alps, home to many of the island’s highest mountains and rarest plants. It’s a landscape of 200 million-year-old rocks, rich in fossils. Of raptors and the tiniest of songbirds. Of wild boar, fallow deer and porcupines. Of cyclamen and crocuses. Of the largest holly trees on the planet, and of 65 varieties of orchid. A landscape that is void of tourists, ramblers and Sicilians. For anyone in search of wilderness, solitude and sunshine, I can’t think of a better place. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Riding and equestrian wellness sessions gave me the chance to connect with these deeply intuitive animals on a farmstay in the beautiful South Downs national parkOn a farm in West Sussex, I’m standing next to a handsome piebald Irish cob. Jenny is close to 16 hands, with stocky feathered legs, a flowing mane and gentle demeanour. I’m quite wary of horses, but as I watch her belly expanding slowly as she breathes, and notice her long eyelashes and velvet-soft nose, I feel entranced and completely relaxed. I’m at Westerlands, a regenerative farm in Graffham, in the South Downs national park, for a back-to-nature experience, staying in a new cabin and sampling an “equestrian wellness” session. Run by stable manager and equine behaviourist Elly Middleton, with wellness coach Gemma Peterson, the monthly workshops offer people the chance to spend time with horses, slow down and recharge (they can be tailored and booked privately, too).“We can learn a lot from horses, they are masters of mindfulness and deeply intuitive,” says Elly. “The farm’s whole ethos is about healing in nature. Just being with a horse can have therapeutic benefits, teaching us wellbeing techniques, such as how to be in the moment.” Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-frijoleria",
    "description": "Beans are the unsung heroes of Oaxacan cuisine, grown together with different squashes and corn on a milpa, the traditional intercropped plot. Stewed with avocado leaves or epazote and served over rice, filling tamales or tortas or topping tlayudas, they are indispensable but rarely celebrated all on their own.  Amicar Hernandez and Paulina Rovilla opened this legume-centric spot near Museo Rufino Tamayo to give frijoles their much-deserved share of the spotlight. Their other mission? To bring back affordable family meals in this city where tourism is driving up restaurant prices.  This cheery spot, bright with papel picada and posters of corn, is dominated by giant earthenware ollas (pots) holding different bean stews with whimsical names, slow-cooked over wood fire by Sagraria Carvajal, the restaurant’s Zapotec chef.  A dish of refried black beans topped with broken up chicharron called “difuntos” (deceased) is her homage to a specialty served to mourners at wakes in her village. For a stew called “colágeno” she simmers black beans with gelatinous pigs feet until unctuous and collagen rich—a popular Oaxacan hangover cure.  Another pot might contain pinkish-brown bayo beans cooked short of forever with sausage, bacon, pork chop, and ham—in a kind of Oaxacan feijoada—to be eaten with squirts of lime and sharp pickles. For something more cholesterol-virtuous, Carvajal prepares a dish called “fit” with black beans, an anise-y wild herb called hierba de conjejo, corn masa dumplings, and zero animal protein.  Frijoleria sources its seasonal heirloom beans from traditional farmers in the area of San Miguel Tanichico Zaachila known for its milpas. The tortillas are made by a special artisan at the 20 de Noviembre market, and to foster a community spirit the owners support local musicians and wrestlers. Don’t be surprised if a character in a lucha libre cape and mask sits at the next table.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blanco-family-museum",
    "description": "In 1978, Jose ‘Pitok’ Blanco, a renowned Angono born muralist, and his six children held an art exhibit at the National Museum of the Philippines in Manila. Two years later, the family opened the Blanco Family Museum. Eventually, their seventh child became an artist, and Pitok’s wife, Loreto ‘Loring,’ belatedly picked up her brush and joined the family. The museum showcases the evolution of the Blanco family as artists, and displays all their work, as well as various awards the family received from both local and international bodies.  Pitok taught his children the basics early on but allowed them to develop their own styles. According to one of the sons, the family maintained daily scheduled painting sessions, helping hone their skills. The prolific family embarked on painting excursions around the world, resulting in diverse and interesting paintings, which is apparent when you compare of each of their works when visiting the museum. Pitok’s masterpiece, the ‘Angono Fisherman’s Festival,’ is a large-scale canvas depicting the faces of over a hundred townsfolk. It garnered admiration for its impressive breadth and details, as Pitok spent years visiting his neighbors’ homes to sketch their faces. Pitok and his family all appear within this scene.",
