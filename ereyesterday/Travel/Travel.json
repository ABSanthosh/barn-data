    "description": "Saved from tourist development by a ‘favourite daughter of Andalucía’, Cabo de Gata is a spectacular national park perfect for an adventure on footIf you study a map of Spain, in the south-east corner you’ll see a strip of empty space along the edge of the Mediterranean. It contains no major towns and barely any roads. Its coastline is equally barren – no ports or resorts; just a few tiny villages tucked away in intriguingly named coves – “raven”, “coal”, “bitter water”. This patch of emptiness is the Cabo de Gata-Níjar national park, a protected haven of desert wilderness on the edge of Europe.Having been forced to cancel an expedition to the Algerian Sahara earlier in the year, this park appears to be the answer to my yearning for the arid warmth and stark beauty of desert travel. Zooming in on the satellite view, a network of paths appears, suggesting a walking route of around 40 miles (64km) – from the Cabo itself, up the coast, along the cliffs, to the beach town of Agua Amarga. My husband, a keen Iberophile and relentless explorer of España vacia (literally, empty Spain) is always up for a wilderness adventure, so we get in the van and head south. Continue reading...",

Today, it is an inspiring exploration of the universeThe sun warms my face as I pause between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies to gaze at the rolling hills of Dumfries and Galloway beyond. I am not, surprisingly enough, in outer space. I’m at the Crawick Multiverse, a cosmos-themed land art installation in the south of Scotland that was built on the site of an old open-cast coal mine and is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year.The galaxies here are huge, spiralling mounds of earth, their perimeters reaching out towards one another but never quite touching.

    "description": "Ulus Victory Monument is a landmark located in the Ulus district of Ankara. Designed by Henrich Krippel, the monument was erected to commemorate the victory of Turkish War of Independence under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Inaugurated on November 24, 1927, the Victory Monument is one of the earliest monuments in Turkey's republican era. It features Mustafa Kemal Atatürk on his horse, Sakarya, at the center. Two soldiers are depicted on the front side of the monument, one of whom appears to be gesturing to his friends, inviting them into battle. On the back side, a Turkish woman carries a cannonball, which references the efforts of Turkish women in the War of Independence. Ulus Victory Monument was strategically placed in the Ulus Square to face the old parliament building, ensuring that visiting diplomats would see the monument.",

    "description": "The Harmony Society, a utopian community whose members believed the second coming of Christ would happen in their lifetimes, used this burying ground from 1803 to 1815. More than 100 Harmonists were buried at this site, but only one marker is easily located — that of Johannes Rapp, son of society founder George Rapp. As for the others, some historians conclude that the Harmonists believed their recognition would be found in heaven, so their graves in Pennsylvania did not need to be marked. The Society eventually moved to Old Economy Village in nearby Beaver County, where a second Harmonist cemetery became the burial place for 594 members of the community. In 1869, after the society's move, the stone wall at the original cemetery and unusual pivoting stone gate were added.",
