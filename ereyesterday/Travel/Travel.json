    "description": "The Galician city on the Atlantic coast has the EU’s largest fishing port, which provides its many bars and restaurants with a spectacular trawl of oysters, clams and musselsRocks thrashed by Atlantic waves have famously bestowed names such as “end of the world” and “coast of death” on Galicia, Spain’s north-western region. But there is a calmer, more intimate side to this coastline, that of the many rias (inlets). Legend has it that they resulted from the imprint of God’s hand when he made the world, and, temptingly, they nurture superlative shellfish. This lures me to Vigo, the largest fishing port in the EU, which spills down a hillside into a sheltered estuary lined with marinas, industrial docks, jetties, a fishing port and a cruise terminal.The magic formula is the combination of fresh river water and salty seawater, which creates a nutrient-rich paradise for succulent crustaceans and cephalopods. I soon learn, too, that Vigueses are joined at the hip to the sea – and have been for centuries. Passion for el mar rules: “We are all men of the sea,” as one local tells me, and trawler-loads of ocean fish join shellfish on the plates of Vigo’s many taverns, tapas bars and restaurants.

    "description": "Having missed out in my youth, I thought that was that – until I took a revelatory trip with my sons. We’re going again this yearYouth might not be wasted on the young, but for the longest time I thought Interrailing was. When I was a student, as the 1980s became the 1990s, many of my friends took the opportunity to discover Europe by train and they all returned with amazing stories of discovery. But for long-forgotten reasons, it was something I was always going to do but never actually got round to. And then suddenly I was in my late 20s and reluctantly resigned myself to never doing it, having been reliably informed by so many people that it was an opportunity only open to those under the age of 26.Fast forward a few decades to spring 2023 and I’m trying to decide where to take my teenage children for our first holiday in five years – a gap caused largely, but not wholly, by the pandemic. My most memorable childhood holiday had come in 1981 when, over the course of a few days, my dad drove my family and our caravan from Nottingham to Pisa. I still remember the incredible feeling of my horizons broadening overnight. I’d love to give my children a similar experience, except I don’t drive.Phil Mongredien is a production editor on Guardian Opinion and Long Reads Continue reading...",

    "description": "By the 1980s, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had benefitted from decades of economic growth that left it wealthier than any time before or since. Good trade relationships with the West created a consumer culture found in no other communist country at the time. The Republic of Croatia, being among the most industrialized parts of the federation, became especially wealthy, and quite a few older people there still feel \"Yugo-nostalgia\" to this day. The Zagreb 80s Museum is a house museum that showcases what a typical apartment in the city looked like at the time, including many of the foreign and domestic goods families would have had access to. Some may be surprised at the sheer variety of such items, including Atari and Commodore 64 video game consoles, casino games, and even early personal computers. And unlike most other museums, this one actually allows visitors to touch the displays.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/republican-lamppost-at-the-royal-palace",
    "description": "In March 1939, Spain was in turmoil. After almost three years, the country's vicious Civil War was coming to an end, and, on April 1, 1939, the fascist dictator Francisco Franco declared victory over the Republican forces backing the country's democratically elected government, known as the Second Spanish Republic. Franco's new government set out to erase all of the symbols of the previous republican government. Some, however, managed to survive in plain sight, such as an unassuming lamppost at a corner of the Royal Palace in Madrid. Nearly all of the lampposts in this area of the capital are adorned with royal crowns representing Spain's constitutional monarchy. This lamppost, however, has a small mural crown on top, an emblem of the Second Spanish Republic.  A mural crown symbolizes a city's walls or towers. In ancient Greece, the coronet represented how the gods watched over a city. After Spain's 1868 Glorious Revolution deposed Queen Isabella II, the new government stopped using the Spanish royal crown as an architectural motif and instead looked to find a new symbol. The Spanish Academy of History eventually advised using the mural crown because it was less ornamental.  Starting in the late 19th century, the mural crown was in use, decades before the Second Spanish Republic, which lasted from 1931 to 1936. There's no way to verify whether this lamppost is truly a surviving symbol of the defeated republic, though many like to believe it is, or if it's even older. Regardless, the lamppost has withstood the passage of time, maintaining an air of mystery that continues to intrigue both locals and visitors.",
