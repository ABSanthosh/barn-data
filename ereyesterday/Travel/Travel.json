It is a living reminder of how knowledge tailored to the local ecology is essentialWhen I was 11, I was given the Atlas of Mysterious Places by a teacher and have been tragically obsessed ever since. It is why I have spent most of my life visiting these captivating places, while pursuing a career that gives me the excuse to do so.The more extraordinary places you visit, the more you realise how truly incomprehensible the scale of human ingenuity and cultural innovation is. The wonder is in the unknown and the inspiration it instils towards greater learning. Perhaps that is why the “wonder” I am choosing is one I personally have more to learn about.

I was thrilled by the chaotic wildness of the city that is called Umm al-Dunya, the Mother of the World. Millions of people crowd into Cairo night and day. It was dusty and noisy and polluted and I loved it. I also wanted to explore the country, so that first summer I headed south to the temples and tombs of Luxor.It was an overnight ride of 13 hours on a bus stuffed full of farmers going home after selling their wares in the fleshpots. I fell asleep, soothed by the driver’s Qur’anic verses, and woke up in paradise. Continue reading...",

    "description": "In 1925, the town of Nome, Alaska, was experiencing a severe diphtheria outbreak. The town didn't have sufficient antitoxin to treat the many severely ill town residents, many of them children, so 20 teams of mushers and their sled dogs relayed goods from Nenana to Nome via the Iditarod Trail, an astonishing 674 miles, to deliver medicine and supplies to the town, in just over five days. The teams faced lethal conditions, including temperatures which reached fifty degrees below zero and a climb over 5,000-foot mountain peaks. People around the world followed the story, which made newspaper headlines and was reported on the radio. Balto, an Alaskan husky, was bred by musher Leonhard Seppala. He led the final leg of the journey, which faced the harshest conditions, with musher Gunnar Kaasen. He lived to the ripe old age of 14. Fans of his bravery can visit more than just his statue: after his passing, he was taxidermied, and now resides at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. His actual coat color appears to be a chocolate brown, with two long, white front socks. In recognition of what lead dog Balto and the other dogs and men did, a team of New York City artists, led by Cecilia Beaux, raised funds and petitioned the city to commission a statue to honor the brave dog and the other teams who accomplished an almost unimaginable feat. Brooklyn-born sculptor Frederick Roth was chosen to create a tribute sculpture to stand in Central Park. The artist modeled the figure on an Alaskan Malamute from New Hampshire named Chinook, so the statue's appearance is somewhat different than the actual Balto. The statue was unveiled on December 17, 1925, and has been standing vigil on a rocky outcrop in the park ever since. For the past century, Balto's tribute statue has been a popular destination for park-goers, especially children. The inscription reads: \"Dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed antitoxin six hundred miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through Arctic blizzards from Nenana to the relief of stricken Nome in the Winter of 1925. Endurace - Fidelity - Intelligence.\" Now, a team of conservators care for Balto: the statue is routinely treated with a hot wax coating and polishing, to protect it from the elements. The sculpture is apparently also now subjected to three-dimensional scanning, to document its condition, in the event that it needs to be repaired. Balto's statue isn't the only one to commemorate the event: Togo, another sled dog on the Nome rescue mission, also has a bronze statue dedicated to him, in a Seward Park in Lower Manhattan.",

    "title": "Masters of the Knight: The Art of Chess Carving in India",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/chess-carvers-amritsar-india",
    "description": "In the bustling streets of Amritsar, India, the markets are lined with shops full of colorful tapestries and sweet treats like warm local chai served in clay mugs. But the real treasures are kept behind closed doors. Beyond stacks of gnarled logs, inside unsuspecting brick buildings off the main streets, generations of master craftsmen carefully carve, sand, and polish intricate chess pieces, carrying on a long legacy in the country where the earliest versions of chess were played over 1,500 years ago. These are no basic sets. The pieces make up elaborate professional and collector’s chess sets that sell for up to $4,000 U.S. dollars on the international market. That price is well deserved. Each set is a collective labor of love, with every component handcrafted by a man who specializes in one type of chess piece. (Traditionally, women are not chess carvers.) There are pawn makers, queen craftsmen, and the most coveted—the knight carvers. \"The knight carvers are only knight carvers,\" says Rishi Sharma, CEO of the Chess Empire, India's oldest and largest chess manufacturing company, which was founded in 1962. \"The person who is making the queen, we don't give him the pawn. Otherwise, he's going to ruin it.\" Of all the chessmen, knights are considered the most difficult and require the most skill to carve. While pawns and other pieces can be shaped under lathes, the knights—resembling horse heads usually with wild flowing manes—are carved completely by hand. A chess carver won’t graduate from pawn to knight or any easier piece to harder ones, but instead will learn his craft from the start of his career, usually from their father or a mentor from one of the well-established chess companies. Surinder Pal, a knight carver at the Chess Empire, learned from his father at 18 years old. Now, he has been working on the craft for over 35 years. With his advanced and highly specialized skill, he can make up to 30 simple knights a day, or spend up to three days on a single ornate knight. Today, chess pieces are carved from local species like boxwood or imported trees like rose and dogwood. But they were once made of a far more elusive and illicit material. Amritsar was originally known for its ivory carvers, who produced everything from hair combs and jewelry to furniture and sculptures. And of course, chess sets. After the international trade of ivory was banned in the 1990s, the craftsman turned to the similarly smooth but far more accessible medium. With raw materials readily available, it’s the demand for these fine chess sets that determines how many are produced. And demand has fluctuated in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic left many people secluded in their homes, leading to a boost in demand for many indoor games, says Sharma. In October 2020, that enthusiasm for chess was compounded by the release of The Queen’s Gambit, a series about a fictional American chess prodigy. \"The Queen's Gambit had a very big role in spreading awareness of chess,\" Sharma says. \"And after that, we see a big boom.\" Despite the show’s creator stating they have no plans for a second season, Sharma stays hopeful. \"We hope the next season comes as soon as possible.\" That initial excitement has since faded, he says. With economic impacts and trade restrictions from ongoing wars around the world, the demand for high-quality chess sets has taken a hit, Sharma says. As producers in China and other countries circulate more plastic and inexpensive sets, the ornate wooden craft has become more of a luxury. But for some, the price is well worth it. \"You won't get the feeling of that craftsmanship in those plastic chess sets,\" Sharma says. While he is optimistic that international demand will return, they’ve seen a rise in interest within India. The brain-engaging game became popularized in elite private schools across India in the early 2010s. Due to great success—including fostering Gukesh Dommaraju, who became the youngest world chess champion in December 2024—the initiative is now spreading to government-funded schools as well. While women may not be carving chess pieces, young women are playing the game—in September 2024, the Indian men's and women's teams both took home gold at the Chess Olympiad. Despite the game's rise in popularity, young people aren’t clamoring to learn how to make the sets. \"The younger generation is not interested in this kind of handcraftsmanship,\" Sharma says. \"They want only white-collar jobs to do in the malls or offices. They don't want to come work in this sawdust.\" Still, for those few who do take an interest in the craft, the Chess Empire is always willing to teach.",
