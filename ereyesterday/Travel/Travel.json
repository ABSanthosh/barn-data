    "description": "The walk across the North York Moors – which has to be completed in 24 hours – is a mix of trudging and wild beauty. I experienced both as I joined one of the first people to do it in 1955 One August evening in 1955, members of York Mountaineering Club had convened in the city’s Olde Starre Inne. They were, perhaps, lamenting the shortage of mountains (or indeed hills) in York, when club chair David Laughton turned up waving a copy of that month’s Dalesman magazine.It contained a challenge, issued by Bill Cowley, author of the Farmer’s Diary column. Cowley would provide a cup – “an inexpensive one” – to anyone who traversed the North York Moors in less than 24 hours: “… You would cross Carlton Moor, Cringle Moor and Cold Moor; Botton Head and Bloworth; the long flat expanse of Stony Ridge … over Howl Moor and Simon Howe, by Tom Cross Rigg and Snod Hill to Lilla Cross, then over Fylingdales Moor … to the sea.” Continue reading...",

    "description": "In the center of Zagreb, step into a whimsical world of Croatian folklore. The Museum of Lost Tales is dedicated to little-known Croatian stories, myths, and legends. These traditional tales have been passed down from generation to generation, and have been memorialized in this space, through writing, illustrations, and interactive exhibits. The collection is the work of Croatian artist Zdenko Bašić, who has also illustrated children's books focused on the traditional tales. Opening its doors in 2024, Bašić created the museum to collect and record these stories — many of which are traditionally told orally — in writing and visual displays, for generations to come. Inside, you can find tales about faeries, witches, vampires, and other magical creatures that inhabit Croatian folktales. One room is dedicated to old Croatian and Slavic mythology, where you can read stories about the olden gods and other beliefs regarding the creation of the universe.",
