Through an open window, I hear a harpist plucking notes at a banquet drifting as the sun sets low over the battlements. On the other side of the lane, smoke drifts from Durty Nelly’s pub, where a singer is halfway through The Parting Glass. A short walk away, the limestone facade of the Creamery hints at its past lives – as a stagecoach stop, a dairy, a roadside inn. Tonight, it’s a pub.Inside, Bríd O’Gorman plays the fluttering melody of The Cliffs of Moher on her flute, accompanied by Michael Landers on guitar – a quiet moment before the small crowd erupt into applause as Cian Lally pulls our pints.

    "description": "Listen and subscribe on Stitcher, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. Johanna: Let’s get into it. Tee us up, Dylan. Dylan: I’m Dylan Thuras. Johanna: I’m Johanna Mayer. Amanda: I’m Amanda McGowan. Dylan: And this is Atlas Obscura. Today is a listener mailbag episode where we answer all of your questions. Your travel questions, your life questions, your esoteric questions. This is an edited transcript of the Atlas Obscura Podcast: a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Find the show on Stitcher, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. Johanna: OK, first question: This is from a listener named Frank. Frank asked: “What is the longest line you have ever waited in? What was the experience like and was it worth it?” Amanda: I hate waiting in lines. I used to be the kind of person that was like, if there’s a great pastry or something from a bakery, I’ll wait for an hour for that. And now—you know, a decent pastry is just as good as an excellent pastry, sometimes. Johanna: I could not disagree more. I feel like I have the type of personality where a lot of people would think that I would be really against waiting in a line, but I absolutely will wait for certain things. And, my answer to this question—it’s a little embarrassing. Do you remember the cronut? Amanda: Oh, yeah. Dylan: Yes. Johanna: I waited in the cronut line not once, but twice. And I did get on that line at five o’clock in the morning. Dylan: No! Johanna: Twice. Dylan: Tell me, how long were you in the line for? Johanna: I think like three hours. Dylan: Are you kidding me? Johanna: Maybe I got in line at 6 a.m. Dylan: When I see a line like four people deep, I’m like, nope not interested. On the other side of that line, it’s like an important thing I really need, I’m just like, “Oh, I don’t need you. I’m not doing this.” Amanda: I’ll file my taxes after the deadline. Dylan: Yes, 100 percent. I refuse. Johanna: You don’t think there’s something fun about the communal experience of everyone being like, “We are excited about this thing, we are putting aside a day,” you kind of mix it up with the other people in the line—you don’t find anything appealing about that? Amanda: Now that you say that there is a feeling— Dylan: If it’s the right cultural event. Johanna: Like the release of the cronut. Dylan: I don’t think I’ve ever been—honestly, it’s at a theme park. I probably waited for like an hour and a half to ride a roller coaster. Johanna: Which roller coaster? Dylan: Probably the longest line was for Kingda Ka at Six Flags. Johanna: Closed, now. Famously now closed. Dylan: Yes, now closed. But yeah, it was the tallest roller coaster in the world for a while. Johanna: Why was it closed? Any arm dislocations or anything? Dylan: I think it was just always breaking. I think people were getting stuck on it. You’d be stuck up at the top. Amanda, what’s your longest line? Johanna: Any line stories, Amanda? Amanda: This is also probably not particularly cool, but I’m a little freak for the band U2. Maybe you’re familiar with the band U2? They obviously did a big thing at the Sphere. I went with my sister and I got general admission tickets to be on the floor, and we ended up really close to the front. We waited in line for probably like an hour and a half. Dylan: Oh, that’s not bad. That’s normal. Honestly, I have never done what you were talking about Johanna, where you’re like, “It’s gonna take six hours, the line is part of the experience.” I guess there has not been the kind of occasion where I had something where I was like, “Oh, I really want to do this.” Johanna: OK, next question. This is from a listener named Ashley. It came in via email. She says: “I love taking trips with friends and family, but we’re all in different financial places in our lives. How do you manage planning a trip with people you love and care about who have mixed budgets?” It’s a great question. Amanda: That is a good question. Johanna: Yeah, tough. Dylan: I think there’s a straightforward way to do it. You have to be a little bit comfortable talking about money right out of the gate, but— Johanna: That’s the answer, is just having a conversation. Dylan: And you don’t even need to get into your full money picture. You can just say, “We only have $2,500 for this kind of vacation right now.” I think just agreeing, being upfront about what your budget for a trip is is a good place to start. And it might mean not knowing where you’re going. It might be like, “Hey, look, I would love to take a trip. I only can spend two grand. Where can we go for two grand? And you could do a lot of stuff, you know what I mean? Cheap flights to Florida or Las Vegas are very cheap often, and you can kind of come up with some fun trip like, “We’re gonna fly to Vegas and drive out to the desert and we’re gonna camp for three nights.” Amanda: Wait in line to see U2 for four hours. Dylan: Yeah, we’re gonna go to the Sphere. That’ll be a thousand dollars of the budget. Johanna: Well, that’s what I was gonna say also is: If you’re in the pre-planning “Where are we going?” stage, outdoors things are often a very great selection for a lower budget. But also, once you’re there, something that I feel like I’ve kind of realized as I get deeper into my 30s is: If you’re going on a trip with a friend, it’s OK to not stay together. You can get different accommodations, sometimes it’s even better. You don’t have to eat every meal together or anything. You can just be on these kind of parallel trips that you link up for certain things. Amanda: I totally agree. Dylan: Actually, it’s a really good idea to not assume you have to spend 100 percent of your time together. That is a recipe for everyone getting very grouchy with each other. I mean, I also think there are some strange scenarios with friends and family—and this is more comfortable with family than a friend, but someone might say, “Oh, well, whatever, let me cover the hotels.” Or, “I’m buying the flights. I want to do that.” And I honestly think in that case, it depends person to person, but just say, “OK.” You know what I mean? Be gracious. Be like, “OK I appreciate that.” And maybe put boundaries on it. But if somebody wants to pay I think that’s fine, you just have to sort of be clear about where those boundaries are. Amanda: I think those are both really good suggestions. The only thing I have to add is if there’s something that you have in mind for an expensive component of a trip or a big activity that’ll cost a little more money, it maybe helps to kind of put feelers out ahead of time. My friends and I go on a trip once a year and we make a Google Doc. This is not for more spontaneous travelers. We make a Google Doc and we’re like, “Hey, we want to do a haunted horse beach tour,” or some accursed thing. And then you’re like, “OK I expect that this is something people want to do and I can opt out of it in advance or not.” Johanna: Amanda, you actually brought this question up the other day. Do you know what question I’m talking about? Amanda: I do, yes. Johanna: You want to ask that? Amanda: I would love to ask that. My question is, “What are some places that you weren’t supposed to be in, but ended up really enjoying?” And I asked this because I am a person who books crappy flights all the time. I always book all my travel last-minute and I always get stuck in a layover somewhere that I wasn’t supposed to be on my itinerary. I have an answer as well, but I’ll let you guys answer first. Johanna: I freaking love Indianapolis. A couple of years ago, my partner and I drove from New York to Missouri where I’m from and we ended up driving the first 12 hours and stopping in Indianapolis for the night and it rocked. There were so many outdoor breweries. There were people playing music outside. It felt very much like a place that a lot of people were decamped from Chicago or a bigger city and came to this more affordable place where there’s more space and they brought a lot of cool stuff there. Had some really good barbecue. We loved it. I was ready to move to Indianapolis after that. Amanda: That’s my list. I want to go to the Kurt Vonnegut Museum. Johanna: Oh, we did not go there. I did not know that that was there. Dylan: Just a plus one to mid-sized Midwestern cities. Your Kansas Citys, your Cincinnatis, your Pittsburghs. Johanna: What’s yours, Dylan? Dylan: I have two, kind of. I mean, one of them I made a whole podcast episode about. But, I got stuck in Las Vegas for four days. And I know that’s a funny place to—you know, because tons of people travel to Las Vegas as a major destination, people want to go. But I did not want to be there for four days because I was like, “What am I gonna do with all this time?” I’m not much of a gambler. I’m not against it, I just lose all my money. I didn’t have the money to lose. But then I just ended up having this wonderful experience. I rented a car and I drove out to Death Valley and I was off in the desert and at the weird Amargosa Opera House where this woman painted all the walls with murals of people so she could perform in front of an audience. I just went all over the place. I went out to this big land art place called Double Negative and I just really explored all the non-casino Vegas stuff of which there’s a ton. It’s such a weird quirky place. So I ended up—that trip, that period where I just had four days to kill, I really fell in love with the place. I was like, oh, OK. This is a good reminder of if you’re willing to look you’ll find stuff that’s delightful. Johanna: Amanda, What’s yours? You said you had one. Amanda: It was like Christmas travel and I had a layover in Fort Lauderdale. And of course my connection got canceled. So, it was me and a plane full of people coming from Connecticut in Fort Lauderdale at this airport hotel and nobody had any weather clothes. So everyone was sitting around this pool in winter coats and winter boots just sweating, and eating food from the gas station at the hotel. So, everyone’s in that kind of mood. And then we’re at the pool and this iguana the size of Plymouth Rock lumbers over the pool and everybody just stops and is like, “Oh my god, what what is that?” And the guy who was working at the hotel was like, “Oh, you know, he’s chill. He comes here every day. He bites but he’s fine. Just give him space.” Johanna: Did he have a name? Amanda: For some reason in my head, I’m thinking his name was Ivan, but I don’t know if I just made that up. It was amazing. I think about that iguana like once every couple months. We had a cosmic connection, man. Dylan: There's something a little bit magical about falling into a block of unstructured time. It’s slightly panic-inducing at first, you’re just like, “Oh no, what am I doing?” You could look at your phone the whole day, whatever, you can fritter away that time no problem. But like there’s just something kind of magical about being like well, I guess I gotta go take a look. You know and like and then it ends up being such fun experiences because there’s no stakes. You didn’t mean to be there. Johanna: You’re free. Dylan: Yeah, totally. Johanna: That’s all I got for you guys. Dylan: That was fun. Amanda: Thanks for letting me share my special friendship with the airport hotel iguana. Shout out to Ivan. Dylan: Thank you for sending your questions in, too.

Dylan Thuras: If you visit Colonial Williamsburg these days, you will find that there’s one burning question on everybody’s mind. Darin Durham: Everybody’s always worried about where Wilbur is. Anna Reinhardt: People will sometimes even email us and say like, “I saw you move Wilbur, where did Wilbur go?” Darin: We get text messages on a daily basis about the whereabouts of Wilbur. Dylan: Wilbur is a sheep, a very friendly sheep, and a little one too, just only a year old. Born last year during what’s called the lambing season. Lambing season happens every spring in Colonial Williamsburg and it’s a really big deal, mainly because these baby lambs are very small and very, very, very cute. Darin: Some people plan their trips to Williamsburg during lambing season for that purpose. This is an edited transcript of the Atlas Obscura Podcast: a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Find the show on Stitcher, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. Anna: I think the energy around lambing season is always really fun and the weather is nice and the flowers are blooming and the little lambs are running around, I mean … Darin: And jumping. They like to jump. Anna: Yeah, it’s really cute. Dylan: But in addition to being extremely small and extremely cute, these lambs tell a pretty incredible story about American history. It’s a story that involves sheep smuggling, extinction, and a president of the United States. I’m Dylan Thuras and this is Atlas Obscura, a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. This episode was produced in partnership with Visit Williamsburg. Dylan: And today we are going to Williamsburg to talk about a very special breed of sheep. One that was so prized, so incredibly valuable, that during the 18th century there was a lot of illicit, under-the-table sheep trading going on. And after some ups and downs, these valuable sheep actually went extinct in the United States before ultimately being brought back right here in colonial Williamsburg. Crazy sheep story. Darin Durham and Anna Reinhardt are both animal husbanders at Colonial Williamsburg. It means they spend a good part of each day chasing after sheep in historical costumes. And it is not every day you see someone join a Zoom meeting in a period outfit. Darin: Yes, I am dressed like a rural person in the 18th century right now. We were just shearing sheep at our farm site on the other end of town. Anna was also dressed up, but now she is back in her lovely Colonial Williamsburg sheep t-shirt. Anna: I was covered in sheep gunk. I was smelly. Yeah, so now I’m wearing a hot pink t-shirt with a cartoon sheep on it, and you can’t see on the video, it says Colonial Williamsburg. Dylan: Shearing a sheep is really hard work. I’ve tried to do this once, and it’s just incredibly difficult. First off, they weigh between 100 and 200 pounds, so they’re just difficult to wrangle. And also, they wiggle around. They’re kind of, you know, they get nervous and want to run away. But then there’s the fact that at Colonial Williamsburg, they’re not using modern electric clippers. They are shearing with actual shears, like scissors. Anna: I feel like I need to prepare by going home and just sitting on the couch and squeezing a tennis ball, because you’re opening and closing the shear so much that by the end of it, I find that my forearms are a little sore. Dylan: Using electric clippers would make this process go much faster. But that is just not the point. The Colonial Williamsburg experience is all about feeling like you’ve been dropped into the 18th century. So not only are Anna and Darin using old-fashioned shears, they’re also using them on old-fashioned sheep. Anna: One of the things that we try to do here is line up animals that reasonably could have been in our kind of region during the colonial time period. Darin: And the Leicester Longwool had a big part to play in a lot of that. Dylan: Yes, we are talking about a specific breed of sheep called the Leicester Longwool, which was like basically the first designer breed ever. They’re like the sheep version of the labradoodle. And it all started back in England in the 1740s. Darin Durham: The Leicester Longwool breed was developed by geneticists in England by the name of Robert Bakewell. I mean, he’s still in a lot of agricultural textbooks even today. And the Leicester Longwool breed itself is one of the first breeds of livestock that actually had a breed standard. So if you look at the American Kennel Club with all the dogs, it kind of started with the idea that Robert Bakewell came across with this particular breed of sheep. Dylan: Basically, Robert Bakewell wanted a sheep with a lot of meat on it and also a lot of wool. So he chose ewes and rams from his flock that were beefier or woolier, and then he bred them together. And ultimately, eventually, ta-da, you get this big, meaty, woolly sheep: the Leicester Longwool. Soon, the Leicester Longwools became famous for producing this super warm, super durable wool. It was the perfect wool for making blankets or coats. Now, during this period, the textile industry made up an enormous part of the British economy. And the British were very protective of their textiles. They passed all sorts of laws banning the colonies from producing their own wool and exporting it. Believe it or not, they also banned sheep like the Longwools from being sent out of Britain. These sheep were essentially a protected technology. Think of the CHIPS Act today. So, as you can imagine, people in the American colonies thought, “Oh, I really, really want to get my hands on these valuable sheep.” Darin: And there were people, particularly rich planters, that were buying them off the black market. And there’s a pretty famous one. There’s this fellow on the Potomac River by the name of George Washington that bought some Leicesters off the black market. Dylan: That’s right. George Washington was an illicit sheep trader. Darin: Yeah, he called the black sheep market. Dylan: There’s actually a letter from him where he’s complaining about all of these British statutes on sheep and then mentions that some, quote, “less scrupulous people have managed to get around them,” wink wink. He’s pretty careful to say that he didn’t do any of the importing directly, but it seems like he was definitely buying baby lambs from these smuggled sheep. All these British rules about sheep trading, they weren’t just annoying. They were exemplary of the fundamental problems between the colonies and the British. And so it became a political issue. Anna: As we get closer to the American Revolution, a lot of farmers in Virginia get interested in the idea of trying to produce more wool as a form of economic independence and patriotism. People are saying, like, “Oh, yeah, it’s going to increase our economic independence.” And part of it is really political protest. Darin: Washington has, what, between two and four hundred sheep at any given time. Anna: Yeah, I think at one point he might have had close to 900. Not for long, though. Dylan: For a long time, the Leicester Longwools were the gold standard of sheep. Everybody wanted one. The wool was strong and warm, had a kind of sheen to it even after you dyed it. But then a story that happens time and time again played out. A new kind of technology arrived on the block. A new breed of sheep from Spain. And actually, this one you’ve probably heard of. You probably even own a jacket or a sweater made from its wool. Merino sheep and Merino wool. The Merino sheep produced wool that was both softer and finer than the Leicester Longwool. So soft you could wear it right next to your skin. And soon, a kind of Merino mania began to spread. And the Leicester began to fall out of favor. By the 1940s, the Leicester Longwool was completely extinct in the United States. Darin: And, you know, that’s kind of a problem because once you lose some of this genetic material, it’s gone forever. And there are hundreds of breeds of livestock that have actually become extinct. As young as this country is—you know, we’re going on 250 years—we’ve lost a lot of livestock that will never come back. Dylan: Enter Colonial Williamsburg. In the mid-1980s, they started what was called their Rare Breeds Program. The goal was to bring back animals that had been really important to American life in the 18th century. Cows like the Milking Red Devon, or horses like the Cleveland Bay Horse. If you’ve ever seen the movie War Horse, that is a Cleveland Bay Horse. And to bring the Leicester Longwools back, Colonial Williamsburg had to track down a farmer in Australia that still had a flock. Darin: Those Leicesters were brought over, flown over, and they had a flock here in Williamsburg, Virginia, and they had another satellite flock within about an hour and a half from here, and basically went from there. And now there’s, what, about 2,000 Leicesters registered at any given time now here in the United States? Anna: The Livestock Conservancy tracks how rare different breeds are in North America. So there’s, just like an endangered species list, there’s extinct, there’s critically endangered, there’s threatened, and then there’s watch lists, and then you’re not on the list anymore. The Leicester Longwools have gone from extinct to, or functionally extinct at least, to threatened in North America, which is pretty good. Darin: It’s probably our rare breeds program’s biggest success story, I would say. Dylan: Today, Colonial Williamsburg is home to about 40 Leicester Longwool sheep, and more are born every year during lambing season, which, as we mentioned before, is unquestionably the cutest time of year to visit Colonial Williamsburg. And of course, back in the 1700s, the wool from these Leicester Longwools would have been made into fabric, and so that is what happens at Colonial Williamsburg, too. They shear the sheep once a year, spin it into yarn on an old-fashioned spinning wheel, and then weave it into fabric on these big looms. This fabric is usually made into rugs or horse blankets, used all around town. But if you have any crocheters or knitters in your life, they sometimes put up homemade yarn for sale in the gift shop. Darin: And it’s a cool souvenir if you happen to come across it, because, you know, you’re in Colonial Williamsburg, that sheep was hand-shorn in an 18th century method. It’s an 18th century breed of sheep, and you’re getting a product that, I mean, wholeheartedly was, you know, started here and ended here, which is pretty neat. Dylan: It’s like farm-to-table but for cloth, you know? Wool-to-yarn. Sheep-to-sweater. But even if you’re not in the market for yarn, you can still visit the sheep and the baby lambs, including Wilbur, and appreciate how they kind of set the vibe at the museum. You know that when you are walking around Colonial Williamsburg, you are seeing the things that people would have seen and hearing the things they would have heard, including all these cute little “bah” sounds. Darin: You’re walking down the street at 7:30 in the morning, you hear roosters crowing, you hear cows mooing, you hear sheep bleating, and it really adds to the experience as a whole. Dylan: You too can go and see these cute little baby lambs and visit the rare breeding program in Colonial Williamsburg. I personally find this to be one of the most interesting things about the whole experience. And while you’re there, you can explore more. You’re in this historic triangle where Williamsburg is one piece of it, but the whole region is this kind of intermix of nature and history. Nearby, you can go to Jamestown on the James River. You can see bald eagles and white deer and all of the wildlife that the English settlers would have seen when they arrived. Or you could go to Yorktown’s riverfront and see these battlefield landscapes and also understand this natural world that shaped colonial survival, whether it’s the Chesapeake Bay and its marine life or the wildlife in the forests that sustained soldiers during the American Revolution. You can find out all of this and more places to explore on Visit Williamsburg. Listen and subscribe on Stitcher, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps.",
