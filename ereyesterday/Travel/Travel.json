    "description": "This people’s museum is crammed with curios donated by Dublin residents. A major facelift has added a library, archive and exhibition on ‘fearless women’There are certain museums around the world that go beyond their role of housing artefacts and somehow seem to act as portals to the past. The Frick Collection in New York and Marcel Proust’s cork-lined bedroom at the Musée Carnavalet in Paris both hum with a timeless energy that transcends the exhibits on display. The Little Museum of Dublin is also such a space.Within seconds of ascending the stairs of this beautiful four-storey Georgian townhouse at 15 St Stephen’s Green, a different era appears to take hold. The modern world disappears and I imagine myself back in Georgian times, when this red-bricked terrace was built along with so many of the beautiful squares and parks throughout the city centre.

    "description": "A new trail follows the 26-mile route of the world’s first passenger train journey on the Stockton and Darlington RailwayIt was as strange a sight as you could stumble upon in the English countryside. As a muggy summer’s day began outside Shildon, County Durham – rain threatening, bees drowsy in the hedgerows – I found myself standing on an embankment, surveying two rows of colossal stone teeth jutting through the earth. It looked as if someone had buried a sleeping giant.“You wouldn’t believe it by looking at it, but this is one of railway history’s most amazing feats,” my companion, rail expert Richie Starrs, said as we gazed down at the molars beneath our feet. A closer look revealed they were abandoned rail sleepers, laid out between the hawthorns and along which coal wagons were once pulled uphill by steam traction locomotives. “This is the Brusselton Incline, a section of the original Stockton and Darlington Railway. Nationally, it’s a story that’s not well known, but it’s one we’re rightly proud of.” Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/napier-art-deco-new-zealand",
    "description": "Visiting Napier is like stepping back in time. The city’s central business district is home to dozens of original buildings and shopfronts that exemplify the key styles of the Art Deco movement. Napier was devastated by an earthquake in 1931, which resulted in the death of over 250 residents. From this tragedy, a new vision for the city emerged. As the city was rebuilt after the earthquake, the buildings in the central business district were designed in the popular architectural style of the time, known as Moderne, later termed Art Deco. Thanks to the efforts of the Art Deco Trust, many of these buildings have been preserved and restored. When walking along Emerson and Tennyson streets, be sure to look up—you’ll surely discover the beauty, elegance, color, and motifs that define Art Deco. Some of these motifs are inspired by the indigenous Māori culture of the region. Queen Elizabeth II stayed at the Masonic Hotel in Napier, and Prince Edward VIII, who later abdicated the throne, spent three months in the city.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/military-cemetery-for-north-korean-soldiers",
    "description": "The Military Cemetery for North Korean soldiers, also known locally as the “Enemy Cemetery,” is located beside a highway south of the inter-Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Hidden without signs, the two neighboring graveyards sit on a hilltop bordered by vegetable gardens. One holds the bodies of North Korean soldiers killed during the Korean War, while the second contains infiltrators and spies killed in the South since 1953. Established in 1996, the cemetery contains hundreds of mostly unidentified graves, all facing north as a sign of respect. North Korea, just 5 kilometers away, never claimed the bodies, as doing so would have meant admitting responsibility for several clandestine operations. The site once also held 541 Chinese volunteers, later repatriated to rest in the “Resist America and Aid Korea Martyrs Cemetery” in Shenyang, China. Maintained minimally and seldom visited, rumors suggest South Korean intelligence monitors the cemetery to spot any potential North Korean sympathizers who come to pay their respects. Among those buried here are Kim Sung Il, involved in the 1987 bombing of a Korean Air plane, and 29 members of Unit 124, which infiltrated South Korea in 1968 with the aim of assassinating President Park Chung Hee. Only two survived; one returned to North Korea and became Vice Minister of Defence, while the other remained in South Korea and became a pastor.",
