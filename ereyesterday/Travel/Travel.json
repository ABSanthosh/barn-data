    "description": "The spectacular estuary is a haven for thousands of migrant birds each winter, and perfect to explore on foot and by boatThe Christmas market doesn’t know what’s hit it. At 8.30 on a mid-November morning Exeter is a whirl of white, a city half-blinded by tumbling flakes. Four market workers, caught out by this overly authentic addition to the festive decor, are busy shovelling the ground in front of the bao stalls and craft gin chalets. Above them, the cathedral’s medieval towers stand tall and cold in the heaven-filling flurry. Winter has arrived in Devon with bells on.I’m here to catch a train to see some birdlife. A breakfast blizzard wasn’t part of the plan, but sometimes these things don’t go as expected. The city’s Queen Street has turned into a real-life snow globe – Narnia with sandwich shops – yet the little two-carriage train I’m catching trundles into Exeter Central bang on time. I find a window seat and settle in. Snowy rooftops roll by. Somewhere, an estuary lies in wait. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/honekilden-the-hen-spring",
    "description": "Hønekilden (The Hen Spring) in Sønderborg, southern Denmark, was once renowned for its pure water—so much so that, in the 1500s, Queen Dorothea had it channeled through hollowed-out tree trunks to her castle’s waterworks. Locals trusted it above all other sources for cooking. Although its outlet remains visible today behind a wrought iron gate, the water is no longer drinkable.  Legends surround the spring, especially in the neighborhood, where residents claimed that local newborns weren’t brought by storks but were \"found swimming in the spring.\" In 1924, Widow Larsen of Sønderborg recalled how, as a child around 1845, she and her friends would hide by the spring, hoping to catch a glimpse of these mysterious babies—but their curiosity was never satisfied. The spring was also linked to other forms of magic, with some believing its waters held the power to aid fertility. It was said that if a woman struggled to conceive, simply stepping over the spring’s water could lead to pregnancy.  Then there’s the haunting tale of a young girl who, on Three King’s Day, hoping to catch a glimpse of her future husband, peered into the spring—only to see her own image, shrouded for burial. She confided her fright to a friend, but that same night, terror overwhelmed her, and she was found dead the next day in the harbor’s icy waters. In 2016, a new water feature was added beside the legendary old spring, creating a small plaza in front of it. Sculpted by Vibeke Fonnesberg, the piece includes trickling water taps and a rooster with three hens cast in bronze—a playful nod to the spring’s name; Hønekilden.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-republic-of-the-east",
    "description": "At the end of the first world war, the country of Austria-Hungary disintegrated into countless smaller countries. Among the chaos, one country briefly appeared in the eastern region of Slovakia. It was called both the Slovak People’s Republic and the East Slovak Republic. It claimed that Eastern Slovaks’ dialect and culture was far too detached for them to be considered Slovaks and that they had more in common with the Hungarians than with the new Czechoslovakia. It only existed for a couple of weeks, from December 11 through 29, 1918 before being occupied by the Czechoslovak army. The only memory of this brief era in history is a restaurant with the same name. It pays homage to this time by having its menu completely in the East Slovak dialect as well as having the republic’s constitution displayed for everyone to see in their bathrooms, as well as allowing you to sign up for ’citizenship’ on their website.",
