    "description": "The former fishing village on the Ligurian coast was once a favourite with the wealthy British set. Now instead of tennis and tea parties, it offers scenic treks and seafood feasts in glorious spring sunshine‘Why don’t the inglesi come here any more?” The question was asked by a customer at Caffè Roma in the seaside town of Alassio, whose pre-second world war British population could reach 5,000.There are several reasons, I think. From the late 19th century, wealthy Britons would arrive in October to escape the winter cold, stay until May, and then head home before the torrid Italian summer. These days, British people with that kind of wealth probably winter between Zermatt and the Caribbean. But neither has Alassio great appeal to more ordinary Britons wanting a summer holiday: August temperatures can hit the high 30s, crowds and prices surge and, as in so many Italian resorts, the sands are taken over by beach concessions from Easter to September.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museo-internazionale-e-biblioteca-della-musica",
    "description": "Most visitors to the Museo Internazionale e Biblioteca della Musica (International Museum and Library of Music) may expect a collection of antique musical instruments, but they’ll soon discover it offers much more. Beyond its instrument exhibits, the museum contains a library of historical musical documents, all within a restored, centuries-old building. This museum and library traces its origins to Giovanni Battista Martini (1706-1784). Father Martini was nominally a Franciscan monk, but also a talented composer, music theorist, historian, and teacher whose pupils included Mozart and J.C. Bach. Through his studies, he amassed a vast collection of musical literature, which he requested remain with the Franciscans after his death. Over time, the library expanded and was eventually transferred to the city of Bologna, where it is now recognized as one of the world’s oldest musical libraries. A separate collection of historic musical instruments—less renowned but still of interest—was established in Bologna in 1804. In 1959, the library and instrument collection merged as the Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale, though originally in a different location. The collection is currently in the Palazzo Sanguinetti, a mid-16th-century palace built for a prominent Bologna family. When its last owner, Eleonora Sanguinetti, passed away in 1986, she donated the building to the city. After extensive restoration, the building reopened in 2004 as the Museo Internazionale e Biblioteca della Musica. Today, visitors can explore rooms decorated with frescoes and filled with historic instruments and musical literature. Some rooms also feature classical paintings, including works originally owned by Father Martini and preserved by the Franciscans as part of his collection. In addition to its exhibits, the museum still functions as a library. The collection of over 100,000 documents includes unique and rare works, making it both a showcase of musical history and an important resource for scholarly research.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/besakih-temple-bali",
    "description": "As you draw closer to the base of Pura Besakih in Bali, the complex of Hindu temples rises above you and its enormity begins to fully set in. This is Bali’s mother temple, the holiest place of all for the four-million adherents of Balinese Hinduism, and it is remarkable. Besakih, sometimes called the great temple, sits about one-third of the way up Mount Agung, a 10,000-foot active volcano on Bali’s eastern side. The clouds that usually enshroud Agung’s higher reaches feel close at Besakih, complementing the mystery and awe a visitor can feel. Twenty-three temples make up the complex; they’re built upon six terraces. At its center is Pura Penataran Agung, the most important of the temples, with a split stone gateway called a candi bentar at its entry. This is an active place of worship that is not open to tourists, but visitors are welcome to watch respectfully from the perimeter of the central temple. Wander through the open-air structures. The architectural contrasts become more striking the higher you climb into Besakih, and get a fuller good look at its buildings. The symmetrical serenity of the meru, the thatched pagoda-like structures, stands in stark contrast to the murti, statues representing the divine (or simply the decorative). From the very top of the complex, you may be able to see the Indian Ocean. Ceremonies large and small take place about 70 days a year at Besakih, with Bali’s familiar marigold-colored fabrics—and plenty of white and red, too—draped at key points in the temples. Trees are interspersed with stone throughout the complex, adding more color, along with flowers and lotus ponds. Nearly the entire Balinese Hindu population comes to Besakih at some point during the year. Besakih keeps some secrets to itself, including its age. Inscriptions found at Besakih have been dated to 1007, AD; other sources note some of its structures may go back 2,000 years. Eruptions in 1963 and 1964 claimed between 1,100 and 1,600 lives and displaced more than 86,000 people. Astonishingly, the lava flows stopped just short of Besakih.",
