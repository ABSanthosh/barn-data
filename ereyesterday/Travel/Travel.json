    "description": "Spending nearly a decade on the move gave me a deeper understanding of the importance of conversation, people’s boundless generosity – and my limitationsI have often felt as if I was born 100 years too late. There was a time when satellites weren’t whizzing above us and everything had yet to be discovered or filmed. Growing up, it seemed as if all the great adventures had happened before I was born. But in 2013 I discovered that – although it had been attempted – no one had made an unbroken journey through every country without flying. I had a shot at becoming the first to do it.I was fascinated that such an adventure was still out there, untouched. However, I was in my 30s, I had just met a wonderful woman, my peers were having their first children (and in some cases their second) and I had a 12-year career in shipping and logistics. But I couldn’t let the idea go. So, at 34, I set off – and didn’t return home until almost a decade later. These are the lessons I learned along the way. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Fort Zion offers a solid, quirky detour before heading into the grandeur of Zion National Park. Built to resemble one of Utah's old Western frontier towns, the \"fort\" boasts a petting zoo, a gift shop filled with cowboy trinkets and Native American crafts, an ice cream parlor, and a restaurant serving up buffalo, elk, and even rattlesnake burgers. The real star of the show? The \"Virgin Jail,\" a wooden jail that makes for the perfect photo op in the town of Virgin, Utah. Surrounding the jail are other hilariously small Old West-style buildings, including a bank, a saloon, and a \"House of Negotiable Affection.\"",

    "description": "Hidden away in the Lazio region of Italy, about 50 miles north of Naples, the Gianola and Monte di Scauri Regional Park stretches across 292 stunning hectares. Managed by the Riviera di Ulisse Park Authority, the body that governs other nearby Atlas Obscura locations such as the Villa of Tiberius, this park is home to many ancient Roman ruins that few tourists know about. Among its notable sites is a remarkable seaside villa, dating back to around 50 BC and believed to belong to the Roman military officer Mamurra who served under Julius Caesar. Visitors can also explore the evocative Grotta della Janara, a staircase adorned with a barrel vault reminiscent of Sardinia's Domus de Janas, and the remnants of Porticciolo Romano, a small Roman port. Scattered across the landscape are five coastal towers: the ruins of Torre di Gianola and Torre Fico, alongside Torre Foce and Torre dei Mulini, which, though integrated into private properties, remain strikingly visible. The majestic Torre di Scauri, perched atop Monte d'Oro, offers breathtaking views of Minturno and the coastline.",
