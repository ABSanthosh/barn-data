    "description": "A policy of restricting huge liners visiting popular Cyclades islands could have the unintended consequence of diverting mass tourism towards quieter islandsImagine the perfect Greek island, a pristine enclave of slow tourism that’s remained unchanged for decades. Along the curve of a narrow bay whitewashed buildings line a quay, a rocky mountain face rearing up behind them. On the opposite side of the bay nestles a sleepy fishing village, where brightly painted traditional fishing boats are tied up in a marina. Small yachts moor along the quay where ferries dock a few times a day, bringing visitors or returning locals to the island.Now imagine a procession of multistorey cruise liners docking here. Cruise liners that hold up to 1,400 passengers each when the entire permanent population of the island is about 2,000 people. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Two novices, a large van and a lively Irish setter make for an eventful road trip through the French mountainsWhen I first had the idea of taking a winter road trip through the Alps, I imagined snowy walks followed by fondue in the comfort of our van, feet warmed by 25kg of auburn fluff (it was to be our Irish setter’s first encounter with snow). Waking up to snowflakes on the skylight and the freedom of being able to go wherever we wanted. What I hadn’t quite pictured was spending our first night in a car park on the outskirts of a city, sandwiched between the medieval ramparts and a graveyard.We were in Albertville, on the edge of the French Alps, in an enormous campervan that afforded theoretical freedom but size-induced restraints. Those born before the 1980s probably know Albertville as the home of the 1992 Winter Olympics, those born after may have passed it if heading for Chambéry for a ski trip. The new town of Albertville sprawls industrially through the valley, tower blocks overshadowed by snow-capped mountains, while the old town, known as Conflans, fortified and cobbled, is so pretty it looks like an illustration, and is home to more cats than a Greek island.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ahlat-seljuk-cemetery",
    "description": "Ahlat Selçuklu Mezarlığı is, as the locals will proudly tell you, the largest Islamic cemetery in Turkey and the fourth-largest in the world. Sandwiched between Lake Van to the south, Mount Suphan to the east, and Mount Nemrut towering to the west, the setting is stunning. But the decorated gravestones are the real attraction; standing an average of six feet (two meters) tall and carved from red basalt, they have a small protrusion at the top unknown in Western gravestones. The rust-colored stone is the perfect material for the carved ornate figurations, homages to the deceased, and verses from the Quran.  An ancient settlement with roots dating back at least 4,000 years, Ahlat has seen many shifts in power, oscillating between Persian, Roman, Byzantine, Armenian, Arab, and Ottoman rulers. When the Great Seljuk Empire came to power in this region of Anatolia in the 11th century, they put their stamp on local architecture. There are also two tombs within walking distance and several others in the town of Ahlat, small structures built between the 13th and 16th centuries, each with its own intriguing architecture. Emir Bayındır Tomb, dating from 1481 and visible from the cemetery, is architecturally the most interesting and the symbol of the township.  There are many other Seljuk cemeteries ringing Lake Van, but the one in Ahlat is by far the most picturesque.",

    "description": "The Canary Islands are a popular whale-watching destination, with primarily pilot whales being seen in their waters. In the past this was different and the locals would hunt these creatures. In El Médano, a replica whale spine commemorates this history.  Vertebración y Desvertebración (Vertebration and Desvertebration) is a sandstone sculpture made by Guillermo Batista, which can be found on the easternmost tip of the town. It is a set of two sandstone replicas of whale bones. In one, seven vertebrae are stacked into a large spine and in the other, they are individually placed next to each other.  The piece has a dual meaning. On one hand, it remembers the islands' whaling past, on the other it symbolizes the islands themselves, with each of the seven segments standing for each of the Canary Islands. The first sculpture shows that they belong together, while the latter shows that they also each have their own culture and traditions. Seven individuals are one whole.",
