Our writer wonders if this is the future for winter resortsThe first sign we’re heading into the wild, having left the cosy confines of our resort for a ski touring taster, comes when three mountain goats jump in front of the car, eyeball us skittishly, then launch themselves off a vertiginous drop to our left.My 14-year-old son, in the passenger seat beside me, curses loudly, and I take a deep breath. We drive on, navigating some serious hairpin bends, before arriving in Montespluga, which sits at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres in the Lombardy region of the Italian Alps, about two-and-a-half hours’ drive from Milan.

    "title": "In the National Parks, Fire Crews Do More Than Fight Fires",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/fire-crews-national-parks",
    "description": "This piece was originally published in High Country News and appears here as part of our Climate Desk collaboration. In September 2020, as crews outside Yosemite National Park worked to contain the oncoming Creek Fire and evacuate those in its path, archaeologist Jennie Leonard was racing to protect something that couldn’t leave: the giant sequoias in the Mariposa Grove. Leonard and her fellow resource advisors—who protect species, cultural items, and other resources from wildfire and fire-suppression activities—covered the bases of the ancient trees with structure wrap, a fire-resistant aluminum fabric. Each tree, Leonard recalled, \"looked like a baked potato.\" Resource advisors like Leonard have served on wildfires since the 1970s. The National Park Service has deployed them since the start of this century, and their work has become increasingly critical, said Cedar Drake, a Park Service ecologist who coordinates the agency’s resource-advisor training course. With climate change bringing larger, more frequent, and more destructive fires, resource advisors are needed to guide firefighters in areas where large wildfires have been uncommon, including California’s Redwood National Park and the western reaches of North Cascades National Park in Washington. \"The biggest challenge that I’d say we’re facing is just the scope and scale of fires we’re seeing,\" Drake said. \"Resource advising is one way that we can adapt to climate change (and) be proactive … having folks on the ground that are providing input to the fire managers and the firefighters so that we can be more sustainable in how we manage these fires in the future.\" Between 2019 and 2022, enrollment in the Park Service’s 35-hour resource-advisor training course increased 125 percent compared to the previous four years; more than 2,600 students from federal, state, tribal, and local agencies have been certified since 2020. The free course went online in 2021 and now routinely reaches its 700-person capacity and sometimes requires a waitlist. Resource advisors, or READs, are based at incident command centers, while advisors called REAFs can work on firelines without an escort. Many ecologists, biologists, and archaeologists take the READ course. \"Nobody’s a resource advisor as your job,\" said David Campbell, a biologist and resource advisor at Yosemite National Park and elsewhere. \"We’re all just doing this as an extra duty.\" In big parks like Yosemite, local experts can identify critical resources and advise fire crews during both prescribed burns and wildfires. \"In an ideal world,\" Campbell said, \"we are pulling local folks from the local unit as much as possible to represent the resources they know best.\" But in remote or less well-funded areas, resource advisors are sometimes borrowed from other regions, quickly familiarizing themselves with the landscape so they can advise fire crews on protecting plants, animals, and sacred sites. At Grand Canyon National Park, advisors have access to analog and digital maps showing resources. During fire season, Diné fire archaeologist Jason Nez keeps his communications radio on; when a call comes in, he uses those maps to locate resources in the fire’s path. \"Decision-making can happen fast,\" said Nez, a member of the Navajo Nation who trains new resource advisors. Advisors offer suggestions, not commands, but they learn to quickly identify how to protect resources in a variety of circumstances. On one fire, they might help position a fire crew campsite so that firefighters won’t haul gear through invasive weeds and accidentally spread seeds. On another, they might indicate where a bulldozer can safely construct a fireline to prevent erosion into a salmon-rich stream. In parks that lack the extensive maps and planning abilities of Grand Canyon or Yosemite, the Park Service is developing local unit guides that identify natural and cultural resources, infrastructure, and designated lands and arrange protection measures and communication systems long before fires occur, Drake said. \"We need to start being more proactive in terms of knowing where these sites are and having plans ahead of time in terms of how we’ll respond.\" Once resource advisors have the information they need, they’re faced with the challenge of communicating it during an emergency. \"Oftentimes, they don’t have experience working with fire crews and firefighting techniques,\" said Nez. \"That can add a level of stress for inexperienced resource advisors.\" Trainees need to learn how firelines work as well as how to advocate for resources without disrupting operations, so Nez and other instructors take them on smaller local fires to see how crews operate. Sometimes there’s an us-versus-them mentality between resource advisors and firefighters, but \"I’ve never worked with a crew that has intentionally wanted to damage a resource,\" Leonard said. \"They just don’t know it’s there. Fire folks don’t get the chance to come into our world, and then we launch ourselves into theirs.\" Resource advisors also learn to work with tribes and tribal communities. Dirk Charley, a retired tribal relations program manager for the U.S. Forest Service in California and a member of the Dunlap Band of Mono Indians, said that communication among tribes, resource advisors, and federal and state agencies helped protect a sacred area during the 2021 KNP Complex Fire in Sequoia and Kings Canyon. For tribes, identifying such areas may require \"sharing a tribal map that’s very near and dear to them,\" said Charley, a former wildland firefighter who now trains resource advisors and occasionally serves as a tribal liaison for the Forest Service during California fires. Recently, he showed a class of fire archaeologists how to protect pictographs from smoke and heat damage in the Sierra National Forest by creating defensible spaces before wildfires start. Communication is important long after the smoke clears. \"Everybody goes home after the fire,\" Charley said. \"But the forest, or the park, has a mess. And the tribes, they have a mess.\" Resource advisors are often asked to help with post-fire cleanup. In 2022, Leonard worked with a crew in California that was removing hazardous standing trees. Where cultural artifacts had been exposed by the fire, they used downed trees to create barriers along the road, making the area less accessible to curious visitors. Drake and his team are also developing a template that agencies and communities outside the parks can use to protect resources and thereby avoid \"scrambling to try to gather that information while the fire’s burning,\" he said. The resource-advisor model isn’t limited to fires; the Forest Service also uses resource advisors before, during, and after catastrophic events like floods and hurricanes, which could become more frequent in a changing climate. It also employs them for special events, including unauthorized ones like the annual Rainbow Gathering, said Hilary Markin, a public information officer for the agency’s National Incident Management Team. Large groups can cause soil compaction, water quality, and sanitation problems, and disturb sensitive species and archaeological sites, she said—and they may be more resistant to suggestions than a fire crew. In Yosemite, two years after resource advisors wrapped sequoias at the Creek Fire, the Mariposa Grove was threatened by the fast-moving Washburn Fire. Campbell, who was the lead advisor, worked with a team of sawyers to remove dead and downed wood around the sequoias and pull out flammable duff. Once again, the sequoias survived, but in recent years, more than 14,000 giant sequoias in similar groves have been lost to wildfires—close to 20 percent of the entire species. \"We’re on a trajectory to lose giant sequoias for all of time,\" said Campbell. Tree by tree, resource advisors work to stem that loss, now and for years to come.

    "description": "This article is adapted from the January 11, 2025, edition of Gastro Obscura’s Favorite Things newsletter. You can sign up here. Last week, in a store in Bologna, Italy, I spotted something interesting. Outside on the street, Fiat cars were zipping by. In front of me, a box of chocolates also sported a Fiat logo. These were no recent brand tie-in. In 1911, the car company held a contest between Italy’s chocolate companies, with the goal of releasing a confection to celebrate their new “Tipo 4” model. The winning chocolate, the Fiat cremino, is still sold today. More on that later. Here at Atlas Obscura, we talk a lot about the food available on planes and trains. But what about cars, and their connection to food? It’s easy to think of a car as merely a conveyance to a restaurant, or as the place to eat an unglamorous fast-food meal while on the road. But food and cars go way back. Some people are surprised to learn that the Michelin stars that celebrate the world’s greatest restaurants are doled out by the same company that makes tires. In the early 20th century, though, motorists needed places to go in their new vehicles. In 1900, French brothers André and Édouard Michelin began distributing a booklet of travel information to customers to help them navigate the roads, fill their tanks, and fill their stomachs. Over the years, car manufacturers also got into the game of publishing guides and, in the case of the Ford Motor Company, the occasional cookbook of recipes from restaurants along their recommended routes. But sometimes, car companies go one step further, lending their names to chocolates, sausages, and even iconic pieces of kitchen equipment. This week, we’re exploring a handful of these curious culinary connections. The Fiat Cremino Back to the tale of Fiat chocolates. When the company solicited contest entries, Majani, a business from Bologna, submitted a cremino chocolate with alternating layers of gianduja (hazelnut chocolate) and almond paste. What distinguished it was its four layers instead of the cremino’s usual three: a nod to Fiat’s new Tipo 4. Majani won the competition, and even after the last Tipo 4 put-putted off the road, they continued to sell the Fiat cremino. These days, it comes in several flavors, but the packaging always carries the Fiat logo, rendered as a gleaming sunburst. In the 2021 obituary of company scion Anna Majani, the New York Times related that “Fiat’s president, Gianni Agnelli, once told Ms. Majani that her company sold more Fiat chocolates than he sold cars.” The Volkswagen Currywurst A few years back, sadness took hold of the Gastro Obscura newsroom. We heard that Volkswagen had started to phase out “Product Item No. 199 398 500 A.” This was not a beloved car component. This was Volkswagen’s very own currywurst, with 30 employees turning out 18,000 sausages a day. Said sausages, served in company cafeterias with signature curry ketchup, were also sometimes packaged up and given as thank-you gifts to German VW customers. Even the writing on the casing (Volkswagen Originalteil, or “Volkswagen Original Part”) denoted the sausage as a proud VW product. In 2015 and 2017, the company made more sausages than it did cars. In 2021, Volkswagen decided to swap the sausage at their Wolfsburg headquarters for vegetarian and vegan alternatives, leading to heated speculation that the Volkswagen currywurst was not long for this world. However, this move was undertaken only at the main headquarters, and employees there eventually asked for the original currywurst to come back, which it did in 2023. The company seems to have cottoned on to the absurd appeal of its proprietary currywurst. Last year, to celebrate their 75th anniversary in the USA, Volkswagen of America, Inc., distributed free bottles of “Product Item Number 00010 ZDK-259-101”: their own blend of curry ketchup. The Peugeot Pepper Mill Much like how people are surprised to learn that the Michelin tire company is still directly involved in reviewing restaurants, some are surprised to learn that their fancy pepper grinder can trace its roots to a French car manufacturer. A little background: The Peugeot brand got its start in 1810, when two brothers, Jean-Frédéric and Jean-Pierre II Peugeot, converted their family flour mill into a steel mill, gaining accolades for their springs and saws. It took another three decades for the company to start producing household goods, such as their coffee grinder in 1840. Their pepper mill came along in 1874, with its familiar curvy shape and twisty mechanism. The company christened it the “Model Z,” which, funny enough, wouldn’t be a bad name for a car. However, at this point, Peugeot’s first car was still 15 years away. As Amanda Sims writes for Food52, when you conjure a pepper mill in your mind, you’re thinking of the Peugeot’s design. She also notes that the company refuses to claim the honor of having invented the table-top pepper mill, but they’re so ubiquitous that many people simply assume they did. While Peugeot cars are now made by a giant multinational corporation, the Peugeot family still produces the pepper mills and other kitchen devices as a separate concern.",
