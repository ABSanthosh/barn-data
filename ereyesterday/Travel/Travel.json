This month is viewed as galaxy season in the northern hemisphere, offering the chance to see the Andromeda galaxy, our nearest galactic neighbour, just 2.5m light years away, with the naked eye.

For 1,250 years Benedictine nuns have followed a structured monastic life here, which guests are invited to experience by staying in the convent guesthouse. Meals are provided, with fruit and vegetables from the organic garden. Guests are invited to take part in hourly prayers and spend time in the church, the Chapel of Grace, and the convent museum.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jqd-saltworks-2",
    "description": "After more than a decade of working as a chef in restaurants around North Carolina, Nancy Burns reconnected with her own gastronomic heritage. Her time in the kitchen led to an interest in collecting salts from around the globe. Eventually she started to research her own roots and the history of salt in West Virginia. Burns is the fourth great-granddaughter of the man who started JQ Dickenson Saltworks back in 1817. The saltworks ceased operation in 1945. In 2013, Burns and her brother revived the family business. West Virginia geology has lent itself to salt formations and mining as many know. Burns approaches salt as an  “agricultural product,” not a mineral and uses the sun to evaporate the brine as part of the salt-making process.  Once the salt is harvested from large beds in greenhouses, some of it is with imbued with local flavors such as ramps, mushrooms, and even ghost peppers. Burns also ages some of her salt in bourbon barrels for additional complexity. JQD Saltworks sources a monthly subscription box, which is aimed at teaching people how to creatively use the salts by providing recipe inspiration and education. Seven times a year, the Saltworks host chefs onsite from the region to make a dinner featuring local ingredients and also incorporate the salts. The Saltworks facility is open for tours to see the magic behind the scenes. It is also possible to do a salt tasting in the rustic company store. The store is stocked with both JQD Saltworks items and a variety of artisan goods ranging from soaps to hand-carved wood products made by craftspeople from across Appalachia.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/first-flight-monument",
    "description": "Standing underneath some trees in the southwest corner of Tokyo’s Yoyogi Park is a set of monuments marking the first airplane flight in Japan. The main monument consists of a broad stone structure featuring an eagle with outstretched wings. The first men to fly airplanes in Japan are depicted by busts nearby. While these monuments might seem to celebrate a purely joyous event, the monuments actually have dark undertones. Originally, Yoyogi Park was not a grassy leisure area but instead a military training ground, which is the main reason why Japan’s first aircraft flights took place here. In the early twentieth century, the Japanese military were learning how to use aircraft. Captain Yoshitoshi Tokugawa was sent to France to train there, while Captain Kumazo Hino (who was also known for inventing the Hino-Komuro 1908 pistol) spent time learning to fly in Germany. Both returned to Japan with aircraft that were reassembled and tested at the training grounds in Tokyo on December 19, 1910. Captain Tokugawa took flight first in his French biplane, traveling three kilometers in four minutes and reaching an altitude of 70 meters. Captain Hino then flew his German monoplane a distance of one kilometer in one minute, reaching an altitude of 45 meters. Captains Tokugawa and Hino would continue to serve in the military, and the training grounds at this site would continue to be used by the Japanese Army right up to the end of World War II in 1945, at which point the United States military occupied the site.  Later, when the Olympics were held in Toyko in 1964, this area was used to house the athletes at the event.  Following that, the area was converted into the peaceful park that it is today; the First Flight Monument is one of the very few remaining indications that Yoyogi Park once had a much darker past.",
