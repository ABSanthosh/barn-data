    "description": "From a hidden gem in Nice to a rustic revelation in Beaujolais and a bargain bistro in BrittanyFar away from the tourist traps of the old town, tiny seafood restaurant Coquillages Bouchet on Rue Rusca is a relative newcomer in Nice. Tucked away on a sidestreet near the port, the menu is short and the atmosphere relaxed. The young owners, Nicolas and Hugo, are best friends and their passion for fresh seafood, especially sea urchins and oysters, simply radiates. If you’re after fancy, go to one of the exclusive beach clubs dotted along the coastline. If you want fresh, vibrant and delicious platters of seafood served with charm and glasses of ice-cold white wine, come here.Melanie Clarkson Continue reading...",

And yet, Tal Barahi Temple is a two-story pagoda built on an island in Pokhara, India's Phewa Lake.  The temple is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Barahi. Barahi is known in Nepal as a manifestation of Durga, a major Hindu goddess, and Amija, a group of deities representing female ancestors.  Visitors can access the island by private boat or kayak. The island offers beautiful views of the Annapurna range and World Peace Pagoda on clear days.",

It is home to the 100-ton Rycom aquarium in an otherwise unassuming location for marine wildlife.  This 100-ton aquarium houses fish representing the region's native marine inhabitants. More than 1,000 fish representing dozens of species are located within the aquarium, along with spineless aquatic invertebrates like sea cucumbers and stars. The aquarium overlaps with the first-floor elevator, giving shoppers a chance to observe animals like the endangered Napoleon wrasse. Two-inch clownfish can be seen mingling with zebra sharks reaching nearly 14 feet in length, while massive moray eels swim alongside schools of damselfish and cardinalfish.  Staff from the nearby Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium care for the Rycom aquarium, ensuring the safety of endemic fish and quality of the mall facilities.",
