    "description": "Austria’s upgraded sleeper proves an exciting way to travel between two absorbing, family-friendly cities for our writer and her young daughtersToasted ham baguettes in hand, we cheered as the new-generation Nightjet drew into Vienna Hauptbahnhof. It was a little before 7pm, and as the carriages hummed past I felt a rush of joy, like celebrity trainspotter Francis Bourgeois, but without the GoPro on my forehead. For more than three years I’ve been documenting the renaissance of sleeper trains, and I’d wondered if I might one day tire of them. But the thrill seems only to intensify each time I embark on another nocturnal adventure, this time with my two daughters – aged eight and five – who were already arguing over the top berth. The first four carriages were designated for travellers to the Italian port city of La Spezia, the other seven carrying on to Roma Tiburtina, where we would alight at 10am. Once in Rome we had 24 hours to eat classic carbonara, dark chocolate gelato, and bike around the Villa Borghese before taking a train to Florence.Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) has played the lead role in resuscitating Europe’s night trains. Towards the end of 2016, ÖBB launched its Nightjet network on 14 routes, using old rolling stock it bought from Deutsche Bahn. Then, to the delight of train nerds like me, it launched a brand-new fleet at the end of 2023, and now operates 20 routes across Europe. We were now on board this high-spec service, which smelled of freshly unpacked furniture, the carpets soft underfoot, the lighting adjustable to disco hues of neon blue and punk pink.

    "description": "Casa Cueva, or “Cave House,” was designed by the Mexican architect Juan O’Gorman as his family home, built on a lava bed in the Jardines del Pedregal neighborhood of Mexico City. In 1969, it was acquired and transformed by the artist Helen Escobedo, who demolished parts of it to build her residence, sparking a longstanding controversy that remains a subject of heated discourse in local architectural and artistic circles. The building is now a music school without public access, but parts of the original structure remain, including a rocky facade with O’Gorman's original multicolored mosaics.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/babe-ruth-and-cecil-b-demille-banyan-trees",
    "description": "In the early 1930's, tourism was still new to Hawaii and local leaders on all of the islands were seeking ways to make their locations stand out. In 1933, the city fathers of Hilo decided to invite famous visitors to plant banyan saplings along a circular drive on Waiakea Peninsula, near Hilo International Airport. This campaign began with American director Cecil B. DeMille in 1933. Later that year, after the World Series, baseball star Babe Ruth visited Hawaii for some exhibition games and also planted a tree in front of what is now the Hilo Hawaiian hotel.  At the time, \"The Babe\" was perhaps the most famous person in America. Over time, the area disappeared from the tourists' radars as the drier Kona coast took most of the Big Island's vacationers.  Plans for more hotels were never completed.  One of the attractions in the area, Uncle Billy’s Hilo Bay Hotel, was closed, condemned, and left vacant, attracting drugs and illegal activity to the area. Today, the Hawaii state government is attempting to restore the area to something approaching its former glory. More than two trees were planted in the 1930's — there are some which were planted by Amelia Earhart, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and several notable actors.  Though not all banyans survived the tsunamis that hit Hilo in 1946, 1960 and 1964, those that did are now past 90 years old and far grander than saplings!",
