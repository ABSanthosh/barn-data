    "description": "This week, the Channel Islands celebrate 80 years since liberation from Nazi occupation, but the fascinating bunkers, tunnels and towers that remain have found a new lease of lifeI’m woken by a tractor uprooting jersey royals in the potato field next door. In my simple hexagonal room, dawn illuminates five high slit windows marked with military coordinates and a compass etched into the ceiling. But heading downstairs, I timeslip into a 19th-century lounge where gothic-style windows frame sea views in three directions.During the second world war, Jersey’s occupying forces requisitioned Nicolle Tower, a whimsical two-storey folly, and added an extra level. In what is now the bedroom, German soldiers kept lookout for an allied invasion that never came. Continue reading...",

So I have come to see how it works in practice, aiming to travel to the country’s little known vineyards hugging the slopes along the Moselle River and then trek through the mysterious canyons and forests of the Mullerthal region.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/creek-street-district",
    "description": "Creek Street is one of the most popular attractions in Ketchikan, Alaska, and right away, visitors get a sense of its kitschy history. You'll note that everything is on stilts; legend has it that because prostitution was illegal on land, those stilts were the result of resourceful Alaskans finding a way to make it work. Creek Street was Ketchikan's red-light district up until the late 1920s. A century ago, it was filled with bootleggers, fishermen, and brothels. The main attraction is Dolly's House, a former \"house of ill repute\" which is now a museum dedicated to what Creek Street used to be. Creek Street's sort of \"separation\" from the main area of the city and convenient positioning on an ample creek made it a great place to conduct debauchery, as you could come and go in the cover of night without anyone being the wiser. There is even a street named \"Married Man's Trail,\" which has a staircase and trail leading to the back doors of the row of houses. In theory, this allowed men to discreetly take a walk down through the woods to visit Creek Street. Today, there are a number of cute shops along Creek Street offering souvenirs, handmade goods, and other one-of-a-kind Alaskan-made wares. There's also an excellent bookstore at the edge of Creek Street that is a must-visit for any bibliophile. Be sure to check out the salmon run and ladder near the end of Married Man's Trail, where you can watch salmon swimming upstream and, if you're lucky, catch a great picture of them jumping! You can also go fishing while you're in town at Creek Street - there are a couple of places where you can rent gear and get a fishing license for the day.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/winter-hill-gang-hq",
    "description": "Today, the structure at 12-14 Marshall Street in the Winter Hill neighborhood of Somerville, Massachusetts, houses a church. But it was once the central headquarters of the Winter Hill Gang and the site of grisly acts of violence. In the 1960s and 1970s, the back room of Marshall Motors was where Howard T. Winter, John Matorano, and Whitey Bulger—who was once the second most wanted man in America after Osama Bin Laden—held court and presided over their empire. Their exploits have been the inspiration for countless books and movies. When the Church of God acquired the property in 2008, the garage's infamous trapdoor, which led to a basement where the Winter Hill Gang tortured or disposed of their rivals, was still intact. Pastor Colin Green of the current church says he has \"rebuked anything in there, in the name of Jesus.\" Probably only of interest for true gangland aficionados (or those in the Winter Hill area looking for a Sunday service), 12-14 Marshall Street nonetheless has a significant place in the history of organized crime in the United States.",
