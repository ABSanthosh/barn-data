    "description": "Where his family once farmed on a wild fringe of the Lycian shoreline, one man has built his dream retreatAged seven or eight, planting onions on his father’s land above Kabak Bay, Fatih Canözü saw his first foreigner. Before the road came in 1980, his village on the jagged coast of south-west Turkey’s Lycia region was extremely remote, isolated by steep valleys and mountains plunging into the sea. It took his family two days to get to the city of Fethiye on winding donkey tracks, to sell their apricots, vegetables and honey at the market. Despite his shock at seeing the outside world intrude for the first time, Canözü remembers thinking even then that tourism was the future.Four decades on and having trained as a chef, Canözü has not only built a restaurant and 14 tourist cabins in Kabak, he has married a foreigner too: a former Middle East correspondent from England, who came here to research a novel and ended up falling in love. Now they are raising their family on this wild fringe of Anatolia’s Turquoise Coast, a region that Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founding father of the Republic of Turkey, is said to have called the most beautiful in the country.

    "description": "Tucked away beneath the breathtaking Linh Phước Temple in Da Lat — a kaleidoscope of mosaics made from tiny shards of glass and ceramic — lies something entirely unexpected: a creepy basement exhibit that plunges visitors into the terrifying legend of Mục Liên’s 18 Gates of Hell. Mục Liên, also known as Maudgalyāyana, is said in Buddhist scripture to have made multiple trips to hell, to rescue his mother from suffering.  Accessed through an unmarked stairway at the back of a souvenir shop beneath the temple, the descent into this underworld begins subtly—but quickly turns surreal. Inside, a dim, cavernous maze is lined with grotesque papier-mâché figures frozen in eternal torment, each tableau vividly portraying one of the Buddhist hells reserved for sinners of all kinds. Screaming souls, decaying demons, and grim-faced judges guide you through the moral allegory of karmic justice, all narrated by eerie audio echoing through the darkness in Vietnamese. This immersive exhibit is both kitsch and chilling, an offbeat spiritual warning nestled below one of Vietnam’s most beautiful temples. It’s a jarring contrast — and one you’ll never forget.",

    "title": "Lighthouse of Jára Cimrman in Kořenov, Czechia",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lighthouse-of-jara-cimrman",
    "description": "Imagine taking one groundbreaking invention after another to the patent office and the clerk uncompromisingly telling you now, now, he was already here. You must have met him — a certain Alexander Graham Bell.\" This is just one of the wacky incidents shown in the 1983 Czechoslovak mockumentary \"Jara Cimrman Lying, Sleeping\" (Czech: Jára Cimrman ležící, spící\"). It also shows, for example, that Cimrman bent the original model of the Eiffel Tower, which is why it looks the way it does today. And when Guglielmo Marconi complained that Cimrman, flying in a hot air balloon, had broken his telegraph wires, he replied that he should make it work wirelessly. In short, Jára Cimrman was a versatile genius to whom we owe almost every notable invention. But he never existed — he was created for a radio program in 1966. He is said to have created a philosophical movement called externalism, the opposite of solipsism, and Cimrman claimed that everything existed except himself. He compared himself to a hole in a piece of paper that can be seen even though it is not a physical entity. His nonexistence did not prevent him from winning the national Greatest Czech poll in 2005, but Czech Television did not want to recognize the victory of someone who never existed. Cimrman was disqualified, and the official winner was Charles IV (1316–1378), Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia. However, many Czechs haven't given up the fight for Cimrman's recognition and continue to strive to spread awareness about his achievements. To this end, they have placed dozens of celebratory signs across Bohemia sporting slogans like \"Jára Cimrman probably never lived in this place.\" One of his most important contributions, however, is the Jára Cimrman Lighthouse, located in a place where the sea cannot be seen. Given the mountainous nature of the area, it may be the highest lighthouse on Earth. It also serves as a lookout tower, and in the building below lies the Jára Cimrman Museum, full of his inventions and personal belongings. Its exhibits include a broom for sweeping corners, a portable tourist signpost, curved scissors for cutting all nails at the same time, a double-sided rake, a hand saw with animal teeth, a two-piece swimsuit, a stuffed flying rabbit-grouse hybrid, a soup bowl with a sink stopper, a portable prison cell, bicycle handlebars made of ram horns, and many more inventions. It also contains Cimrman's shapeless self-bust, damaged during the steaming of hats, so no one knows his true appearance. Other curious Cimrman factoids include that when he was escaping from enemies near the North Pole, he missed it by seven meters and therefore is not considered to have discovered it. He also invented the CD, which originally stood for \"Cimrman's disk\", but after its re-invention in 1979 it was renamed the \"compact disk\". Cimrman's disk was different in that it was not made of artificial polycarbonate, but of beeswax, so it was more environmentally friendly. Cimrman also left behind a number of plays which are continuously found and interpreted by the Jára Cimrman Theater. All of his plays are preceded by short pseudoscientific lectures, where \"cimrmanologists\" provide the audience with the necessary knowledge to better understand the following jokes. And since the actors style themselves as scientists, they eschew artistic demands, allowing themselves to be awkward and comically stiff. However, the Jára Cimrman Theater is located in a different location.",
