    "description": "The crowds have left and the elements reign supreme on an off-season escape to NewquaySurfers are bobbing in the whitewater shallows off Newquay’s Fistral Beach, poised for that ecstatic moment when a barrelling Atlantic roller will propel them to their feet. Then it arrives – the Big One. Despite the biting cold the surfers rise in unison, carving into the wave’s lip with effortless balletic grace.There’s something quite magical about Cornwall off-season. Gone are the crowds; this is the time when the elements reign supreme. Storm Éowyn recently made that very clear, hammering the coast with brutal winds and booming surf. But even in calmer periods, the landscape feels untamed, an unpredictable theatre of darkened skies, crashing waves and howling gusts. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/viking-longboat",
    "description": "Upon the River Anton as it passes through Andover, a Viking vessel stands as a whimsical reminder of a far less peaceful era when Norse raiders struck fear into the heart of Anglo-Saxon England. This ship is neither a museum piece, nor a meticulous reconstruction, but rather a blend of public art, local history, and floral fancy. Rather than cleaving the waves of the North Sea primed to pillage, Andover’s longboat began its life as something far more delicate: a flower display for the Test Valley in Bloom Millennium celebrations.  The sculpture remembers the relationship between Olaf Tryggvason and the town. In the late 10th century, the Norseman and his raiding parties proved such a persistent threat that King Ethelred was compelled to pay a substantial sum of tribute money, Danegeld, to appease the Vikings, and protect the kingdom. In addition to this, Olaf became a Christian and was baptized in Andover, vowing never to invade England again.  In 2022, weathered steel figures ‘boarded’ the ship as part of a regeneration of the area around the town's mills. The figures were each inspired by authentic Norse depictions found on excavated coins and Viking artifacts.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-world-time-today",
    "description": "Within a wall of London’s bustling Piccadilly Circus Underground Station, a curious contraption circumnavigates the globe. The result of a collaboration between architect Charles Holden and John Mowlem \u0026 Company, ‘The World Time Today’ was integrated into the station during its expansion and redesign in 1928. This unique linear clock features a westward-scrolling time band across the equator that moves at the same pace as the Earth's rotation, tracking the passage of time across the globe. Small illuminated light bulbs draw attention to select cities: London, Cape Town, Sydney, New York, Victoria (Canada), and Buenos Aires, a symbol of the burgeoning global consciousness of the interwar period,   Though the timepiece doesn’t provide pinpoint accuracy due to the varying nature of global time zones, The World Time Today is fascinating to watch. Since the map remains as it was in the 1920s, it is curious to admire as a record of the geopolitics of the early 20th century.",
