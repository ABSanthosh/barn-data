The farm has some lovely showers and toilets, and nothing else apart from beautiful fields full of meadow grass. The swifts and swallows dart along the top of the grass to eat bugs at dawn and dusk. All day long you can hear beautiful birdsong from birds such as skylarks. The fields run alongside the beautiful coastal path, which has a hedgerow full of wildflowers and birds. This is the most beautiful place on Earth (when it isn’t raining). The numerous beaches are full of soft white sands. Our children have grown up playing free in the fields on their yearly holiday – no computers, just outdoor fun.Em Continue reading...",

    "description": "The Maasroute is the ideal entry-level, multiday bike trip for young children – flat with plenty of riverside cafes, family-friendly campsites and ice-cream stops en routeAs early as I can remember, I’ve always got a thrill out of poring over a map, tracing wavy river lines with my fingers, roads that connect and borders that divide – all the routes I could take. The freedom of heading out on my bike and not knowing where I’m going to pitch my tent that night. Now that my children are aged seven and nine, I wanted to introduce them to the liberation of this kind of adventure. They adore a day out on their bikes, but this was to be our first multiday bike trip as a family of four, so it was crucial to find a route easy and fun enough to captivate them.The Maasroute follows the course of the Maas River as it meanders for 300 miles (484km) through the Netherlands, from the inland city of Maastricht to the Hook of Holland, then loops back to Rotterdam. It forms part of the much longer Meuse cycle route (EuroVelo 19) that stretches from the source of the Maas (or Meuse as it’s known in France) on the Langres plateau, travelling through the French and Belgian Ardennes before crossing into the Netherlands.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tsunami-walking-tour",
    "description": "Geographic features make Crescent City, California, particularly vulnerable to tsunamis. Much of the small town, located 20 miles south of the Oregon border, is only a few feet above sea level and the crescent shape of the bay amplifies wave intensity. The Mendocino fracture zone, an irregularity in an underwater ridge, is also believed to focus wave action on the community. Since the first tide gauge was installed in Crescent City in 1933, more than 30 tsunamis have occurred there. However, oral histories of local native people and geological evidence suggest that tsunamis have battered the Northern California coast for centuries. The worst recorded tsunami in Crescent City occurred in the early hours of March 28, 1964. An Alaskan earthquake of magnitude 9.2 caused waves to surge south along the western coast of North America. Not quite five hours after the seismic disruption, three small waves washed into Crescent City, resulting in minimal damage along the waterfront and a false sense that what had taken place could be overcome. The fourth wave, which was preceded by the harbor draining completely to the sea floor, crested at nearly 21 feet and slammed into the downtown. The catastrophic wave killed 11 people, injured another 24, and devastated 29 city blocks, two-thirds of Crescent City. Over 289 commercial buildings and homes were destroyed, with an estimated value of more than $14 million (over $140 million in 2025). According to the University of Southern California’s Tsunami Research Center, the event remains “the largest and most destructive recorded tsunami to ever strike the United States Pacific Coast.” Gone was the 19th-century town that developed following the discovery of gold and was built economically upon the logging industry. Rebuilding began almost immediately and continued for a period of years. The land between Front Street and the Pacific Ocean was elevated 10 feet and, except for a few civic buildings, repurposed as Beachfront Park. The Army Corps of Engineers installed wave-dissipating concrete blocks, known as dolosse, to fortify the jetty. And Crescent City produced its tsunami walking tour, nine two-sided panels that on one face look back at the 1964 tragedy and on the reverse, advise residents and visitors how to prepare in the case of a future event. Development of the waterfront park and the history of Army Corps interventions are among the topics presented on the didactic panels. Also described is how the civil defense systems at the time were inadequate and a tragic rescue attempt resulted in almost half of the 11 deaths. The northern boundary of the Redwood National and State Parks is just south of Crescent City and there are numerous informative National Park Service signs in the area in addition to those that make up the tsunami walking trail.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/madam-yokos-gravesite",
    "description": "The British colony of Sierra Leone had been founded in 1792 with the settlement in Freetown. As the 19th century progressed, the colony expanded its influence and control farther inland. This was spurred further by the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, and in 1896 the British declared a protectorate over hinterlands of Sierra Leone. In was in this era of increasing British influence that the girl Soma was born, around 1849. Upon coming of age, she adopted the name Yoko during her Sande society initiation. Her first start in politics was likely during the marriage to her second husband, the Taiama chief Gbenjei. After Gbenjei’s death, Yoko married Gbanya Lango, a powerful war chief. This marriage would bring her into contact with the British authorities; when Gbanya Lango was imprisoned by British colonial officials, Yoko went to Governor Rowe to plead his case. Reportedly impressed with Yoko, Governor Rowe flogged but then released Gbanya. Her third husband died in 1878, leaving Madam Yoko in position to take over as kor mahei, or war chief, of the Kpa Mende. Using shrewd political tactics, force, and British support, Madam Yoko united fourteen Kpa Mende chiefdoms. By 1884 she was known as “Queen of Senehun.” The creation of the British protectorate, and the colony’s subsequent efforts to impose a “Hut Tax” caused a crisis in Sierra Leone, leading to the Hut Tax War of 1898. When Madam Yoko ordered her people to pay the tax, they rebelled, causing Madam Yoko to flee into the protection of the British. The resistance was unsuccessful, and for demonstrating her loyalty, the British rewarded Madam Yoko with a silver medal from Queen Victoria, and elevated her to Paramount Chief. Madam Yoko continued to rule as Paramount Chief until her death in 1906. She was buried in the town of Moyamba. Her grave was declared a national monument in Sierra Leone in 2016 and resides within what is now a market area in the town. It is identified by two plaques, one placed by her family’s descendants and another by Sierra Leone’s Monuments and Relics Commission.",
