    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/geneva-skateboard-musuem",
    "description": "Since skateboarding first emerged in the 1940s and 50s, the sport has evolved a lot. The boards are more advanced and the tricks are bigger, faster, and more complex. One thing that hasn't changed much over time though, is the urge to put art on the bottom of the boards. You can see this in the collection at the Geneva Skateboard Museum, which showcases boards from different eras of skateboarding. The museum is made and run by Jim Zbinden, who has had the dream of this museum in mind for nearly 30 years. The first iteration of the museum came in the early 2000s. Hundreds of skateboards were displayed to show the intricate and unique art that has been a part of skateboarding culture for the last seven decades.  In the museum's current location, you'll find three floors where each inch of wall and ceiling space is covered with skateboards and skateboard paraphernalia. The collection has everything from old used boards to new display boards to boards that belonged to famous skaters like Tony Hawk. This makes the museum interesting even for those who have never touched a skateboard in their lives.",

    "description": "The Ghost Lore Museum in Jiufen, Taiwan, explores Taiwan’s rich traditions of ghost stories, superstitions, and afterlife beliefs. Located in Jiufen—a mountain town famous for its mist-shrouded scenery, narrow alleyways, and vibrant tea houses—the museum immerses visitors in the spiritual and supernatural aspects of Taiwanese culture. While the museum only includes a couple of rooms, it is full of items and statues that showcase the diverse types of spirits and ghosts prominent in Taiwanese and East Asian folklore. It features iconic spirits like the gui (ghosts of those who suffered an unjust or tragic death) and jiangshi (the “hopping” vampires of Chinese myth). Explanatory panels accompany life-sized models, artifacts, and illustrations, offering a glimpse into the roles these spirits play in Taiwanese belief systems and rituals. Hidden inside a cabinet, a grotesque Krasue—a Southeast Asian demon with the internal organs exposed and connected to a flying female head—welcomes the visitor by repeating what they said while opening the door. One of the highlights is the depiction of the Hungry Ghost Festival, an important event in Taiwan and other East Asian countries, when it’s believed that the gates of the underworld open, allowing spirits to visit the living. This exhibit showcases offerings, lanterns, and other ceremonial objects used to appease wandering souls, along with life-sized models that recreate festival scenes. The museum displays a collection of traditional talismans, amulets, and symbols that people use to ward off evil spirits or attract good luck, especially related to Taoism. Visitors can learn about the symbolism behind each item and how they’re used in rituals to protect against misfortune or mischief from vengeful spirits, including a sword made of coins used by Taoist exorcists. The place is built as an open photo booth, where visitors can take pictures while using the items around, lying inside coffins, or joining a set of heads inside jars.",
