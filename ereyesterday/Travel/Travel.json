Chef Bertílio Gomes’s family comes from this southern region, and his seasonal, constantly changing menu features dishes such as octopus with sweet potato and razor-clam soup, which evoke balmy summer days and demand a chilled glass of rosé. Daily specials (available only at lunchtime) might be a bifana (pork sandwich) or duck rice. Mains start at €17.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-station-toronto",
    "description": "Museum Station, a subway stop on Toronto’s Line 1 Yonge-University, isn’t like most stations—its pillars are sculpted to resemble cultural and historical figures from ancient civilizations, making it one of the most visually striking stops in the city. In 2008, the station underwent a major renovation that transformed its support columns into large-scale replicas of artifacts, turning the station into an underground gallery of world civilizations. Among these designs are Egyptian deities, Toltec warriors, Greek Doric columns, and motifs from Beijing’s Forbidden City. The theme was chosen to reflect the influence of the nearby Royal Ontario Museum, one of Canada’s most important cultural institutions. The walls and ceiling colors were also updated to complement the new look, making the space feel more like a museum exhibit than a transit stop.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/reserve-ecologique-des-barails-twin-cities-gardens",
    "description": "North of Bordeaux, tucked within a park known as la Réserve écologique des Barails, the twin cities gardens have been designed to make visitors feel as if they have been magically and instantly transported to other parts of the world.   Built around pieces donated by Bordeaux's sister cities, the 11 gardens within the twin cities recreate a little bit of Germany, Spain, Japan, Morocco, and other destinations. Highlights include the Munich garden, complete with benches and statues; Madrid, with lamppost, drinking fountain, and dustbins; the photogenic Moorish mosaics in the Casablanca garden; and the peaceful Japanese garden representing Fukuoka.  The twin cities gardens were first created in 1992 in Parc Floral as part of a partnership with an international flower festival, Les Floralies Internationales de Bordeaux. Over the years, the landscaped park (which includes an extensive rose garden and even a manmade mountain stream flowing through rocks from the Pyrenees) and neighboring forest have become a haven for joggers, ramblers, and cyclists. Cultural events are also occasionally held there.  The twin cities gardens have gradually fallen into disrepair, but still offer a beautiful urban escape, all within easy reach on the city’s tram network and a stone’s throw from Bordeaux’s main sports stadium.",
