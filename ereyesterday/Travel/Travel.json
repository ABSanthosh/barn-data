    "description": "Move over wild swimming … ice diving in a frozen mountain lake and camping under the Milky Way connects you with nature at its most raw and magicalIt’s five below freezing on the ice-caked surface of a lake in the French Alps and, as I prepare to slip, seal-like, into the black water, my racing mind is begging me to wimp out. Diving in a frozen lake at night – below ice, beneath the stars, at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres? What an absurd idea.An hour ago, I was inside a tiny mountain refuge beside Lac Robert drinking tea, the temperature outside dropping by the second. Now, I’m outdoors and zipped into a cumbersome drysuit (designed to prevent water from entering), with blue latex gauntlets sealed at the wrists and a black frogman hood wrenched over my head.

    "description": "A slow jaunt around the mountainous national park, on some of the highest roads in Britain, delivers dramatic scenery, frosty walks and ziplining after darkThe road north takes us through a landscape muted by frost, the hills hazy beneath the milky winter sun. My friend Anna and I are heading for the Cairngorms in a red campervan called Rowan, which we picked up from Big Sky Campers, just across the Forth from Edinburgh. It’s an appropriate name, for we see the red berries of rowan trees everywhere we go, shining so brightly it’s as though someone’s strung tiny clusters of baubles on the silver-barked branches.At 1,748 square miles, the Cairngorms is the UK’s largest national park, stretching from Perthshire in the south to Moray in the north; mountains rear up just after we pass the riverside village of Dunkeld, armed with pastries from Aran Bakery. When I’ve been up here before, I’ve only skirted the edge of the park, sticking close to the hiking-shop-crammed town of Aviemore and seeing the hills – cloaked in snow at Easter and resplendent in purple heather in summer – from afar.

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/clocks-of-st-george-s-basilica",
    "description": "When St. George’s Basilica in Victoria, Malta, was built in 1678, its front façade included two circular spaces that could be used for either sundials or clocks so that people in the square in front of the church could tell the time.  However, these circular spaces were left blank for centuries until the basilica underwent restoration work between 2019 and 2022, at which point in time the parish decided to install clocks in the front façade. The parish employed local artist John Grima to work on the clocks. However, both the artist and the parish noted that everyone today was surrounded by timekeeping devices and that no one needed another clock to be able to see what time it was. They therefore decided to install two different types of clock that presented time in a completely different way. Both clocks are made of marble and have single bronze pointers. The one on the east tower (as seen on the left when looking at the front façade) bears the Greek letter Alpha. The circumference is mostly surrounded by what appear to be minute marks except that the clock has more than 60 of these marks and that a small gap appears to exist between the 0 and 3 minute position. The single bronze dial on this clock does not move but instead points to the clockwise side of the gap in the tick marks. This clock represents time—not in the normal sense, but rather in a spiritual sense. It symbolically indicates that Jesus Christ (the Alpha) arrived at the right time, with his actions piercing into the chronological time of humanity. The clock on the west tower (as seen on the right when looking at the front façade) features the Greek letter Omega. The circumference is mostly blank except for five minute marks just before the 0 minutes position. The single dial of this clock tells the hour much like a conventional clock, and it is meant to indicate that time is still moving towards the second coming of Jesus Christ. The average traveler passing through the square in front of the basilica may not even pay much attention to the clocks, and many people who do notice might simply be confused by the clocks’ appearance, but the visitors who take the time to research the history of the clocks will have a deeper understanding of the artwork’s theological interpretation.",

    "title": "Atlas Obscura’s Juiciest Pope Drama",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/juicy-pope-drama",
    "description": "In the 2024 film Conclave, which received eight Oscar nominations including Best Picture, the process of selecting a new pope reveals skeletons in each candidate’s closet. Although the story is fictional, the real-life papacy has had no shortage of secrets and scandals over the centuries. Here are seven of Atlas Obscura’s favorite tales of wild, shocking, or just plain peculiar goings-on behind the Vatican’s walls. The Unsolved Case of the Attempted Assassination of Pope John Paul IIBy Matthew Blitz In 1981, Mehmet Ali Ağca shot Pope John Paul II multiple times during a public appearance with the intent to kill. The pope survived and publicly forgave his assailant, while Ağca served a 19-year prison sentence in Italy before being sent back to his native Turkey, where he served additional time and has mainly kept a low profile since his release. But what were Ağca’s true motives? And was he acting independently, or did others play a role? Long after John Paul II’s death from natural causes in 2005, the circumstances surrounding the attempted assassination remain clouded in mystery and conspiracy. Found: Pope John Paul II’s Letters to a Lady FriendBy Sarah Laskow Another source of speculation in the life of Pope John Paul II is his relationship with a female philosopher named Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka. They met in 1973, five years before he became the pope, and remained close for over 30 years until his death. While not openly scandalous, the many letters they exchanged over the years reveal an unusual degree of intimacy. “I am thinking about you, and in my thoughts I come to Pomfret [Tymieniecka’s home] every day,” the pope wrote toward the end of his life as his health declined. The Cadaver Synod: When a Pope’s Corpse Was Put on TrialBy Elizabeth Harper Intense political infighting within the early Church led to the Synodus Horrenda or Cadaver Synod of 897. The short version is that one pope had another pope’s dead body exhumed and forced the corpse to stand trial for crimes he was accused of in life. This bizarre, but true, story ushered in one of the most corrupt eras in the history of the papacy, a time that’s now referred to in all seriousness as the pornocracy. Europe’s First Pornographic Blockbuster Was Made in the VaticanBy Esther Inglis-Arkell And speaking of porn and the Vatican, it’s rumored that salacious paintings once decorated the walls of the 16th-century Constantine Room in the papal apartments. Whether they were deliberately commissioned by a licentious pope or placed out of spite by a disgruntled painter is unknown. The paintings are said to have inspired The Sixteen Pleasures, a book of erotic engravings that circulated widely (despite the Vatican’s best efforts to censor it by imprisoning the author). That Time Portugal’s King Gifted an Elephant to the PopeBy Devon Field Poor Hanno the elephant. Born in Portuguese-controlled India, he suffered the discomfort of a long voyage to Europe, where he drew massive crowds when he was presented to Pope Leo X in 1514. Though prized by the pope, Hanno survived only a short time in ill health before being buried under the Vatican. Fueled by human greed for prestige and entertainment, Hanno’s journey came at the expense of his well-being—a tale still too often the case with elephants today. When the Pope Made 10 Days DisappearBy Cara Giaimo The Earth does not take an even number of days to make one journey around the Sun, and by the late 16th century, the Julian calendar used in much of Europe was gradually getting out of sync with the changing seasons. So to keep Church holidays like Easter and Christmas at the same time of year, Pope Gregory XIII came up with a novel solution: He decreed that 10 days in October 1582 would be skipped. But as you can imagine, disappearing more than a week from the calendar created some problems. Found in the Garbage: A Supposed Bone of a First-Century PopeBy Christina Ayele Djossa In 2017, Enviro Waste, a U.K. waste removal company, discovered something highly unusual in a London trash bin: a red wax–sealed box containing a small piece of human bone. An attached inscription identified the bone as belonging to Pope Clement I, who lived so long ago that few details of his life are known with certainty. Papal remains can sometimes end up in unusual places (the heart of Pope Pius VI is in France, while the rest of his body is in the Vatican), but the discovery of Clement’s alleged reliquary in London raised a host of unanswered questions. Was it genuine? And just how did it get not only to London, but into the trash?",
