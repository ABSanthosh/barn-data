  "description": "Počitelj is a charming historic fortified village located in the south of Bosnia and Herzegovina, along the Neretva River. The village has medieval Ottoman architecture built on a hillside, with stone houses, narrow streets, and fortress in the top of the hill that gives you an amazing panoramic view from the region. The town was first mentioned on records from the 15th century, but it was likely founded even earlier, in the late 14th century. Počitelj played a significant role in controlling access along the Neretva River and was an important administrative and military center during the Ottoman period. Some importants places of Počitelj are the Počitelj Fortress, Sahat Kula (Clock Tower), Šišman Ibrahim Pasha Mosque, Hammam (Turkish Bath).",
