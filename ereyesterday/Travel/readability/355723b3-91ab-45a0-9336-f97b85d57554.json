  "description": "In 1962, a partial mastodon skeleton was unearthed in Tualatin near where its public library now stands. Originally on display at Portland State University until being stored away sometime in the 1970s, the nearly half-complete skeleton was cleaned and restored for display in the library. The exhibit is offset against a frosted glass image of what the mastodon would look like in life. The mastodon was a female who expired in her 20s and is believed to have died about 14,000 years ago.  Many other ice age artifacts are on display in the library including the sacrum (a bone connected to the pelvis) of a giant ground sloth, mammoth bones and bones from other animals. Additional pieces include small glacial erratics, and replicas of an ancient bison skull, mastodon tooth, and mastodon tusk.",
