  "description": "Near the north end of Hlavná, the main street in Prešov, Slovakia, there is a monument to the 49th parallel north. The monument is inscribed in English (presumably the missing inscription on the other side was in Slovak): \"The 49N parallel of latitude runs through the town of Prešov. It is known that this parallel—a unique animal kind—is spread from the Arctic pole to the equatorial primeval forests but to observe it in person... well, you are doing it right here, right now. There are only a few human mortals who have seen the parallel and you are lucky to be one of them. Warning: no feeding, no teasing, stroking only on your own risk.\"",
