And I’d know, as it wasn’t long ago that I flew 19 hours across the world with my 3-month-old. A newborn or young infant cannot be reasoned with nor can they sit in front of a screen or snack on treats. What do you pack for an infant on a long flight? Where do you even put the baby? And that’s all before accounting for the side eye you get from fellow passengers bracing themselves for screaming and crying.A little groundwork, though, can go a long way toward easing some of that stress, said James Howard, a Delta Air Lines cabin manager and father of a toddler. You might even enjoy it, he added.Advance planningIf you are flying internationally, your baby, no matter how young, will need a passport. You can apply for one online, mail in supporting evidence, like a birth certificate, and then show up in person for an appointment. The process can take roughly three months though you can pay to expedite it. You will need a passport photo though the State Department concedes that the baby can be lying down for the photo and “it is acceptable if your infant’s eyes are not entirely open.”If you know you will travel in the first few months of your baby’s life, you can add your child to your airline ticket even before they’re born, said Brian Kelly, founder of the Points Guy website and a father of two. Your airline would use a placeholder name (usually “Baby” and your last name). Then, closer to your travel dates, update your booking with their legal name.For most domestic U.S. flights, infants can travel free on the lap of an accompanying adult, though many experts don’t think this is safe; on international flights, you might be charged a portion of your fare.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
