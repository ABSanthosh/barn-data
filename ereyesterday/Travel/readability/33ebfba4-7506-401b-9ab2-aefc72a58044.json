  "description": "In Welsh tradition, a caerdroia is a turf maze typically imitating the Cretan labyrinth of Greek mythology. Translated as either a \"Castle of Turning\" for its many twists or the \"Walls of Troy,\" in reference to The Iliad's fabled lost city, these mysterious paths could once be found throughout this region. The paths typically lead to a raised hillock, thought to have once been used in ritual dances. Much of the folklore surrounding these turf mazes has been lost.  In 2005, a caerdroia was brought back to life in Gwydir Forest, Conwy, a scenic woodland in the Snowdonia region. A social enterprise based in Llanrwst called Golygfa Gwydyr, Theatre Cynefin, and local youths contributed to its creation. Measuring roughly a mile in length, it is thought to be the largest forest labyrinth in the world. Visitors are invited to embark on a meditative wander through its many turns.",
