  "description": "The Corbeille of Nefta (La Corbeille de Nefta) is a unique natural and historical site located in the oasis town of Nefta in southern Tunisia, near the Algerian border. Known for its stunning beauty, the natural springs here water nearly half a million date palms, one of the largest collections of the trees in the world, as well as ancient irrigation channels, which have sustained the local population for centuries. The name \"Corbeille,\" which means \"basket\" in French, refers to the shape of the area, which resembles a basket as it dips into the surrounding desert landscape, creating an oasis of lush greenery amidst the arid environment. The Corbeille of Nefta is a testament to the ingenuity of ancient agricultural techniques, particularly the traditional methods of water management that have been employed in the region for generations. The oasis is sustained by a system of underground water channels, known as qanats, which bring water from deeper underground sources to irrigate the land. Historically, the Corbeille of Nefta has been a hub of life and trade. Its palm groves and fertile land have long been central to the local economy and way of life.  Nefta is famous not only for its oasis but also for its importance as a cradle of Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam. Sufism, with its emphasis on inner purification, spiritual closeness to God, and the seeking of divine truth, has had a profound influence on Nefta. The city is home to several important Sufi shrines and landmarks, the most famous being the shrine of Sidi Bou Ali, a revered Sufi saint, which attracts pilgrims from across Tunisia and beyond. These sacred sites serve not only as places of worship but also as centers of learning, where Sufi teachings on spirituality, ethics, and divine love are passed down through generations.  Nefta, considered the second holy city of Tunisia, is sometimes called the \"Kairouan of the South.\" The city also hosts a festival of traditional and mystical music, known as Rohuanyet.",
