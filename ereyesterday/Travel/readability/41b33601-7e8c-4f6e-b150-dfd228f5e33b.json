  "description": "At the corner of Chestnut Street and 2nd Street, there's a tiny park featuring a gazebo and a heartwarming tribute to a tremendously successful NFL running back. Saquon Barkley grew up within walking distance of the boulder-affixed plaque honoring him. Barkley played for Whitehall High School before going on to star at Penn State University. He then played in the National Football League for the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles, with whom he won the Super Bowl in 2025. This plaque is a reminder that a small town kid can make it big.",
