  "description": "The Oddities Museum is a serial collector’s dream. This gallery of miscellany, loaded with outsider art and biological wonders of grotesque beauty, traveled as a U.S. roadshow at the Oddities and Curiosities Expo before attaining its official status as a non-profit museum on the outskirts of downtown Atlanta. Owner Jeremy Gibbs, who started his collection when he encountered the conjoined calves of the Georgia State capital on a junior high school trip, says, “The Oddities Museum is for the community, a place for folks to enjoy something out of the norm that pushes the envelope, where we are all allowed to be different from others, from our family, coworkers, and classmates. Here, we celebrate subculture, and those who will not immerse themselves can view from a distance, dip in their toes, and see something different for a moment in time.” Thousands of square feet are filled with strange treasures. Divided into sections like natural oddities, extreme art and pop culture relics, science and medical quackery, an asylum room, and a massive sideshow freak section are just the start. Giant clown heads and a kaleidoscope of funhouse objects hang from the rafters. Don’t miss the funeral section, where religion and fraternal orders bleed into the Victorian era. See how long it takes you to find the 20-foot-wide pterodactyl. The Oddities Museum has the most extensive collection of animal deformities on display in one building anywhere in the U.S., including a genuine jackalope and the only two-faced buffalo in existence. How about haunted dolls or an extensive collection of taxidermic pets that will make you shudder and sigh at the sweetness of the thought? For those who dare to believe in other worlds, don’t miss the full-sized mermaid in a glass casket or the “real” vampire in its coffin lying near a dead clown and an Egyptian mummy. Yeah, it's that kind of place. Visiting The Oddities Museum lets you come with your curiosity, ask questions, and leave with an expanded view of reality. See things you have never seen before and will probably never see again elsewhere.",
