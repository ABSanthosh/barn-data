Or you were never in a stalled Apple TV+ production with Brian Tyree Henry.Mr. Henry, 43, who recently received the Gotham Television Awards’ first Performer Tribute for his role in “Dope Thief,” is the star and an executive producer of this crime drama about two friends who try to earn a living as fake drug enforcement agents. The limited series was not quite halfway through filming in Philadelphia when Hollywood writers went on strike in 2023, soon followed by actors. He decided to make the best of a bad situation by staying put and diving as deeply as possible into his character’s hometown.ImageMr. Henry rose to prominence as Alfred “Paper Boi” Miles in the FX show “Atlanta.” He currently stars in the limited Apple TV+ series “Dope Thief,” which is set in Philadelphia.Credit...Taylor Jewell/Invision, via Associated PressDuring the work stoppage, which lasted six months, “the Philly crew was still there, and they were my friends,” Mr. Henry said in a video interview. “So my time in Philly felt like sleep-away camp.” He learned a lot. For starters: “Philly natives love Philly,” he said. “If I walked out of my house in anything green and white, it had better have an eagle on it.”ImageMr. Henry and his co-star, Wagner Moura, play friends who try to earn a living as fake D.E.A. agents in “Dope Thief.”Credit...Jessica Kourkounis/Apple TV+, via Associated PressHe also discovered that he didn’t need to stray far from his Center City rental to find a happy place: the tiny 17th-century Rittenhouse Square. “You can sit in the park and read a book, and then go and chill out and have a good meal across the street,” he said, citing the steak, popovers and tater tots at Barclay Prime among his favorite examples. Another neighborhood staple was the Rittenhouse Spa \u0026 Club, where regular facials helped mitigate the “sweat, blood, smoke and gunpowder” he was covered in during filming. “They would be like, ‘What did you go through this week?’” he said.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
