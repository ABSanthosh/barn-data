  "description": "The Tongariro Alpine Crossing in New Zealand is a 19-kilometer hike that takes visitors between Mount Ruapehu and Mount Ngauruhoe. After reaching the summit of Red Crater, a volcanic cone sitting nearly 2,000 meters above sea level, hikers are treated to dazzling views of electric blue and green lakes below. Known as Ngarotopounamu in Maori, the Emerald Lakes owe their brilliant colors to the presence of volcanic minerals. Steam can be seen emerging from geothermal vents nearby, giving the area a sulfurous smell. Hikers pass Mount Ngauruhoe on the way to the lakes, an active cone volcano that last erupted in 1977. Lord of the Rings fans may recognize Mount Ngauruhoe as Mount Doom, the fictional volcano where the \"One Ring\" was forged.",
