  "description": "Just north of the city of Jericho, Hisham’s Palace is a sprawling archeological site which contains renovated ruins of an ancient estate — including a palace, bathhouse, mosque, grape press, and more. Inside the palace is one of the world’s largest mosaic carpets, which underwent restoration and opened to the public in 2021. The estate is a prime example of Umayyad-era ingenuity and artistry, including ancient plumbing systems which are similar to those used today. The site is undergoing continuing excavations as archeologists learn more about its connections to Islamic and Middle Eastern history.",
