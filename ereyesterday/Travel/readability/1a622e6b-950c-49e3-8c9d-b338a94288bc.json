  "description": "Few items are more synonymous with the United Kingdom than a red phone booth. Even with the advent of mobile phones, tourists still line up to have their pictures taken with these symbolic relics of a bygone age. But in Bath, England, one phone booth is painted in an atypical hue. This phone booth, situated where Brock Street becomes Royal Crescent, is one of England’s only grey phone booths.  A placard posted on the window reads: “This K6 telephone kiosk designed in 1935 to mark King George V's jubilee, was one of 70,000 between 1936 and 1968 in the U. K.. Whilst red is seen as an iconic color, when first introduced there was an outcry over these intrusive bright features. The General Post Office sanctioned the muted colors of battleship grey with glazing bars 'picked out' in red, in areas of natural and architectural beauty. This was such an area, and a rare surviving example of a grey K6.”",
