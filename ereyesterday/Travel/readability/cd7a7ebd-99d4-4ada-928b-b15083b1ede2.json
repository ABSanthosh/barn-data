  "description": "Located in Rotterdam's historic Delfshaven, this quirky museum features more than 100 vintage pinball machines available for visitors to play at any given time. Many of the machines on display here date back to before the Second World War. The playable pinball machines include classics featuring the Addams Family, the Big Lebowski, the Twilight Zone, and many more.  For the curious, there's also a section of the museum devoted to the historical evolution of spijkerbal, as it's known in Dutch. The oldest piece in the collection is a venerable toupie hollandaise table, or toptafel, from 1853. This \"Dutch spinning top\" game, a predecessor of modern-day pinball, became popular throughout aristocratic European circles in the 17th century.",
