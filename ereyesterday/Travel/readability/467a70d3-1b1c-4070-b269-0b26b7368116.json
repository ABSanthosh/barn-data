Truth be told, I am way too toasty in this quasi-nautical ensemble, having hoped and dressed for ominous fog, murderous gales and oceanic rainstorms. Instead, it is bright, calm and warm on an early spring afternoon in the famously pretty fishing village of Cudillero in Asturias, where the Costa Verde of northern Spain drops away into the deep blue Bay of Biscay.Built in 1858, the local lighthouse – the Faro de Cudillero – stands on a shelf of rock just beyond the harbour, a short walk up stone steps and along a narrow cliff side service path. Its hexagonal beacon tower has been remodelled a few times over the years. The signal lamp inside was first fuelled by olive oil, then paraffin and petrol, before being electrified and eventually automated. With no further need for a human operator, its sturdy keeper’s cottage was left derelict decades ago. It’s sad to contemplate that absence, and the general obsolescence of the role itself. But if I can’t man the light, I can at least occupy the lighthouse.Cudillero, Spain locator mapThe keeper’s cottage has been bought, converted and partitioned into two loft-style holiday apartments by the German company Floatel, which specialises in this kind of repurposing. Staying for a couple of nights with my girlfriend and our six-year-old daughter in the Farero suite, I find the interior much plusher and airier than whatever salty quarters I might have imagined.We’ve got heated floors, a wood-burning stove, a fitted kitchenette, a nice, high ceiling, and a Nordic timber whirlpool bath with bench seats, big enough for all of us. Our priorities in proper order, we begin hot-tubbing without delay, while pretending to be a 19th-century lighthouse family mystified by modern luxuries.Large flanking windows look east and west to sunrise and sunset and, as the latter approaches, we go out to watch the lamp come on. The sky dims to indigo, a faint moon floats up over the tower, and visibility fades along the shoreline, tripping the sensors and flipping the switch. I expected a search beam to shoot from the lantern room and sweep the bay in whooshing gyres, but this light is programmed for a sequence of static flashes known as “occultations”. Put in Tolkienesque terms, it’s like an eye that opens for one long stare followed by three short blinks, repeating in cycles of 16 seconds. Or dash-dot-dot-dot, to represent the letter “B” in international morse code. It should really be “C” for Cudillero, but that letter was already taken by Candás, another coastal beacon about 30 miles due east.The plush interior of the apartment was a welcome surprise. Photograph: Javir Parilla/FloatelI learn all this and more back inside by the fireplace, where the honesty bar is well stocked, and the bookshelves support a small library of lighthouse-related literature. Between novels by Virginia Woolf and Jules Verne are historical journals and photographic surveys that reference this site in particular. Progressing from tangy, cloudy Asturian cider to a decent mid-range Spanish red, I read how ancient mariners set signal fires more or less where I’m sitting, and may have lured a few ships in to wreck and plunder on these rocks.Since the lighthouse entered service, though, there’s no record of a major disaster, no defining loss of local menfolk in the unforgiving Cantabrian Sea. An Italian cargo vessel called the Amelia C (en route from Newcastle upon Tyne to Venice) sank just offshore in 1877, though it seems the lighthouse keeper mobilised the village for a rescue effort, and all aboard were duly saved.This makes for a consoling bedtime story. I’ve always been a twitchy insomniac, but now I discover the sublime and fathomless comfort that comes of drifting off beside your family in the belly of such a refuge, between the winking lantern and the sighing sea. So here we are asleep and dreaming in “lighthouse world”, as Floatel co-founder Tim Wittenbecher described it when I spoke to him on the phone.Cudillero is renowned for high quality seafood. Photograph: Raul Garcia Herrera/Alamy“A lighthouse is the most purely positive structure we can think of,” Wittenbecher told me. “It has only good associations.” He discovered just how many people feel this way 20 years ago, when he and his wife turned a ruined beacon into a guest house on the Baltic Sea. Hundreds responded immediately to their first online ad, and their pet project became a business model. As Floatel, it has since entered public-private agreements to take over the empty lodgings of lighthouses in spots from Ischia in the Gulf of Naples to La Palma in the Canary Islands.“They are always in super-attractive positions, in dramatic, romantic and mostly quite abandoned areas,” said Wittenbecher. All broadly true of the Faro de Cudillero, though it’s not as far removed from civilisation as some others in his portfolio, and is close enough to the village that it once served double-duty as the local schoolhouse.It is also handy enough for the present housekeeper, Cristina, to bring us breakfast the next morning – a wicker basket full of pastries, yoghurt, juices, meats and cheeses. A single gull hovers at the window to watch us eat. “Clear off, you varmint,” says our daughter, shaking a fist and quoting one of her own favourite books, The Lighthouse Keeper’s Lunch.After breakfast, we wander around Cudillero itself, which forms a kind of amphitheatre in the tight arc of the adjoining cove, with steep vertical staircases and narrow lateral lane-ways stitched between tiers of brightly painted houses. Some have strips of curadillo hung outside – dried sharkskin that’s been a totem around here since the days when fishers used the rough flesh to polish their boats, and ate it when they couldn’t catch much else.The seafood is still great in these parts. After walking near-deserted beaches at Playa del Silencio and Playa de San Pedro La Ribera, we ascend to lunch at the stone-built mountain inn Cabo Vidio, where the house special is a coastal variation on the region’s renowned bean stew, fabada asturiana, made with salt cod hauled from the cold waters below.The writer’s family and family walked at Playa del Silencio. Photograph: Herraez/Getty ImagesCudillero fishmonger Manolo Fernández supplies every restaurant in the vicinity. “The quality of the produce is the same in each place,” Fernández assures me at his shop beside the port, while cleaning and gutting a hake. “The only difference is the chef.” He’s quick to laugh but also prone to lamentation. “This used to be a real seafaring village,” says Fernández. “I remember 230 boats out there; now we’re down to about 30.” This shop has been in his family for three generations and almost a century, “but me and my brother will be the last, I think”. As he cheerfully lists the reasons why – supermarkets, politics, overfishing, the climate crisis – it occurs to me that I’d forgotten all those worries while staying at the lighthouse. There it is above us, and ahead of us: salvation for sailors in trouble.We climb the path back to our perch, and watch our little girl sit cross-legged in a sunbeam on the windowsill, scanning the horizon for mermaids and orcas with the house binoculars. Some day, I’m thinking, this will be a bright spot in my memory – a signal light out of the distant past, flashing dash-dot-dot-dot. B for “beautiful”. B for “bygone”.Accommodation was provided by Floatel, which has two two-person apartments at the Cudillero Lighthouse from €190 or €290 a night B\u0026B; the entire lighthouse sleeps four and can be rented from €480 a night B\u0026B (four nights for the price of three, seven nights for the price of five)",

A single gull hovers at the window to watch us eat. “Clear off, you varmint,” says our daughter, shaking a fist and quoting one of her own favourite books, The Lighthouse Keeper’s Lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter breakfast, we wander around Cudillero itself, which forms a kind of amphitheatre in the tight arc of the adjoining cove, with steep vertical staircases and narrow lateral lane-ways stitched between tiers of brightly painted houses. Some have strips of \u003cem\u003ecuradillo\u003c/em\u003e hung outside – dried sharkskin that’s been a totem around here since the days when fishers used the rough flesh to polish their boats, and ate it when they couldn’t catch much else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe seafood is still great in these parts. After walking near-deserted beaches at Playa del Silencio and Playa de San Pedro La Ribera, we ascend to lunch at the stone-built mountain inn \u003ca

Fernández assures me at his shop beside the port, while cleaning and gutting a hake. “The only difference is the chef.” He’s quick to laugh but also prone to lamentation. “This used to be a real seafaring village,” says Fernández. “I remember 230 boats out there; now we’re down to about 30.” This shop has been in his family for three generations and almost a century, “but me and my brother will be the last, I think”. As he cheerfully lists the reasons why – supermarkets, politics, overfishing, the climate crisis – it occurs to me that I’d forgotten all those worries while staying at the lighthouse. There it is above us, and ahead of us: salvation for sailors in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe climb the path back to our perch, and watch our little girl sit cross-legged in a sunbeam on the windowsill, scanning the horizon for mermaids and orcas with the house binoculars.
