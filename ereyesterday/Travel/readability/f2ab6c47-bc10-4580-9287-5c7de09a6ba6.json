  "description": "Transportation enthusiasts may be surprised to learn that Buenos Aires once had the highest tramway-to-population ratio in the world, earning it the nickname “City of Trams.” At its peak it had 875 kilometers (544 miles) of tramways, and 99 tram lines using 3,000 carriages. By 1963, however, the network began to be dismantled in favor of buses and the metro. One of the few remnants is this small, 2 kilometer loop in the Caballito neighborhood. A group called the Amigos del Tranvía (friends of the tramway) volunteers on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays to operate the trams along the loop on a first-come first-serve basis, completely free of charge. They also share some of the history of the tram system, their organization, and sell various souvenirs that support the organization. Riding the tram feels like you’re being transported back in time.",
