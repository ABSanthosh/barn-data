  "description": "Taiwan is known as the birthplace of bubble tea, but there’s much more to the beverage scene here. Take this shop, for example. It has been selling just one drink, plum juice (suanmeitang), for over 60 years, and it’s still a favorite for both locals and visitors. Parkside is definitely one of the most famous among shops dedicated to the specialty drink of plum juice, and the namesake comes from its location right next to the 228 Memorial Park. Plum juice take much effort and care to make. Sour plums are soaked and boiled with ingredients like licorice root, dried plums, osmanthus, and hawthorn, then sweetened and chilled. It’s usually made in big pots and served cold. This juice shop has a modest start. Initially, the owner sold the drink on a cart, and drinks came in plastic bags with a rubber band and a straw  In 1969, the shop moved into its current spot. If you step back from the counter, you’ll see it’s inside a beautiful Western-style building, which is now a protected historic site. During the Japanese colonial era, it used to be a tailor shop. The plum juice is said to have the magic to cool people down, making here a perfect stop on a hot Taipei day. And if you want more,  you will be tempted to try the only other item on the menu—a simple, old-school scoop of traditional ice cream.",
