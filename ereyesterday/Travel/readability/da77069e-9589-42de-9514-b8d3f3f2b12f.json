In one case last week, controllers were temporarily unable to see or communicate with aircraft. More than 200 flights from and into Newark had been delayed as of Monday morning.The troubles prompted United Airlines, Newark’s largest carrier, to cut nearly three dozen round-trip flights per day at the hub, starting last weekend.Here’s what anyone heading to Newark Airport needs to know.Air traffic control staffing is limiting capacityLast summer, management of the airspace surrounding Newark shifted from New York to Philadelphia. This move, which involved relocating at least a dozen air traffic controllers, was meant to ease air traffic delays.The Federal Aviation Administration has attributed last week’s flight disruptions at Newark to equipment failures and staffing issues at the Philadelphia air traffic control center as well as to construction on one of Newark’s runways.Those staffing issues appear to be partly linked to an equipment failure that occurred last Monday, when controllers at the Philadelphia air traffic control center who are responsible for Newark “temporarily lost radar and communications with the aircraft under their control” and were “unable to see, hear or talk to them,” said Galen Munroe, a spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents 20,000 air traffic controllers, engineers and other aviation workers.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
