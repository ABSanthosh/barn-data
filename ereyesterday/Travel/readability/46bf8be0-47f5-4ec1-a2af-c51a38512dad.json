  "description": "The area near Tapkir Galli (a busy road in the center of the city) is known for its electronics market. In this area, there are also several old temples and mansions. Among these structures is a beautiful stone building that houses the Pune Prarthana Samaj. Pune Prarthana Samaj was founded in December 1870. It has its roots in the Brahmo Samaj movement inspired by the religious and social reformer Raja Ram Mohan Roy. Pune Prarthana Samaj is a society focused on the spiritual upliftment of the self, leading to the spiritual upliftment of society at large. It aims to create a value and knowledge based society through its motto: Humanize, Equalize, Spiritualize. Ever since its establishment, the society has focused on social enlightenment by introducing and encouraging progressive thoughts and practices. The society’s prayer hall is called Hari Mandir. It is a large congregation hall made of grey basalt stone and has a wooden ceiling. The hall has stunning vintage architecture. It was constructed in 1909. It stands on a 1,700-square-meter plot of land donated by Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade, one of the society’s founding members. With the premises, there is a stupa of Dr. Sir Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, another one of the founding members. The building stands in the middle of a crowded market area and offers a window to the city’s history and the efforts taken by the citizens to bring progressive change and social reforms in society.",
