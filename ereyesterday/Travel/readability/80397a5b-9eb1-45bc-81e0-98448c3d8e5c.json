  "description": "The Biscari Palace presents an unassuming front on a street not far from the Catania Duomo, but enter and you are transported to a mid-18th century world of rococo ballrooms, mirrors, marquetry and Roman mosaic floors. The Palazzo was built after the devastation of the 1693 earthquake, extended and added to by subsequent generations, and completed in 1763. Visitors can see a range of rooms, including the large and exquisitely decorated Rococo ballroom, and the equally beautiful private quarters, including a Roman marble floor, to the side of the public rooms.",
