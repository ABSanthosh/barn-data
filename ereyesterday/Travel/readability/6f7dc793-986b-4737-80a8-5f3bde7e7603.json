  "description": "The Kikori River Basin (KRP) is a remote region of the Southern Province of Papua New Guinea. The KRP contains one of the largest expanses of pristine forest in the Southern Hemisphere with high levels of endemic flora and fauna species. Although not the most populous region of Papua New Guinea, over 16 different ethnic groups reside throughout the KRP. Due to its remoteness, the residents of the KRP still rely on nature for their livelihoods and continue their traditional ways of living.   Traveling to the Kikori River Basin requires love for remote exploration, adaptability, respect for diverse cultural systems, and openness to step way out of your comfort zone. Few roads exist in the KRP region, so the primary form of travel is by river in dugout canoes. Throughout your journey, you can revel in the grandeur of breathtaking Wasi Falls, serene Lake Kutubu, and giant limestone karsts. Each village interspersed throughout the region provides a unique experience, from the longhouse cultures of the highlands to those in the delta regions. Shop at the Mendi market for a bilum bag keepsake, the quintessential cultural and artistic craft of Papua New Guinean traditions; marvel at the anthropologic artifacts at burial caves and of cave paintings; and even share in a buai (betelnut) break with a local, at your own discretion (this customary practice of chewing and spitting out the nut while dipping a mustard stick in lime powder gives a person a sense of elation, but has severe long-term health impacts). Buai break or not, opportunities abound to connect with locals and learn about this culturally and ecologically diverse region.",
