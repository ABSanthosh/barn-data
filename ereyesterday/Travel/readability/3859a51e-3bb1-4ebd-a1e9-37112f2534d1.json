Photograph: © Hufton+CrowThe opening of this new V\u0026A outpost marks the latest chapter in the reinvention of the Olympic Park as a “new cultural quarter” for London. At the time of the London 2012 games, I lived in Bow, on the edge of the Olympic Park. On the night of the opening ceremony we watched from the window of my flat as fireworks lit up the sky above the stadium. It was the culmination of one of the most ambitious regeneration projects that London had ever seen and we had a ringside seat as this brave new world rose up from a 560-acre brownfield site.As well as providing a deprived area of east London with world-class sporting facilities, part of the Olympic legacy was the promise to build a new creative hub, somewhere that would inspire locals and visitors alike. We moved out of the area shortly after the games finished, so I was curious to see for myself whether that promise had been fulfilled.On a bright spring morning the park is quietly humming with activity. Teenagers glide along wide boulevards on roller skates and toddlers play in the water fountains in front of the London Stadium. On the canal, families drift by in pedalos in the shape of white swans, watched over by Zaha Hadid’s imposing Aquatic Centre which carves a graceful arc in the blue sky.My daughter and I make a beeline for a cluster of new buildings which are lined up along the canal. The East Bank project represents the largest single investment in culture by a London mayor since the Great Exhibition of 1851. The first phase launched in 2023 with the opening of cutting-edge new campuses for University College London (UCL) and the London College of Fashion. Both sites have been designed to be open and accessible to the public. So you can wander into the reception of UCL East and see public art installations – on our visit Luke Jerram’s “Gaia”, an inflatable replica of the Earth, was floating serenely above the atrium – or head to the cafe where your coffee will be delivered to you by a robot waiter.A postgraduate show at the London College of Fashion, East Bank. Photograph: Ana BlumenkronAt the London College of Fashion, the public areas host regular showcases of student work. We stroll around the lobby, all bare concrete and curving staircases, and admire a display of outlandish undergraduate creations – although my daughter is far more interested in what the fashion students themselves are wearing.Next door is Sadler’s Wells East, a new outpost of the dance theatre which opened in February. The open-plan foyer is home to a light-filled bar, cafe and dance space – when we drop in for a coffee there’s a community dance class in mid-flow. The 550-seat auditorium will provide a home for visiting dance companies of every genre, from ballet to hip-hop. We have booked tickets for that evening’s show, a family-friendly performance of Snow White by the balletLorent.Our next stop is the ArcelorMittal Orbit, the twisted red steel sculpture that towers over the Olympic Park. We take the lift up to the viewing platform, a dizzying 80m above the ground. Far below us the London Stadium, now home to West Ham football club, is laid out like a Subbuteo pitch. As a general rule of thumb, I try to avoid any activity that involves having to don an Australian Rules Football helmet and elbow protectors. And yet here I am, joining the queue of teenagers waiting to launch themselves feet first down the Helix, the high-speed helter skelter that snakes around the outside of Anish Kapoor’s look-at-me landmark. My teenage daughter takes one look at the foam helmet and refuses to go any further. “It’s just a big slide!” I tell her. “Come on, it’ll be fun!”The Helix slide on the ArcelorMittal Orbit at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Photograph: Mark Mercer/AlamyThese words – and others that cannot be published here – ring in my ears as I corkscrew down the metal tube at terrifying speed, emerging 40 seconds later feeling like I’ve been flushed down the S-bend. My sensible daughter has taken the lift down and is waiting for me at the bottom. “Oh Mum,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionOne of the side-effects of this area’s transformation has been a burgeoning of the local food scene, from the world’s first zero-waste restaurant, Silo in Hackney Wick, to Barge East, a floating bar and restaurant moored in the shadow of the London Stadium. We’ve booked a table at Hera, one of the park’s newest openings, which has been winning accolades for its authentic Greek food.It does not disappoint. From the basket of homemade bread and dip of smoked aubergine with thyme, honey and balsamic vinegar, to the elegant sea bass carpaccio and charcoal-grilled chicken skewers, everything is sensational. But the standout dish is the feta saganaki – feta cheese, wrapped in angel hair, deep-fried and drizzled with lemon honey. My daughter and I are still dreaming about it weeks later.Swan pedalos in the Olympic Park. Photograph: Queen Elizabeth Olympic ParkIt’s the kind of lunch that needs to be followed by a long walk, so we trace the course of the canal, fringed with head-high whispering grasses, into the northern half of the park, eventually reaching the iconic Olympic rings – which have found a permanent home on a raised mound overlooking the Lee Valley VeloPark.A group of women dressed head to toe in sequins shimmer past in the late afternoon sunshine, on their way to Abba Voyage. The virtual concert experience has attracted more than two million visitors since opening in a purpose-built arena on the edge of the Olympic Park in 2022. In September, they will be joined by an army of David Bowie fans when the V\u0026A Storehouse becomes the new home of the David Bowie archive, comprising stage costumes, song lyrics, instruments, makeup charts and sketches. And there’s more to come. Next year will see the relocation of the BBC Music Studios from Maida Vale to Stratford and the opening of the V\u0026A East museum in a striking new building inspired, apparently, by an X-ray of a Balenciaga dress.I’ve enjoyed being a tourist on my old home turf. It may not have the gravitas of South Kensington, the architectural cohesion of the South Bank Centre or the neoclassical elegance of Covent Garden, but East Bank is an invigorating and inspiring addition to London’s cultural scene. And it’s fun. Where else can you slide down Britain’s tallest sculpture, handle vintage haute couture, or dance in front of an Abba avatar, all in one day?The V\u0026A East Storehouse opens to the public on 31 May.

As a general rule of thumb, I try to avoid any activity that involves having to don an Australian Rules Football helmet and elbow protectors. And yet here I am, joining the queue of teenagers waiting to launch themselves feet first down the Helix, the high-speed helter skelter that snakes around the outside of Anish Kapoor’s look-at-me landmark. My teenage daughter takes one look at the foam helmet and refuses to go any further. “It’s just a big slide!” I tell her. “Come on, it’ll be fun!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure id=\"6009eb6f-dbdf-4cb0-9b2d-ee2469e72399\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"img-4\"\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/682e0cf21d2d2cf0b15690f6bacfe8174f6b3b45/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/682e0cf21d2d2cf0b15690f6bacfe8174f6b3b45/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;dpr=1\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/682e0cf21d2d2cf0b15690f6bacfe8174f6b3b45/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=605\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/682e0cf21d2d2cf0b15690f6bacfe8174f6b3b45/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=605\u0026amp;dpr=1\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/682e0cf21d2d2cf0b15690f6bacfe8174f6b3b45/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=445\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/682e0cf21d2d2cf0b15690f6bacfe8174f6b3b45/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=445\u0026amp;dpr=1\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"/\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"The Helix slide at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/682e0cf21d2d2cf0b15690f6bacfe8174f6b3b45/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=445\u0026amp;dpr=1\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"296.66666666666663\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003csvg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe Helix slide on the ArcelorMittal Orbit at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\u003c/span\u003e Photograph: Mark Mercer/Alamy\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese words – and others that cannot be published here – ring in my ears as I corkscrew down the metal tube at terrifying speed, emerging 40 seconds later feeling like I’ve been flushed down the S-bend.
