  "description": "The Burke Building is a historic building along the famous Escolta Street, once the financial and shopping capital of the Philippines in the early 20th century. The building was designed by the preeminent architect of that time, Tomas Fernandez Arguelles, in art deco fashion. Named after cardiologist William J. Burke, this site housed the department store Heacock’s, among others. The building was damaged during World War II and underwent renovation. The Burke Building was built in 1919, a period of rapid engineering advancement and the growing popularity of high rises, and at five stories, it is one of the tallest buildings in Escolta. In it, the developer installed the first elevator in the country—an Otis brand, imported from France, equipped with a brass cage that had to be closed manually. A marker is installed on the wall beside the entrance to commemorate this milestone.",
