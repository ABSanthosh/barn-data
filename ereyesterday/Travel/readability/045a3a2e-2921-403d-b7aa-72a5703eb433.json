  "description": "This arrow is a surviving remnant of a 1920s federal-government-sponsored airmail navigation network. By then, carrying mail had become the first serious commercial application of air travel. The network consisted of concrete arrows, originally painted yellow and designated as Beacon Stations, that pointed east on east-west routes and north on north-south routes. Each station had a bright light atop a 50-foot steel tower that allowed pilots to navigate from light to light after dark. Without radar, GPS, or reliable radio, night flying was extremely hazardous and could not be done routinely. Most of the towers were scrapped long ago, but a surprising amount of the concrete arrows remain—this is one of them. It is Beacon Station #32 LA-SL (#32 on the route from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City), positioned east of the surviving Moapa Airmail Arrow, station #31 LA-SL. The two are 17 airline miles apart. At night, if you stand on this arrow and imagine glimpsing the light on the Moapa station slightly south of west, that glimpse would have been your goal as an airmail pilot.",
