  "description": "Just a mile outside Lonavala, a popular hill station between Pune and Mumbai, visitors can explore ancient caves dating back over 2,000 years. Four-hundred feet above the village of Bhaja (or Bhaje), along an ancient trade route, 22 rock-cut caverns make up the Bhaja Buddhist cave complex. The caves are very similar to the Karla Caves in their architectural design. At the center, there is a large prayer hall called the Chaitya Griha. On either side, embedded in the mountain, are the smaller caves with artistic doors and windows carved in the stone. An important feature of this place is a group of 14 stupas, which are relics of resident monks who once lived there. An inscription mentions the names of three of the monks: Ampinika, Dhammagiri, and Sanghdina. Two of the stupas are topped with relic boxes. Some of the caves have runic inscriptions adorning the walls, while others feature artistic sculptures and instruments.",
