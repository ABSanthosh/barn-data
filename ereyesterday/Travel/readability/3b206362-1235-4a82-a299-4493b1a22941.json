The big resort hotels are shuttered, the beach bars sealed up, the superclubs powered down until their showy reopening parties get the summer started again in late April. By July, the ratio will be back to 20 visitors to every one resident, but for now the island is as empty as it gets.The sun is shining though, the air bright and warm, the sky a salted Balearic blue. And crowds still gather, here and there. At the Trotting Races, for example, in the Sant Rafael hippodrome in the centre of the island. A peculiar island tradition that supposedly began with charioteers during Ibiza’s Roman occupation, the sport requires jockeys to ride on little wheeled carts harnessed to horses that keep a briskish, semi-hurried pace, as if slightly late for an appointment. Kids and old boys seem to love it, the latter laying small bets on the races and dropping shots of brandy in their coffee. My horse, Maldiva des Puig, comes a distant third.Over the same weekend, I also visit Mercadillo Sant Jordi, just outside Ibiza Town, a busy flea market in a cycling velodrome where the mood and music are unexpectedly vibrant. The resident DJ plays a judicious early afternoon set of trance and disco that fills a racing pit with daytime dancers.Then there is the Sunday “hippy” market in the tiny northern village of Sant Joan de Labritja. Morning mass has just ended at the parish church and the congregation merges with shoppers and pedlars around the main square. A band is playing Bob Marley covers and a few wizened flower people are smiling and swaying like it’s 1969.Jean-Michel Fueter, an elder statesman of the island’s creative community, has been standing in for the band’s regular guitarist. “I first came to Ibiza in 1970 as one of those long-hairs,” he says when the band takes a break. “LSD and all that. I later realised that what I loved about the place was not just the people and culture, it was the energy of the land itself. It’s tellurgical, magical, peaceful and feminine, and, if you’re sensitive, you can tune into it.”The Cave of Light. Photograph: Ibiza HikeIn summer, Fueter helps people do this at his long-running, mind-expanding club night Namaste, held in Ibiza’s other landmark hippy market, Las Dalias. But winter may be a better time to pick up the signal he’s talking about, when there is, frankly, less interference.“People always ask about the hidden gems of Ibiza,” says Boris Buono, who makes it his business to feed the Sunday multitudes with plant-based pizzas at his garden restaurant. “To me, the real hidden gem is the winter.”Unlike most chefs and owners, Buono keeps his establishment open all year round. “I live here, I work here, my kids are in school – what else am I going to do?”“I prefer the winter,” agrees Behzad Behpour, an Iranian-born painter who works out of a second-floor studio overlooking the market. “You can clear your mind a bit, and make time to create.” Around us hang Behpour’s signature large canvases, rendering Ibizan icons (club owners, big-name DJs, regular celebrity visitors) as writhing servants of the island’s presiding deities – principally the ancient Phoenician moon goddess, Tanit. “I certainly think it’s an island for artists, and hanging out when it’s quiet is part of the artistic process.”His Kurdish friend Bahram Pourmand, better known as Bahramji, is also a painter, a new age musician, and another veteran of the Ibizan scene. “You don’t get a winter like this anywhere else,” says Bahramji. He agrees too on the magnetic pull of the place, but reminds me that magnets also repel. “If the island doesn’t want you she will push you away,” he says, the kohl around his eyes making his gaze that bit more intense.The hippy market in the northern village of Sant Joan de Labritja. Photograph: Album/AlamyThe island is not immune to market forces and rent hikes have been squeezing artists off Ibiza, as Bahramji says: “Finding €2,000 a month is very difficult, but I’m going to stay here, playing music until I die on stage.” The summer glamour of the island, the recent upscaling of its club culture, the building and buying of luxe villas and condos, all have knock-on effects that linger when the VIP crowd clears out when summer ends.“Locals end up paying tourist prices for everything, even for toast and coffee,” says Martina Greef, on her sailboat off the eastern port of Santa Eulària des Riu. Greef is a lifelong islander whose German parents came to Ibiza with that original influx of hippies. She owns a share in her vessel, named the Al Mar, and covers the exorbitant mooring fees by running charter services in peak season.Most clients just want to sail across to the island of Formentera, she says, “because that’s what they’ve seen on Instagram”. The strait between the sister islands is akin to a highway for yachts and ferries in summer, and the short voyage not very inspiring for a mariner. “But in winter we can go where we want,” Greef says, turning us 60 degrees to the wind before giving me the wheel.Sailing lessons provide her livelihood in the quieter months, and even as a landlubber I can see the appeal. Get the angles right and the boat just takes off. For a short spell, I feel as if I’m flying the boat over open water, while the low sun drops behind an ancient altar to Tanit above Cap des Llibrell.Back inland, Lucas Prats puts me up at one of the villas on what used to be his grandfather’s property, Can Lluc, looking out to sea from a hillside of orchards and olive groves. Agroturismo is a competitive business these days, drawing visitors away from coastal hotels to converted farmsteads. To Prats, there’s no reason why Ibiza can’t build up its off-peak profile, in the same manner as Mallorca. “We have better weather than they do at this time of year,” he claims.One of the villas at Can Lluc, near San Rafael.“Visitors who come in winter love it – we just need more promotion.”Next morning, I descend on foot through steep cliffside forests with Manuel Ehrensperger of Ibiza Hike Station. A Swiss-born former CEO of luxury fashion brands, he now leads “holistic” hikes in the wildest parts of the island, where pines grow over long-abandoned stone terraces once used for growing and drying figs. “People say I changed my life, but this is luxury too,” he tells me.A true believer in the healing power of nature, and silence, Ehrensperger invites me to spend seven minutes in hushed contemplation above the Cave of Light, where the water glows a deep, cosmic blue. It’s too dangerous to jump here, he says, but I can drop into the sea from the rocks at the other side, and have the whole cove to myself – another pleasure of winter.Well, not quite to myself. While I’m thinking about it, two dolphins breach the surface below. It’s a little chilly up here to be honest, and a bit higher than I’d like. I’m not one for mysticism either, for talk of energies or vibrations. But I feel like those dolphins are telling me to jump. The goddess Tanit wants me to – the spirit of the island herself. So I jump.Balearia operates ferries to Ibiza from Dénia and other mainland Spanish ports. Accommodation was provided by Can Lluc (canlluc.com), which offers negotiable rates on villa rentals outside peak season. Trot races are held year-round at Sant Rafel hippodrome (hipodromsantrafel.com). Sant Jordi market is held every Saturday and Sant Joan hippy market every Sunday. Sailing lessons (€200 for three trips) with Martina Greef, booked through Ibiza Kayak, and hikes with Manuel Ehrensperger (€30 for three hours) through Ibiza Hike Station",
