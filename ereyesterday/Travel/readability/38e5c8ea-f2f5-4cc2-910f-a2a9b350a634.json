Visit americanexpress.com to learn more. The Platinum Card® from American Express is the OG of premium travel cards. Since its launch in the 1980s, it’s always been known for its exclusivity, suite of perks, and stellar customer service. While it does have the highest fee in the game ($695, See Rates and Fees), it offers a ton of bang for your buck. You’ll more than come out on top if you take advantage of all that this premium card has to offer. It unlocks the most comprehensive lounge access of any card, includes elite hotel status, has tons of travel perks, and offers hefty statement credits. I personally love this card, but it’s not for everyone. Here’s my review to help you decide if it’s right for you. What does the card offer? This card unlocks a ton of lounge access, elite status benefits (enrollment required), travel perks, special hotel discounts, and luxury goods and service credits. Here’s a glance at just some of the benefits: Earn 80,000 Membership Rewards® Points after you spend $8,000 on eligible purchases on your new Card in your first 6 months of Card Membership Earn 5x Membership Rewards® points on flights booked directly with airlines or with American Express Travel® (on the first $500,000 spent per calendar year) Earn 5x Membership Rewards® points on prepaid hotels booked on American Express Travel Travel insurance coverage including secondary car rental insurance, trip interruption and cancellation, lost luggage reimbursement Access to The American Express Global Lounge Collection (for eligible Card Members) Up to $200 in airline credit (Valid on one qualifying airline that you must choose in advance. Valid on incidentals only, not airfare.) Up to $200 back in statement credits each year on prepaid Fine Hotels + Resorts® or The Hotel Collection bookings through American Express Travel using your Platinum Card®. (The Hotel Collection requires a minimum two-night stay.) Up to $199 annual CLEAR® Plus statement credit (covers an annual membership) per calendar year (subject to auto-renewal) Receive either a $120 statement credit every 4 years for a Global Entry application fee or a statement credit up to $85 every 4.5 years for a TSA PreCheck® (through a TSA official enrollment provider) application fee, when charged to your Platinum Card®. (Card Members approved for Global Entry will also receive access to TSA PreCheck at no additional cost.) Using Your Membership Rewards Points You’ll earn Membership Rewards points with The Platinum Card® from American Express. These are some of the most valuable transferable points out there, thanks to their impressive suite of travel partners: Aer Lingus AerClub (1:1 ratio) Aeromexico Rewards (1:1.6 ratio) Air Canada Aeroplan (1:1 ratio) Air France-KLM Flying Blue (1:1 ratio) ANA Mileage Club (1:1 ratio) Avianca LifeMiles (1:1 ratio) British Airways Club (1:1 ratio) Cathay Pacific Asia Miles (1:1 ratio) Choice Privileges (1:1 ratio) Delta SkyMiles (1:1 ratio) Emirates Skywards (1:1 ratio) Etihad Guest (1:1 ratio) HawaiianMiles (1:1 ratio) Hilton Honors (1:2 ratio) Iberia Plus (1:1 ratio) JetBlue TrueBlue (250:200 ratio) Marriott Bonvoy (1:1 ratio) Qantas Frequent Flyer (1:1 ratio) Qatar Airways Privilege Club (1:1 ratio) Singapore KrisFlyer (1:1 ratio) Virgin Atlantic Flying Club (1:1 ratio) You can also use your Membership Rewards points to book flights and hotels in the Amex Travel portal. (This isn’t the best use of your points. I’d generally advise against it; it’s always best to transfer your points to travel partners rather than using the card’s travel portal.) Breaking Down the Amex Platinum’s Credits and Benefits I love Amex cards for their perks and benefits, and the Amex Platinum comes with over $1,500 worth of them. It’s like a little coupon book. Here’s what you get with the card: Perks for a Streamlined Airport Experience (Lounge Access, CLEAR Plus, Global Entry/TSA PreCheck) One of my favorite perks of this card is that it offers the most comprehensive lounge access out there, and to some of the best lounges in the game. The Centurion Lounges are stellar, as are the Delta Sky Club lounges. You’ll also get access to the Priority Pass network of over 1,700 lounges around the world. The Amex Platinum also gets you to the lounge quicker with statement credits that cover services to expedite airport security. You’ll get up to $199 annual CLEAR® Plus statement credit (covers an annual membership) per calendar year (subject to auto-renewal). You’ll also receive either a $120 statement credit every 4 years for a Global Entry application fee or a statement credit up to $85 every 4.5 years for a TSA PreCheck® (through a TSA official enrollment provider) application fee, when charged to your Platinum Card®. Keep in mind that if you’re approved for Global Entry, you’ll also get access to TSA PreCheck at no additional cost. So, if you’re traveling internationally, just go with Global Entry. The process is a bit more involved (you have to go for an in-person interview), but it’s worth it. Airline and Hotel Credits The Platinum Card also offers up to $200 in airline credit, which sounds great at face value but can be a bit of a pain to use. The credit can only be used on one airline, which you must pre-select, and you can only use it for incidentals, not airfare. However, if you regularly check a bag (and don’t already have an airline credit card that offers free baggage as a perk), you’ll use up that $200 in no time. (You can also use it on things like paid seat selection and in-flight food and beverage.) The card also offers up to $200 back in statement credits on prepaid Fine Hotels + Resorts® or The Hotel Collection bookings through American Express Travel using your Platinum Card®. These are usually pretty luxurious properties, so you won’t be getting any free hotel stays with this benefit alone. But if you’re looking to splash out with a high-end hotel or resort stay, $200 off is pretty nice. Plus, the Amex Platinum offers complimentary Marriott Bonvoy® Gold Elite and Hilton Honors™ Gold Status, which offer extra perks and benefits when staying at these properties. Lifestyle Statement Credits The “lifestyle” statement credits are where this card can be a bit less useful depending on your spending habits. My favorite of these is the $200 Uber Cash benefit. It’s distributed as $15 in Uber Cash each month, plus you’ll get a bonus of $20 in December after adding your Card to your Uber account. That said, I do find it a bit annoying that you can only use your Uber Cash on rides and orders in the U.S. (when you select an Amex Card for your transaction), since I’m often out of the country. (To receive this benefit, you must have downloaded the latest version of the Uber App and your eligible American Express Platinum Card must be a method of payment on your Uber account. The Amex Benefit may only be used in the United States.) Other lifestyle credits include up to $50 biannual Saks Fifth Avenue credit and up to $155 Walmart+ Credit when you use your Platinum Card to pay for a monthly Walmart+ membership. You’ll also receive up to $240 Digital Entertainment Credit via up to $20 back in statement credits each month on eligible purchases made with your Platinum Card on one or more of the following: Disney+, a Disney+ Bundle, ESPN+, Hulu, The New York Times, Peacock, and The Wall Street Journal. (This is an easy set and forget if you subscribe to any of these.) Amex Offers In addition to all those statement credits, you’ll get access to Amex Offers. With these, you can save money or earn bonus points with select retailers. The offers are ever-changing and targeted, meaning you won’t have the same offers as another cardholder. The majority of these offers are “spend X, get Y amount back.” The Amex Platinum’s Travel Insurance Last but not least, you’ll get great travel insurance with this card. No matter where you’re going, travel insurance is the most important thing to get for your trip. Hopefully, you won’t need to use it, but I know from experience that if you do, you’ll be glad to have it. I’ve had to use it around the world, from Argentina to South Africa to Italy. Each time something has gone wrong on the road, travel insurance has helped me recoup my costs. While I always recommend purchasing a standalone travel insurance policy, many travel cards offer travel insurance as a perk for no additional cost (apart from the card’s annual fee). While I wouldn’t solely rely on the card’s travel insurance, it’s a nice benefit. Here are the travel protections that the Platinum offers: Trip cancellation and interruption coverage of $10,000 per person, per trip (on round-trip tickets only, $20,000 per 12 consecutive month period) Trip delay coverage up to $500 if the delay is six hours or more (on round-trip tickets only, two claims per 12 consecutive-month period) Emergency evacuation and medical transport coverage: no limit; must be coordinated via the Premium Global Assist Hotline Cell phone protection up to $800 minus a $50 deductible (two approved claims per 12-month period, and you must have paid your cell phone bill with your card) Lost luggage coverage up to $3,000 per person Secondary car rental coverage Keep in mind that to be eligible for these protections, you have to pay for your trip (or cell phone bill) with your Amex Platinum. Also, always be sure to always read the fine print so that you understand exactly what’s covered! Eligibility and Benefit level varies by Card. Terms, Conditions, and Limitations Apply. Please visit americanexpress.com/benefitsguide for more details. Underwritten by Amex Assurance Company. Who is the Amex Platinum for? The Amex Platinum is best for frequent travelers who’ll use the premium perks, like easier airport experiences and elite status at hotels. If you can also take advantage of a few lifestyle credits, it’s a solid deal. I’d say just run the numbers and see if the value adds up for you. (And read my post on picking a travel card if you need more help.) As with any rewards card, you should not get this card if you’re already carrying a balance or plan to carry a balance. Interest rates for travel cards are notoriously high and the points just aren’t worth it if you’re paying interest each month. This card is also not for anyone with poor credit, as you need excellent credit to qualify. (If that’s you, check out the best credit cards for bad credit so you can start improving your score today.) *** The Amex Platinum isn’t cheap but if you travel often, the perks can easily outweigh the hefty annual fee. From airport lounge access to generous travel credits, it’s a card built for those who live life on the move. If you’re a frequent flyer looking to travel smarter and more comfortably, I think this card is worth it. Click here to learn more and sign up! Stop paying full price for travel!

While I wouldn’t solely rely on the card’s travel insurance, it’s a nice benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are the travel protections that the Platinum offers:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTrip cancellation and interruption coverage of $10,000 per person, per trip (on round-trip tickets only, $20,000 per 12 consecutive month period)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTrip delay coverage up to $500 if the delay is six hours or more (on round-trip tickets only, two claims per 12 consecutive-month period)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEmergency evacuation and medical transport coverage: no limit; must be coordinated via the Premium Global Assist Hotline\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCell phone protection up to $800 minus a $50 deductible (two approved claims per 12-month period, and you must have paid your cell phone bill with your card)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLost luggage coverage up to $3,000 per person\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSecondary car rental coverage\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eKeep in mind that to be eligible for these protections, you have to pay for your trip (or cell phone bill) with your Amex Platinum. Also, always be sure to always read the fine print so that you understand exactly what’s covered!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEligibility and Benefit level varies by Card.

If you can also take advantage of a few lifestyle credits, it’s a solid deal. I’d say just run the numbers and see if the value adds up for you. (And read my post on picking a travel card if you need more help.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs with any rewards card, you should not get this card if you’re already carrying a balance or plan to carry a balance. Interest rates for travel cards are notoriously high and the points just aren’t worth it if you’re paying interest each month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis card is also not for anyone with poor credit, as you need excellent credit to qualify.
