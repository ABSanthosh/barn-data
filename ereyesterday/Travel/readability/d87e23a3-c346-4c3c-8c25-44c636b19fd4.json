  "description": "Las Vegas features quite a few garages that build customized cars as well as multiple car museums.  However, the Hollywood Cars Museum and Liberace Garage may be the most notable of these locations because of its cars’ star power. The main part of the museum’s collection, which is spread across two rooms, features famous cars and other vehicles from film and television shows as well as extremely unusual custom-built cars. Some of the cars, such as one of the Batmobiles from Batman Returns and cars from the Fast and Furious franchise and the Hangover, were actually used in the films. Others, such as those from Starsky and Hutch, The A-Team, and The Dukes of Hazzard, were stunt vehicles, while other cars, such as the 1966 Batmobile, the DeLorean from Back to the Future, and the car from Knight Rider are simply very good replicas. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to tell which cars were actually used in movies, although at least Tow Mater and Doc Hudson from Cars can clearly be identified as replicas and not original vehicles from the film series. Interspersed among these vehicles are rather unusual custom-built cars that may not have appeared in any film or TV show but still truly stand out. This includes the car that looks like a giant roller skate and the bunkbed hot rod. However, a second large section of this museum named the Liberace Garage features the famous Las Vegas performer’s outrageous car collection in a space filled with mementos from the performer’s past. Several Rolls Royces, most of which are decorated with mirrored tiles, feature very prominently within this room, although the room also contains a Bradley GT with gullwing doors and a custom-made hot rod with a piano on top.  At the beginning of his performances, Liberace would often enter the stage in one of the Rolls Royces. Even with all of the other exotic cars driving around Las Vegas as well as the various garages interspersed in the areas off the Strip, no other Las Vegas venue can present visitors with the opportunity to see multiple Batmobiles and Liberace Rolls Royces under one roof, making the Hollywood Cars Museum and Liberace Garage truly distinct among its peers.",
