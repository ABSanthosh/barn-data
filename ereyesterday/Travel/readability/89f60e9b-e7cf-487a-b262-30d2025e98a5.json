  "description": "Şakirin Mosque was built in 2009 by the architect Hüsrev Tayla. It was decorated by Zeynep Fadıllıoğlu, the first female interior designer of a mosque in modern Turkey. The mosque is built in a modern style, with an aluminum roof and lightweight decorations inside. Unlike other mosques in Istanbul, it uses almost no stone, giving the building the impression of being weightless. Inside, you can see an impressive tilted chandelier and calligraphy by Semih İrteş. The mosque is very quiet and used mostly by locals.",
