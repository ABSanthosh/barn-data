  "description": "Dinah the Pink Dinosaur greets visitors entering Vernal, Utah. Originally, the 40-foot tall figure welcomed patrons of the town's Dine-a-Ville Motel. Designed and built in 1958 by motel owner Helen Millecam, the dinosaur seemed like a perfect icon for the new business located near Dinosaur National Monument, where many apatosaurus fossils had been discovered. Construction of the dino was contracted out to the Young Brothers Electric Sign Company, who were also responsible for other novelty signs such as Downtown Las Vegas' \"Vegas Vic.\" Naturally, they designed Dinah's eyes and the sign she held to glow. With an interior of steel, fiberglass, and wire mesh, the dinosaur weighs over a ton. When the motel closed and was demolished in 1999, Dinah's fate was uncertain. As a loved symbol of the city, she was saved and moved to city property along US-40. Although her long tail fell off during a 2023 vehicle accident, it was reattached soon after. Today, Dinah's eye still glow as she now holds a sign promoting the city, which calls itself \"Dinosaurland.\"",
