So is choosing the right place to stay and keeping your expectations reasonable.Credit...Weston WeiPerri KlassDr. Perri Klass is a professor of journalism and pediatrics at New York University and the author of “The Best Medicine: How Science and Public Health Gave Children a Future.”Updated Traveling with a baby or a toddler can be fun, frustrating, even revelatory. Planning is key, and so is your willingness to tailor the trip to the youngest traveler. As Dr. Elizabeth Barnett, the director of the pediatric travel program at Boston Medical Center, advises, “If you take a young child, it’s all about the child.”Choose one (or two) destinationsThis is not the time for a “nine European capitals in seven days” trip. Think about picking one place or splitting your trip between two destinations. That will allow you to settle in and get the sleep schedule sorted out. Most small children thrive on routines. If you find the right playground or bakery, your child will enjoy returning.Getting there: It’s all about strategy — and luckAirports, airplanes, long drives, train rides: They all loom large, depending on your child’s disposition. Get ready to distract, soothe, sing, nurse — whatever helps. For toddlers, pediatricians agree that travel is the perfect occasion to forget screen time rules and embrace devices and programming that will help pass the time.For babies, sucking something aboard an airplane can help with painful air pressure changes in the ears, so pack a pacifier and a bottle, and if you’re breastfeeding, dress for comfortable semipublic nursing. Don’t give your baby medication to promote sleep unless you’ve discussed it with your pediatrician — and if you get clearance, try it at home first in case there are negative reactions. Healthychildren.org, from the American Academy of Pediatrics, is a good source for tips on air travel with babies.Keep in mind that if an infant car seat is going to be used on an airplane, it should say on the label that it is certified for use on aircraft.Some children behave perfectly on long flights, while others lose it completely. But every child is capable of both. It’s up to you to bring along equipment and diversions, snacks, changes of clothing and a friendly, apologetic smile in case your child interferes with other passengers’ comfort.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
