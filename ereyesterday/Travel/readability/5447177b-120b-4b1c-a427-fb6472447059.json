Having captured my thoughts and feelings as I traveled has allowed me to relive that trip over and over again in the years since. Memories fade, so being able to relive events as they happened is priceless. To be reminded of the people I met, places I saw, and things I felt? To see my journeys through the eyes of my younger self makes me glad I kept a journal. Younger me was wise! While we memorialize our travels on social media, journals let you get more personal and honest. After all, unlike social media, you’re (probably) the only one that is going to read it. Long-form writing also allows you to go a lot more in-depth and is a lot easier to look through in the future (you don’t have to endlessly scroll). That’s why I created My Travel Journal — because I think more travelers should spend time journaling as they explore. I released this journal last year and it sold out! But I found 96 copies in my apartment so I am putting the journal back on sale! This journal features guided prompts to help you remember everything you experience on the road, as well as quotes to keep you inspired along the way. It also includes pre- and post-trip sections, so you can set your intentions before you actually record your experiences, and then reflect on everything. It has everything you need to record your trip: It has guided prompts so you remember to write down all your important memories. There is free space too so you can just let your thoughts run wild. It has inspirational travel quotes to keep you inspired. It’s only as thick as a Moleskine, so it’s perfect to travel around with. I’ve designed the journal to be as straightforward and streamlined as possible so that you can remember all those incredible moments. It will help you get into the habit of journaling every day too. This journal is only $15 USD and includes free shipping. It is 168 pages thick and weighs .75 lbs and comes in four colors: Beige Black Navy Pink You can click here to order the journal. Come get one of the last copies of these journals. They were much loved by the community and I am sure you or whoever you give this to will love it! NOTE: This journal is available to US customers only at the moment. If you are in another country, email me and I will see how much it costs to ship the journal to you! If you have any questions, email me at matt@nomadicmatt.com. Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner. It’s my favorite search engine because it searches websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as it consistently returns the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: SafetyWing (best for budget travelers) World Nomads (best for mid-range travelers) InsureMyTrip (for those 70 and over) Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage) Want to Travel for Free? Travel credit cards allow you to earn points that can be redeemed for free flights and accommodation — all without any extra spending. Check out my guide to picking the right card and my current favorites to get started and see the latest best deals. Need a Rental Car? Discover Cars is a budget-friendly international car rental website. No matter where you’re headed, they’ll be able to find the best — and cheapest — rental for your trip! Need Help Finding Activities for Your Trip? Get Your Guide is a huge online marketplace where you can find cool walking tours, fun excursions, skip-the-line tickets, private guides, and more.
