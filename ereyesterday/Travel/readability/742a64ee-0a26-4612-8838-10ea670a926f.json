Photograph: Annabel AbbsThe 40,000 hectare park was created in 1989, when its biodiversity and geological rarity were recognised by Unesco as possibly the richest in the Mediterranean. My partner and I are here to walk from its hinterland to its rim on the northern coast of Sicily, not far from the capital, Palermo. Our route follows a section of the newly restored 166km Via dei Frati (The Way of the Friars), a trail once used by itinerant friars, pilgrims, beggars, mystics and missionaries. We shall be walking about 90km of sharp ascents and descents over seven days, starting from the village of Gangi (with views of Etna on a clear day). And yes, a century back, some of the Madonie’s medieval hilltop-perching villages were infamous mafia strongholds – all of which makes for a landscape as rich in history as it is in flora and fauna. Today, these villages – depopulated, dusty, replete with romantically ruined castles-on-crags and ridiculously ornate churches – are where we sleep.We booked our guesthouses – in Petralia Sottana, Gangi, Geraci Siculo, Castelbuono and Cefalù – in advance, but could have saved ourselves the effort as we were the only guests. Each day, we head out on quiet country lanes that gradually turn into cattle tracks and then into hidden, winding paths. Here, we must keep a careful eye on the yellow arrows and red-and-white stripes, daubed on rocks and trees, that indicate the Via dei Frati. As we climb, we leave behind the horned cattle, shaggy goats and timid ponies that roam the Madonie’s verdant pastures. Now, skittish deer and their fawns clatter over the scree that often replaces grassland. Raptors soar. We dip and dive, through steep beech forests, past monumental oak trees rumoured to be a thousand years old, around woodlands of wild pear, ash and juniper.In these most remote locations, we often stumble across tiny deserted chapels – and wonder how they were built, and by whom. These were vital places of refuge for the friars who once followed these routes, seeking alms in exchange for work.The village of Castelbuono Photograph: Interfoto/AlamyThe Via dei Frati was rediscovered by a Sicilian psychotherapist called Santo Mazzarisi. After walking several well-known pilgrim routes and wondering why Sicily had no trail of its own, Mazzarisi began researching, and then restoring, this ancient path. In 2017, it opened to the public, starting at Caltanissetta in central Sicily and ending at Cefalù on the coast. In the past, pilgrims then crossed the sea from Messina before heading to Jerusalem, but today’s route has been designed as eight stages, each ending in a village where food, accommodation and, of course, a beautiful church can be found. For a true pilgrim experience, Mazzarisi suggests visiting during holy week – 13-20 April this year – when Caltanissetta hosts processions of life-size statues re-enacting the Resurrection.We join the trail at Gangi because this is where it hits the Madonie mountains. The park contains none of the usual trappings of civilisation so, of necessity, we carry a daily picnic, prepared by our guesthouse, and eat our focaccia sandwiches on sun-warmed rocks. Having explored Gangi’s museum, which is chock-full of geological and archaeological treasures unearthed from the park, we walk 14km to Geraci Siculo. We are not walking at our normal pace – there’s too much to distract us. Instead, we pause regularly to note the birds (buzzards, firecrests, buntings, tits and yellow-feathered serins), to examine the curiously striated rocks that are everywhere, and to exclaim over the remarkably “biblical” scenery. We feel as though we’re inside a Renaissance painting: grazing goats, wooded valleys, divinely slanting light.In Geraci Siculo, we are beckoned into a library by its wizened curator, who proceeds to unlock glass cabinets stacked with 15th-century religious manuscripts. We cannot understand what he is telling us, but the odour of dusty pews drifting from the pages adds to the peculiar sense of time travel.We continue to hike, upwards, through clouds, to Petralia Sottana, where we spend an additional day climbing Monte San Salvatore, following the scuffed tracks of rootling boar, clambering over granite boulders, and getting pleasantly lost.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionFrom Petralia Sottana, we amble 16km to our next accommodation, an agriturismo called Azienda Bergi, just outside Castelbuono – arriving so exhausted we can barely muster the energy to eat the obligatory four courses of Sicilian cuisine: caponata, pasta with sardines, grilled lamb and gelato made from the sap of neighbouring ash trees and known locally as manna or “white gold”.Cefalù on the Tyrrenhenian Sea marks the end of the Via dei Frati. Photograph: Jan Wlodarczyk/AlamyApart from a stooped white-haired man foraging for fungi, we meet no one on our walk until the fifth day, on a sunny morning, near a car park with a cafe. We’re heading to the region’s world famous giant holly trees, 20 metres high and thick with scarlet berries, when we hear voices, dogs barking, cars reversing. The sound is such an affront to our ears we pick up our pace, almost running to return to the unpeopled wilderness we’ve fallen in love with. Minutes later, we are happily alone again until we reach Castelbuono. A taxi is planned to take us to Gibilmanna for the final 9km descent into Cefalù on the Tyrrhenian Sea. Although the route becomes increasingly urban, we are mollified by repeated glimpses of sparkling ocean and the knowledge that Cefalù has not only beaches but a Unesco-listed Norman cathedral among its many treasures.In the past, we have hiked all over Europe, but – thanks to the strenuous ascents and silent nights – never have we slept so well. And never have we felt so deliciously solitary. If crowds are your thing, this park and the pilgrim route just won’t do. But if you like a landscape all to yourself, or a terrain so rich in geological history and so abundant with rare plants, insects and birds that you’re forced to walk at an unfamiliarly slow pace, the Via dei Frati will surpass all expectations.Annabel travelled independently.

For a\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003etrue pilgrim experience, Mazzarisi suggests visiting during holy week – 13-20 April this year – when Caltanissetta hosts processions of life-size statues re-enacting the Resurrection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe join the trail at Gangi because this is where it hits the Madonie mountains. The park contains none of the usual trappings of civilisation so, of necessity, we carry a daily picnic, prepared by our guesthouse, and eat our focaccia sandwiches on sun-warmed rocks. Having explored Gangi’s museum, which is chock-full of geological and archaeological treasures unearthed from the park, we walk 14km to Geraci Siculo. We are not walking at our normal pace – there’s too much to distract us. Instead, we pause regularly to note the birds (buzzards, firecrests, buntings, tits and yellow-feathered serins), to examine the curiously striated rocks that are everywhere, and to exclaim over the remarkably “biblical” scenery. We feel as though we’re inside a Renaissance painting: grazing goats, wooded valleys, divinely slanting light.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Geraci Siculo, we are beckoned into a library by its wizened curator, who proceeds to unlock glass cabinets stacked with 15th-century religious manuscripts. We cannot understand what he is telling us, but the odour of dusty pews drifting from the pages adds to the peculiar sense of time travel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe continue to hike, upwards, through clouds, to Petralia Sottana, where we spend an additional day climbing Monte San Salvatore, following the scuffed tracks of rootling boar, clambering over granite boulders, and getting pleasantly lost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"\u003e\u003ca data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-14\"\u003eskip past newsletter promotion\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-14\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\"\u003eafter newsletter promotion\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom Petralia Sottana, we amble 16km to our next accommodation, an agriturismo called\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eAzienda Bergi, just outside Castelbuono – arriving so exhausted we can barely muster the energy to eat the obligatory four courses of Sicilian cuisine: caponata, pasta with sardines, grilled lamb and gelato made from the sap of neighbouring ash trees and known locally as \u003cem\u003emanna\u003c/em\u003e or “white gold”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure id=\"6954ab99-4bd6-43b9-8970-9bb334dd8ba3\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"img-4\"\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d79e03474c801ec14821892f8b7898df65d91957/369_180_4962_3236/master/4962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d79e03474c801ec14821892f8b7898df65d91957/369_180_4962_3236/master/4962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;dpr=1\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d79e03474c801ec14821892f8b7898df65d91957/369_180_4962_3236/master/4962.jpg?width=605\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d79e03474c801ec14821892f8b7898df65d91957/369_180_4962_3236/master/4962.jpg?width=605\u0026amp;dpr=1\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d79e03474c801ec14821892f8b7898df65d91957/369_180_4962_3236/master/4962.jpg?width=445\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d79e03474c801ec14821892f8b7898df65d91957/369_180_4962_3236/master/4962.jpg?width=445\u0026amp;dpr=1\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"/\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Cefalù on the Tyrrenhenian Sea marks the end of the Via dei Frati.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d79e03474c801ec14821892f8b7898df65d91957/369_180_4962_3236/master/4962.jpg?width=445\u0026amp;dpr=1\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"290.20959290608624\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003csvg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCefalù on the Tyrrenhenian Sea marks the end of the Via dei Frati.\u003c/span\u003e Photograph: Jan Wlodarczyk/Alamy\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eApart from a stooped white-haired man foraging for fungi, we meet no one on our walk until the fifth day, on a sunny morning, near a car park with a cafe. We’re heading to the region’s world famous giant holly trees, 20 metres high and thick with scarlet berries, when we hear voices, dogs barking, cars reversing. The sound is such an affront to our ears we pick up our pace, almost running to return to the unpeopled wilderness we’ve fallen in love with. Minutes later, we are happily alone again until we reach Castelbuono. A taxi is planned to take us to Gibilmanna for the final 9km descent into Cefalù on the Tyrrhenian Sea. Although the route becomes increasingly urban, we are mollified by repeated glimpses of sparkling ocean and the knowledge that Cefalù has not only beaches but a Unesco-listed Norman cathedral among its many treasures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the past, we have hiked all over Europe, but – thanks to the strenuous ascents and silent nights – never have we slept so well. And never have we felt so deliciously solitary. If crowds are your thing, this park and the pilgrim route just won’t do. But if you like a landscape all to yourself, or a terrain so rich in geological history and so abundant with rare plants, insects and birds that you’re forced to walk at an unfamiliarly slow pace, the Via dei Frati will surpass all expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnnabel travelled independently\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e.
