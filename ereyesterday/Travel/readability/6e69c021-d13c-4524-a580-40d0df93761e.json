  "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/agios-nikolaos-church-maza",
  "description": "Built in 1324, Agios Nikolaos Church is located in the quiet village of Maza Apokoronas, a 40-minute car ride from Chania in Crete. It is said to be one of the most important Byzantine monuments on the western side of the island. The church is a single-aisle, barrel-vaulted structure, with many frescoes decorating its walls. Ioannis Pagomenos, the painter of the frescoes, transformed the walls of the church into a beautiful tapestry of saints and biblical scenes. At the center there is Christ the \"Light-Giver\" found between the Virgin Mary and Saint Nicholas. Legend has it that Pagomenos was buried underneath the church. Archeologists from Greece occasionally visit the church to work on preserving the frescoes. Despite numerous initiatives to help with their preservation, the lack of frequent visitors and the church's age makes it challenging to maintain them in good condition. As a result, many of the frescoes appear faded, and due to the candles that the visitors have been lighting, some of them appear black from the smoke. For anyone in Crete seeking a blend of history, art, and a touch of mystery, Agios Nikolaos is the place to visit.",
