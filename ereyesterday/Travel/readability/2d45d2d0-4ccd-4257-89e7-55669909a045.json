Here’s what to know before you go.Credit...Weston WeiMay 30, 2025The outdoor boom that began during the pandemic has had staying power. Since 2020, the number of people visiting state and national parks has soared. Unfortunately, so too have the number of search-and-rescue efforts, as many people enter the backcountry woefully unprepared. With funding cuts at the national park and forest levels — and with volunteer response teams stretched thin — now is a good time to learn how to recreate safely in the wild.“A lot of the call types we’ve had are people getting stuck in technical terrain that exceeds their ability,” said Chris Carr, a paramedic in Colorado, referring to environments that demand agility and skill to traverse.Gear that is more accessible to novices, social media posts from beautiful locales and a false sense of security carrying a cellphone creates may all be playing a role here.If you’re planning a trip into the wilderness, here are some steps that can help you avoid becoming a statistic this summer.Do your homeworkBefore you leave home, get out your guidebooks, look at official websites and learn about any trails, mountains or terrain you plan to explore. Keep in mind that the terrain you’re used to at home might be different from what you encounter on a new trail; the drier, dustier surfaces of the West are a different experience than the rocks, roots and mud you’ll frequently encounter in the East. “Wilderness areas can be vast and can get remote quickly. Start small and don’t take on big chunks right out of the gate,” said Corenne Black, a forest ranger with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation.In some areas, like New York’s Adirondack Park, where Ms. Black works, it can be easy to make a wrong turn or get off trail if you’re not paying close attention. While apps like “All Trails” can be helpful, you shouldn’t always depend on your electronics, either. Learning to use an old-fashioned map and compass — and bringing them with you — can mean the difference between a planned day hike and spending the night in the wilderness.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
