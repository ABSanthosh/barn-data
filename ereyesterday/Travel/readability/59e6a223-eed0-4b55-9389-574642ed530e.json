Many of those passengers will spend a night or two in town, where they may take day trips to see penguins in places like nearby Martillo Island.How Long Will the ‘End of the World’ Stay Wild?Crowds of tourists bound for Antarctica have brought prosperity to Argentina’s southernmost city, but the boom is also squeezing locals and stressing the environment.About 90 percent of Antarctic cruises depart from Ushuaia, Argentina. Many of those passengers will spend a night or two in town, where they may take day trips to see penguins in places like nearby Martillo Island.Credit...April 15, 2025It was summer in the city that proudly calls itself the “end of the world,” and the tourists were flocking like the penguins they had traveled thousands of miles to see.On a late-January afternoon, five hulking cruise ships crowded the docks in Ushuaia, Argentina, waiting to take deep-pocketed passengers who had paid $15,000 to $18,000 each, on average, for once-in-a-lifetime 10-day trips to Antarctica.ImageCruise ships crowd the port of Ushuaia in the summer months. Passengers pay up to $18,000, on average, for the chance to visit Antarctica on luxury voyages.A decade ago, about 35,500 Antarctic passengers set out from Ushuaia. Last year, about 111,500 did. This year, as the season draws to an end, the local port authority estimates that the number will be 10 percent higher. Many tourists will spend a night or two in town before or after their cruise, some choosing an Airbnb over a room at one of the city’s mostly humble hotels.The explosion in tourism is bringing prosperity for the 83,000 residents of Ushuaia, which is squeezed between the Andes and the Beagle Channel. But it’s also taxing resources, raising the cost of living and contributing to a housing shortage for workers. The remoteness, Ushuaia’s biggest selling point, only makes the strain worse.“We sell an aura,” said Julio Lovece, president of the Ushuaia Foundation XXI, which advocates tourism development that benefits the local community. “Unlike other places that maybe sell waterfalls, or whales, or glaciers, we sell the end of the world.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
