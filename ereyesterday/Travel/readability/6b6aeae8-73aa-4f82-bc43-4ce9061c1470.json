The experience can be stressful: With the clock ticking, travelers race through customs, pick up and re-check bags, then have to go through security again to board the next leg of their flight. If they’re not speedy enough or the lines aren’t moving, the plane will leave without them.But starting this month, travelers on several flights from London to Dallas and Atlanta will be able to bypass some of these steps and get to their connecting gates faster.The pilot program, called One Stop Security, will expand to select flights from Heathrow Airport to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport operated by American Airlines and to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport operated by Delta Air Lines. It began last week on one route, Flight 51, from London to Dallas, an American Airlines spokesman said.Delta and American will both offer dedicated customs areas for eligible flights, but each will handle security screening differently.Passengers with American who are connecting to other flights from Dallas will stay at gate level and go through a small passport control area before getting cleared to head to their next gate. They won’t need to claim their bags, recheck them, or go through Transportation Security Administration screening.For Delta passengers in Atlanta, the process will differ depending on whether a traveler is registered in Global Entry, a trusted traveler program, or has the Mobile Passport Control app, which is available only to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.All travelers on those flights will be processed in a dedicated customs area separate from standard immigration and won’t have to claim and recheck their bags, but only Global Entry members or Mobile Passport Control app holders will be able to bypass T.S.A. screening, a Delta spokeswoman said. In all, this can save customers up to 40 minutes, the spokeswoman added.The T.S.A. did not respond to multiple requests for comment. However, Adam Stahl, the T.S.A. deputy administrator, told Fox News in an interview that more international airports would join the program in the coming months.The One Stop Security pilot began in February for travelers going from Dallas-Fort Worth to Heathrow and then connecting to international destinations outside Britain. It’s available on five daily flights operated by American on this route, an airline spokesman said.Christine Chung is a Times reporter covering airlines and consumer travel.Related ContentAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT",
