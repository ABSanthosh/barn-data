Winter’s over, spring has sprung, “thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages” — as Geoffrey Chaucer wrote in Middle English in the 14th century.People are still tramping the same general path from points around London, eastward toward the spired vision that is Canterbury Cathedral and sometimes beyond along the Pilgrims’ Way.Today, the Pilgrims’ Way is a series of public footpaths, bridle ways and paved lanes that parallels and sometimes coincides with a national trail, the North Downs Way, created in a post-World War II effort to get urban people into the countryside.ImageIn April and May bluebells carpet many of the woodlands along the Pilgrims Way.The precise route of the medieval Catholic pilgrims is not certain, but human feet have walked the same route along a chalk escarpment that runs between the English Channel and the British heartland for millenniums, since long before Christianity. Druidic standing stones along the way attest to lost traditions and meaning that even prehistoric peoples attached to the route.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
