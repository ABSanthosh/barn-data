  "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/devils-punch-bowl",
  "description": "The picturesque but rugged Oregon Coast is known for its numerous natural features formed by cliff erosion. Devils Punchbowl stands out with its red-and-yellow sandstone walls, which contrast well with the black rocks at low tide. At high tide, the scene of the waters churning within the rocks gave the bowl the nickname of \"Satan's Cauldron.\" According to geologists, the cliffs here are around 80,000 years old, and where formed by tectonic uplift. Sea caves form naturally along the cliffs. The Devil's Punchbowl itself formed when two caves were joined together by erosion and then collapsed. The black rocks on the floor of the Punchbowl are originally from its ceiling. All of these processes occurred relatively easily because the marine sandstone here is much softer than other rocks. This also means the Punchbowl and the surrounding cliffs are prone to further erosion and collapse.",
