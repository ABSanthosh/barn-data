Photograph: Independent Picture Service/AlamyEach terrace wall is a testament to the stone-mason’s art, some of them standing as tall as a house to retain a couple of metres of soil. And that soil, carefully gathered and treasured for centuries, turns these steep slopes into fertile, productive land. Coffee grown here would have been served at London’s first coffee house in 1652, although at the time the true origin was so obscure it was known by the name of the Red Sea port where merchants bought it: Mokha.Everywhere you see the intricate workmanship and the care taken to control and retain not only soil but water. Some stone cisterns are barely bigger than a bathtub, others are Olympic swimming pool-size with complex systems of access via steps and ledges.In spring on one mountain, Jabal Sabir near the southern city of Ta’izz, I walked through shady groves of coffee, almond and khat trees, listening to the farmers hold conversations with friends who might be just 100 metres away on a terrace across the valley, but several hours walk apart. Those terrace walls act as graveyard too. When folk die the entire village turns out to carry them at dawn and insert the shrouded body behind a stone. Everyone’s last act is to push up the daisies, and the coffee beans.Many terraces were already ancient when the 10th-century Arab scholar Abu Hasan al-Hamdani described them as a marvel of the world. The fact is the terraces are the product of generations of human dedication, right up to the present day. Some have fallen into disrepair, it’s true, but others continue, and with their management of soil and water, they remain a potent symbol of sustainability, environmental care, and good sense.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionRead more of Kevin Rushby’s travels in his Substack, Backstory",
