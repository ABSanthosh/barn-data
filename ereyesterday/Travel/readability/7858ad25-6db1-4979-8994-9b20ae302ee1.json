  "description": "On a slump block wall along 7th Street, Phoenix artist Maggie Keane has immortalized David Bowie with a series of vibrant murals. Painted in July 2016, the mural depicts the late musician’s various personas through eight side-by-side portraits that span each of his iconic transformations—from his glam-rock to his Berlin era. Keane, an artist known for her eclectic murals, approached the wall with permission from its owner. The mural has since become a local landmark, surviving fading and tagging (with the help of periodic touch-ups from Keane).",
