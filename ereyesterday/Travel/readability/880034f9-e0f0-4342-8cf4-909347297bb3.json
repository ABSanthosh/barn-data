  "description": "In the Pendle village of Newchurch, St. Mary's Church tower features a curious oval opening in its west face. Known locally as the 'Eye of God,' many debate whether the eye's purpose is practical or paranormal. The most straightforward explanation suggests that the eye served as an observation point. The church warden likely used it to monitor and prepare for approaching funeral and wedding processions. However, Pendle's history casts a shadow over this simple explanation. The region is infamous for its 1612 witch trials, where 12 individuals were accused of witchcraft. One of the accused, Anne Chattox, was accosed of desecrating graves in St. Mary's Churchyard to collect human remains. Given this context, it's easy to see why the 'Eye of God' has also been seen as a protective symbol—a stone sentinel guarding the area against the ill effects of witchcraft.",
