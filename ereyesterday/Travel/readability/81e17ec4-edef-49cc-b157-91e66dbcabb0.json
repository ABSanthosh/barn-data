  "description": "In Old Gretna on the West Bank, Dough Nguyener’s Bakery takes a modern twist on the quintessential New Orleans bakery, landing somewhere between a classic Vietnamese restaurant, an upscale pastry shop, and a drive-through doughnut spot. And while the aesthetic may lean a bit a little heavily on the Dunkin’ Donuts model, with flashy cases and pink neon accents, the food on offer is anything but standard. Owner Betty Archote (née Nguyen) and her family are veterans of the local restaurant scene, bringing a fresh take on Vietnamese heritage to Dough Nguyener’s. Their menu offers lesser-known gems like xôi gà (sticky rice with chicken), bánh mì chả lụa (baguette with traditional sausage), and cà phê trứng (Hanoi-style egg coffee), alongside popular favorites such as phở and bún bò Huế.  The history of Vietnamese cuisine in New Orleans is deeply tied to the migration of refugees after the Vietnam War, when many families, taken with the climate and geography of the South, settled in Louisiana. Over time, Vietnamese cuisine became a beloved part of New Orleans food culture, with its emphasis on fresh herbs and bright flavors complimenting the city’s existing French, African, and Creole influences. These days, restaurants like Dough Nguyener’s are rightly celebrated as integral parts of the city’s food scene, and Vietnamese bakeries across town have rolled out versions of traditional king cakes during carnival season, proving to be some of the best of the best on offer. At Dough Nguyener’s, the cà phê sữa đá (Vietnamese coffee) doughnut steals the show—a clever, delicious nod to fusion cuisine. It’s a delightful year-round treat and a worthy stand-in for their similarly-flavored king cake, available exclusively during Mardi Gras. Either way, it’s something to savor—and something to look forward to.",
