  "description": "The famous alleyways of Shinjuku’s Golden Gai are filled with tiny bars packed together. Head a little off the main strip and you’ll find a closet-sized red hued room filled with clamshell VHS tapes of horror movies, bloody-looking props, TVs endlessly looping scary flicks, and drinks that cost just ¥666. The bar attracts a mixture of genuine horror buffs, as well as patrons lured by the lack of cover and cheap drinks. Deathmatch In Hell is a horror-themed bar bringing delightfully terrifying energy to the Tokyo bar scene. Drink among severed arms, terminator skulls, guitars, and skeletons as heavy metal music blares throughout the small seating area. The bloody circus of horror, metal, and alcohol is orchestrated by GO Nakajima, a man invariably sporting a Wayne’s World baseball cap with a great eye for gore and an even better hand for pouring solid drinks.",
