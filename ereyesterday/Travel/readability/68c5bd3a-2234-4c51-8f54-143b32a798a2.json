  "description": "In 1998, a Chicago shoe retailer named Peter Hanig saw a public art display of cows while visiting Zurich, Switzerland. The fanciful exhibit inspired him to create a similarly whimsical display in his native city. The following year, a collaboration with Commissioner of Cultural Affairs, Lois Weisberg allowed Hanig to bring \"Cows On Parade\" to life. His brainchild spawned similar public displays in many other cities throughout the U.S. In 2001, long after \"Cows On Parade\" had been put out to pasture, Hanig continued to receive positive feedback from fans expressing their fondness for the cows and lamenting their disappearance. In response, Hanig gifted \"The Bronze Cow\" to the people of Chicago. This throwback to \"Cows On Parade\" is an 8 foot long, 4 1/2 foot tall bronze bovine that stands outside the Chicago Cultural Center. Its eyes are etched with images of the Water Tower and Picasso's untitled sculpture.",
