  "description": "Many of Oahu’s best snorkeling and diving spots are associated with enclosed bays or natural coral reefs with large varieties of ocean life, while a few other sites are simply well-known because they are close to tourist locations.  However, Electric Beach on the Waianae Coast (or the west coast) of Oahu is uniquely different from any other diving or snorkeling site in Hawai'i. The beach, also referred to as Kahe Point, is located across the street from the Kahe Power Plant, which is operated by the Hawaiian Electric Company. The power plant uses seawater as a coolant, and the expelled seawater is relatively warm compared to the rest of the ocean surrounding Hawaii. As such, many sea creatures including colorful reef fish, sea turtles, and even dolphins seek out the area around the discharge pipe about 100 yards offshore.  Because of the currents generated by the intake and discharge pipes from the power plant, many guides recommend this location for intermediate to experienced snorkelers and divers. Additionally, swimming to the end of the discharge pipe could take some time. Nonetheless, the clear waters and wide variety of sea creatures make this one of the premier underwater locations in Hawaii.",
