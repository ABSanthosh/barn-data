  "description": "North of Bordeaux, tucked within a park known as la Réserve écologique des Barails, the twin cities gardens have been designed to make visitors feel as if they have been magically and instantly transported to other parts of the world.   Built around pieces donated by Bordeaux's sister cities, the 11 gardens within the twin cities recreate a little bit of Germany, Spain, Japan, Morocco, and other destinations. Highlights include the Munich garden, complete with benches and statues; Madrid, with lamppost, drinking fountain, and dustbins; the photogenic Moorish mosaics in the Casablanca garden; and the peaceful Japanese garden representing Fukuoka.  The twin cities gardens were first created in 1992 in Parc Floral as part of a partnership with an international flower festival, Les Floralies Internationales de Bordeaux. Over the years, the landscaped park (which includes an extensive rose garden and even a manmade mountain stream flowing through rocks from the Pyrenees) and neighboring forest have become a haven for joggers, ramblers, and cyclists. Cultural events are also occasionally held there.  The twin cities gardens have gradually fallen into disrepair, but still offer a beautiful urban escape, all within easy reach on the city’s tram network and a stone’s throw from Bordeaux’s main sports stadium.",
