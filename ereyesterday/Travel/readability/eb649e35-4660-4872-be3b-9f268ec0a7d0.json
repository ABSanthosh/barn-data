Daily Drop keeps you informed about the latest news and information around points \u0026 miles, as well as updates across the airline and hotel industries. While the newsletter is free, they also have a subscription service called Daily Drop Pro, which promises even more points deals, alerts, and tools to help you find the award availability you need for your next trip. But does it deliver? Is it worth the price? As Daily Drop has gotten bigger, I’ve gotten questions about the service from readers so I figured it was time to breakdown the service and talk about who it is right for. What is Daily Drop Pro? According to the team at Daily Drop, Daily Drop Pro was created to be your one-stop shop for flights and hotels (whether with points or cash), deals, and chatting with like minded people in their community forum. The service has five main features: Flight Points Search Hotel Points Search Deal Alerts Wallets Daily Drop Pro Lounge Let’s walk through all of them. Flights Point Search There are lots of websites that let you search for points flights. In addition to Daily Drop, there’s Point.me, Seats.aero, Points Path (a chrome browser extension), and a few others. The space has become incredibly crowded in the last few years. What makes Daily Drop Pro Different? The main feature that I really, really like is that you change your preferences to narrow the results based on time of day, stops, duration, maximum points, and aircraft type (which is a feature that is unique to them). They also have a feature that lets you compare the cash rate but that just sends you Google Flights and I don’t think that a real selling point. I think the real edge here is that you can get really specific on the award flights you want, which is something the other services lack. Hotel Points Search Daily Drop Pro also lets you search for award space for hotels. There’s not a lot of other competitors in this space and Daily Drop has a ton of options that let you customize your results based on points, programs, award certificates, which hotel programs you can transfer credit cards points, and so many more. I think the hotel award search is the best in class and, like the flight search, its ability to let you get hyper specific is really awesome. Deal Alerts This feature lists points and cash deals. It’s really cool because you can see not only award fare sales (which happen all the time but are a pain in the butt to keep track of) but also cash fare deals. You can select your home airports, choose your preferred travel regions, and let the deals decide your destinations. Daily Drop Pro’s points deals are detailed, too — showing the taxes and fees of an award, which program to book through and how the redemption stacks up to Daily Drop’s point valuations. It’s one of the more comprehensive deal feeds out there. Wallet \u0026 Points Management The Wallet lets to link your different accounts (award programs and credit cards) and have them all displayed in one place. Plus, it will remind you of all the perks, credits, and other benefits you get with each card / loyalty program. If you have a lot of different cards, this can be really helpful because it can be confusing to remember all the perk and deals that come with each card. Heck, even I forget sometimes and I’m expert at this stuff (but when you start to have double digit cards, it’s a lot to remember)! The Daily Drop Pro Lounge The lounge allows you to chat with other members. It’s a message board and like all message boards it didn’t seem that active. It’s a good feature but not one that I would rely on given that there’s not a lot of activity on the forum. How much does Daily Drop Pro cost? Daily Drop Pro Membership is $149 a year. Is Daily Drop Pro worth it? I think Daily Drop Pro is a good product if you have a lot of credit cards and are heavy into the points \u0026 miles game. Inputting all your cards and membership programs takes some initial start up time but the ability to track all your points, benefits, and rewards in one place is really convenient. As I said, even I forget about card benefits sometimes. It’s hard to keep multiple cards in your head so having it in one place is nice. The hotel award feature is definitely the best in class. And, while there are other airline search tools, I do like the increased search filters (especially the ability to filter by plane type!). And the deals feature can allow you to keep track of all the deals happening in one place rather than subscribe to multiple newsletters and websites. So, is the service worth $12 a month? I think so. Daily Drop Pro essentially bundles lots of other programs, improves on them, and puts them all into one dashboard for you and that is a real time saver. I think the service is definitely worth it. Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Find a cheap flight by using Skyscanner. It’s my favorite search engine because it searches websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hostel with Hostelworld. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as it consistently returns the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels. Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: SafetyWing (best for budget travelers) World Nomads (best for mid-range travelers) InsureMyTrip (for those 70 and over) Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage) Want to Travel for Free? Travel credit cards allow you to earn points that can be redeemed for free flights and accommodation — all without any extra spending. Check out my guide to picking the right card and my current favorites to get started and see the latest best deals. Need a Rental Car? Discover Cars is a budget-friendly international car rental website. No matter where you’re headed, they’ll be able to find the best — and cheapest — rental for your trip! Need Help Finding Activities for Your Trip? Get Your Guide is a huge online marketplace where you can find cool walking tours, fun excursions, skip-the-line tickets, private guides, and more.

They are the best in class and you can’t go wrong using them on your trip.",
