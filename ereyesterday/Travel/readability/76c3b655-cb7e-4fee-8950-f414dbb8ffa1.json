  "description": "Hanamaki City in Iwate Prefecture is notable for its associations with Kenji Miyazawa, a poet and author of children's literature best known for his fantasy novel Night on the Galactic Railroad, written circa 1927 and posthumously published in 1934. The story follows the adventures of a lonely boy named Giovanni and his friend Campanella as they travel across the galaxy on a fantastical train. It deals with themes of sorrow and self-sacrifice, a reflection of life and death. As with other works by Miyazawa, it is often difficult to interpret and leaves space for theories. In 1993, a new road was constructed in Hanamaki and the city commissioned local artist Osami Yamamoto to create a large mural to reduce the stuffiness given off by the concrete wall. Spanning 80 meters (87.5 yards) long and nearly invisible during the day, the mural is illuminated with UV light after sundown to reveal a stunning tribute to Kenji Miyazawa's novel, depicting a vibrant galaxy with steam locomotive trains running through.",
