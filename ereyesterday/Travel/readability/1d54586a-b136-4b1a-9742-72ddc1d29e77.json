It’s a hub for backpackers and travelers too. The mix of old-world architecture and modern skyscrapers gives the city a unique charm. I especially love strolling through Melbourne’s iconic laneways, enjoying the colorful street art and popping into hidden bars. There’s so much to do here that you could easily spend a week and not get bored. No matter how long you have though, choosing a great hotel is paramount. There are a ton of hotels in the city, and not all of them are good. In fact, I’ve stayed in some that were downright terrible! So, to help you make the most of your visit down under, here is my list of the best hotels in Melbourne: 1. Treasury on Collins This four-star aparthotel is in the city’s CBD (central business district; the neighborhood in Melbourne I recommend for most travelers). The building itself is a 19th-century landmark, and I think the hotel has done a great job of maintaining its character while updating the place, with high ceilings and elegant details like gilded crown molding in all the public spaces. The hotel has a fitness center, and I like the complementary happy hour that they host each evening. It’s a nice touch. The daily breakfast buffet is also complementary and includes your standard fare: a selection of hot dishes, pastries, cereals, and fresh fruit. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with large windows that let in plenty of natural light. I like the simple but sophisticated design, with neutral tones and quality furnishings. Suites have a kitchenette with a mini-fridge, microwave, and a Nespresso coffee machine, while full apartments also have a cooktop and dishwasher. All rooms have a washer/dryer, a large TV with Netflix, and a good-sized work desk (something I always appreciate). The bathrooms are modern and clean, featuring walk-in showers, premium toiletries, and soft towels. Overall, this is a great choice for travelers that want access to a kitchen in a centrally located upscale hotel. Book here!   2. The Victoria Hotel This historic, three-star property in the heart of the city was established in 1880. I love its traditional design, with its grand entrance and Art Deco décor throughout the lobby and restaurant (which offers a breakfast buffet as well as lunch and dinner). The hotel offers basic but useful amenities, including a fitness center, a heated plunge pool, and a sauna. The rooms are simple but comfortable, with a minimalist design that maximizes space. Rooms vary in size but generally offer decent space for a city hotel, with large windows providing natural light. As a solo traveler, I especially like that there are single rooms, a good option for travelers on a budget that want more privacy than staying in a hostel dorm. Each room includes basic amenities like a flatscreen TV, tea and coffee-making facilities, a mini-fridge, and a small workspace. The bathrooms are clean and functional, featuring either a walk-in shower or a combination shower and tub. I think this is the best choice for travelers looking for a comfortable and budget-friendly stay in the city center. Book here!   3. W Melbourne I love this trendy five-star property. It has a bold design and vibrant atmosphere. The hotel features sleek, contemporary interiors with funky art pieces and neon lighting. It’s packed with amenities too, including a rooftop heated pool that’s open 24/7, a large high-tech fitness center, and a spa. There are multiple dining options as well, from a stylish cocktail bar to a high-end restaurant serving creative dishes. Breakfast offers a range of options, from fresh pastries and fruit to more substantial hot meals, all in an chic setting. The rooms here are spacious and ultra-modern, with an edgy, stylish design. There are large, comfy beds, big flatscreen TVs with casting functionality, a desk, complimentary bottled water, and stocked minibars. I love the floor-to-ceiling windows as they provide lots of natural light. The black marble bathrooms are sleek and luxurious, featuring huge walk-in rain showers, light-up mirrors, high-end toiletries, plenty of counter space, and even heated toilet seats! If you’re looking for a unique, high-end experience in the CBD, stay here. Book here!   4. Quest St. Kilda Bayside This four-star apartment hotel is just minutes from St. Kilda Beach, one of my favorite areas in the city. The hotel has a modern, minimalist design and offers a relaxed atmosphere. Amenities include a small outdoor swimming pool, BBQ facilities, a gym, and secure on-site parking. While there’s no on-site restaurant, each apartment comes with a fully equipped kitchen, and there are plenty of cafés and restaurants nearby for breakfast and other meals. The spacious apartments all have separate living and dining areas, as well as full kitchens with a stove, microwave, mini fridge, toaster, and a tea/coffee maker. Rooms also have a washer/dryer and smart TVs. The bathrooms are clean and functional, with walk-in showers that have excellent water pressure, as well as nice complimentary toiletries. Overall, the apartments provide a home-like feel with all the essential amenities for a longer stay in a vibrant part of the city. Book here!   5. The Langham Hotel This luxurious five-star property is located along the Yarra River in the heart of the Southbank. I love the grand elegance here, from the marble entranceway to the chandeliers and plush furnishings. You can expect top-notch amenities here too, including a pool in a beautiful atrium, a well-equipped fitness center with a sauna and steam room, and a spa known for its exceptional wellness treatments. The hotel’s restaurant serves a high-end buffet, and while it’s expensive, it’s worth a try, even if just for breakfast. It’s quite extravagant and features a massive array of baked goods, an egg station where you can get benedicts or omelets, as well as other hot dishes like brioche French toast and waffles. The spacious rooms have a classic, luxurious feel, featuring large windows with stunning views of either the city skyline or the river. Rooms come with plush bedding, a 55” smart TV, a minibar, and a work desk. The bathrooms are equally upscale, offering marble finishes, deep soaking tubs, walk-in showers with good water pressure, high-end toiletries, fluffy bathrobes, and slippers. If you’re looking for a place to splurge, this is it! Book here!   6. Ovolo South Yarra I like the eclectic and colorful design of this trendy four-star hotel. It’s very retro chic, filled with pop art on the walls and funky furniture throughout. The lobby and common areas are bright and inviting, making it a fun place to hang out. The hotel offers several amenities, including a gym that’s open 24/7 and complimentary self-serve laundry. There are also fun and unique touches like the sweets station by the elevators (it has jars of gummies, jellybeans, and M\u0026Ms). The on-site restaurant, Lona Misa, serves breakfast in the mornings and plant-based cuisine with a Latin twist in the evenings. The rooms are compact but stylish, with a design that has a distinctly 1970s feel thanks to the color palette and quirky décor. Despite the smaller size, the rooms are well laid out and filled with natural light from the large windows. All rooms are soundproofed and have blackout blinds as well as comfortable beds so you can get good sleep. In-room amenities include flatscreen TVs, Bluetooth speakers, and a tap with filtered water in the bedroom (which I appreciate as it helps avoid single-use plastic bottles). The bathrooms are sleek and modern, featuring rain showers, quality toiletries, and funky tile designs. Overall, the rooms offer a cozy yet unique experience, perfect for travelers looking for something a bit different. Book here! *** Melbourne has a laid-back yet cosmopolitan vibe that I just love. It’s got a perfect blend of modern attractions and historic charm, and there are tons of things to see and do. But no matter what brings you to the city, pick one of the hotels above for your stay and you’ll be sure to have a great time down under! Book Your Trip to Melbourne: Logistical Tips and Tricks Book Your Flight Use Skyscanner to find a cheap flight. They are my favorite search engine because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned. Book Your Accommodation You can book your hotel using Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels. If you want to stay in a hostel instead, book with Hostelworld as they have the biggest inventory and best deals. For hostel suggestions, here’s a complete list of the best hostels in Melbourne. If you want to know the best neighborhoods, here’s my guide to all the best areas in town! Don’t Forget Travel Insurance Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: Safety Wing (for everyone below 70) Insure My Trip (for those over 70) Medjet (for additional repatriation coverage) Looking for the Best Companies to Save Money With?
