Many provide “biohacking” treatments involving infrared saunas, cryotherapy chambers, IVs and blood work, while others focus on more holistic ways to nurture the body and mind.Some experts have expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of biohacking treatments on life span and suggest setting your expectations before committing to a program. “The good part of the longevity trend is that people are more aware of optimal health and that they can influence the quality and quantity of their life,” said Dr. Kenneth R. Pelletier, author of “Change Your Genes, Change Your Life.” “But taking supplements and having blood transfusions, for example, are not a promise of extended longevity.”Here are six all-inclusive spas and retreats around the world that offer longevity-based programs and treatments.Tecate, MexicoRancho La PuertaImageRancho La Puerta, on a 4,000-acre organic farm and wilderness preserve, offers guests yoga, circuit training and hiking, as well as weekly sessions with its 102-year-old co-founder.Credit...Rancho La PuertaThank you for your patience while we verify access.
