  "description": "The word dovecot refers to any structure or building used to house domesticated pigeons, very similar to a henhouse or chicken coop. The Dovecot Studios on Infirmary Street derives its name from a similar structure when they were located in Corstorphine, just west of the city center. Beginning in the early part of the 20th century, Dovecot Studios was established to be an institution that would carry on the legacy of looming and weaving. Maintaining a connection to William Morris, the campaigner and leader of the British Arts and Craft movement, the studio would work with world renowned designers to create handwoven rugs and tapestries. A century later, the studio would relocate into their current configuration, a Victorian-era bath house. What makes this institution so unique is that the public is invited to watch the artists at work. Besides providing curated exhibitions, as well as a vast array of lectures and classes, Dovecot Studios maintains a viewing gallery.  Standing on a skylighted balcony, visitors can look down on to a massive art studio and witness designers working on giant looms. All of this takes place in what was once a 1800s era swimming pool. The list of artists who have worked with Dovecot Studios is quite extensive, they include such luminaries as Henry Moore, David Hockney, Sir Peter Blake, Elizabeth Blackadder, and Alasdair Grey.",
