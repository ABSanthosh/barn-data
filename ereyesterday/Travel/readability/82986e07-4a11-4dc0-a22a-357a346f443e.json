At least a million more people will be celebrating Mardi Gras, the city’s biggest tourist draw annually, less than a month later.But a terrorist attack on New Year’s Day, which killed 14 people and injured dozens more on the tourist-filled thoroughfare of Bourbon Street, has cast a pall over the city.Since then, local, state and federal officials have sought to reassure visitors regarding the city’s safety for the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras. New or expanded security efforts are planned, including aerial surveillance and assigning more plainclothes officers. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency responsible for public security, including antiterrorism and disaster prevention, upgraded its security assessment of the city’s Mardi Gras parades to its highest rating, which allows for additional funding and resources to be supplied. The Super Bowl was already assessed at its highest level.“We are doing everything we can to address the gaps that the New Orleans Police Department and the Louisiana State Police might have,” said Eric DeLaune, a special agent with D.H.S.’s Homeland Security Investigations who is leading the federal coordination for Super Bowl and Mardi Gras.On-the-ground measuresImageDuring the Super Bowl and its related events, law enforcement will concentrate efforts on Caesars Superdome and its surrounding neighborhoods.Credit...Getty ImagesAccording to the Homeland Security Investigations office, security efforts for both events will include special agents stationed on rooftops and in the crowds, SWAT team members on standby, surveillance drones, extra security cameras around the city, armored vehicles placed at key points, K-9 officers with bomb-sniffing dogs, and patrols along the Mississippi River.
