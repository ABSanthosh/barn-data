  "description": "This roadside memorial park presents a poignant and impressive remembrance of the deadliest landslide in United States history. On March 22, 2014, the hillside north of State Route 530 near the town of Oso, Washington, gave way and 43 lives were lost. An area 1,500 feet by 4,400 feet was buried beneath 30 to 70 feet of mud, soil, and rock, destroying 49 homes. A walk through this memorial park gives insights into the geology of the event, the actions of the first responders, the survivors, and those who perished. It is a thoughtful installation, dedicated on the 10th anniversary of the event.",
