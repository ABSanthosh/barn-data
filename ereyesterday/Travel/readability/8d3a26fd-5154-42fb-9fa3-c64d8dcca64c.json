In 2012, I counted the number of countries I’d been to. I’d clocked up about 90, so I decided to try to hit 100 – which I did the next year.

It made me tear up. In Svalbard, a group of islands off Norway, I saw a total solar eclipse, which was surreal: everything goes dark. I met a matriarchal tribe in the Bijagós Islands in Guinea-Bissau. The women were really outgoing and the men reserved.At times, I worried I wouldn’t be able to get to every country.

There have been a few times when I’ve felt uncomfortable, but I’ve learned to be aware of my surroundings and plan transport in advance.In the US, we don’t get much time off work, but I used all of mine to travel. Being able to go abroad on business helped, too. I’ve spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to do this – maybe $500,000 (£385,000) or more. Since I started my journey, there’s been a lot more awareness of the environmental impact of travel. It helped that many of my journeys used empty seats on planes, or were for business. Now I don’t work full-time, I prefer slow travel and take fewer flights.In June 2019, I quit my job to take a year-long sabbatical to travel. In March 2020, the pandemic meant I had to go home, which was then Texas. I had only four countries left to visit: Cape Verde, Nigeria, Namibia and Mozambique.Eventually, places started opening up again. Namibia was first – I spent two weeks there. It’s a magical place: I went to the giant sand dunes and watched cheetahs up close at Etosha national park. In December 2020, I visited Mozambique, the last country on my list.

I’ve learned that even though we all have different cultures, religions and lifestyles, people want the same things: home, family, love and security. I’ve also learned that you don’t need as much as you think to be happy. In 2022, I moved from the US to Lisbon, where people are less focused on consumption.Visiting every country in the world has made me more comfortable with being uncomfortable, whether that’s travelling, personal challenges, or moving to a new country.
