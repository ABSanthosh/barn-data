    "description": "Thanksgiving is a great holiday for surrounding yourself with friends and family, eating a delicious meal, and finally rewatching all those festive \"Friends\" episodes, all while reflecting on what you've been thankful for this year. Some may be grateful for those delicious dishes that come with the holiday season or the time taken to slow down and treat yourself to much-needed pampering. It may sound corny, but one of the things we're most grateful for is our ability to express ourselves with fall nail art, especially when it comes to Thanksgiving nails. The time we set aside to get a new manicure, especially around holidays like Thanksgiving, is the ultimate self-care task. In anticipation of all the holiday hubbub, take a moment for yourself and get painting - or book an appointment at the salon if that's more your speed - to achieve the Thanksgiving nails that will be the eye candy of the dinner table. If you think Thanksgiving nail designs are hard to come by, think again, because we found a ton of seasonally-appropriate ideas to get you into the holiday spirit. From Thanksgiving nail art featuring adorable hand-painted turkeys to candy-corn nails and festive twists on french manicures, if you need some Thanksgiving nail-art ideas ahead of your next manicure appointment, we've found a bunch of fun nail ideas for you to try before the big day.",

    "title": "The Jheri Curl Is Back and Better Than Ever",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/jheri-curls-49397635",
    "description": "There's no denying that we're in an era where iconic beauty trends of decades past are back in a big way. From the sultry '90s brown lipstick that once dominated grunge and R\u0026B aesthetics to the defiant return of the infamous side part (challenging the long-term reign of the middle part) it's clear that beauty is cyclical. The latest obsession in this retro revival? The glossy, defined '80s Jheri Curl. The inspiration for this trend stems back to singers Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, and cult-classic movies such as \"Coming To America,\" where actors Eric La Salle and Darryl Jenkins are remembered for their iconic \"SoulGlo\" scene. Flash forward to today, and we're seeing celebs like Drake sporting the style - defined, loose curls that are so shiny they appear nearly wet. The rebirth of the Jheri curl is just one example of how deeply-rooted certain hairstyles are in Black cultural memory. To help us learn more about the origin of the Jheri curl and how to wear it today, we enlisted the expertise of hairstylist Nelson Vercher. Ahead, more on what's behind the trend and how it's being adapted for the modern era, combining equal parts nostalgia with contemporary styling techniques. Experts Featured in This Article Nelson Vercher is a master hairstylist at Rita Hazan Salon in New York City who has worked with celebrities like Kelly Rowland and Naomi Campbell. What Is a Jheri Curl? A Jheri curl is a hairstyle that was popular among Black folks during the late 1970s (hitting its peak in the '80s and early '90s), featuring loose curls that are extremely shiny. \"The style was intended for people with coarse hair texture who wanted a softer, more defined curl, something similar to a perm,\" Vercher tells PS. Where did the trend get its start? The style was the brainchild of chemist and stylist Robert William Redding. Redding's innovative contributions to hair care extended beyond this iconic look; he was also responsible for developing hair conditioner and pH-balanced shampoo. Marketed primarily to Black men and women, the Jheri curl was promoted as a low-maintenance, wash-and-wear alternative to chemical relaxers. Its promise of easier upkeep made it an attractive option for those seeking a more manageable hair care routine. However, there were also some notable drawbacks. The style's signature sheen was achieved through the use of an activator, an oil-based product with some undesirable side effects. It was notorious for staining clothing, furniture, and virtually anything it came into contact with, posing practical challenges for those who embraced the style. How To Achieve a Jheri Curl There are several ways stylists create this look - and FYI, these days, there's none of that irksome activator required. If you have thicker, tight coils (think a 4C type), hair is prepped with a wet styling product, such as curling custard, curled with an iron, then set in place with perm rod hair rollers, explains Vercher. However, if you have a 3C hair type, your stylist will likely first use a mild relaxer to break down the texture a bit, then create more of the desired curl pattern with the perm rod rollers. For those with thick or extra-frizzy hair, Vercher says prepping hair with a keratin treatment, in lieu of a relaxer, is another option. Ask your stylist for a custom keratin treatment, which also breaks down the hair texture in order to then be able to create more defined curls, he says. \"The plus with the keratin is it slowly washes out, so you don't have to commit [to the style] for too long,\" he adds. You can also DIY a Jheri curl at home. Vercher recommends using a texturizer (a milder form of a relaxer), applying a setting solution, and flat twisting your hair around perm rods, then letting it sit for 10 minutes before rinsing. The big caveat? Any type of chemical treatment can be damaging to the hair, particularly if not done correctly. It's imperative to follow all product instructions carefully and ideally consult with a pro hairstylist before trying this at home. Jheri Curl Hairstyles Back in the day, the style itself was most often worn down, sprayed with lots of \"activator juice,\" to add mega-watt shine. \"The Jheri curl was intended to create wash-and-wear looks for very kinky textures,\" Vercher says. \"You would see lots of bobs, asymmetrical bobs, or just long curly/wavy hair looks.\" Those are all still good choices today; adding a Jheri curl to these popular styles make for a fun and unexpected twist. To ensure you get that signature sheen, making sure hair is moisturized is key (using both a wash-out and leave-in conditioner is a good way to do just that). You can also amp up the shine by rubbing argan or coconut oil through the hair; just make sure to do so gently, so that the curls stay intact and don't lose their shape.

    "title": "\"Unsexy\" Beauty Products That PS Editors Can’t Live Without",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/unsexy-beauty-products-49362561",
    "description": "There's a new trend sweeping Beauty TikTok where users reveal the \"unsexy\" beauty products in their routines that work like a charm. From body oils to tongue scrapers and everything in between, people are raiding their bathroom shelves to talk about all of the items they swear by but wouldn't necessarily take a shelfie of. These items are effective and get the job done - they just don't have the cutest packaging or Instagrammable results. As editors, we get to try products that run the gamut from dirt cheap to extremely expensive. Due to the nature of our roles, it's our duty to try everything with a neutral lens and report back on whether they work. While we love aesthetically pleasing bottles and pretty formulas that make us want to snap a picture, sometimes the best products are the ones that just work – sans any other bells and whistles. What's \"unsexy\" about a product can mean different things to different people. For some, it's the packaging that it comes in; for others, it can be what the item is used for. Still, the unifying quality of all of these items is that they deliver incredible results regardless of all that. As such, we've decided to share our favorite unsexy beauty products that we can't live without and would recommend in a heartbeat. Our obsessions range from products like Aquaphor Healing Ointment to First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - there are truly all kinds of options. The best news? We're anticipating a bunch of these products going on sale for Amazon's October Prime day, so make sure you keep an eye out. From deodorant to dandruff shampoo, keep reading for the items we always keep in stock (and hidden within our medicine cabinets).",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/taylor-swift-lipstick-nars-morocco-shade-49397393",
    "description": "Image Source: Getty / Jamie McCarthy Much like her album releases, details about Taylor Swift's makeup routine are highly coveted - and arguably just as secretive. Unlike other celebrities with endless GRWM videos and BTS glam shots, Swift has assumed a more guarded approach when it comes to sharing her favorite beauty products - leaving fans (and beauty editors alike) with the task of piecing together the specifics of her look. While Taylor Swift's red lipstick has long been a fixture (read: the fixture) of the pop star's everyday glam, more recently, the singer has been opting for a warmer lip shade that's primed for fall wear. And after weeks of online speculation about the exact brand of lipstick and its coloring, Swifties finally have an answer on the product - and it costs less than $30. Swift's longtime makeup artist Lorrie Turk took to Instagram to confirm the spicy lipstick shade that the musician has been substituting in place of her signature red lip, citing the Nars Original Lipstick in Morocco ($26), which Turk claims she's \"worn for years.\" Image Source: Getty / David Eulitt She accompanied her caption with a photo of Swift from a Chiefs game earlier this season, where the star paired her cinnamon-esque lip with a skin-baring outfit, complete with a denim corset, leggy jean shorts, and wine-colored thigh-high boots to match. As with most things that receive Swift's cosign - whether it be a posture-correcting sports bra or denim workout dress - the product has already sold out at most major retailers. Fortunately, Swift's lipstick is still available to shop in a matte liquid version ($28), as well as in a lip pencil ($24) format. Plus, the formula comes in a handful of other similar shades, which are shoppable at Nordstrom ($24, originally $28).

    "title": "Shark's New Hair Tool Does It All, From Curls and Blowouts to Flat Ironing",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/shark-flexfusion-straight-air-ceramic-system-review-49397290",
    "description": "Ever since the Shark FlexStyle came into my life, styling my hair has never been easier. The blow-dry brush attachments deliver an instant salon-quality blowout and the curlers are a must for quick beachy waves. Plus, its slim and flexible structure makes it travel-friendly. While the Shark FlexStyle became my emotional support hair tool, the only other tool I depend on is a flat iron. However, Shark released an upgraded version of its FlexStyle tool called the FlexFusion Air \u0026 Ceramic System that aims to do it all. As a Shark hair tool loyalist, I was eager to try out the new Shark FlexFusion Straight ($400). With the new FlexFusion Straight, you can replace your hair dryer, blow-dryer brush, hot comb, curling iron, and even a straightener. Ahead, you can read my in-depth review of Shark's newest hair tool and see if it's worth the hype. About the Shark FlexFusion Straight, Air \u0026 Ceramic System: It's designed to work with both wet and dry hair using high velocity air flow to dry and ceramic plates for hot tool performance. It has three speed settings, three heat settings, a cool shot, a wet or dry hair mode, and a ScalpShield mode. It promises no heat damage styling in wet-to-dry mode never exceeding 230°F or approaching heat damaging temperatures of 302°F. It comes with five attachments: a Wet-or-Dry Air Straightener, a Wet-or-Dry Fusion Brush, two 1.25\" auto-wrap curlers, and a styling concentrator. What I Like About the Shark FlexFusion Straight: The FlexFusion Straight includes all the FlexStyle benefits, such as the rotating wand and attachments, but has been upgraded for more versatility. For starters, the FlexFusion has a ScalpShield mode that helps protect your scalp from excessive heat exposure and damage. It also has a lighter build and a more powerful airflow with two unique attachments: the Wet-or-Dry Fusion Brush and the Wet-or-Dry Air Straightener. The Wet-or-Dry Fusion Brush combines the benefits of a blow-dry brush with a hot comb - it's the attachment version of Shark's SmoothStyle Heated Comb Blow-Dryer Brush. This is the attachment I use the most because I love a voluminous blowout. In just a few passes, I'm left with hair that's smooth, shiny, and bouncy. The heated comb helps reduce frizz and flyaways at the roots and delivers a more refined look. Similar to the Dyson Airstrait, the Wet-or-Dry Air Straightener uses concentrated airflow to straighten your hair. It also has a ceramic flat iron, so you get both benefits. Within a few passes, my damp, wavy hair becomes pin-straight with zero frizz and a high-shine finish. This is much more efficient (with less heat damage) than blow drying and using a straightener afterward. I can also use this like a traditional flat iron and get close to my roots to touch up my baby hairs, give my curtain bangs shape, and create face-framing waves. The FlexFusion Straight is powerful, yet easy to use. I don't have to waste time working on smaller sections. I can grab big sections to style and get precise, salon-quality results. I can go from wet to dry and perfectly styled in just 15 minutes. How to Use the Shark FlexFusion Straight To rotate the FlexFusion to a 90-degree angle for ergonomic blow drying, simply slide down the hinge latch button in the middle of the back of the wand and rotate the nozzle to the left. Before using the styling attachments, I rough dry my hair with the concentrator so it's not soaking wet. When my hair is damp, I use the FlexFusion on wet mode (toggling to the droplet icon), and when my hair is dry or needs a second-day touch-up, I use it on dry mode (toggling it to the red three-wave icon). On wet mode, you should see the LED panel become blue (as shown in the top left image above). On dry mode, the LED panel will glow yellow at first, then become green when the heat level is set (as shown in the right side images above). If you want to use the ScalpShield mode, press the heat button for two seconds until the LED lights turn blue (as shown in the bottom left image above). Depending on whether I want a blowout or a sleek and straight look, I'll attach the Wet-or-Dry Fusion Brush or the Wet-or-Dry Air Straightener, respectively. Each attachment has arrows you line up to insert, rotate, and securely lock in place. I use the curlers when my hair is dry and blown out. You can use the Wet-or-Dry Fusion Brush just like a normal blow-dry brush and comb out your hair in sections. Make sure you add a subtle curl for bounce and volume. Use the ceramic hot comb side to style and add volume to second-day hair or to smooth out ponytail creases. To use the Wet-or-Dry Air Straightener attachment, the brand says it's best to position the plate side towards your roots, so the direct airflow hits your ends, drying and straightening the hair simultaneously. If I want to use this attachment like a flat iron, I switch it to dry mode, turn off the airflow completely, and use the plates to straighten my hair. What to Consider Before Trying the Shark FlexFusion Straight Like most multifunctional hair tools, it takes practice to master the unique attachments, especially if you're used to traditional curling irons and flat irons. It took me a few tries to successfully achieve a salon-worthy flip and curl with the Wet-or-Dry Air Straightener, especially since it's a wider base than I'm not used to. The same learning curve applies to the auto-wrap curlers. One curler directs airflow to the right and the other directs it to the left, and you have to swap them out if you want both sides of your curls to face outward. If you already have a Shark Hair Tool with various attachments, unfortunately, those attachments are not compatible with the FlexFusion line. Is the Shark FlexFusion Straight Worth the Splurge? The Shark FlexFusion Straight is worth the splurge if you want to invest in an all-in-one hair tool that can truly do it all, especially if you want to streamline or upgrade your hair tool collection. It's ideal for those who haven't invested in a multi-tool device like the FlexStyle System or the Dyson Airwrap. If you already have the FlexStyle System, this might be a redundant purchase, unless you want to forgo your traditional flat iron. Beyond the two unique attachments, the main difference between the FlexStyle and the FlexFusion is that the FlexStyle is designed to primarily work on wet hair, whereas the FlexFusion can work on both wet and dry hair. Where is the Shark FlexFusion Straight Available? The Shark FlexFusion Straight is available on the brand's site and will be available at Sephora on Oct. 10. If you do not want the straightener attachment, Shark offers a less expensive package that replaces it with a FrizzFighter Finishing Tool. You can also build your own custom set here.

    "description": "For some people, the beginning of October marks the official countdown to Halloween. If you're a beauty aficionado, however, it also means the kick off to a new slate of fall beauty launches. Maybe it's the budding anticipation for holiday releases or the extra time you're probably starting to spend indoors, but regardless, one thing most of us can agree on is that this season of beauty-product drops just hits differently. With the colder months hovering just right around the corner, a common theme we're looking at can be summed up in one word: rich. From decadent body lotions, spicy-scented fragrances, and hydrating hair products, there's something comforting about refreshing your beauty routine and cabinet this season. Should you also be an early bird, you can even get a head start on your holiday shopping and beat the crowds. A win-win. To help make the narrowing-down process easier, PS beauty editors have tried dozens (if not hundreds) of new product launches in order to recommend you the absolute best of the best.

    "title": "Revlon's Viral Blow-Dry Brush Is on Sale Right Now - Here's Why We Love It",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/revlon-one-step-hair-dryer-volumizer-plus-review-48638494",
    "description": "When I think about beauty tools that have gone viral, the first product that comes to mind is Revlon's One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumizer. Not only does it have more than 360,000 five-star reviews on Amazon, but I honestly can't scroll my TikTok feed without seeing at least one person using this fan-favorite blow-dryer brush. It's easy to see why: not only is it affordable, but it's helped countless people achieve salon-worthy blowouts from the comfort of their own homes. Although this product has amassed what can only be described as a cult following, users still had suggestions for improvement. Revlon's response? The One-Step Volumizer Plus ($54, originally $60). I tried out the older version of Revlon's blow-dryer brush, but the brush head was a little too big for me and made it difficult to nail down my go-to style. Also, I didn't love the heat settings because it felt like the high heat was too much for my hair, but the low setting was too low to set the style I was looking to achieve. In the end, it left my hair feeling a little dry and dehydrated, so I opted to use a different tool for my at-home blowouts. However, my best friend uses the older version of Revlon's blow-dry brush and swears by it, so when I heard about the improvements and the smaller brush attachment on the newest version, I decided it was time to give the blow-dry brush a second chance. After I started seeing glowing reviews for the newer version on TikTok I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. When I received it in the mail, I eagerly awaited wash day so I could finally test it out - spoiler alert, it was everything I wanted and more. Keep reading for everything you need to know about the Revolon brush blow dryer, as well as my before and after photos. About the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Blow-Dryer Brush The most recent tool has ceramic-titanium tourmaline technology, which helps reduce heat damage and protect hair against it. It has low, medium, high, and cool heat settings for easy customization. (The previous version only had low, high, and cool.) While the original version had a 4.25-inch oval brush, the newest version comes with a 2.4-inch oval brush. The brush head is detachable for easy storing and traveling. What I Like About the Revlon Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Blow-Dryer Brush The biggest difference I noticed between this brush and others I've used in the past is how well my hairstyle stayed put. Although I think I've pretty much mastered the '90s blowout, I've often found that the look can fall throughout the day if I don't use a ton of hairspray or texture spray. I didn't use either after the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer, and my flipped-in ends lasted even after a night of sleeping on them. While my hair sometimes felt dry when using the older version of this blow-dryer brush, my experience with the newer version was the opposite: it was smooth and shiny. How to Use the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Blow-Dryer Brush When wash day finally arrived, I prepped my damp, clean hair with a leave-in conditioner, hair oil, and a heat protectant. I then waited until my hair was about 85 percent dry, and I separated it into sections. I started out by running the brush through my ends, then curled and flipped the hair under. I repeated those steps for the middle and top sections, and in the end, I was left with a perfect blowout. What to Consider Before Trying the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Blow-Dryer Brush My only wish is that this tool had an option for different attachments, but with the detachable head as a brand-new feature, who knows what Revlon has in store for the future. Still, if you're looking for an affordable way to achieve a salon-worthy blowout without ever stepping foot outside of your house, either add Revlon's One-Step Hair Dryer to your cart or add it to your wish list ASAP. Where the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus Blow-Dryer Brush Is Available The Revlon Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus is available on Amazon and Target. It's currently on sale, but we're anticipating an even lower price for Amazon's upcoming October Prime Day. Rating: Renee Rodriguez is a staff writer and social producer for PS.

    "title": "I Stopped Using Dry Shampoo After Trying This TikTok-Viral Product",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/color-wow-raise-root-spray-review-49060256",
    "description": "I don't care what anyone says, TikTok is a treasure. Over the years, the app has introduced me to new ways to wear my hair in a claw clip, a blush makeup hack that made my life infinitely easier, and new relationship advice. What more could someone want? I'm constantly scrolling for beauty tips, especially when it comes to my hair. I have fine hair, and it can look exceptionally flat at the roots when it's dirty. Plus, I only wash it twice a week, so it's actually dirty more often than it's clean. When I saw a video from TikTok user Kaelyn Emily showcasing how a root-thickening spray gave her dirty hair new life, I knew I had to test it out for myself. So, does the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray ($24) live up to the hype? Keep reading my full review to find out. About the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray This liquid formula is made with proprietary elastomers that promise to add volume to the roots of the hair. It can be applied wet or dry and works for all hair types, but it's ideal for thin, fine, or limp hair. It also doubles as a heat protectant, and it's paraben, sulfate, and gluten-free. @kaetheblondie Wait whatttttttt #hairstylistlife #hairstylistsoftiktok #volume #hairtok #flathair #hairhack #hairtips ♬ original sound - Kae What I Like About the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray I've used this product quite a few times since my first trial, and it's become one of my go-to tools for giving my hair volume. Now that I know it works well on dirty and dry hair, it's practically replaced my need for dry shampoo entirely. I've also used it on damp, clean hair, and it's my favorite product for making sure my volume lasts all night long. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness, and there's no visible residue that I often see when using dry shampoos. How to Use the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray The brand recommends applying the product to damp or dry hair, concentrating on the roots, and then styling as desired. In the video I saw on TikTok, the woman applied the product to dirty hair, which is how I initially decided to test it out. I was on day four of not washing, so I wasn't entirely sure whether or not it would work for me as well as it had for her. To try it out, I started out by sectioning off the top of my hair and spraying a generous amount of the product in each section. Then, I took my Dyson Airwrap dryer attachment and soaked up some of the excess product. From there, I took the Dyson round brush attachment and began blowdrying and styling. When I was finished getting everything smooth and dry, I was shocked to see that my hair not only had tons of volume at the roots but also looked like it had been freshly washed. What to Consider Before Trying the ColorWow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray One thing to note about this product is that, unlike dry shampoo, it does require the extra step of styling with a blow dryer or dryer brush. If you're someone who likes a quick fix, this might not be the product for you. However, I think the extra step is worth it based on the results. Also, I have noticed that the product can smell a little bit like alcohol when you first apply it, and although it quickly fades, it can be a little off-putting at first. Where Is the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray Available? The Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray is available on Amazon, as well as the brand's website and Sephora.

    "title": "Laneige's $24 Lip Sleeping Mask Lives Up to the TikTok Hype",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/laneige-lip-sleeping-mask-review-48879903",
    "description": "Very few cult-favorite beauty products have brought me as much joy as the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask ($24). Ever since laying my hands on a little tub of it for the first time years ago, it's remained a staple on my bedside table, in my handbag, and on my work desk, just to name a few spots I have them stashed. (Yes, I proudly own several flavors.) I'm obsessed with everything about this lip mask, from its pretty pink packaging to its hydrating, nonsticky texture. The lip mask is available in classic flavors like Berry and Vanilla, but occasionally, Laneige throws a limited-edition one into the mix. They unveiled Pink Lemonade Swirl in May 2022 (and fans are begging for its return now that it's unavailable). With a reputation as one of the best lip masks on the market, the product has become a viral sensation - PS editors love it, beauty influencers love it, and the hydrating product even boasts a few celebrity fans. Charli XCX called it one of her everyday essentials in an interview with British GQ - perfect for brat summer and beyond - and Ashley Park dubbed it her sleeping must have in an interview with PS. As you might guess, I wasted no time in getting my hands on these tubs, and I can confidently say that they have become new staples in my everyday routine. Read on for my full Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask review. About the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask The formula first made its debut in the US in 2015 with its bestselling flavor, Berry. Before introducing seasonal flavors like Watermelon Pop and Mango, the brand had a lineup of four other options: the original Berry, Sweet Candy, Vanilla, and Gummy Bear. Each mask is formulated with hydrating hyaluronic acid, moisture-locking glycerin, and skin-protecting antioxidants. What I Like About the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask I've always been the type of person who reaches for fruity scents over the sweet ones, and Pink Lemonade Swirl and Mango were just as delectably summery as I had hoped. The Mango flavor captures the fruit's smell perfectly and the Pink Lemonade Swirl is like sipping on a refreshing glass of the real deal. (I know this sounds annoyingly cliché, but I'm telling it like it is - I swear.) As for what it looks and feels like: it's a lusciously thick formula with a silky-soft texture and a glossy finish. I agree with our former content director, Macy Cate Williams, who reviewed the original Berry formula and said: \"This lip mask isn't sticky or uncomfortable - it glides on smoothly and feels very soothing on my lips.\" Like her, I'm also a fan of using it instead of a regular lip balm throughout the day. The tiniest amount goes a long way, so even with multiple applications daily, it lasts a while. What to Consider Before Buying Laneige Lip Sleeping Masks When considering Laneige's lip sleeping masks, one important factor to keep in mind is the cost. At $24, this balm comes with a higher price tag, and it's worth noting that there are comparable products available at a lower cost. However, the masks' sleek and visually appealing packaging, which has gained significant attention on TikTok with over 250 million views (!) for videos tagged with #laneigelipmask, likely contributes to their premium price point. It ultimately comes down to personal preference and budget when deciding whether the investment is worthwhile. While I don't make it a habit to purchase these on a regular basis, I do treat myself to one occasionally as a special indulgence - and I urge you to do so, too. If you're thinking about buying one for yourself, the good news is that we're anticipating they'll be on sale for Amazon's upcoming October Prime Day - which would be the perfect time to test out the product or to stock up on your favorite flavor. Where Are Laneige's New Lip Sleeping Masks Available? Laneige's new Lip Sleeping Masks are available direct-to-consumer from the brand's website, as well as at Amazon and Sephora.

    "description": "The Expert Edit features interviews with specialists about the products they swear by in their chosen field. For the latest installment, we spoke to beauty influencer Darcei Giles about her product recommendations. Darcei Giles, better known as MissDarcei, has been creating beauty content on YouTube since 2010. Having garnered close to four million subscribers, she's become known for her series \"Black Girl Tries,\" which was started in 2018 to test makeup styles that Black people typically don't get to participate in. \"At the time, the trend was to follow other creators' makeup tutorials, but everyone was following the tutorial of someone who looked like them,\" Giles tells PS. \"I decided to do the opposite and followed the tutorial of a Korean makeup artist.\" \"Content creators do have a voice and we do have real influence.\" Giles has always been a lover of Korean beauty brands, so when she showed up to a TIRTIR event where guests were going home with nine foundation shades - none of which matched her skin color - she gladly accepted the gifting. \"When I got home, I decided to try the foundation anyway and I loved the formula, so I made a video asking the brand, if they ever decided to make my shade or darker, [to] call me.\" Not only did the reel go viral, TIRTIR contacted Giles to partner with her on a new launch that included her shade. \"This was a monumental moment in the beauty industry because this was the first time a brand actually answered the call of inclusion. This moment proved that content creators do have a voice and we do have real influence,\" she says. Giles and TIRTIR now work together to prioritize inclusivity and expand diversity, and other companies have taken note. She maintains that her perseverance in consistency got her to where she is today, with a huge following that trusts her guidance and makeup recommendations. \"It's cliche, but be yourself. My weird interests got me where I am. It's boring to try to be someone else. Even if someone is successful, you can't become successful by being a copy of them. You have to do things your own way,\" she says. Beyond sampling makeup to fine-tune her favorite beauty products, Giles also spends a significant portion of her day regulating her nervous system by working out, practicing breathing exercises, and going for walks. Ahead, she shares her go-to picks with PS for makeup and skin-care, ranging from basic, affordable must haves to tried-and-true investment buys that she can't live without.

    "title": "The Viral Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence Is an Editor-Favorite - and It's on Sale",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Cosrx-Advanced-Snail-96-Mucin-Power-Essence-Review-46422012",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Kelsey Garcia My skin-care inspiration is that of a glazed doughnut. I dream of having hydrated, dewy, and near-reflective skin, and I'm happy to report that a recent purchase has brought me closer than ever to my goal: the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ($15, originally $25). I'm by no means the first person to rave about this beauty product. In fact, the essence already has quite the cult following. (A facial essence, by the way, is a concentrated yet lightweight lotion applied after cleanser but before moisturizer.) This particular one by Cosrx claims to hydrate the skin and even out its texture, all the while minimizing fine lines and acne scars. So, yeah, it's promising a lot. The secret to the product's success is snail mucin, an ingredient that's been appearing in more widely available skin-care products in the last few years. It's believed that the mucin naturally possesses moisturizing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and glycolic acid, to name a few. Some studies have also shown that it can reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles, according to research published in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology. And as far as I'm concerned, it's a must-have for everyone. Keep reading to learn more about the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence. About the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence Key ingredients include snail secretion filtrate (a substance derived from snails and beloved for its hydrating benefits), soothing allantoin, and hydrating hyaluronic acid. It's highly rated on retailer sites like Amazon, with nearly 75,000 five-star ratings. It doesn't contain any fragrance, sulfates, or parabens. What I Like About the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence I'll admit, I bought this essence before I knew anything about what it really was or snail mucin benefits. Instead, I simply kept seeing mentions of the product across the internet, recognized that it was fairly affordable and - since I'm gullible - that's really all it took. So off I went to oo35mm, a local beauty shop frequented by skin-care connoisseurs, in search of a bottle of the stuff. Because I am in my late 20s and own a smartphone, I posted a photo of my purchases on Instagram Stories. I kid you not, no selfie I have ever posted has received such engagement. (Frankly, I should have been offended.) Some people inquired about the whole snail situation, but most of the people who replied said they were longtime fans of the essence. There were a lot of flame emojis involved. It's been months since I started using the essence daily. I use it after cleansing and before applying moisturizer, and I am a complete convert. Though I was worried the additional skin-care step would clog my pores over time, leading to pimples and what have you, my skin's texture has actually improved, and it feels way more even now. The hydration payoff is also huge, and I feel like it actually helps my moisturizer work better, too. For a while, I had been feeling as though the cream would just sit atop my skin after application, and now I feel like it's actually penetrating through and sinking in. Best of all, I finally feel close to glazed doughnut status. Image Source: Amazon What to Consider Before Trying the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence One thing to consider before trying the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence is that the texture isn't for everyone. To me, it feels sticky just for a few seconds before absorbing into my skin completely. This fleeting stickiness, though brief, has deterred some users. It's worth noting: the majority of shoppers agree that it ultimately doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky, and as far as I'm concerned, that shopper was being a tad dramatic. Nonetheless, if that initial texture will throw you for a loop, you might want to consider a different product. Where Is the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence Available? The Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence is available at Amazon and Ulta Beauty. Right now it's on sale, but we're anticipating an even lower price for Amazon's October Prime Day, so make sure to keep an eye out.

    "title": "This $20 Shampoo and Conditioner Duo Works Wonders on My Thick, Dry Hair",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/native-shampoo-conditioner-review-49396552",
    "description": "As a beauty editor, I've tested hundreds, if not thousands, of products that promise to tame my thick, wavy, and often unpredictable hair. Through trial and error, I've found that my dry strands adore the Biolage Shampoo and Conditioner, have a soft spot for the splurge-worthy Dyson AirWrap, and drink up Verb Ghost Weightless Hair Oil like it's their job (if you've got thick, frizzy hair like mine, these are all must-tries). But while these staples are nonnegotiables in my routine, I'm always on the lookout for new, buzzy finds because, well, it's my job. I most recently tested the Native Shampoo and Conditioner Set ($20), a fan-favorite among Amazon shoppers, and let's just say it didn't disappoint. Related: This Conditioning Mask Gave Me Softer and Shinier Hair After Just One Use About the Native Shampoo and Conditioner Set The Native Shampoo and Conditioner Set is the number one bestseller among all of Amazon's shampoo and conditioner sets. The duo comes in a total of six different fragrance options. Both the shampoo and conditioner come in large bottles (16.5 ounces), so they'll last a while. Both the shampoo and conditioner are sulfate-, paraben-, dye-, and silicone-free. What I Like About the Native Shampoo and Conditioner Set There's a lot to love about the Native Shampoo and Conditioner Set. For starters, the value is unbeatable. I compared it to other bottles in my shower and my overflowing beauty cabinets and found that most clock in at about 10 ounces. This duo, on the other hand, is massive at 16.5 ounces per bottle. Translation: it's going to last, especially because you don't need to use much product to get a really thick lather. A small, quarter-sized amount is plenty to give my long hair a good wash. Another thing I'm obsessed with is its coconut and vanilla scent. It reminds me of a tropical, coconuty sunscreen on a perfect beach day. I'm already excited for how the fragrance will make for a nice mental escape when winter hits here in Minnesota. But what sells me is Native's commitment to ingredient transparency. The brand keeps its shampoo and conditioners simple with 10 ingredients or less in each formula, and the back of every bottle breaks down exactly what each ingredient is and what it does, all in easy-to-understand terms. This is honestly the way all ingredient lists should be. I can't forget to mention that the results of Native's Shampoo and Conditioner Set were just as impressive. After shampooing, my hair felt thoroughly cleansed. I applied the conditioner from mid-lengths to ends, letting it sit for a few minutes while I shaved. Once I was out of the shower, I brushed through my hair with a wet brush, and it felt like I had just sprayed on a detangler. It was super easy to comb through, and my hair felt incredibly soft. After blow drying and straightening, it looked just as amazing - shiny, soft, and healthy. What to Consider Before Buying the Native Shampoo and Conditioner Set One thing to keep in mind before adding this shampoo and conditioner duo to your cart: some users have noted issues with the pump mechanism. \"The shampoo and conditioner both smell amazing. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to use them because the pumps are defective and won't pop up, so I can't get the product out,\" wrote one shopper who rated the product two stars. \"I'm going to have to buy some alternative containers and transfer the shampoo and conditioner so I can use them, which sucks, but I don't want to return them.\" While I haven't run into this issue myself after a few weeks of testing, it's worth noting that several people have mentioned it - though many still rave about the formula, despite the suspected packaging flaw. Where Is the Native Shampoo and Conditioner Set Available to Shop? The Native Shampoo and Conditioner Set is available on Amazon with two-day shipping via Prime, or direct-to-consumer at the brand's website, nativecos.com.

    "description": "If there's one thing you take away about skin care, let it be to always wear sunscreen. That doesn't just mean on clear, sunny days, but on overcast days, in airplanes, on long car rides, and at home, too. \"With UV radiation attacking our skin every time we step outdoors - even indoors or near windows - sunscreen is the main line of defense we have to protect ourselves,\" dermatologist Sphoorthi Jinna, MD, who specializes in skin cancer and Mohs surgery, tells PS. \"Our face, in particular, having typically no coverage, is one of the most vulnerable areas of our bodies. Facial sunscreen is extremely important to add to your daily regimen, both from an anti-aging and skin-cancer-prevention standpoint.\" That's not to say it's always easy to find a formula that works for you, especially if you have a sensitive or acne-prone skin type. According to Dr. Jinna, the skin-care industry has put a lot of effort into changing that, formulating face sunscreen that's \"efficient with high SPFs while making more elegant formulations than traditional body sunscreens.\" That means more lightweight textures that easily blend into skin, can be layered under makeup, or are tinted for a more elegant application for dark skin tones. The most important thing is to find a sunscreen you'll want to use every day. First, Dr. Jinna recommends using an SPF of 30 or higher with broad-spectrum protection \"so it covers different types of UV radiation that can cause skin cancers and premature aging,\" she says. Another thing to note is to apply the proper amount: \"Typically, it's recommended about a nickel-size dollop of sunscreen should cover the face, remembering the upper eyelids and neck as well.\" There are plenty of sunscreens on the market, and we've tried and tested hundreds over the years to help you pick the best formula for your specific needs. From chemical formulas to physical ones and even a few hybrid options, we rounded up the best face sunscreens on the market. We made sure these passed our tests with elegant formulations ideal for your skin type and zero white cast for those with dark skin tones. Because Dr. Jinna also points out that \"sunscreen typically lasts 90-120 minutes, and therefore, it is important to reapply every two hours, especially when you are outdoors or in a vehicle exposed to sunlight all day,\" we even included a few options perfect for sunscreen reapplication, like a facial mist and makeup SPF. (Just make sure you use that as additional protection over normal sunscreen since Dr. Jinna says those are \"typically not enough coverage on their own.\") Whether you're looking for hydrating sunscreens, mattifying ones, or options for acne-prone or sensitive skin, find your perfect daily face sunscreen ahead.

    "description": "I've been fortunate enough to have relatively clear skin for most of my life, but every now and then, there are those pesky pimples that pop up at the most random and unwanted times. Sometimes, it can be due to stress or simply a sign that a change in my skin-care routine is needed. Either way, I typically try to get rid of them as fast as possible with a spot treatment. However, recently, I've been even more successful at eliminating breakouts with the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch The Original ($22). As someone with sensitive skin, I'm not the first to jump at just any new product. But that doesn't mean I'm not tempted by the idea of something that promises to get rid of acne in just a few hours. After finally giving the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch a chance, I was thrilled to learn that my easily irritated skin loves it. It helped eliminate my pimples overnight. Keep reading for my full review of the acne patch (which, by the way, you'll be able to get on sale during Amazon Prime Day starting Oct. 9). About the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original Made of pure, medical-grade hydrocolloid, this sticker improves the look of pimples overnight. It's a chemical-free formula and allergy-tested to be suitable for all skin types. You typically see results in six to eight hours. The sheet's translucent matte finish blends well into the skin. Included in a box are 36 patches. What I Like About the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original From its unmatched staying power to the undeniable results, I can say that the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch truly lives up to the hype. Thanks to its gel formula, the patch gently clings to the skin for hours while effortlessly absorbing all of the gunk in the pimple. This is great, whether you're a heavy sleeper or on the go all day. It also helps you beat the annoying temptation of picking at your face, which helps prevent scabs and scarring caused by popping pimples. The patches come in 36-count and 72-count packages. How to Use the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original The Mighty Patch is incredibly simple to use. Whether you're going to sleep or just starting your day, prep your skin with your usual cleansing routine. You can apply toner as well, but be careful with your moisturizer as the area around the pimple needs to be dry and any oils will keep it from adhering properly. Then, you just stick the patch on, let it sit for six to eight hours, and peel it off when it turns white. And just like that, you're left with a noticeably smaller breakout and in some cases, it fully disappears. What to Consider Before Trying the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original This acne patch is an excellent option for all skin types, including those with sensitive skin like myself. However, the brand recommends using caution if you're prone to irritation. Where Is the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch Original Available? The Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch Original is available on Amazon, as well as Target, Ulta Beauty, and the brand's website.

    "title": "These Bestselling Crest Whitestrips Brightened My Teeth in 3 Days",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/crest-whitestrips-review-49221813",
    "description": "In the lead-up to my wedding, there are several beauty treatments I've either already outsourced or plan to indulge in before the big day. From acrylic nails to a natural-looking spray tan and even laser hair removal, there's no doubt I'm holding back. However, there was one treatment I couldn't bring myself to undergo professionally: teeth whitening. The intense post-treatment discomfort during my first attempt years ago left me determined to explore other options. So, here I am now, typing this with my top and bottom teeth sandwiched in Crest 3D Whitestrips ($30, originally $46) opting for an at-home solution that suits me better. While experiences vary, this is officially my chosen method to achieve a brighter smile. Ahead, I break down more details about them, including my before-and-after photos. About Crest 3D Whitestrips Crest Whitestrips have been around since 2001. It comes with a total of 44 strips (22 upper and 22 lower): 20 Professional Effects Treatments and two One-Hour Express Treatments. The American Dental Association (ADA) Crest 3D Whitestrips recognizes Crest Whitestrips as a safe and effective method for teeth whitening. For best results, the brand recommends using them once a day for 30 minutes. What I Like About Crest 3D Whitestrips What truly impresses me about Crest 3D Whitestrips is how effective they are. Even though it had been well over a decade since I last used them, I couldn't resist trying them again and added them to my virtual Amazon shopping cart. The box boldly claimed they could \"remove over 15 years of stains in three days,\" which initially made me a bit skeptical. However, the results speak for themselves. Crest 3D Whitestrips Before and After After just four treatments, the difference is already remarkable. The \"before\" image on the left and the \"after\" image on the right clearly shows the noticeable change. And I've barely made a dent in the box with plenty of treatments left. How to Use Crest 3D Whitestrips Using Crest 3D Whitestrips is a straightforward process. Within a box containing 20 treatments, each strip is individually wrapped for convenience, which makes them travel-friendly. To use them, you simply peel open the packaging using the tear notch and then place the longer strip on the front of your upper teeth and the shorter strip on your lower teeth. As you do this, try to aim to align the straight edge of the strip with your gumline and then fold over the back side of your teeth to secure it in place. Leave the strips on for 30 minutes, and then remove them. I always brush my teeth afterward to get rid of the peroxide taste, but that's ultimately a personal preference. It's important to note that perfecting the application process may require some trial and error. I found that the grippy texture of the whitening strips worked really well on my top teeth but not as effectively on my bottom teeth. Toward the end of the 30 minutes, I noticed that the bottom strip tended to slide off, resulting in a gap in coverage. Similar experiences have been shared by other shoppers. One satisfied Amazon customer, who rated them five stars and considered them worth the money, mentioned that \"the bottom strips seemed to not stick properly but other than that they work FANTASTICALLY!!\" Another equally impressed shopper agreed, stating, \"I found the bottom is a bit harder to stay on, but other than that, they work well!\" What to Consider Before Trying Teeth Whitening Strips Before trying teeth whitening strips, it's important to be aware of the potential for irritation. I experienced soreness and had to take a Tylenol to alleviate the sensitivity, which persisted throughout the day. As a result, I decided to skip a day to avoid dealing with the discomfort again. However, when I resumed using them, I didn't experience any pain and have been using them nightly ever since. When deciding on a teeth whitening method, it's essential to consider if whitening strips are the best fit for you. As someone who values the convenience of whitening my teeth at home, saving money, and being able to multitask, the strips have become my preferred option over professional treatments. However, it's important to acknowledge that there are alternative options available, such as toothpastes and gels that can be directly applied to your teeth or via a tray that fits in your mouth. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), in-office teeth whitening treatments may have stronger effects, which aligns with my experience of feeling significant discomfort afterward. The ADA states: \"Bleaching compounds in over-the-counter whitening products are typically peroxide-based and contain carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide at lower concentrations compared to in-office or dentist-prescribed, at-home bleaching techniques.\" Nonetheless, I'm cool with sticking with my whitestrips, especially since the results are top-notch. And finally, Crest recommends a few maintenance tips to get the most out of your whitestrips. \"If you drink cola drinks, sip them through a straw to minimize the contact of the drink with your white teeth,\" the brand states on its website. Likewise, they advise you \"rinse your mouth as soon as possible to minimize the risk of stains if you drink coffee, tea, red wine, or cola, or eat foods that are likely to stain your white teeth.\" As an avid coffee drinker, I've been making a point to rinse with Crest Whitening Rinse Fresh Mint Mouthwash ($26) after getting my coffee fix. If you do decide to try out the Crest 3D Whitestrips, know that they typically go on sale for Amazon's October Prime Day, which would be a great time to make your first purchase or to stock up.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/it-cosmetics-superhero-mascara-review-49329307",
    "description": "I've been a fan of IT Cosmetics for as long as I can remember. I first fell in love with the brand after trying its beloved CC+ Cream, which remains one of my favorites to this day. This pattern has become familiar over the years: each time I test any of its latest releases, I find myself consistently impressed. Among the standout products that followed the CC+ Cream is the Superhero Mascara ($28). As a beauty editor constantly sampling the latest offerings to stay up to date with the best products of the year, I've tried too many mascaras to count. To this day, to this day Superhero continues to be one of my tried-and-true favorites. What makes it so good? Ahead, I break down everything you need to know about it before adding it to your cart. (Which, by the way, you'll be able to get on sale during Amazon Prime Day on Oct. 9.) Keep reading for my full review. About the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara first launched in 2016, and the waterproof version followed in 2023. It's formulated and designed to lengthen and add volume to your lashes. It's infused with collagen, biotin, proteins, and peptides to condition lashes while enhancing their appearance. What I Love About the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara What I love about the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is how well it enhances the volume and length of my super-straight lashes without clumping them together. Before applying any mascara, I use my Tweezerman eyelash curler. Without it, I've noticed that mascara tends to weigh down my lashes, counteracting my goal to add volume. In the below photo, you'll see my left eye in its natural state (without having used an eyelash curler) and the right eye prepped without mascara, just freshly curled. (The difference is jarring, I know.) How to Use the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara Applying IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is straightforward. I start by curling my lashes, then use the mascara wand to sweep and wiggle the product from root to tip. Two coats usually do the trick, and I'm good for the entire day. This mascara is my go-to for no-makeup-makeup looks, ideal when I want natural makeup but lashes that really pop. For days when I have an afternoon workout planned, I opt for the waterproof version ($28), which effortlessly withstands sweat and - when my CorePower Sculpt classes really take a toll - tears. Below is a photo of how my lashes look after freshly applying the Superhero Mascara. It's night and day from the lifeless lashes I started with. (And yes, they really stay like that until it's time to whip out the makeup remover.) What to Consider Before Trying the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara It's important to be aware that some users of IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara have reported clumping, as noted in the reviews. My tip is to remember that less is more with this product, as the formula is quite thick. I recommend prepping your lashes for application by combing them and removing any excess product from the mascara wand before use. If you see a glob of mascara on the wand, gently wipe it off on a tissue to ensure a smoother application. Although these additional steps might seem inconvenient, it's worth noting that not all users, including myself, have dealt with clumping. Another thing worth noting? The IT Cosmetics Superhero also comes in a travel-size version ($17), if you're interested in giving it a test run before investing in the full-size tube. Who Is the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara Best For? IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is best for those like me who want to level up their lashes with volume and length. It's a great option for all ages, given that it's infused with collagen, biotin, and peptides that condition your lashes as you coat them. While choosing a mascara is highly subjective, in my opinion, this one is worth experimenting with at least once. It might be a game-changer for you, as it was for me. Where Is the IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara Available? IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara is available direct-to-consumer via the brand's website, Sephora, Ulta Beauty, and on Amazon.

    "title": "Everything You Should Know About Chemical Peels",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/what-is-chemical-peel-48461402",
    "description": "When it comes to popular skin-care treatments, there are plenty of options on the market. You've got everything from microneedling to butt facials on the menu, and it can be difficult figuring out which service is right for your skin type and needs. One procedure that tends to be the most misunderstood? Chemical peels. Thanks to a certain episode of \"Sex and the City,\" the thought of getting a chemical peel has become a lot scarier to many than it actually is. The truth is that they're very safe to get when done by a professional, because experts are able to control the potency of the treatment, and when done correctly can boast a ton of skin-care benefits. The ingredients will usually differ from person-to-person, but typically, the results are always well worth it. In case you're curious about what a chemical peel is and why it serves as a great facial treatment from time to time, we're here to break it down for you - with help from a couple of experts, of course. Learn all about the different types of chemical peels, as well as the benefits and safety information. Experts Featured in This Article Azza Halim, MD, is a board-certified physician and anesthesiologist with offices in Florida, Chicago, and California. Marnie Nussbaum, MD, is a dermatologist and founder of Lines Meet Lines. She has a practice located in New York. What Is a Chemical Peel? According to dermatologist Azza Halim, MD, a chemical peel is \"a formulation of various chemicals that are intended to help remove the top layer of the skin to reveal healthier skin.\" There are several different types of chemical peels, and each one can address various skin concerns. \"Glycolic acid peels are great for exfoliating, as they penetrate deep into the skin,\" Dr. Halim tells PS. \"Lactic acid peels are derived from milk and gentle for sensitive skin, as well as moisturizing for dry skin. We also have salicylic acid peels, TCA peels, retinol peels, and so much more, and each can be used alone or combined, depending on the skin's needs.\" Chemical Peel Benefits Chemical peels have a long list of benefits. They usually help minimize dullness, pores, the appearance of fine lines, scars, and hyperpigmentation. \"These are great for anyone that desires more rejuvenated skin, as well as to treat various conditions such as acne and acne scars, hyperpigmentation, sunspots, pores, fine lines, aging skin, uneven skin tone, [and] texture, as well as balancing oil secretion,\" Dr. Halim says. \"I always recommend to my patients to get peels in between laser treatments to maintain and prolong the results of their lasers, as well as for skin health.\" Are Chemical Peels Safe? Despite what you may have heard (or seen on TV), chemical peels are typically safe when performed by a dermatologist or aesthetician. They're typically customized according to your skin type and its needs, but generally speaking, you can get a chemical peel if you're experiencing a myriad of skin concerns. How to Prep For a Chemical Peel If you've made a chemical peel appointment with a dermatologist or aesthetician, the first thing you should do is discontinue your use of retinol, acne treatments, and prescription topicals for at least seven days before the treatment. \"Stay away from irritating products because you don't want to aggravate your skin further,\" dermatologist Marnie Nussbaum, MD, previously told PS. You should also head to your appointment with clean skin that's free of makeup. \"We don't want sebum or oil to prevent the peel from penetrating the skin,\" Dr. Nussbaum says. Chemical Peel Aftercare The best thing you can do for your skin after getting a chemical peel is to make sure you're keeping it hydrated and wearing sunscreen. \"You don't want to cause burning or hyperpigmentation, so sunscreen is important,\" Dr. Nussbaum says. You should also stay away from harsh and abrasive products that might irritate the skin further. - Additional reporting by Renee Rodriguez Danielle Jackson was a former assistant editor for PS Beauty.

    "description": "Some celebrities are very open about their tattoos and the meanings behind them, like Dove Cameron, who's talked about her ink in multiple interviews. Some stars, on the other hand though, are a bit more private about the subject. The latter is the case for Rosalía. The Spanish singer has a small collection of body art, but she rarely talks about the designs publicly. Rosalía has two known visible tattoos so far. The most noticeable one is on her foot and can be seen during many of her red carpet appearances. Her lesser-known piece of ink is on her right thigh and can only be seen when she's wearing shorts or a dress, or in swimsuit photos, which the \"Lo Vas a Olvidar\" singer posts on her personal Instagram page. According to The New York Times, Rosalía's thigh tattoo is a garter belt, and it's \"a replica of the one that the Austrian feminist performance artist Valie Export gave herself onstage in 1970.\" Rosalía proudly considers herself to be a dynamic feminist and she likes to express herself as such through different elements of beauty. She previously told PS that the nail-polish shades she created in her collaboration with MAC Cosmetics are \"a symbol of power and strength - of radical and extreme femininity.\" Get a closer look at Rosalía's tattoos, and learn their meanings, ahead.",

    "description": "When it comes to beauty routines, there's often one tool or product that a person just can't live without. For some, it's a favorite concealer, and for others, it's a body wash they've been using for years. For many people, that product just so happens to be a hair dryer. If you're someone who always likes having their hair looking on point, finding the perfect dryer that can give you everything from a straight style to a bouncy blowout is key. But what happens when you're on the go? If you're traveling and staying at a hotel, they might provide one in the bathroom, but typically it's too hard to say whether or not it will work on your specific hair type. This is where travel hair dryers come into play. Of course, you'll want something that has a sleek and chic design, but there are plenty of other factors to consider before making a purchase. For example, you'll want to consider where you're traveling to and what type of voltage you need (including whether you want a dual voltage hair dryer), as well as what tool will work best for your hair - whether it's fine, thick, curly, or somewhere in between. Ahead, we're breaking down all the pertinent information, including rounding up the best travel hair dryers out there. What Is a Dual Voltage Hair Dryer? If you've never heard of a dual voltage hair dryer, don't worry - we're here to explain. If you're traveling out of the United States, you'll want to pay attention to what kind of hair tool you're bringing with you. The US, Japan, and Canada all use electrical outlets with 110-120V. However, other countries like Europe, Australia, and the UK have outlets that supply 220-240V. If you try using a single voltage tool without a converter, you could end up damaging the tool or even the electrical outlet. Dual voltage hair dryers will work on both low voltage and high voltage, which makes them a great option if you're planing on traveling a lot and bringing the tool with you.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/briogeo-dont-despair-repair-hair-mask-review-49396228",
    "description": "After spending the summer swimming in a chlorinated pool and baking in the sun, my already-dry hair started to look extra parched, even after lathering it in my favorite hair oil. I knew I needed an extra step in my haircare routine since I also color it and have naturally curly (and frizzy) hair texture. The last hair mask I tried honestly didn't do much to perk up my dull and damaged strands, but after hearing people rave about Briogeo's Don't Despair, Repair! Deep Conditioning Hair Mask ($15-$39) on social media, I figured it was worth at least trying. About the Briogeo Don't Despair, Repair! Deep Conditioning Hair Mask It's a deeply conditioning hair mask that strengthens and moisturizes dry, damaged hair. It can be used for all hair types and textures. Its key ingredients include rosehip oil, algea extract, and B vitamins. It's free of sulfates, phthalates, parabens, petrochemicals, mineral oil, silicone, and talc, as well as DEA, dyes, and gluten. What I Like About Briogeo Don't Despair, Repair! Deep Conditioning Hair Mask At less than $40 for the largest size - an eight ounce tub - it's considerably less expensive than other options I've cycled through my shopping cart. It also only needs to be left in for 10 minutes and can be applied just once a week. Low commitment threshold aside, the most exciting thing is that you can actually get results after the very first treatment. I immediately noticed a difference in the texture of my hair, which felt softer. The frizz control is also on point. While I usually have a halo of tiny hairs that spring up with the slightest bit of humidity, the essential fatty acids from the rosehip oil help to give it a glossy coating. I also appreciate that it's made almost entirely from naturally-derived ingredients and skips ingredients I've been actively avoiding, like sulfates, phthalates, parabens, petrochemicals, and silicone. It leaves a subtle scent that's slightly fruity without being overly sweet. How to Use the Briogeo Don't Despair, Repair! Deep Conditioning Hair Mask After shampooing, massage it into hair, going from the root to the tip. Aim to get a nice, even coat throughout. After 10 minutes, rinse it out. The directions say to use it weekly until you get the results you're after. Once that happens, you can switch to applying it every other week if you want. What to Consider Before Trying the Briogeo Don't Despair, Repair! Deep Conditioning Hair Mask Since I have extra-thick hair, I leave the mask on for up to 15 minutes if I have time. I also follow up by spraying on Briogeo's Briogeo's Don't Despair, Repair! Moisture + Damage Defense Leave-In Treatment, which could also be boosting the effectiveness of the hair mask. All I know is that if it works this well after just two treatments, I can't wait to see how my hair evolves after using it for a couple of months. Where Is the Briogeo Don't Despair, Repair! Deep Conditioning Hair Mask Available? This mask is available at Nordstrom, Amazon, Sephora, and Ulta. Rating: Angela Elias is a contributing editor for PS Shopping.

A couple of months ago, I was at the store picking up toothpaste and realized the oral care section now looks more like your average skincare aisle. Sure, there were the typical tubes of Colgate and Crest, but also beautifully designed electric toothbrushes and curvy bottles of mouthwash that reminded me of sleek beauty tools and fancy body products. And, hold on — was that a teeny-tiny vial of tooth serum? I left that day with a lot of questions (along with a fresh tube of toothpaste) and wondered, as we’ve witnessed the “skinification” of hair and body care…is oral hygiene next? Maintaining healthy teeth and gums is one thing, but unsurprisingly, many of the products in the tooth beautification space zero in on whitening – arguably the most popular cosmetic concern when it comes to your smile. Whitening toothpaste, strips, and other systems have long been popular choices for at-home use, but as I did more research, I found brands like Moon Oral Beauty (Kendall Jenner previously served as the brand’s face and also launched a whitening pen in collaboration with Moon in 2021), but also beauty brands that dabbled in tooth care. Tarte has a whitening pen called Pearly Girl, which has quietly racked up hundreds of positive reviews, and Glossier teamed up with Marvis on a limited-edition holiday kit last year. Hismile’s Glostik Tooth Gloss looks just like a tube of shimmery pearl gloss but is meant to be applied on teeth for a natural yet noticeable bright gleam. Oh, and purple toothpaste — based on the same color theory concept that violet neutralizes yellowish, brassy tones — is becoming a thing. “I believe that a beautiful smile starts with a healthy foundation, so I first focus on ensuring that all aspects of oral health are in optimal condition,” Dr. Garrett Worsey, DDS of Apa Aesthetic Los Angeles tells Refinery29. “[Tooth serums and glosses] are part of an exciting trend in oral care; these products usually have ingredients designed to enhance the appearance of teeth, such as brighteners or enamel protectants.” However, Worsey is quick to note that these products are meant to be a compliment, not a replacement for practicing healthy oral hygiene. “Essential components of a healthy oral care routine are twice daily brushing with a re-mineralizing toothpaste, daily flossing, and of course, professional dental check-ups.” But…why teeth? For starters, there’s big money in pearly whites. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global oral care market was estimated at $33.63 billion in 2024 and is projected to swell to $46.52 billion by 2032. As for the glosses, serums, and varnishes…what’s actually making a difference, and what’s just stuff for stuff’s sake? It’s not sexy, but the core of any healthy routine is twice-a-day brushing (preferably with an electric toothbrush), daily flossing (either manual or accompanied with a tool like Waterpik), and depending on your concerns, a fluoride mouthwash. If we dig deeper, an argument can be made that a megawatt smile is the new status symbol — and that brands are looking to capitalize on the moment; my FYP is flooded with celebs’ picture-perfect Chiclet pearly whites — almost certainly the work of veneers, the immaculately crafted, porcelain tooth coverings totaling in the tens of thousands of dollars. I’ve witnessed the normalization of Botox, fillers, and plastic surgery become commonplace brunch table fodder. I wonder if maybe within a few years (or sooner), we’ll be asking the group chat not about the latest episode of Love Island but about getting our teeth done. While I’d argue that the concept of “oral beauty” is simply building upon what dentists have been preaching for years — and repackaged for the TikTok generation — my consensus is that having a beauty routine for your chompers wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world. One, it encourages healthy habits, and two, it might even bring you joy (I mean, Hello Kitty electric toothbrushes tend to have that effect, no?). “Walking around with a smile that you’re confident in can truly be life-changing, and this all begins with a good ‘oral beauty’ routine,” says Worsey. “Maintaining excellent oral hygiene is the foundation, but enhancing your smile with aesthetic treatments can really take your overall appearance and confidence to the next level. The absolute best part of my job is seeing this transformation in my patients’ lives once they finally have the smile they’ve always wanted.” Like what you see?

    "description": "The leaves are starting to turn red, and there’s a hint of chill in the air, which means it’s time to swap out your breezy summer perfumes for something that feels a bit more snuggly. This time of year calls for fragrances that wrap you up like a cashmere sweater — think warm and enveloping amber, restorative woody scents and a touch of sweet, comforting vanilla. Cherry perfumes and tobacco notes also tend to get a boost in popularity around the fall.Lucky for us (and you), a fresh collection of fall-inspired perfumes has just hit the shelves, many of them doing a fabulous job at bottling up the perfect autumn day, a steamy mug of apple cider optional. Our editors have spritzed their way through all these new releases to present you with a list of perfumes that will instantly get you in the mood for fall, no matter your budget. Whether you’re into spicy, warm scents that evoke long naps by the fireplace or a classic vanilla perfume that will linger on your scarf for days, we’ve got you covered. We’ll be updating this story with more tried-and-tested feedback as more new scents are dropped, so make sure to keep this one bookmarked.At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

It’s a challenge to find perfumes and candles that don’t make me feel ill, so I’m constantly on the hunt for warm, woodsy scents that aren’t too pungent. I was eager (and nervous) to try Ariana Grande’s Lovenotes Pink Woods — and I’m in love.“The perfume smells bright and sparkly at first spray, thanks to the Italian bergamot and lotus flower, but it turns warmer and muskier as it sits on my skin (that would be the vetiver and cashmere woods talking). The fragrance reminds me more of a cologne, which I tend to prefer, but there are hints of sweet candy, which makes sense, as there are notes of cotton candy in it. This one feels more mature and luxurious than Grande’s earlier fruity and floral fragrances. Most importantly, it doesn’t irritate my sense of smell or give me a headache.” — Victoria Montalti, associate fashion writerShop UltaAriana Grande Lovenotes Pink Woods Eau de Parfum, $, available at UltaHermès Barénia Eau de Parfum“Barénia is the first chypre scent (think a citrus-mossy-woody hybrid) by Hermès. This new perfume takes inspiration from its namesake, a type of high-quality leather used in the most iconic bags from the luxury fashion house. I haven’t liked a single leather-inspired perfume in the past, so I wasn’t 100% sure I’d enjoy this. However, just one sniff is enough to change my mind: The patchouli tickles my nose and harmonizes with the oaky base note to create a soft leather-like aroma. It conjures memories of my vintage leather bomber jacket, one of my prized possessions.“The leathery notes fade away quite quickly, and you’re left with a cloud of tart berries and sweet butterfly lilies that drifts around you for the rest of the day. If you’re looking for a cozy signature fragrance for the winter, you can’t go wrong with Barénia. The striking bottle design, created to resemble an Hermès calfskin stuffed bracelet, makes this a certified collector’s item.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop NordstromHermès Barénia Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromSol de Janeiro Cheirosa 76 Perfume Mist“Often super sweet, fruity, and playful, most Sol de Janeiro fragrances skew much younger to me, as someone in her early thirties. But consider Cheriosa 76 the fragrance family’s chic older sister. She’s still fun and full of energy (that’ll be the zingy blackcurrant), but she’s also sophisticated and put-together (the creamy jasmine, heady freesia, and skin-like amber woods make sure of that.) Starting at $24 for a mini bottle, it’s considerably cheaper than the fragrances on this list, but it boasts brilliant staying power. It gets warmer and more comforting as you wear it in, making it the perfect autumn perfume if you’re on a budget.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, deputy beauty directorShop SephoraSol de Janeiro Cheirosa 76 Perfume Mist, $, available at SephoraMarc Jacobs Perfect Elixir Eau de Parfum“I normally don’t associate fruity perfumes with autumn, but Marc Jacobs’ latest addition to the Perfect Eau de Parfum lineup has managed to surprise me. Perfect Elixir greets you with the sweet and tart aroma of plums, which happen to be in season during the early months of fall. The scent then warms up with cozy amber and vanilla bean accords, while rhubarb and patchouli add a dash of crispness. It reminds me of a plum and almond tart — the perfect autumnal dessert — but it doesn’t smell overly saccharine on the skin, thanks to delicate orange blossoms in the middle notes. It’s a very grown-up but still flirty version of a vanilla scent that has impressive staying power, but you’ll be tempted to reapply even way before it fades.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop UltaMarc Jacobs Perfect Elixir Eau de Parfum, $, available at UltaGivenchy L'Interdit Absolu Eau de Parfum Intense“This new scent is my absolute favorite out of Givenchy’s ever-growing L’Interdit perfume range. The jasmine in the other variations is quite pungent, which can be polarizing to some people. Givenchy L’interdit Absolu presents you with a white floral bouquet that is much softer, creamier (thanks to the combo of neroli, lavender, and cardamom) — and a little bit boozy, due to the addition of rum. It’s also enriched with tobacco absolute that warms up the scent and lends a soft smokiness, making the wearer feel more sexy and enticing. Compared to the OG version, L'Interdit Absolu sits closer to the skin, creating a more intimate experience overall.” — Eudora Nwasike, certified fragrance specialist by the Fragrance FoundationShop UltaGivenchy L'Interdit Absolu Eau de Parfum Intense, $, available at UltaDedCool Aura Eau de Parfum“Fuelled by top notes of pear and lemon, DedCool Aura is layered with middle notes of jasmine and patchouli, which dry down to bottom notes of musk, caramel, and vanilla. The resulting cocktail is bright and juicy, sparkly but mature, and thick and luxurious — but never headache-inducing. It’s an exquisite, nostalgic balance between sweet and herby, and it’ll wrap you with warmth on cold, rainy days. It has all the makings of a ‘signature’ perfume that all of your friends and acquaintances will associate you with from here on out.” — Humeara Mohamed, contributing writerShop DedCool DedCool Aura Eau de Parfum, $, available at DedcoolJo Malone Hinoki \u0026 Cedarwood Cologne Intense“I was recommended this scent because I don’t like sweet, gourmand perfumes, and this is basically the opposite. It’s true: Hand me a cherry perfume, and my nose will instantly wrinkle. This, then, sounds perfect on paper. Inspired by the Japanese ritual of ‘forest bathing,’ it’s studded with tree-like notes, including Japanese hinoki cypress (which smells a bit like eucalyptus) and cedarwood. As someone who spends 99% of their time in lakes and green spaces, it sounds right up my street, and, at first spritz, it really is.“The initial smell is super fresh, but elevated, like a posh laundry detergent, in the best way. You begin to notice the woody elements a little more as it dries down, and this is where things get complicated. The clash of fresh and woody notes makes it smell a little too home spray-like. It’s a lovely scent, but perhaps a little too piney for my skin. I’d love this in a candle; I prefer something softer and more suggestive in a fragrance. However, if your preference is strong and heady fragrances that last all day, this will be a winner.” — Humeara Mohamed, contributing writerShop NordstromJo Malone Hinoki \u0026 Cedarwood Cologne Intense, $, available at NordstromINITIO Parfums Privés Atomic Rose Hair Perfume“I’ve been on the lookout for a signature hair scent for years. As a petite girlie, I’m convinced that lovely-smelling hair is a great way to make an impactful first impression since most people tower over me and can only see the top of my head. With these new hair mists by INITIO, I’ve landed on the hair fragrance of my dreams. These perfumes are alcohol-free, which means they won’t dry out your ends, while panthenol (vitamin B5) moisturizes the hair and makes it shinier without weighing it down.“Atomic Rose is my favorite out of the range: it casts a veil of jasmine, rose, bergamot, and vanilla that stays on my hair, and I’m hooked on the luxurious floral scent. I keep holding the ends of my hair for a sniff throughout the day, and every person who has hugged me has complimented my smell. It’s still an investment at $91, but the price point is significantly lower than the eau de parfum version, which starts at $240.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop NordstromINITIO Atomic Rose Hair Perfume, $, available at NordstromVictoria’s Secret Daring Eau De Parfum“I have a soft spot for Victoria’s Secret perfumes. I think they are quite good across the board and definitely hold their own against fancy designer ones. The latest launch is named Daring, and even before I smelled it, I knew it would be right up my alley. It’s a crisp, woody scent (two words not usually paired together), and features a unique blend of bergamot, amber, and oakmoss for a complex result — bright and verdant at the beginning, but then dries down to reveal sensual earthy notes. I’ve been loving it for fall, since it feels very feminine and elegant (but not in a granny way), but also a little masculine with its oakiness and hint of edge. It also doesn’t hurt that the bottle is the prettiest pale green hue, which is my favorite color.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writerShop Victoria's SecretVictoria's Secret Daring Eau De Parfum, $, available at Victoria's SecretPenhaligon’s The Dandy Eau de Parfum“I only just received The Dandy and I’m already a quarter of the way through the bottle. In fact, I’m calling it: it’s my new signature scent. I’m obsessed with the 1920s (the haircuts, brooding speakeasies, the infamous parties) and The Dandy is what I imagine every stylish flapper girl smelt like. It opens with a splash of whisky (rich and earthy) then makes way for raspberry (tart and floral) but it’s the notes that remain — creamy, musky, skin-like ambrox, rich oak, spicy cedarwood and intoxicating smoke — that make this so special.“On the dry down, the cocktail-esque notes dissipate, and it transforms into something really soothing. Throughout the day, I catch delicious, delicate plumes of it, like the fragrance is simply an extension of me — like clean, powdery skin. The other day, someone chased me off the train (bear in mind it wasn’t their stop) to ask me which perfume I was wearing. It’s really that memorable.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, deputy beauty directorShop NordstromPenhaligon's The Dandy Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromLike what you see?

    "title": "The Hype Is Real: These 2 Products Gave Me Fuller-Looking Lips",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fuller-lips-makeup-trick?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "For as long as I can remember, my lips have been a source of insecurity. My upper lip is visibly thinner than my lower, and while it’s probably not as noticeable to others as it is to me, my Cupid’s bow is slightly uneven. My awareness of this lack of volume and symmetry dates back to childhood, when I would spend hours poring over the full and flawless lips of the ‘90s supermodels that graced my mother’s magazines — a fixation that led to a failed middle school attempt at wearing lip liner, where I would thickly line and reshape them to poor effect. (The chalky formulas of the early aughts certainly didn’t help my case.) I abandoned my efforts soon after when a friend kindly pointed out that I looked “insane.” Now, in my 30s and so much more self-assured, my feelings toward my lips are less characterized by anxiety, and yet, they still lack a certain something. I wanted gloriously full lips that — and this was important — had to look natural. I had no idea how to achieve this elusive balance.  As it turned out, there was a lot I could do, but none of it would deliver the look I so deeply desired without costing me an arm and a leg (or a full month’s rent). I first considered a lip lift, a permanent surgical procedure that alters the shape and position of the upper lip to make it look fuller. But due to financial constraints (it can cost upward of $6,500!) and a very real fear of going under the knife, I ultimately ruled it out. I also couldn’t justify the $800+ price tag of expertly injected lip filler in NYC, especially given it would require once-to-twice yearly touch-ups. Plus, my Google search turned up enough filler migration photos to turn me off for good. I didn’t completely shy away from the med spa, however. I worked up the courage to try the less expensive but much more temporary lip flip, which uses strategically placed neurotoxin injections to coax your upper lip to flip upward and create subtle fullness. It looked great, but I just couldn’t get behind the whole drooling-on-myself-in-public thing every time I took a sip of my drink. (If you know, you know.) Frustrated, I then turned to a tried-and-true and needle-free method for enhancing your facial features: makeup. I knew that skillfully applied cosmetics could create magic, but I feared that I, a mere mortal who lacks steady hands (please don’t ever ask me to apply winged eyeliner), would struggle…and struggle I did. Despite consuming countless TikTok tutorials on how to masterfully overline your lips to attain that nepo baby-influencer pout, I just couldn’t get it right. I found myself right back where I was at 13: The final product always leaned too harsh or clown-like to wear out of the house, and I found that many lip liner formulas I tried were super drying, tugging on my lips and creating the opposite effect of fullness. That’s when I discovered this genius hack — and the products needed to achieve it. After hearing the sung praises from my beauty writer peers, I got my hands on Maybelline’s Lifter Liner, a deliciously creamy pencil that taught me lip liner doesn’t have to, well, kind of suck. Its hydrating, hyaluronic acid-infused formula glides on smooth as silk and wears incredibly comfortably — no dryness or chalkiness in sight. More importantly, its consistency makes it easy to blend and buff out, something I learned is crucial for creating a seamless, realistic look. All it takes to pull off my dream look is to: start from the center of my lips, slightly overline my natural contours, and then diffuse the color through the center of my lips with the tip of my finger. This creates gorgeous, natural-looking dimension and fullness, no expert skills or fancy tools required. I found that the shade “Out Of Line” is the perfect rosy-taupe that’s slightly darker than my natural lip color, which helps create subtle definition for a “my lips but better” effect. This alone does the trick, but topping it off with the Lifter Gloss really amplifies the overall look. Just a few swipes of hydrating, high-shine formula in the shade “Stone” instantly smoothes my lips, camouflaging any lines or signs of dryness and imparting a fuller-looking, glass-like finish. For a trick this simple, it’s done so much for me and my confidence, because it’s helped me learn to love my lips. It’s not that I ever needed to permanently (or semi-permanently) change them, but a little enhancement goes a long way. Now, it’s become a mainstay in my daily makeup routine, and I leave my house with the fullest, supplest, juiciest lips to date — and it didn’t require any painful procedures or draining my bank account to get there. In fact, I had not one but two friends ask if I had “done something” to my lips on their first public debut. Fortunately for them, I don’t gate-keep. .primisslate { display: none !important; } Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "title": "What Went Wrong At The Fenty Hair Salon In London?",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fenty-hair-salon-experience-4c-hair?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "When the Fenty Hair salon pop-up opened its doors in the Selfridges department store in London earlier this month, the girlies didn’t hesitate to get their bookings in. Located inside Selfridges’ Corner Shop activation from 3rd to 28th September, all you needed to secure an appointment was freshly washed hair and £35 (approx $45, which you could redeem against any Fenty products). According to my Girl Math calculations, the service worked out to be free (or at least on Rihanna’s tab). This salon experience was an exciting extension of Fenty Hair by Rihanna, the haircare line launched by the Bajan superstar and multi-hyphenate in June of this year. Fenty Beauty is known as the brand that helped to revolutionize inclusivity in the makeup industry by celebrating diversity, heritage, and authenticity, holding its competitors (including the big beauty conglomerates) to account on why they couldn’t (or didn’t care to) get shade matching right for all. The “Fenty effect” sparked a cultural reset in the industry, proving to many that visibility sells. Women with dark complexions, like me, started seeing themselves featured in campaigns more often and finding beauty products on the high street more easily as brands scrambled to keep up with the shade-inclusivity conversation. Naturally then, expectations for the Fenty Hair salon pop-up were high. As far as we’re all concerned, Rihanna knows how to build a brand that feels like it’s truly for everybody.  The pop-up salon positioned itself as an in-person experience for inclusive haircare, where all textures and curl patterns could receive premium treatment, especially those of us who have long been underserved in mainstream haircare. Customers of any hair type could pick a style from the Fenty Hair lookbook and then be guided to choose the right product line-up for their hair type that will repair, strengthen, hydrate, smooth and protect. Despite these intentions, the Fenty Hair salon prompted backlash from some Black women with 4C hair who felt their needs weren’t properly met. The salon’s claim of inclusivity clashed with reality for some, including content creator @sincerelyoghosa, who shared her experience on TikTok. Oghosa, a fashion and beauty influencer, took to social media to share her frustration with the Fenty Hair salon after what she described as inadequate service and an overall disappointing experience with her 4C hair. In her video, Oghosa expressed that she was left feeling that her hair was manhandled and treated as an inconvenience. “I believe that from the moment I showed up in front of [the stylist], she was just annoyed at the prospect of having to do my hair,” she said. “I have never felt like such an inconvenience just because my hair is natural,” she added, in a TikTok video that has amassed 3.4 million views to date. “I felt like, Oh you ugly nappy-headed girl, why did you think you’re gonna come here and get a nice style? That is literally what it was giving,” she explained. The comments section on her two-part storytime video has since been turned off but her experience reflects a broader issue that Black women with 4C hair often face in salons: texturism — discrimination towards those with coarser and more afro-textured hair. After Oghosa posted her video, Fenty Hair salon issued an apology, acknowledged her experience, and expressed regret that it did not meet the high standard they aimed for. Refinery29 Unbothered also reached out directly to Fenty Beauty for comment. The brand’s representative said: “Oghosa’s experience at our styling pop-up does not align with the core brand values and standards of beauty for all that our brand has stood for since 2017. We take this feedback very seriously and took immediate action to ensure that it will not happen again. We have worked diligently to ensure that every person working with our brand is fully educated, trained, and given the resources to provide an experience where all people are celebrated, feel seen, and ultimately, well cared-for by us.” It’s likely that what happened at the Fenty Hair salon was a case of ‘one bad stylist’ and the backlash doesn’t take away from Fenty’s efforts in prioritizing Black women’s beauty needs. However, it’s fair to highlight that at some point during the preparation for this activation, something went wrong. I can relate to Oghosa’s frustration. As a beauty journalist, I was given exclusive first dibs to try the first-ever Amazon Hair Salon in the summer of 2021, before it opened to the public. However, once I flagged that I have afro hair, my appointment was delayed for five weeks, well after the store’s opening. During my consultation, a stylist who claimed to be experienced with afro hair gaslighted me into thinking my hair would be hard to style and claimed there were limited services and treatments available for my hair texture. The salon’s general manager later admitted that stylists often exaggerated their abilities and apologized to me. Although afro hair services were offered on the salon’s website, she explained they had “struggled” to hire someone with real expertise in afro hair. Granted, once they did, the stylist I had was fantastic — but the experience leading up to it wasn’t. It took countless calls and emails for a huge brand like Amazon to finally get me into the salon chair. It’s no wonder Black women feel jaded by the in-salon experience.  While Oghosa’s experience sparked conversation, it wasn’t the only one. Reviews of the Fenty Hair salon from other customers with 4C hair have been mixed, with dozens of creators praising the salon’s efforts and feeling elated with the service, while a few echoed Oghosa’s concerns. One user wrote, “I had high hopes, but I felt like they didn’t know what to do with my hair. It took longer than expected, and the stylist seemed frustrated.” Another user claimed that even though cornrows were a style option, not all stylists could braid afro hair. This is not just a Fenty Hair salon issue. Just recently, Black influencer Kristen Mariella shared a bad silk press experience at the renowned Hershesons salon, another London-based establishment known for high-end services. Kristen detailed how her hair was left damaged and the stylist struggled to manage her texture. At the time of writing, Hershesons has not publically responded. Unbothered has reached out for comment. I can relate to Mariella’s experience, too. I once attended an event with another well-known high street hair brand and their celebrity stylist ambassador. Upon seeing my natural hair, he panicked and said, “Oh, what happened to your long, luscious hair?” — likely referring to one of my wigs. He added, “The team showed me pictures of you, and it didn’t look like this.” I had assumed that with 20 years of experience (allegedly) across all hair types, this stylist would know how to style my natural hair. Instead, he used a fine-tooth comb to “brush out” my coils and secured a loose and lifeless French braid with a rubber band. What was meant to be a 45-minute appointment ended in 15. I felt so degraded that I shed a tear. It was deeply triggering to watch my colleagues leave with beautiful, shiny styles while I looked disheveled and like I had been dragged through a bush by a fox.  Then there was the time my silk press from another world-renowned salon only lasted the 10-minute walk to the Tube station. By the time I arrived home, 35 minutes later, my hair was a fuzzy triangle. Like many Black women, my in-salon experiences have more often than not been sub-par, to say the least. In fact, we’re a demographic often lacking loyalty to the in-salon experience in the UK. Finding a salon that can cater to the needs of our curls and coils outside of the big cities can feel pretty laborious, meaning we’re often forced out of necessity into being our own hairdressers.  Black women are tired of hearing that their afro hair is unruly and hard to deal with (it’s not; you just have to know what to do with it). Growing up, the closest I ever got to a “professional” hair experience was the local aunty who did braids in her kitchen in between cooking dinner for her family and scolding her kids. Somehow, the more chaotic the environment, the better the hair, so I never complained. However, Black women are as deserving as anyone else of a luxurious hair appointment experience. We spend six times more on hair than any other demographic in the UK so the least brands could do is think of us when devising their services. Why, in 2024, are we still dealing with stylists who are ill-equipped to handle afro hair, particularly 4C?  In 2021, the British Beauty Council successfully pushed for the cutting and styling of afro and textured hair to become a compulsory requirement within the NOS (National Occupational Standards) hairdressing qualification. Sure, it’s unrealistic to expect every stylist in the country to be an expert in afro hair. I’m not going to my dentist expecting him to fix my headaches so visiting Eurocentric salons may not be the solution to elevating the in-salon experience for Black women. However, if a brand claims to be inclusive, they must deliver on that promise — or expect to be held to account.  Sherrille Riley is the founder of Beauty Edit Mayfair and has over 20 years experience in hair styling. She shared some insight: “If you’re going to promote yourself as diverse, you need to make sure your workforce is trained and able to deliver. Do not use us as a marketing tool to raise your profile.” “In order to specialize in afro hair, you need extensive training, passion, and knowledge, and you need to be in an area where you can practice it regularly,” Riley adds. “So the way to tackle this gap is to be more proactive in the recruitment process from inception with stylists and also with the staff coordinating the activations so that the best people are on the job.” It’s likely that Oghosa’s negative experience at the Fenty Hair salon was a case of “one bad stylist” and the backlash doesn’t take away from Fenty’s efforts in prioritizing Black women’s beauty needs since its inception. However, it’s fair to highlight that at some point during the preparation for this activation, something went wrong. Black women’s feelings should always be validated as historically we’ve been gaslit into thinking that we’re the problem.  Demanding proper care and respect for 4C hair in mainstream salons isn’t too much to ask. Black women are tired of hearing that their afro hair is unruly and hard to deal with (it’s not; you just have to know what to do with it). And even though experiences shared by influencers like Oghosa and Mariella may be rare occurrences for the brands that are putting in the work, they are not isolated in the industry as a whole and highlight how far we still need to go. They also emphasize the importance of holding salons accountable. If salons wish to call themselves inclusive, they must invest in training their staff to treat every customer’s hair with the care and expertise it deserves. They must offer a consultation to discuss your hair type, concerns, and expectations before any treatment begins. They must be transparent about the products and techniques they plan to use on your hair, as well as their experience with afro hair. Anything less isn’t inclusivity — it’s just marketing.

Church wig, Party City wig, stiff wig, slayed wig, red wig, bad wig — no matter how you’ve experienced them, wigs have always held a special place in Black culture and self-expression. Amongst other traditional and popular Black hairstyles, wigs are a facet of creativity, expression, and empowerment in the Black hair space. For Black women, wigs can be a transitory protective style for the random big chop you had to do because your hair had been fried, dyed, and laid to the side one too many times (sound familiar?). They’re also fun and versatile, offering ample opportunities to switch up a look instantly; they’re a quick fix for an at-home dye job gone wrong, a confidence booster for those experiencing hair loss or alopecia, and sometimes even a miracle worker (the girls that get it, get it). The possibilities are truly endless, especially in 2024.  “Wigs used to be for grannies,” says Hannah Ayegbusi, founder of Honeyhand, a styling studio specializing in wigs and sew-ins. After 17 years of experience, Ayegbusi has seen countless viral moments due to her celebrated wig techniques and has seen and done it all in the hair industry. “[In the past], you’d have to be in your 90s to be [seen] wearing a wig. But now, wigs are a fashion statement. It’s part of fashion now but before, it was only for older folks,” says Ayegbusi. Times have certainly changed. The global wig and hair extension market was valued at 6.46 billion dollars in 2022 and there are more than 150 million wig tutorial videos on TikTok. With so much information at our fingertips venturing into wig territory can feel overwhelming. Wig and weave terminologies such as 360, weft, virgin, Remy, glueless, or French lace can have even the most chronically online person’s head spinning. It’s important to break down the basics. To help, Unbothered has shared maintenance tips, wig types, and everything in between to help beginners transition from wig novice to buss down baddie.  DashDividers_1_500x100 What’s the main quality difference between synthetic and human hair wigs? One of the biggest financial decisions you’ll make when choosing a wig is whether to go down the synthetic or human hair route. When it comes to quality human hair wigs are the gold standard. Real human hair is used to make a wig unit that looks and feels natural. They offer versatility because they can be styled with heat and dyed. However, they require more maintenance and can come with a high price tag. Human hair wigs are perfect for those who want to invest in a long-lasting, high-quality wig that can be styled however they want. Ethically, it’s also important to research a wig company’s credibility to understand how human hair is sourced. Synthetic wigs, on the other hand, are made from man-made fibers and mimic the look of human hair. They are more affordable than human hair wigs and come in various styles and colors. While they don’t typically last as long as human hair wigs (depending on how you treat them) synthetic wigs hold their style after washes so you don’t have to style them every day and you get more wear out of them.  When it comes to the price tag, synthetic wigs are usually the more affordable option, with prices ranging from around $25 to $200 depending on the vibe you’re going for (they are also widely accessible with some synthetic wigs available to purchase from Amazon). Human hair wigs are an entirely different story; these can start at $150 and go all the way up to £1,200 or more for customized units. Check out brands like HoneyHand, Ruka Hair, and Gina Knight Wig Design, for human and synthetic hair wigs in European and natural coily textures. Whether you’re looking for your first synthetic wig or have decided that human hair units are your only way of life these brands are doing it for the culture. “It’s easy and harmless to try on a wig. There’s no damage to your actual hair,” says Ayegbusi. “But if you do decide to try, do your research. And if you’re going to invest, choose quality.” What exactly are lace front wigs and which type is the most realistic?  Lace front wigs have become a go-to for many women who want an install with a natural-looking hairline and versatile styling options. But not all lace is created equal. Two common lace types are HD (high definition) lace and French lace—both offer unique benefits depending on the look you’re going for. HD lace: HD lace is thin and made to blend with any skin tone. This makes it ideal for Black women who want an undetectable hairline and the most realistic look possible. HD lace is also extremely delicate so it requires gentle hands.  French lace: French lace is thicker and more durable than HD lace, making it a great option for those looking for longevity from their wig. It’s still very natural-looking but may not melt into the skin like HD lace. If you’re new to wigs and want something that will last, French lace might be a better option while you’re getting the hang of application and care. What’s a “buss down” wig and is it hard to achieve the look? If you’ve spent even a minute on social media or listened to any rap song, then you’ve probably heard the term “buss down”. It’s a sleek, bone-straight wig that lays flat and is usually worn with a middle part at ridiculously long, luxurious lengths by the girls. In 2017, Nicki Minaj gave us many things, but the meme of her boarding a private jet to Prague is forever cemented in our memories—not because of the luxury of it all, but because of the jet-black, 40-inch hair that swished in her wake. Since then, we’ve seen social media stars like Jayda Cheaves, a.k.a. Jayda Wayda, dubbed the queen of the middle part buss down. The women in rap starter pack definitely includes a buss down (if you have the coins), because everyone from Cardi B to Ice Spice has been seen with their own take on the style. To get the look you’ll need a good wig and an immaculate application technique. If you’re a beginner a wig stylist will be essential.  Choose a quality wig: To get a buss down look, go for a human hair lace front or full lace wig. The key is how natural the hairline and middle parting space appear, so lace is important here. Foundation: Before applying the wig, make sure your natural hair is as flat as possible—either braided tightly or slicked down with gel. A flat foundation is crucial for getting a laid look. Perfect your melt: “Melting” refers to the wig hairline being nearly invisible and melting your lace is basically the deciding factor in how natural your wig will look. Use adhesive or a wig band to lay your lace flat against your hairline.  “Wigs encourage confidence in Black women because hair is such a visual thing,” says Ayegbusi. “When they get a wig that doesn’t look like a wig, it boosts their confidence, whether it’s for a birthday party or just their 9-to-5 job. I’ve seen my creations do that for women.” Glueless, glue, or sew-in — what is the best wig application for beginners? ​​One of the most intimidating aspects of wigs is mastering the application process, but it doesn’t have to be complicated. Here’s a breakdown of the most common methods: Glueless: Glueless wigs come with adjustable straps and combs to secure them without the use of adhesive. This method is quick, easy, and great for daily wear. It’s also ideal for beginners who want to avoid the mess of glue or tape. Glue: Glue application is popular if you want to wear your wig for several days because it has a longer hold. A thin layer of bonding glue specifically made for wig application, such as the Got2B Glued Styling Gel ($6.99) and Freeze Blasting Spray ($6.99) is used along the hairline, and the lace is pressed into it. Use a blow dryer on cool to set the glue and a wig band to ensure the lace melts into your skin. This method requires lots of practice but it also ensures your wig stays in place. Incorrect application and removal of abrasive wig glue can cause damage to fragile hairlines and even hyperpigmentation along the forehead after prolonged use, so again, it’s wise to seek professional help. Sew-in: If you want a semi-permanent option, sew-ins are another route. A closure or lace frontal can be sewn into your natural hair. Sew-ins are perfect if you want a more stable option without having to reapply the wig every day. There is no better time than now to try out a wig. Even if you’re new to wearing wigs, there are millions of videos that can guide you on your journey, as well as hair stylists who offer one-on-one sessions. Whether you experiment with synthetic hair or go all-in with a full-lace human hair wig, enjoy the journey of figuring out what works best for you. Explore different styles and colors to see what resonates with you. There’s a whole community of young, middle age, and older women who are on the same journey of trying something new, so reach out to your hair community for advice and inspiration. “Once upon a time, wigs were daunting,” says Ayegbusi. “Now people see them as a fashion statement. Whether it’s a buss down wig or a pixie wig, it’s just become part of the culture.”  This article was originally published to Unbothered UK Like what you see?

    "description": "Fall has only just arrived, but that doesn’t mean we’re not already looking ahead to what this year’s holiday season will have to offer. (That is, if you’ve been good this year.) And while it may feel early — after all, Halloween is two months away — that hasn’t deterred brands from releasing some of their big-ticket holiday items. Case in point: Beauty-stuffed advent calendars.While these blockbuster sets usually come at a premium price point, that's for a few reasons: They tend to be limited in quantity, feature exquisite packaging, and contain myriad products, including full sizes or limited-edition shades. All that's to say that the beauty-filled advent calendars you'll find here are not only marvelous to ooh and aah at but also provide a surprisingly good value, given the ample contents inside. (Pro tip: Find a buddy to go halfsies with and divide the spoils.) And while advent calendars are inherently an exercise in patience, we won't tell if you open up all the teeny-tiny doors the day it arrives on your doorstep...At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff. All of our market picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team. All product details reflect the price and availability at the time of publication.

    "description": "e.l.f. Cosmetics has come a long way as a brand. As a pioneer in affordable beauty, it has always been a trusted training ground for people who wanted to experiment with makeup without breaking the bank. Many of us still remember the days of $1 blush sticks and $3 eye shadow palettes. Somewhere along the way, the brand has evolved from our go-to for cheap makeup in a pinch to a well-respected source for products that offer impressive quality for the price tag.Just look up e.l.f. on TikTok and you will be inundated with effusive praise for the brand’s “dupes”, which provide staggeringly similar versions of mega-popular makeup products for a fraction of the cost. Some recent viral bangers include the Halo Glow Liquid Filter (the more affordable twin to Charlotte Tilbury’s Hollywood Flawless Filter), and the Glow Reviver Lip Oil, which gives Dior’s $40 version a run for its money at a mere $8. Ahead, our editors have tested the brand’s buzziest recent makeup and skincare drops, along with longtime favorites, to see which of them are deserving of a spot in your beauty bag.At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

Products she tried:Camo Liquid Blush, $7Power Grip Dewy Setting Spray, $10Holy Hydration! Gel-Yeah Moisturizer, $12Pout Clout Lip Plumping Pen, $7Photo: Courtesy of Venus Wong.e.l.f. Cosmetics Camo Liquid Blush“If you’re looking for an affordable liquid blush that has great color payoff and lasts all day, this is an obvious choice. A little bit goes a long way: I dabbed two tiny dots of Comin’ In Hot Pink, the bright fuschia color, and was a bit shocked by how pigmented it was — I looked like a Barbie impersonator! Luckily, the blush blended out beautifully with my fingers, and I was impressed by how long-lasting the color is; my cheeks were still glowing pink at the end of the night. Overall, it reminds me of the Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush, $23, in terms of how pigmented it is, but with a more fluid, buildable consistency. The fact that it’s a third of the price has convinced me to replace my liquid blush with e.l.f. when my Rare one runs out.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Camo Liquid Blush, $, available at e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Power Grip Dewy Setting Spray“I’m a big believer that a good makeup setting spray should be seen (via strong results), but never felt on your face. I tend to apply a very liberal amount, so ideally, it shouldn’t cost a fortune, either. This offering from e.l.f. has checked all my boxes. I can barely notice the hyper-fine mist when I spray it on, but it does a wonderful job at holding up my makeup in place, even during sweaty, grueling journeys on the train. Remember to give this a shake before use, since it’s half oil (which moisturizes your skin).” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Power Grip Dewy Setting Spray, $, available at e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. SKIN Holy Hydration! Gel-Yeah Moisturizer“My skin always gets extra dehydrated and itchy during the summer, and this jelly-like moisturizer has been a total godsend. I think of this as an elevated version of the aloe vera gel I used to put on areas I’d get sunburn. It’s packed with squalane, which helps trap moisture in the skin, and allantoin, an ingredient that soothes itchiness and irritation. The prickly pear extract also tops up the moisture levels in your skin. The formula is so lightweight and feels cooling on the skin, making this a great product to slather on yourself when every other moisturizer feels too greasy in the heat.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Holy Hydration! Gel-Yeah Moisturizer, $, available at e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Pout Clout Lip Plumping Pen“I can never own too many tinted lip balms. I’ve seen this compared to Tarte’s Maracuja Juicy Lip Plumper, $26, and I was especially excited to give this one a go. While it doesn’t feature maracuja passion fruit, Tarte’s famed moisturizing ingredient, it does have similar plumping qualities, and gives a slight tingle so you know it's working. A variety of fruit extracts, including blueberry, watermelon, and pomegranate, keeps my lips nourished and luscious. I appreciate how this tucked away the fine lines and cracks on my lips, and gave my pout a very kissable sheen. I will say that the formula is more satiny compared to Tarte, and carries considerably fewer shimmery particles. For the price of $8, I’ll happily carry this around whenever my lips need a wash of color.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f.

Products she tried:Sun Boss Gloss SPF 25, $7Brow Laminating Gel, $8Bronzing Drops, $12Photo: Courtesy of Humeara Mohamed.e.l.f. Cosmetics Sun Boss Gloss SPF 25“I’ve never really paid much attention to sun protection for my lips, despite religiously applying it to my skin elsewhere. While I should know better, it’s never really appealed to me; the thought of sunscreen on my lips makes me shudder. The Sun Boss Gloss, however, managed to sneak its way into my kit without me noticing its SPF 25 rating. I applied it and simply fell in love with the formula: The pigment! The moisturization! The texture! It wasn’t until afterwards that I realized it’s also an SPF. It’s perhaps a little thicker than other, more oil-like glosses that are dominating the market right now, but I quite like that. It doesn’t taste of anything (which is a good thing), and the staying power is impressive.” — Humeara Mohamed, SEO WriterShop e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Sun Boss Gloss SPF 25, $, available at e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Brow Laminating Gel“My brows have a mind of their own. I never tweeze them and they’re thick and bushy in all directions. Each lone hair is strong and brow gels often fall short, failing to lift and sculpt anything at all. Or if they do, it’s only with copious amounts of product, which then turns into a white, flaky mess midway through the day. This brow gel, however, does nothing of the sort. I apply it onto clean brows straight after applying my skincare and before applying the rest of my makeup. It comes with a small spoolie to initially apply it (I do this in an upwards motion and a downwards motion to really coat every single hair from all angles), as well as a comb and brush to then style the hairs into their final resting places. This is the ultimate dupe for the REFY Brow Sculpt, $24, and, in fact, I think it has better staying power.” — Humeara Mohamed, SEO WriterShop e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Brow Laminating Gel, $, available at e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Bronzing Drops“I’m always a little bit skeptical about bronzing drops. They’re either too glittery, too sticky, or too pigmented and muddy. Just call me the Goldilocks of bronzing drops – waiting for one that’s just right. Enter: e.l.f.’s iteration in Pure Gold, which is the most beautiful shade of bronzed gold, rather than the bright yellow shade that the name suggests. It’s not orange at all, which is another of my pet peeves, and it blends out effortlessly whilst lending the tiniest bit of coverage — but not too much! I like to use this alone or under makeup, with or without a primer, to give my skin the healthiest, just-back-from-a-vacation glow.” — Humeara Mohamed, SEO WriterShop e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Bronzing Drops (Pure Gold), $, available at e.l.f. CosmeticsJacqueline Kilikita, Deputy Beauty Directore.l.f. Products she tried:Soft Glam Satin Foundation, $8Lash XTNDR Mascara, $7Photo: Courtesy of Jacqueline Kilikita.e.l.f. Cosmetics Soft Glam Foundation“I’m telling everyone that’ll listen: e.l.f.’s Soft Glam Foundation is the best base so far this year. The texture occupies a cozy space between a gel and a cream so that it feels like skincare but with the added benefit of medium coverage. It glides onto my skin, blends in a dream and tucks away redness, hyperpigmentation and dark circles. Perhaps this is a testament to how good it makes my skin look: I went for a facial the other day and the aesthetician asked me which foundation I’d used to achieve such an even, glowing base. She couldn’t quite believe it when I told her it was $8. It’s now a staple in my makeup bag.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Deputy Beauty DirectorShop e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Soft Glam Satin Foundation, $, available at e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Lash XTNDR Mascara“This is my new favorite mascara and it’s all down to the brush. It’s much thinner than the others inside my makeup bag currently, but that makes it much easier to maneuver, so you can capture each individual lash — even the teeny tiny ones in the corners. It lengthened and beefed up my lashes all without a single clump or eyelid smudge. So much so it has replaced a $30 designer version in my kit. Besides the nifty brush, the formula dries quickly and doesn’t budge until I see fit to take it off at the end of the day. Even better, it’s a tubing mascara, so it comes off easily with just water. Don’t underestimate it, though. I touch my eyes a lot but not a single flake ever transfers onto my fingers. You might not be able to tell here, but I accidentally picked up the brown version. Now I’m a convert. It looks so natural!” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Deputy Beauty DirectorShop e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Lash XTNDR Mascara, $, available at e.l.f. CosmeticsLauren Cunningham, Freelance Writere.l.f. Products she tried:Liquid Poreless Putty Primer, $1016HR Camo Concealer, $7Halo Glow Blush Beauty Wand, $9Power Grip Primer, $10Photo: Courtesy of Lauren Cunningham.e.l.f. Liquid Poreless Putty Primer“This is a close match to more expensive primers I've used before; I'd actually liken it to Benefit's The POREfessional Face Primer, which rings in at $35. A little silkier in texture than the Power Grip Primer, it does as it says and seamlessly stamps out the appearance of pores. To get the right balance across my face, I used this primer on my cheeks and nose (where my pores are most visible) and the Power Grip Primer on my forehead and chin — together, they make the perfect pair.” — Lauren Cunningham, Freelance WriterShop e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Liquid Poreless Putty Primer, $, available at e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics 16HR Camo ConcealerThe brand claims that this concealer lasts for up to 16 hours and it does — if you use it alongside the Power Grip Primer. On its own, I'd say the most I got out of it was an average of 10 hours of wear, which is still quite impressive. There are 26 shades to suit a range of skin tones, although when you consider Fenty Beauty's 50, there could always be more. What I love about this concealer is that it covers my dark under-eye circles and red patches without too much effort. It also buffs out easily with a brush so you can cover slightly larger areas if you want to. It can settle in fine lines and wrinkles, though, so set it quickly with e.l.f. Halo Glow Setting Powder if you're after a more airbrushed look.” — Lauren Cunningham, Freelance WriterShop e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics 16HR Camo Concealer, $, available at e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Halo Glow Blush Beauty Wand“There's no denying that this is a dupe for Charlotte Tilbury's Beauty Light Wand, $42. It looks the same and applies the same. Although I love CT, it is really hard to tell it apart from the real deal. It's incredibly easy to apply — just dab onto the face and blend out. The result is more of a highlighter effect than a pretty pink flush, but the shimmer finish is quite beautiful. I'd recommend this Beauty Wand to anyone, whether you're a makeup newbie or a seasoned pro.” — Lauren Cunningham, Freelance WriterShop e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Halo Glow Blush Beauty Wand, $, available at e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Power Grip Primer“I'm not normally one for a primer, but I was genuinely impressed by this one. This isn't sticky or greasy in the slightest; it actually feels like you have nothing on your face thanks to a gel-based, hydrating formula containing hyaluronic acid that makes this more like a moisturizer than any powdery primers I've used before. It absorbs almost instantly so you're not waiting around for ages before going in with concealer and foundation. Most importantly, it did hold my foundation on for a lot longer than usual — I found myself wiping almost all of it off at the end of the day, rather than a slight sheer tint. It also added a soft-focus finish that helped to blur any blemishes. What more can I say? I'm sold.” — Lauren Cunningham, Freelance WriterShop e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f.

Products she tried:Glow Reviver Lip Oil, $8Blemish Breakthrough Stick It To Zits, $8Photo: Courtesy of Karina Hoshikawa.e.l.f. Cosmetics Glow Reviver Lip Oil“This is a really pretty lip oil, and it checks most of my boxes: The shade Honey Talks is a stunning rosy brown, and the texture is very plush and comfortable — I can see why people call this an affordable dupe to the iconic Dior Lip Glow Oil, $40. I only wish that it lasted longer! But for the price, I can feel okay about reapplying as needed. It adds a beautiful kiss of color on bare lips, but also is a gorgeous glossy top coat when applied over my favorite lip pencil or lipstick for a more pigmented look. It also feels cushiony and hydrating, which is what I’d expect from a lip oil. For me, I’d choose this lip oil over an expensive alternative any day of the week — it truly exceeded my expectations and had I to guess the price, I’d definitely match it with some of the pricier lip oils I’ve tested.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior WriterShop e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. Cosmetics Glow Reviver Lip Oil, $, available at e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f. SKIN Blemish Breakthrough Stick It To Zits “Between my job as a beauty writer and my general life experience having acne, I’ve tried almost every pimple patch on the market. There’s nothing particularly unique about e.l.f.’s clear hydrocolloid stickers, but that’s not necessarily what I’m looking for; I just want them to work! Out of the many ones I’ve tested, I’d probably place e.l.f’s somewhere in the middle — not the worst, but not the best. While they successfully absorbed most of the contents of a particularly juicy zit overnight, the adhesion of these wasn’t what I generally need. I had to reapply one sticker that fell off a few hours after applying, and I tend to find that patches that don’t have those beveled edges (the ones that really disappear into skin and stay on no matter what) don’t work as well as ones that do. For all those reasons, these wouldn’t be the first line of defense for my acne. However, if I were in a rush and needed to run to the store to get some patches fast, these would do great in a pinch.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior WriterShop e.l.f. Cosmeticse.l.f.
