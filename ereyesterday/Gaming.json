    "description": "Developer Bloober Team faces a challenging balancing act in bringing a cherished 2001 classic like Silent Hill 2 to a new generation. The good news is that the Silent Hill 2 Remake - released on PlayStation 5 and PC - does capture the essence, the atmosphere of Konami's survival horror, all while making smart upgrades to its design. Despite rebuilding the game on Unreal Engine 5, you'll still recognise its iconic, foggy view over Toluca Lake at the game's start. The cutscenes are now acted out with new motion capture and voice overs and while in control, you'll explore Silent Hill's woodland trails and apartment blocks with an updated control scheme - complete with newly devised puzzles. Likewise, its soundtrack is re-arranged by legendary composer Akira Yamaoka, and even the world layout, the ordering of events, is remixed at points to keep fans, old and new alike, on their toes. Even through all these twists though, at its core, Bloober still successfully takes apart and puts back together the beating heart of what made the 2001 original work. Read more",

    "description": "For a new game studio, there are few genres as difficult to break into as that of the tactical shooter. With the space dominated by behemoths Valorant and Counter-Strike, newcomers are up against established games with deep tactical gameplay, distinctive world designs, and dedicated communities. Newbies face a demanding set of player expectations, with a checklist that includes immaculate gunplay, perfect pacing and ultra-clear level design as the bare minimum. And only when you get beyond that do things get really interesting. What have you got that's fresh, and can encourage new forms of tactical thinking? Can you provide enough of a hook that players will want to stick around to master the mechanics? Is your game simply different enough to stand out? Read more",

    "description": "I think it's fair to say that The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is perhaps not the highest priority when it comes to receiving a PS5 Pro upgrade. Packing a reasonable 1440p60 and 4K30 performance split on base PS5 consoles, the game was already delivering a good visual experience on Sony's 2020 hardware - but there is a compromise between image fluidity and image clarity. Part 2's PS5 Pro outing seeks to eliminate that gap, aiming to deliver a 4K-like visual experience at a full-fat 60fps frame-rate target by using Sony's new machine learning PSSR upscaling solution. How does PSSR fare in our first extended look at the technology? Is this a good replacement for native 4K, or does it fall short of that lofty target? Read more",

Impressively, it all runs really well on near-decade-old GPUs too. RT on a GTX 1060? Believe it. Read more",

The problem? Hadea is a hermit state. The only reason why Rémi lives outside of its borders is thanks to his mother, who smuggled him out when he was five. Unfortunately, she was caught by the Hadea border control, leaving him alone and eventually entering the Canadian foster system. Her capture, and the fact that his father was a blacksmith in a village called Jova, are the only things he truly remembers from his short time in Hadea. It's due to this that Rémi, despite understanding the rationality behind his parents actions, wants to reunite with them and learn exactly why they got him out. Read more",

    "description": "A new DF Direct Weekly lands - as usual - today, with the team's thoughts on the recent State of Play, reaction to the most recent RTX 5080/5090 leaks and, perhaps inevitably, more PlayStation 5 Pro. However, it's actually a point raised in last week's Direct that I want to tackle in this week's blog. Many believe - with some justification - that the PS5 Pro is a step too far and that such a console isn't needed. In fact, we've made the argument ourselves. Looking back at that piece, I warned about higher costs of a Pro console, but also looked at the potential improvements it could bring - all of which have come to pass with PS5 Pro. Microsoft declined the opportunity to follow likewise, but now we have some idea of why Sony has taken a different route and perhaps more of the strategy is now understandable. Read more",

The visual upheaval is as dramatic as you'd expect, but the original framework of the game is faithfully intact - right down to every mission objective, the layout of each segment of the mall and even the framing of its cutscenes. Still, in looking at PS5, Series X and Series S, almost every facet of the original's visuals has been rebuilt from scratch - including character models, textures, lighting, vegetation - and there's an optional modern controller scheme for moving and shooting simultaneously.

    "description": "Dragon Ball Super: Complete Series Steelbook Gift Set $120 (was $200) See at Crunchyroll Store See at Amazon Dragon Ball Super's Limited-Edition Steelbook Collection is on sale for a huge 40% discount on the Crunchyroll Store, dropping the price to $120. First released in 2022 and reprinted earlier this year, this premium gift set is arguably the best Dragon Ball Blu-ray set thus far. You're saving 40% with this deal; Dragon Ball Super: The Complete Series normally sells for $200, and discounts are exceedingly rare. This is one of the most notable offers in Crunchyroll's new Treat Yo' Shelf Sale. Dragon Ball Super: Complete Series Steelbook Gift Set $120 (was $200) The entire Dragon Ball Super arc is collected across 20 discs, two in each steelbook case. That's right, this gift set comes with 10 steelbooks and a premium \"steelbox\" display case. The storage box has slots for each steelbook as well as a lid featuring the dragon Shenron.At the $120 deal price, you're paying $12 per steelbook, which is quite cheap compared to standalone anime Blu-rays with steelbook cases.Crunchyroll's deal probably won't last for long, as the $120 price is by far the lowest we've seen over the past two years. At one point in 2022, Amazon had the collection for $155, but the price has been pretty much locked at $200 for nearly two years now. We'll update this article if Amazon matches Crunchyroll's deal for Prime Big Deal Days, but at the moment, the gift set costs $195.57 at Amazon.Dragon Ball Super takes place during the gap in the Dragon Ball Z timeline following the Majin Buu arc. Amazon's exclusive Dragon Ball Z Complete Series Box Set is $175.36.Check out the full list of bonus features for Dragon Ball Super: The Complete Series below.

    "description": "The world of Middle-earth is far more expansive than the tales of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. While Frodo, Gandalf, Samwise, Bilbo, and Gollum might be some of the most familiar faces to Middle-earth fans, J.R.R. Tolkien masterfully built his fantasy world with a staggering level of detail and lore--all of which can explored in The History of Middle-earth series. Compiled and edited from Tolkien's manuscripts and notes by his son Christopher Tolkien, The History of Middle-earth was originally published in the 1980s and '90s. The best-known entry in the series is The Silmarillion, which is one of the source materials for Prime Video's The Rings of Power. Like all Tolkien books, it has received multiple reissues, including gorgeous new 2024 editions and a staggeringly massive three-book set containing all 12 volumes.If you want to read The Complete History of Middle-earth, the best option right now is the 2020 hardcover set. Originally $250, the weighty collection is on sale for $111.62 as part of Amazon's early Prime Big Deal Days sale. This understated set, shown below, will likely become the biggest box set in your home library. The three premium hardcovers total 5,440 pages, an average of 1,813 pages per book. For comparison, The Lord of the Rings Deluxe Edition, which is on sale for 50% off, is \"only\" 1,216 pages.

Split across four slipcased box sets, the design of the new editions takes the exact opposite approach, trading the \"serious\" look for beautifully illustrated cover art that really stands out compared to many of the minimalist editions of Tolkien's work. For this set, publisher William Morrow split the series into 15 volumes.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/silent-hill-2-remake-endings-how-to-unlock-all-endings-including-new-ones/2900-5831/",
    "description": "In revisiting Silent Hill 2, developer Bloober Team has remained pretty faithful to the original game--most of the story and dialogue are unchanged, and while a lot of puzzles have been altered, they tend to remain true to the spirit of those in the original. Silent Hill 2 also maintains the multiple endings of the 2001 release, but in keeping with the rest of the remake's philosophy, it seems to have changed how you unlock them, while adding a few new ones, as well.There are eight total endings to the Silent Hill 2 Remake, with two new ones added to the six that were previously available in various Silent Hill 2 releases. That includes the four original endings and two infamous joke endings. We've been scouring Silent Hill 2 for all the information we can get about the puzzles, story, and endings, in order to compile everything you need to unlock them all.Here's how to unlock each of Silent Hill 2 Remake's endings.Note: Obviously, this guide contains ending spoilers, although we're trying to minimize them. This guide is also a work-in-progress as we keep playing through Silent Hill 2 Remake and its new game plus mode to unlock all its endings. We'll update it as we discover more. \"Leave\" EndingThis is the ending that players seem most likely to get, and is considered the \"good\" ending, so far as any ending of Silent Hill 2 is good. This one has James coming to terms with his situation and leaving Silent Hill with Laura.As with the original release of Silent Hill 2, the three main endings to the game seem to be dictated by your behavior throughout a playthrough. The actual requirements for the Leave ending are potentially a little hazy, but as in the 2001 game, they generally seem to require James showing dedication to Mary over Maria. Spend as little time with Maria as you can, don't visit her repeatedly, and maybe don't show too much desire to save her when she's in trouble. You should also try to keep James at full health whenever possible, and it might help to inspect Mary's photo in your inventory a few times during your run as well. \"Maria\" EndingIf the \"Leave\" ending is about James' dedication to Mary, the \"Maria\" ending is the opposite. Here, James leaves Silent Hill with Maria at the end of the game.The requirements here seem to be the opposite of those in the Leave ending. Try to spend more time with Maria, keeping her close to James when they're together--so don't sprint off and leave her. Prioritize helping Maria if she gets into trouble with monsters and help keep her from taking damage. Avoid looking at Mary's photo, and when Maria suggests something--like leading you toward Laura when she heads to Brookhaven Hospital--listen to her rather than heading off in a different direction to explore. \"In Water\" EndingThe worst of the three main endings, In Water sees James succumbing to his grief and trauma and choosing death over life.The primary driver for this ending seems to be playing James as if he doesn't care about himself. You want to avoid \"excessive\" healing--that is, healing James immediately after he's hurt or up to and over full health; instead, heal him only when it's dire, and without overdoing it. You can tell when James is damaged by the blood spots on his jacket; if you heal with a health drink after two or three hits, James will likely still be a little hurt, allowing you to avoid over-healing, or using more healing than is necessary to get him to full health. By the same token, don't use syringes, which are enough to fully heal James, unless death is imminent. You can also try inspecting the knife in James's inventory from time to time during your playthrough, which suggests that James is contemplating hurting himself. \"Ritual\" EndingThe Ritual ending only becomes available after you've beaten the game once and unlocked the New Game Plus mode, which makes several additional items available throughout the game. In this paranormal ending, James rows out to a sacred spot on an island in Toluca Lake and attempts to resurrect Mary with an occult ritual.We're still working on finding the components for this ending, but it seems likely that it hews closely to what's in the original Silent Hill 2. In that game, you needed four items to reach the ritual ending: the Book of Lost Memories, the White Chrism, the Obsidian Chalice, and the book Crimson Ceremony.If the UFO and Dog endings are any indication, it seems these items might not be in their same locations from the 2001 game. However, all you need to do for this ending is find all four items and then complete the game--but you should then avoid doing the things required for the UFO ending or the Dog ending (including finding the complete Dog key). \"Dog\" EndingSilent Hill 2 also includes two joke endings that suppose some alternative culprits behind the events of the game and James's torment. We won't say more about the Dog ending than that. To get this ending, you need to start a New Game Plus run and find a new item: the Dog key. Grabbing it requires scouring the town of Silent Hill when you have the ability to search its streets, before you complete Brookhaven Hotel. First, check Big Jay's pet shop on the corner Katz Street and Neely Street, before heading to Wood Side Apartments. In the back room of the store, inside a pet carrier, you'll find the Broken Key Part.After visiting Rosewater Park and meeting Maria, you'll again get access to the streets of Silent Hill, albeit in a new area. Keep your eyes out in the neighborhood here for a dog house, which was formerly behind a closed gate. You'll get the second item, the Bone Key, inside it. Combine the two items to make a complete key. Save it until you reach the Lakeview Hotel at the end of the game, and after watching James's video tape, use it to open the nearby Observation Room. \"UFO\" EndingThis is another weird one that requires taking part in multiple steps, and also suggests some other intelligence working behind the scenes in Silent Hill. In New Game Plus, you need to find a specific item and visit several key places in the game with it to unlock the UFO ending. You can get the clues to what you need in the Groovy Music store, where you find the Broken Record and Vinyl Glue items early in the game, before visiting Wood Side Apartments. Check the bench on the right side of the store from the entrance, near the display cases, to find a magazine. It contains several clues, telling you there's an alien device in a Silent Hill storefront, and that strange things have happened on a rooftop, near Toluca Lake, and at Lakeview Hotel. First, you need the alien device: the Blue Gem. Smash the window of the storefront just north of Big Jay's on Neely Street and you'll find it in a jewelry box there. This is a new key item that will stay in your inventory for the rest of the game. Next, head to the rooftop mentioned on the magazine cover--the roof of Saul Apartments on Saul Street. You need to go to this location anyway to get the Jukebox Button to solve the puzzle at Neely's Bar. As you make your way through the apartment building, the linear path will eventually take you to the roof, where you should hear some strange, vaguely sci-fi sound effects. When you hear it, inspect the Blue Gem; it'll glow and you'll hear more strange sounds. We're still working through this ending, but the clues suggest you will also want to pull out the Blue Gem at Toluca Lake--likely on the dock after completing the prison, before rowing across to Lakeside Hotel.The final location will be inside Lakeside Hotel. We'll update this section of the guide as we nail down exactly where that is. New EndingsThere are two new endings in the Silent Hill 2 remake, but so far, details on how to access them are scarce. It's unclear if these become available after the other endings are uncovered and what the requirements are for them. However, the Silent Hill 2 remake does include two new collectible elements that might have something to do with them. The first is a series of 26 Polaroid photos scattered throughout the game, which seem like they might shed additional light on James and Mary's story. You can also find many locations throughout the game where you can trigger Memories, or freeze-frames that reference occurrences in the original Silent Hill 2, acknowledging elements that have been changed between the 2001 version and the remake. The Polaroids and Memories each reward you with a Trophy/Achievement if you find them all, but only if you get them all in a single run through the game. It seems possible that either the Polaroids, the Memories, or both are related to the Silent Hill 2 remake's new endings, and we'll update this section of the guide as we uncover more details.There are many more puzzles and confusing sections in the Silent Hill 2 remake.

    "description": "Like the 2001 original, the Silent Hill 2 remake is a dense game with lots to find within it if you're willing to scour its foggy and dark corners. With a greater emphasis on combat and a few areas that feel larger and more involved, and with new puzzles that often require multiple steps to complete, though, it's going to be a while before you can escape that town. If you're wondering just how long it'll take, that depends greatly on how completionist you intend to be and whether you want to leap into Silent Hill 2 Remake's depths to find its many endings--eight in all--and other secrets.Here's everything you need to know about Silent Hill 2's playtime and what you can expect to uncover if you're willing to spend more time within the nightmare. Naturally, beware of some light story spoilers in this article.How long to beat Silent Hill 2Your playtime on Silent Hill 2 will vary greatly based on how much time you spend exploring the town, searching out-of-the-way places, and gathering extra materials. This is especially true at key points like the early game, when you'll have access to a lot of the town and can check a number of spots that aren't part of the essential path forward. Among the members of GameSpot's team who played Silent Hill 2 Remake ahead of launch, we found the game to last between 17 and 19 hours on an initial playthrough, when we were pretty diligent about searching for secrets. If you're less worried about searching for secrets and extra ammo, you can probably expect Silent Hill 2 Remake to last you 15-16 hours on your first run.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/silent-hill-2-remake-all-weapons-and-how-to-get-them/2900-5837/",
    "description": "Making your way through the Silent Hill 2 remake can be pretty dangerous, even if you're familiar with the 2001 original. As with a lot of things in Silent Hill, the locations of the game's weapons, as well as the puzzles you have to complete, have changed in the last two decades.Here's a full rundown of where to find all of the game's guns, along with additional weapons like the chainsaw. If you'd prefer to skip to a certain weapon, we've laid out some bookmarks for each one.How to get the handgun (pistol)How to get the shotgunHow to get the rifleHow to get the chainsaw Where To Find The HandgunWhile you'll find the main melee weapons, a piece of wood and iron pipe, as part of the story in Silent Hill 2, the firearms are a little easier to miss. The handgun is your first, popping up as you explore the Wood Side Apartments. If you're diligent, you might discover a note mentioning neighbors complaining about gunfire in Apartment 217, giving you a hint as to where you're headed. Getting to Apartment 217 will take a bit, though, as you need to explore most of the first and second floors of Wood Side. The main hallway of the second floor is closed off, but James will spot the key to open it through some bars during a cutscene. After Laura kicks it away, you can make your way around the floor from the other side to retrieve it and make your way to 217. Inside the apartment, check the shopping cart in the middle of the room to claim the gun. Where To Find The ShotgunWhen you get to Brookhaven Hospital, you'll get a tease for your second weapon: the shotgun. Checking in at the entryway of the hospital, you'll find an empty gun cabinet, letting you know that there should be a shotgun here, but someone has moved it. As with Wood Side, you need to explore the hospital to make your way to where the shotgun has been placed. You can find it on the second floor in the Women's Locker Room, which you can reach after you've found the director's office. Check the lockers when you arrive to find the shotgun waiting for you there. Where To Find The Hunting RifleThe hunting rifle is Silent Hill 2's most powerful gun, and it'll be waiting for you in the Toluca Prison Armory, one of the first rooms on your path through the prison when you arrive. Unfortunately, it's locked up; a nearby note mentions that the key is likely in the Witness Checkpoint. You can't go straight to the checkpoint, though, thanks to it being locked down by the prison's security system. Instead, you need to go through the Headless Serpent door to reach Death Row--use our Prison Weights and Hangman guide for all the info on how to unlock the door. Make your way through Death Row until you get to the execution chamber. You need to overload the generator, which will kill the power throughout the area and unlock all the doors. After that, head for the Witness Checkpoint and grab the key from the counter as you head through. The nearby door exits back to the main hall of the prison where you first started, allowing for a quick detour to the Armory. Where To Find The ChainsawCompleting Silent Hill 2 unlocks its New Game Plus mode, which opens up a lot of new stuff to the game--including endings you can't see during a normal playthrough. One of the big benefits to starting a new run is the chainsaw, a high-powered melee weapon that can kill many kinds of enemies in a single hit each. You can find the chainsaw along the road into Silent Hill at the start of the game. The path takes you through the woods to the cemetery, where you meet Angela for the first time. Just beyond is the lumber yard, and if you check the right side of the road as you head through, you can find the chainsaw sticking out of a pile of logs, waiting for you to grab it.The original Silent Hill 2 included other weapons, including the powerful Hyper Spray and Pyramid Head's Great Knife. We're still exploring Silent Hill and searching for these weapons and any others, and we'll update these guides as we uncover more.In the meantime, you can find lots more information on the Silent Hill 2 remake's puzzles, endings, and everything else in our Silent Hill 2 guides hub.",

    "description": "Ninja Scroll Limited Edition Steelbook $34 (was $70) Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart The cult-classic '90s anime film Ninja Scroll is celebrating its 30th anniversary with a new collector's edition Blu-ray, and the wait is almost over. Ninja Scroll's Limited Edition Steelbook releases October 22, and Amazon is now offering a substantial discount. You can preorder Ninja Scroll's new Blu-ray release for only $34 at Amazon. Technically, you're saving over 50% with this deal, but Ninja Scroll's original $70 list price hasn't made sense since it was revealed in August. But hey, at least now you can get the awesome anime on Blu-ray for a far more reasonable price. Ninja Scroll Limited Edition Steelbook $34 (was $70) The Ninja Scroll Limited Edition Steelbook includes a Blu-ray copy of the animated film presented in 1080p with either the English or Japanese voice tracks and English subtitles. It also features a full-length audio commentary with director Yoshiaki Kawajiri and character designer Yukata Minowa. You also get a sleek steelbook case featuring promotional art on the covers and interior panels, plus a removable slipcover.Amazon has the best preorder deal on Ninja Scroll by a wide margin. As of October 4, Amazon is selling preorders for only $34, which is over 50% off list price. You can also preorder Ninja Scroll at Walmart, but it's $47.49. Amazon was previously charging that price, so Walmart might adjust its listing to match. Both retailers offer preorder price guarantees, so if you already ordered at Amazon for a higher price, don't worry: You will be charged the lowest offered price since placing your order. Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart For those unfamiliar with the film, Ninja Scroll is a violent, action-packed story set in Feudal Japan during the Edo Period. The movie follows Jubei Kibagami, a vagabond swordsman who finds himself embroiled in a supernatural plot to take down the Tokugawa Shogunate. While it originally premiered in Japan in 1993, it didn't get an official release in North America until 2012. Despite that, it still managed to become one of the most popular anime releases of the 90s, ranking among other titles aimed at mature audiences like Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and the original Berserk TV series.Speaking of Berserk, you can get the original 1997 series on Blu-ray for $43 (was $60). The collection released earlier this year and was followed up by Berserk: The Golden Age Arc Memorial Edition in August. Meanwhile, Akira is only $18 on 4K Blu-ray, and Ghost in the Shell is $20.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Last year, the film adaptation of Five Nights At Freddy's was an unexpected hit at the box office, and a sequel was confirmed earlier this year. Josh Hutcherson will reprise his role from the first film as Mike Schmidt, a night guard at a restaurant haunted by the souls of murdered children whose spirits live in disturbing animatronic creations. According to Hutcherson, the sequel is not only going to introduce more animatronics, it will also be scarier than the original.\"It's gonna be scarier,\" Hutcherson told Esquire in a new interview. \"It's much bigger; the stakes are higher... There's more animatronics being brought in, different animatronics being brought in, and the world just opens up in a big way.\"The film will reportedly be based on the Five Nights At Freddy's 2 video game, which introduced the Puppet and Balloon Boy animatronics alongside the returning creatures Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy. Hutcherson didn't disclose any plot details, but he did mention that it will expand the world.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

During your journey, you'll find loot, upgrade your abilities, and fight a wide variety of creatures pulled from the video game. If you're feeling diabolical, you can deliberately sabotage your own teammates. That said, if you're playing solo, you probably won't want to sabotage yourself.

I can feel completely put together with just a bright lipstick, mascara and concealer. 2. Bright lipstick shouts however you’re feeling out loud to the world. A smile is that much bigger and brighter with a bright lip. 3. It’s a classic. Red lipstick never goes out of style! 4. The long-wearing matte formulas have improved so much. They last through water, coffee, cat kisses… 5. They’re just so fun to collect!

I forgot how beautiful it looks in pictures! The Honest Beauty eyeshadow palette comes with a card with four looks you can do with the palette. I followed the one called “Classic Smoky Eye” for this post, although with one tweak. I started by buffing the matte beige shade (Vanilla’d Velvet) all over my lids as a base so the subsequent colors would pop a little more. I was a wee bit nervous about using the shimmery gold all over my lids and the shimmery dark purple on the outer corner because…I’m in my 40s now, and shine doesn’t always play well with my 40-something skin, particularly in the crease. Some may even say that I’m “overly picky about shimmery finishes,” *ahem*. Can you blame me though? One false move and you see every fine line!

If you could move anywhere in the world without having to put any effort into it at all (assume someone takes care of the packing, logistics, paperwork, finances, etc.), where would you go? I’d move us to the Manoa neighborhood on Oahu in a heartbeat. 3. What’s a weird breakfast that you like to eat?

I was walking Marnie Mae around the circle when she started barking like mad woman at something. I crouched down to get a better look, and who do you suppose was sitting there totally chillin’ like a villain a few feet away? Yup, Harris, the neighborhood cat lothario (and, incidentally, Tabs’ former foil). Anywho, I also spotted him darting across the main street at the base of our hill (I think he was chasing a squirrel), and then again yesterday skulking through the dry grasses, presumably hunting something else. This post is a reprint in Harris’ honor. He’s still around. I believe he’s about 10 now, still doing what boy cats are apt to do (causing trouble). What’s up with these damn cat stalkers?!

    "description": "The Football Manager series has been around for decades, each of its yearly entries gradually building upon its core systems until it became the mixture of deep simulation and banal press conference screens it is today. Football Manager 2025 is different: a fresh start for the series, built upon a new engine, which Sports Interactive are at pains to say will not immediately be as rich or robust as its predecessor. It now has a release date: November 26th. Read more",

Prior to this, all actions in games simply took place simultaenously, as fast as the player or players could make them. Fast forward to today and many games are now \"turn-based\", from Tactics Ogre Reborn to Age Of Wonders 4 to chess. In celebration of their orderliness, Steam is currently running a turn-based RPG fest featuring discounts and demos for \"turn-based games where you grow stronger with every battle\". Read more",

While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going \"boo!\" Read more",

Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer. Read more",

Will the new Lords Of The Fallen also be called Lords Of The Fallen? Will it build on the exciting innovations of Lords Of The Fallen, or will it seek to recapture the nostalgic charms of Lords Of The Fallen? Perhaps in ten years time we'll do a list feature, \"Lords Of The Fallen Games Ranked\", with just one entry. I'm pretty sure that in 10 years time, generative AI plagiarism will have rendered everything interchangeable anyway. Read more",

And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes.

The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a \"cursed\" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees. Read more",

I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first. That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

Let’s have a look at the new Death Stranding 2 scenes then. Watch them on your phone for added kino. Read more",

Bread! There is nothing so horrible, and nothing so seductive. I'd like to cut back on the stuff to minimise middle-aged corpulence, but there's a place down the road that sells this amazing, tearable sourdough, and I can't get enough of it. Fortunately/unfortunately, there don't seem to be any bread-themed PC games out this week. Here's our round-up. Read more",

I’m currently reading Brendan Keogh’s The Videogame Industry Does Not Exist. It’s interesting enough that I’m only mildly pissed off about the added academic book tax. Paying the academic price is funny if you say it like paying the iron price. Although, again, not quite funny enough to soothe my awful uni flashbacks of books that cost a week’s worth of groceries each. This week, it’s writer on Tomb Raider, Mirror's Edge, BioShock Infinite plus loads more, and host of BBC Radio’s Mythical Creatures - Rhianna Pratchett! Cheers Rhianna!

    "description": "The beauty of cards is that they can be anything. You can slap together a working game with them in a couple of minutes. Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro (and its wired cousin, the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition) has looked to desktop peripherals in search of superior button-bashing, cannibalising the rather good Razer Viper gaming mouse series for its switches. The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller. Read more",

The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects. I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

Enter Junxions, a traffic engineering game which focuses entirely on the simulation and construction of roads, railways, and pedestrian walkways, right down to the coding of the traffic lights.

Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza. This, at least, is the condensed analysis offered by Food Boy, which launched this week on Steam. Read more",

Mechs stomp past you, ignoring you in favour of decimating enemy soldiers. Bug-like drones hover overhead, scanning for prey. And horrifying mommy harvesters scavenge bodies from the debris. As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges. Read more",

You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have \"consequential dialogue choices\" and a \"Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads\". Ah, forgive me, you're here to see the chunky limbs. Here's a recent trailer that shows 'em. Read more",

Treyarch, Raven Software and Activision have popped up a note-to-players covering a range of improvements they're making to Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 in the aftermath of August's beta. Specifically, they're tweaking the damage from bullets to the cranium, while trying to ensure that bullets to the cranium don't \"significantly affect the consistency of time to kill\". Read more",

If you aren't, let me explain: Zachtronics are or were a US-based video game developer founded in 2000 by Zach Barth, who put the studio on ice in 2022 and now works at Coincidence Games, a \"flexible business framework\" involving many former Zachtronics devs. Zachtronics have thrown together all kinds of things - Infiniminer, a block-builder from 2009, is probably the single greatest individual influence on Minecraft, while Eliza is a tremendous visual novel about AI chatbots and labour politics. But if there's a type of game they're known for, it's engineering puzzles and factory games. Read more",

For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the \"old world\".

I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

    "description": "We liked Jusant, Don't Nod's clamber-upper masterpiece, and we also liked Banishers, their colonial ghost-busting action-adventure, but it seems that not enough people did. The company have posted a profit warning, reflecting an 11% decline in operating revenue for the first half of 2024. They've also \"paused\" two unannounced games in development, and altered other unannounced games to be more appealing to a \"wider audience\". Beyond that, they're considering \"all possible options regarding our roadmap\", which sounds just a touch ominous. Read more",

    "description": "I'm not someone who's ever been on board with the \"Can You Pet The Dog?\" craze that swept and/or still sweeps video games. As a heartless individual, I am more concerned with whatever the dog's capable of: general savagery, a howl that replenishes my HP bar, letting me climb atop its glorious mane as it strides across the barren wastes. If it's none of these things, I would much rather have a shiny turret on spindly steel legs skitter besides me. Nomada Studios have, incredibly, thrust their hands into my chest cavity and given me a blood-pumping mechanism. Having spent some time with upcoming action-platformer Neva (the game) and Neva (the dog from the game), I have to admit: I did enjoy petting Neva (the dog). Read more",

Near Mint is a roguelike deckbuilder where you advance through a tower fighting slightly stronger iterations of the exact same skeleton. Ok, nothing too captivating so far. The twist comes from the cards: someone’s left them in their Oodie pouch, spilt BBQ sauce down it, then stuck it in the wash before taking the deck out. Now, all the cards have split apart into three pieces. It’s name-your-own-price on Itch here, and it’ll only take you a couple minutes to get acquainted, but I’ll explain the gist below.

    "description": "Ever since Crimson Desert dropped that audacious trailer at Gamescom 2023, I’ve yearned to soak in its medieval Just Cause 2 vibes. It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes! I’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out \"It’s just a demo\" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

I’ve done this many, many times, but on this occasion there was a surprising twist, one which would have notorious pearl-clutching racist HP Lovecraft spinning in his grave.

    "description": "Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts. And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M\u0026K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too. Read more",

Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

A new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.
