    "description": "I think it's fair to say that The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is perhaps not the highest priority when it comes to receiving a PS5 Pro upgrade. Packing a reasonable 1440p60 and 4K30 performance split on base PS5 consoles, the game was already delivering a good visual experience on Sony's 2020 hardware - but there is a compromise between image fluidity and image clarity.

How does PSSR fare in our first extended look at the technology? Is this a good replacement for native 4K, or does it fall short of that lofty target? Read more",

It may be cozycore on the surface, but there's plenty of bespoke stuff driving its warm pastel aesthetic, including ray-traced global illumination (RTGI), ray-traced reflections and loads of procedural tech. Impressively, it all runs really well on near-decade-old GPUs too. RT on a GTX 1060? Believe it. Read more",

The problem? Hadea is a hermit state. The only reason why Rémi lives outside of its borders is thanks to his mother, who smuggled him out when he was five. Unfortunately, she was caught by the Hadea border control, leaving him alone and eventually entering the Canadian foster system. Her capture, and the fact that his father was a blacksmith in a village called Jova, are the only things he truly remembers from his short time in Hadea. It's due to this that Rémi, despite understanding the rationality behind his parents actions, wants to reunite with them and learn exactly why they got him out. Read more",

    "description": "A new DF Direct Weekly lands - as usual - today, with the team's thoughts on the recent State of Play, reaction to the most recent RTX 5080/5090 leaks and, perhaps inevitably, more PlayStation 5 Pro. However, it's actually a point raised in last week's Direct that I want to tackle in this week's blog. Many believe - with some justification - that the PS5 Pro is a step too far and that such a console isn't needed. In fact, we've made the argument ourselves. Looking back at that piece, I warned about higher costs of a Pro console, but also looked at the potential improvements it could bring - all of which have come to pass with PS5 Pro. Microsoft declined the opportunity to follow likewise, but now we have some idea of why Sony has taken a different route and perhaps more of the strategy is now understandable. Read more",

The visual upheaval is as dramatic as you'd expect, but the original framework of the game is faithfully intact - right down to every mission objective, the layout of each segment of the mall and even the framing of its cutscenes. Still, in looking at PS5, Series X and Series S, almost every facet of the original's visuals has been rebuilt from scratch - including character models, textures, lighting, vegetation - and there's an optional modern controller scheme for moving and shooting simultaneously.

    "description": "Last year, the film adaptation of Five Nights At Freddy's was an unexpected hit at the box office, and a sequel was confirmed earlier this year. Josh Hutcherson will reprise his role from the first film as Mike Schmidt, a night guard at a restaurant haunted by the souls of murdered children whose spirits live in disturbing animatronic creations. According to Hutcherson, the sequel is not only going to introduce more animatronics, it will also be scarier than the original.\"It's gonna be scarier,\" Hutcherson told Esquire in a new interview. \"It's much bigger; the stakes are higher... There's more animatronics being brought in, different animatronics being brought in, and the world just opens up in a big way.\"The film will reportedly be based on the Five Nights At Freddy's 2 video game, which introduced the Puppet and Balloon Boy animatronics alongside the returning creatures Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy. Hutcherson didn't disclose any plot details, but he did mention that it will expand the world.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

For the original Silent Hill 2, we captured it on a PlayStation 2 with the RetroTINK 5X upscaler. Its remake was captured on the PlayStation 5 in its quality mode.",

    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/starfield-shattered-space-a-house-divided-full-quest-walkthrough/2900-5840/",
    "description": "A House Divided is one of the 11 side quests available to complete in the Starfield Shattered Space DLC. This quest centers around a courier and shipment going missing and it's your job to find out why and where the shipment could have gone. Below, you'll find a full quest walkthrough that goes through all the objectives and choices to make in A House Divided. Speak to Qisrani and access Ukaru's ComputerThe quest begins by speaking to Qisrani Ful'kehf near the House of Obedience in Dazra. After speaking to Qisrani, you'll learn of her plight, which involves a courier and shipment of missing goods. She asks that you search the computer of the courier, Ukaru Dul'kehf.Ukaru's computer is located on the Radiology floor of the Halls of Healing building, which is accessed via elevator. After you arrive on the Radiology floor, speak to the man behind the desk and tell him you need to access Ukaru's computer. He'll let you, but he'll also restrict access to the admin privileges of the computer. You can persuade him to give you admin privileges, but it's not essential to the quest.After speaking to the man, head into the room to the right and search all of the attachments on Ukaru's computer (if you have admin privileges). After learning about the shipment Ukaru was transporting, you'll learn that it supposedly went to a supply depot nearby. Track down the missing supply shipment The missing shipment takes you to a supply depot just outside Dazra. At the depot, you can enter and head down to a lower level via a vent after you arrive. Go through the vent until you reach a Supply Depot Computer. Search all of the files but specifically look at the Security Office Keycard attachment. Once you do that, look at the Supply Tracking attachment and then unlock the \"Open Security Door\" attachment to open the nearby door. Follow your quest marker after you're done with the computer and reach the tracking device for the shipment. You'll find Ukaru's Log #2 along with the tracking device. Once you pick up the log, you need to follow the blood trail to reach Ukaru Dul'kehf, who's locked in a chamber. Escape the gas chamber and restore power to the Depot When you reach Ukaru, a man named Brother Omanide will come over the PA system. He will attempt to kill you by locking you in the hallway and releasing gas into the room. To not die, use the vent on the right side wall and escape through the ventilation system. After getting out of the vents, you'll be in a large room with a quest marker on the other side and up some stairs. Reach the quest marker and then head down another level to reach a laboratory. Here, you need to locate four Emergency Power Cells and put them in four dedicated power slots in the nearby computer room. The quest markers for all Power Cells won't appear until you get near them, so make sure to search the entire lab and every room. Once you have four Power Cells, go to the computer room, slide each one into a power slot, and then make your way back to Ukaru, who's now dead, by following the quest marker. Taking the Supply Depot evidence to Qisrani Search Ukaru's body in the chamber and pick up the Supply Depot Recording, which is evidence you can take back to Qisrani in Dazara. When you reach Qisrani after exiting the Supply Depot, she'll be speaking with someone called Mujeen Ka'diq, who's also known as \"Envoy.\" After Qisrani and Muljeen are finished speaking, make sure Muljeen leaves the room before revealing the evidence to Qisrani. Once you've spoken to Qisrani, you'll have to go and speak with Tevina Veth'aal, who supposedly can be trusted to decode the Supply Depot Recording. Decoding the recording and going to Jandar's RestWhen you reach Tevina in The Keep, you can show her the slate recording you found on Ukaru's body. She'll be able to decode it, which leads you to a location called Jandar's Rest. When Tevina asks you what you think the slate says, answer with \"4034.\" When she asks what Noble House you think betrayed House Va'ruun, respond with \"I'm not at liberty to say.\"After you're done with Tevina, head to Jandar's Rest, which is a location far to the north of Dazra. You can fast-travel to a nearby location if you've previously explored Va'ruun'kai. Upon infiltrating Jandar's Rest, you'll find plenty of Zealots to fight. However, you can simply run past them and enter Jandar's Rest. Navigating Jandar's Rest and getting into the Shrine Room Upon entering Jandar's Rest, you'll soon see a quest marker on the other end of a large cavern. There will be dozens of enemies to kill, but only one matters: the Va'ruun Zealot Captain. The captain is located on the left side of the cavern and you need to kill them in order to loot the Zealot Shrine Key, which is how you enter the room at the end of your quest marker. After killing the captain and looting the key, none of the other enemies matter, so run past them to the other end of the cavern. Enter the Shrine Room using your key and confront the head of the Zealots. Negotiating with the Zealot Boss Inside the Shrine Room is the Zealot Boss, who confronts you right away. The Zealot Boss says that he has assassins on the way to take care of Qisrani and he's reluctant to give up any information on who his contact inside Dazra is. However, you can persuade him to give up his contact by passing a persuasion check. If you fail the persuasion check, you'll have to attack the Zealot Boss. If you manage to pass the persuasion check, you'll learn the Zealots' contact is Mujeen Ka'diq. Regardless of your outcome, exit the room after the Zealot Boss is taken care of and head back to Qisrani in Dazra. Stopping assassins and searching House Ka'diq for evidenceWhen you go back to Dazra, enter the Halls of Obedience and speak with Qisrani. Inform her that her life is in jeopardy and that Mujeen Ka'diq is a traitor. She accepts this information, but she'll still want to press on and take Mujeen to trial. Before that happens, two Zealot Assassins attack within the Halls of Obedience. Dispatch of the enemies and then speak to Qisrani again.Once again, Qisrani wants to have a trial for Mujeen and air out the dirty laundry. Your next steps are either to wait for the trial to begin or search Mujeen Ka'diq's computer for more evidence. It's recommended to search for the evidence, as it makes the trial go smoother. If you choose to search Mujeen's computer, you have to hack the computer itself and a file on the computer to gain all the evidence you need. When that's done, or if you just choose to wait, find a bench, chair, or couch to sit on and wait for three hours.After the three hours is up, the trial is set to begin on the Radiology level of the Halls of Healing. Taking hush money or going forward with the trial Before you enter the room where the trial is being held, Mujeen Ka'diq will stop you. He'll ask what evidence you have and explain his reasoning behind what he did. If you're satisfied with Mujeen's side of the story, you can keep quiet about your evidence in the trial. You can do this for free or demand 10,000 Credits for your silence. If you do this, Mujeen walks free. However, if you want to see Mujeen face justice, then don't accept the bribe and proceed with the trial. Finishing the trial and complete A House DividedIn the trial room, your dialogue options will depend on what you told Mujeen. If you accepted his deal, you can say that you don't have any evidence, and he'll walk free. However, if you told him no deal, then you can present the decoded slate from the Supply Depot and evidence from his computer (if you chose to find it before the trial). All of this makes a compelling case against Mujeen, who will be taken away by security.Speak to Qisrani to complete the A House Divided quest, earning you Credits and XP for a job well done.",

    "description": "The Complete Calvin and Hobbes Box Set $100 (was $225) See at Amazon Calvin and Hobbes is one of the most beloved comic strips of all time. If you grew up stealing the comics section of the newspaper from your parents to read the hilarious and insightful adventures of Calvin and his stuffed Tiger, you'll want to check out Amazon's fantastic deal on The Complete Calvin and Hobbes Hardcover Box Set. As part of Amazon's early Prime Big Deal Days sale, Prime members can get the premium book box set compiling all of Bill Watterson's masterful comic strips for $100, which is 56% off its $225 list price.Amazon's price cut matches the lowest we've seen in years. The Complete Calvin and Hobbes Box Set has been on sale for $100 during past Black Friday and Prime Day sales, but it typically sells out pretty fast. If you're interested in picking this up for yourself or as a holiday gift, it'd be wise to order soon. The Complete Calvin and Hobbes Box Set $100 (was $225) The lavish hardcover box set features three volumes compiling every single comic strip from Calvin and Hobbes' run. All told, you're getting 1,440 pages of comic strips, some in color, others in black-and-white. The included slipcase features one of the illustrations that is most-associated with Calvin and Hobbes.I've owned this box set for years and can attest to its quality. The comic strips are printed on thick art paper, and the bindings have held up well. Fair warning, though: The premium materials make these books pretty heavy. With all three books in the slipcase, the set weighs roughly 22 pounds, so each hardcover is around seven pounds. See at Amazon The Complete Calvin and Hobbes certainly isn't the only way to read Watterson's beloved comic strip. If you'd rather have smaller paperback collections, check out the ongoing Calvin and Hobbes Portable Compendium series. Andrews McMeel Publishing began reprinting the series in this travel-friendly format last year. Each compendium comes with two volumes, and the first set is available for only $10 (was $22), and the second is only $12.70 ahead of Prime Big Deal Days The third set actually just released on October 1, and the fourth is available to preorder ahead of its March 2025 release.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Bowser Lego Deals At Amazon - Two Bowser Playsets On Sale For Best Prices Yet",
    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mighty-bowser-lego-super-mario-set-gets-very-rare-discount-at-amazon/1100-6526848/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f",
    "description": "Lego Super Mario: The Mighty Bowser $234 (was $270) See at Amazon The largest Super Mario Lego set has received an extremely rare discount ahead of Prime Big Deal Days. Over at Amazon, you can get The Mighty Bowser for $234 instead of its usual $270. At face value, a $36 savings isn't a huge price cut, but The Mighty Bowser has almost always sold for full price since launching two years ago. Multiple other Bowser Lego sets are discounted, too. Dry Bowser's Castle, one of the biggest Lego Super Mario playsets, is on sale for a huge 30% discount; meanwhile, Bowser's Muscle Car offers a budget-friendly King Koopa option for only $24. Lego Super Mario: The Mighty Bowser $234 (was $270) The discount is from a third-party seller, but your purchase will be shipped from Amazon and is eligible for Prime. Since your order is fulfilled by Amazon, you can return it within 30 days for free, just like any order that is officially sold by Amazon.The Mighty Bowser is certainly one of the coolest Lego Mario sets. Bowser may consistently fail in his attempts to rule the Mushroom Kingdom alongside Princess Peach, but he does own the record for highest brick count in the Lego Super Mario series. At 2,807 pieces, The Mighty Bowser stole the crown from the replica Nintendo Entertainment System kit (2,646 pieces).Once fully built, King Koopa is 12.5 inches tall and 16 inches wide, so you may need to clear some shelf space to display the big guy. With the included stand and Bowser's tail, the build has a depth of 11 inches.While you could call The Mighty Bowser a statue, it's also a giant action figure. His tail, arms, and legs are posable, so you can display Bowser in a variety of different poses. In addition to articulated joints, Bowser's jaw snaps and buttons beneath it turn his head. He can also shoot fireballs to (try to) stop Mario from thwarting his plans once again. When on his stand, Bowser is flanked on each side by fiery towers.There's also a hidden POW Block, which was implemented specifically for Lego Mario, Luigi, and Peach figures to step on. While The Mighty Bowser isn't considered a playset--it's one of the five Lego Mario sets geared primarily toward adults--it does interact with the figures included in the starter courses. If you press Lego Mario against Bowser's shell, he will react to Bowser's presence. See at Amazon Adventures with Mario Starter SetAs mentioned, The Mighty Bowser isn't the only set in the Lego Mario series focused on King Koopa. For a much more affordable option, check out Bowser's Muscle Car, which released earlier this year and is available for only $24--terrific value for a 458-piece build. In August, The Bowser Express Train became one of the largest expansion sets at 1,392 pieces. That set is $120, but you can get the 1,321-piece Dry Bowser Castle on sale for only $77 right now--a massive discount from its $110 price. It comes with a significantly smaller version of (skeletal) Bowser.It's also worth noting that you can pair The Mighty Bowser with Bowser Jr. by opting for the new edition of the Adventures with Mario Starter Set. Released in August for $50, the revamped starter set comes with the interactive Mario figure, Yoshi, Bowser Jr. and his Koopa Clown Car, and more.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "All The Upcoming MCU Movies And TV Shows For 2024 And Beyond",
    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/upcoming-mcu-movie-tv-phases/2900-4230/",
    "description": "Here we goMarvel had just one movie release in 2024--Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine--but the studio is ramping things back up in 2025 with multiple major launches, including the next Captain America movie, the reintroduction of The Fantastic Four, and Thunderbolts, among others. On the TV side, Marvel has a number of projects in the works as well for Disney+. In this gallery, we're running through all of the upcoming Marvel movies and TV series in the works, and there are many.Expectations for any Marvel movie are always high, but the 2025 films--like Captain America: Brave New World and Thunderbolts--will have big shoes to fill. After all, Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine earned $1.3 billion at the worldwide box office, making it the No. 2 film of 2024 so far (only behind another Disney movie, Pixar's Inside Out 2).Here is a rundown of all the upcoming MCU projects for film and TV. We will continue to update this gallery as new information comes to light. Eyes of Wakanda – 2024 (or delayed to 2025?) An animated Disney+ series, Eye of Wakanda, was announced in 2023. It will focus on warriors from the mystical and super-scientific African nation who have been \"tasked to travel the world retrieving dangerous vibranium artifacts.\" It was scheduled for release in 2024, but there haven't been any updates lately, suggesting it might have slipped to 2025 or beyond. Daredevil: Born Again – 2025 A TV series for Disney+ based on the Marvel character Daredevil, Daredevil: Born Again is a live-action show that brings back Charlie Cox as the title character, continuing the story originally told on Netflix's Daredevil series. The series also stars Vincent D'Onofrio, Jon Bernthal, and Michael Gandolfini. Captain America: Brave New World – 2025 Captain America: Brave New World will be the first new Marvel film in theaters since Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine. It stars Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson, who has taken on the role of Captain America following Chris Evans' long run in the MCU. Julius Onah directs the film, which also stars Harrison Ford, Giancarlo Esposito, Liv Tyler, and Tim Blake Nelson. Thunderbolts* – May 2, 2025 No, that's not a typo–Marvel's Thunderbolts* has an asterisk in the title, but the studio has yet to confirm why. What we do know is the Jake Schreier-directed film focuses on a group of Marvel's (anti)heroes going on dangerous missions for the government, sort of like Suicide Squad. The film stars Florence Pugh, Lewis Pullman, Sebastian Stan, Rachel Weisz, Wyatt Russell, David Harbour, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. The Fantastic Four: First Steps – July 25, 2025 Marvel is bringing back The Fantastic Four with a new film from director Matt Shakman that stars Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm. Ironheart – 2025 A spinoff from the Black Panther franchise, Ironheart is a Disney+ show set for 2025 that stars Dominique Thorne as Riri Williams/Ironheart. The series also stars Anthony Ramos, Alden Ehrenreich, and Lyric Ross. Blade – November 7, 2025 Marvel's Blade has undergone a number of changes and has faced setbacks, but the company is now targeting the new film for release in November 2025. The film doesn't have a director attached, and the only announced cast members so far include Mahershala Ali in the lead role, alongside Mia Goth as Lilith. We wouldn't be surprised if this film gets delayed again. Avengers: Doomsday – May 1, 2026 Avengers: Doomsday is the next big Avengers movie, and it's coming May 2026. The big news is that Robert Downey Jr. is coming back to the MCU–not as Iron Man, but instead as Dr. Doom. Avengers veterans Joe and Anthony Russo are coming back to direct. Vision Quest – 2026 A spinoff from WandaVision, Vision Quest brings back Paul Bettany as Vision, with James Spader making his MCU return as Ultron. That's all there is to go on for now. Wonder Man – TBA You have no doubt heard of Wonder Woman, but Marvel is now making a Wonder Man show starring Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Simon Williams/Wonder Man. Ben Kingsley and Ed Harris will also star on the show, which was co-created by Shang-Chi's Destin Daniel Cretton. Avengers: Secret Wars – May 7, 2027 Avengers: Secret Wars will continue where Doomsday left out when it arrives in theaters in 2027. The Russo brothers will direct this film, too, but the plot remains a secret for now. Untitled Wakanda TV series - TBA Another Black Panther spinoff is in the works, focused on the character Okoye from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Danai Gurira is set to return in the role, but there hasn't been much news on this project of late. What If Season 3 - TBA Marvel's What If…? Series, which digs into alternate timelines with some help from the multiverse, is coming back for a third and final season on Disney+. Season 3 will be narrated by Jeffrey Wright, with episodes focusing on characters like Red Guardian, the Avengers, Shang-Chi, and Agatha Harkness. Armor Wars – TBA An upcoming Marvel film, Armor Wars began its production as a TV show before shifting in 2022 to be made as a movie. Don Cheadle is expected to come back as James Rhodes AKA War Machine. The film is expected to tell the story of Rhodes trying to save the day after Tony Stark's futuristic technology falls into the wrong hands. Shang-Chi 2 – TBA 2021's Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings was a box office success despite releasing during the pandemic, and it also earned an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. It took some time for a sequel to get greenlit, but it is indeed happening, with Simu Liu and director Destin Daniel Cretton coming back. Spider-Man 4 – TBA Yes, another Spider-Man movie is coming. Is that surprising? Tom Holland is expected to return for his fourth outing in a standalone Spider-Man film, which will once again be a co-production between Sony Pictures and Marvel. X-Men Reboot – TBADisney now owns X-Men and has plans to revive the franchise. In May 2024, it was reported that an X-Men reboot project was in the works with screenwriter Michael Lesslie attached. That's all we know so far, but it's exciting to think about the possibilities for a new generation of X-Men films. New Scarlett Johansson Project – TBAScarlett Johnassn starred as Black Widow in a number of Marvel films over the years, but the relationship somewhat soured over her standalone movie, Black Widow, prompting a lawsuit against Disney. The two sides eventually settled, and Johansson is staying in business with Marvel for a new project that she will produce. What it is, however, we don't know. Nova TV series – TBA Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy series is on hiatus for now, but fans of the franchise can look forward to an upcoming Disney+ series called Nova. The series follows the character Richard Rider AKA Nova as he joins Nova Corps. and embarks on a series of intergalactic missions. John C. Reilly and Glen Close are expected to reprise their Guardians characters, Rhomann Dey and Irani Rael, respectively. Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man – TBA Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man is a new TV series for Disney+ created by Jeff Trammell. It tells an origin story for Peter Parker/Spider-Man, taking place in an alternate universe where Norman Osborn was Parker's mentor, not Tony Stark.",

He joked that maybe he's now too old, at 37, to play Link, but you never know.\"Oh, my hat's in the ring, they know my hat's been in the ring,\" he told IGN. \"Link was like 37 when he did all this, right!? Seventeen, 37? As a kid, I was like, 'Obviously they're gonna make [Ocarina of Time] a movie soon, the story's all written out for you!'

The sequel earned $7 million from its Thursday previews in the US, according to Variety--that is just over half of the $13.3 million that the first movie made in Thursday screenings five years ago.2019's Joker was a runaway success that went on to make over $1 billion against its relatively modest $65 million budget. The sequel, meanwhile, was never expected to match the success of the first. It had a significantly larger production budget and is tracking to earn between $50 million-$65 million for its opening weekend stateside. The original movie, meanwhile, made $96.2 million for its opening frame.For comparison, Joker: Folie à Deux's Thursday previews were less than The Flash ($9.7 million) and a bit more than The Marvels ($6.6 million).Continue Reading at GameSpot",

But now, Dragon Age: The Veilguard has gone gold, and that means the discs are finally being pressed before they get shipped to stores.BioWare made the announcement via the official X account for Dragon Age, which playfully placed gold discs over the eyes of a skeleton.Dragon Age: The Veilguard has GONE GOLD!Thank you all for your support as we cross this important milestone.

I forgot how beautiful it looks in pictures! The Honest Beauty eyeshadow palette comes with a card with four looks you can do with the palette. I followed the one called “Classic Smoky Eye” for this post, although with one tweak. I started by buffing the matte beige shade (Vanilla’d Velvet) all over my lids as a base so the subsequent colors would pop a little more. I was a wee bit nervous about using the shimmery gold all over my lids and the shimmery dark purple on the outer corner because…I’m in my 40s now, and shine doesn’t always play well with my 40-something skin, particularly in the crease. Some may even say that I’m “overly picky about shimmery finishes,” *ahem*. Can you blame me though? One false move and you see every fine line!

I really enjoyed “Killers of a Certain Age” by Deanna Raybourn. I’ve been needing a fast, fun read and it hit the spot! Next time you need a book for a plane ride or a vacation, grab it. 2. If you could move anywhere in the world without having to put any effort into it at all (assume someone takes care of the packing, logistics, paperwork, finances, etc.), where would you go? I’d move us to the Manoa neighborhood on Oahu in a heartbeat. 3. What’s a weird breakfast that you like to eat? I don’t know if it’s super weird, but I do love a toasted frozen waffle slathered with peanut butter and sprinkled with raisins.

I was walking Marnie Mae around the circle when she started barking like mad woman at something. I crouched down to get a better look, and who do you suppose was sitting there totally chillin’ like a villain a few feet away? Yup, Harris, the neighborhood cat lothario (and, incidentally, Tabs’ former foil). Anywho, I also spotted him darting across the main street at the base of our hill (I think he was chasing a squirrel), and then again yesterday skulking through the dry grasses, presumably hunting something else. This post is a reprint in Harris’ honor. He’s still around. I believe he’s about 10 now, still doing what boy cats are apt to do (causing trouble). What’s up with these damn cat stalkers?! Every week there’s a new one trying to dominate the common area, which sucks because that’s where Tabs likes to do his morning[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 831 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Out 17th October on Steam, Mask Quest is a platform game in which you hold and release a button to refill your character's lungs while dodging police batons, bullets, gas grenades and drones. Neglect to do so, and you'll pop your clogs. It's the kind of mechanical tomfoolery you'd associate with Peter Molydeux, but in this case, it's all the fine work of Stephen's Sausage Roll developer increpare and Quadrant developer undef. The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.

Knowing Brendy, he'll be sauntering down Neely Street like a gentleman dandy from 1920s Oxford, throwing out his cuffs and elbows and winking merrily at all the shambling depression metaphors who are trying to chew his legs off. While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going \"boo!\" Read more",

Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer. Read more",

The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error. Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues.

    "description": "I do not wish to dwell overly long on the incredible stop motion sheep in the trailer for folk horror game Daemonologie, because it’s got so much else going for it - from the gorgeously haunting vocal and string melodies to the extremely dark character interactions that offer your witch finder the choice between 'talk' and 'torture'. And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes. Flock toward the trailer below, and I’ll see you on the other side of the pasture, hopefully as deeply altered by the experience as I was. Read more",

    "description": "I am puzzled by Ara Colon History Untold's priorities. At its heart are a couple of interesting ideas undermined by its own determination to put the wrong thing on centre stage. Make a rich and elaborate resource management game with an unorthodox research system, but then spend so much time on a simultaneous turn system and detailed animations that you're left with a cumbersome interface and lifeless AI, and you too might wind up making Ara. There's an almost great game here, but it's all neglected and bruised from being shoved into the packaging of a lacklustre 4X. Read more",

The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a \"cursed\" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees. Read more",

I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first. That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

I still think the guard are more interesting, but it's a very fun bit of smashy. Before I continue to never be wrong about a videogame ever again, let’s read some writing that I personally found interesting about games (and game related things!) Read more",

    "description": "The beauty of cards is that they can be anything. You can slap together a working game with them in a couple of minutes. Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro (and its wired cousin, the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition) has looked to desktop peripherals in search of superior button-bashing, cannibalising the rather good Razer Viper gaming mouse series for its switches. The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller. Read more",

The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects. I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

    "description": "During his tenure as the foremost newsperson of the 1980s, Atari's Paperboy faced many grievous challenges - squabbling drunks, swarms of bees, the actual Grim Reaper - and yet, day after day he answered the noble call of journalism, lashing his basket to his doughty BMX and daring the treacherously oblique suburbs of Reaganite America. Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza. This, at least, is the condensed analysis offered by Food Boy, which launched this week on Steam. Read more",

Yes, I washed my hands afterward. Ah, but after which? Read more",

Stone's forthcoming Known Mysteries is a ritual of the sun, I guess. Slated for launch on 23rd October, it's the first of several, creatively low-carbon projects that will run off a custom, solar-powered server Stone has set up on her apartment balcony in Calgary, Canada.

For those who don't know the game, this third-person helljaunt sees its players wandering through the battlefields of an endless conflict between three major world powers. Mechs stomp past you, ignoring you in favour of decimating enemy soldiers. Bug-like drones hover overhead, scanning for prey. And horrifying mommy harvesters scavenge bodies from the debris. As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges. Read more",

I'm glad, so here's another. Cold And Afraid is a murder mystery that aims to channel the 1990s with chunky characters and lots of lovely dithering. You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have \"consequential dialogue choices\" and a \"Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads\". Ah, forgive me, you're here to see the chunky limbs. Here's a recent trailer that shows 'em. Read more",

Moonhood Studios, founded by the creators of LIR, just announced The Midnight Walk at last night's PlayStation State Of Play showcase. And it looks to continue their appreciation of the dark and the strange. Case in point: it's a first-person adventure where you play as The Burnt One, who must steer a hideous pot creature through a twisted universe. Read more",

He was right, judging by the trailer shown at yesterday's PlayStation Showcase. The Lake House DLC is due out in October, and does indeed feature a facility run by the shady organisation whose job it is to keep powerful \"altered items\" from running amok.

For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk.

I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

The twist comes from the cards: someone’s left them in their Oodie pouch, spilt BBQ sauce down it, then stuck it in the wash before taking the deck out. Now, all the cards have split apart into three pieces. It’s name-your-own-price on Itch here, and it’ll only take you a couple minutes to get acquainted, but I’ll explain the gist below. Gist is a good word. Satisfying to say. Gist. Read more",

    "description": "Ever since Crimson Desert dropped that audacious trailer at Gamescom 2023, I’ve yearned to soak in its medieval Just Cause 2 vibes. It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes! I’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out \"It’s just a demo\" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.

I’ve done this many, many times, but on this occasion there was a surprising twist, one which would have notorious pearl-clutching racist HP Lovecraft spinning in his grave.

    "description": "Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts. And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M\u0026K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too. Read more",

I would not have given it the best narrative award if it were up against Gran Turismo 7. Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

A new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.
