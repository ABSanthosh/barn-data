    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/133838/UX-Design-Case-Study-Starbucks-Behind-the-Counter-System",
    "description": "This project, \"Bringing Interactive Unity to All Starbucks In-Store Connected Devices,\" is by design consultancy Tactile. The firm straightened out the coffee chain's behind-the-counter systems by tackling the work in five phases.Starbucks Professional Design SystemAt the heart of the Starbucks café experience are their employees–an essential factor in delivering the perfect treat to customers. No minor feat, given the wide array of choices available. So, to help streamline the beverage-building process, Starbucks asked Tactile to craft a common UX strategy and UI design system for all their connected behind-the-counter equipment, now and into the future.Tactile's hands-on experience and direct working knowledge of Starbucks' device ecosystem left us well-positioned to take on such a challenge. The resulting design system helped Starbucks realize more intuitive, enjoyable, and effective devices that balance the needs of both employee and customer. All this was done in an effort to continually deliver a better, more cohesive Starbucks experience.Unifying the Starbucks EcosystemStarbucks employees (also known internally as \"partners\") rely heavily on their trusted tools to craft thousands of delicious beverages per day. This load capacity emphasizes the need for a seamless and efficient work experience, one supported by equipment that's immediately recognizable and easy to use across all locations.The resulting Starbucks Professional Design System is crafted from a foundation of highly functional interactive components and visually intuitive patterns. This system helps Starbucks and their partners realize a more accessible, enjoyable, and effective device experience.Our ApproachTo develop this unified vision for current and future connected devices, we began by establishing a strong foundation of knowledge. Tactile interviewed stakeholder groups from across the Starbucks business in order to establish a core set of guiding UX principles prior to establishing the foundational UI patterns that make up the system.In the end was a newly defined design language that was integrated into the product development process. Our work with Starbucks elevated the quality and consistency of Starbucks device UI in order to create a more cohesive family of equipment. It is a system intended to be more modular, flexible, and scalable across different users and types of equipment, now and into the future.Phase 1Insight Driven Research16 stakeholders, 11 teamsEach interview was conducted as a virtual one-on-one that covered questions from current design and development processes to existing and upcoming equipment, and in-store experiences.The goal of these interviews was to gain an understanding of the current device landscape and processes, as well as gather any intel on current needs, desires, and areas of opportunity.Once the interviews were complete, we evaluated the feedback to identify common themes. These insights highlighted strengths and challenges associated with current and past Starbucks equipment. At the same time it helped to establish a clear set of priorities and opportunities, bringing focus to our ongoing design work.The themes were distilled into six essential design principles. The intention being to guide decision-making, while also defining the experience for key product features and functionality. This helped the system strike the right balance between business goals, in-store partner experience, and customer convenience.Phase 2Device Audit and Deep DiveIn this auditing phase, we took a closer look at current and past equipment. Evaluating the various UX/UI implementations, we gained a clearer understanding of existing features, patterns, and functions.Using our six design principles as a guide, we audited device experiences to identify areas of alignment and opportunities for improvement. This work would steer our path forward for the new design system.Phase 3Building Common UX PatternsLeveraging the findings from the research and audit phases, we began design exploration for a prioritized set of foundational UX components and UI patterns. These would act as a basis for all devices, drawing on common features and functionality within the ecosystem.We started with device agnostic wireframes that described basic pattern behaviors for common features like alerts and sequenced tasks. Each pattern was documented in a living file that was incrementally updated and refined as we moved ahead into the validation phase.Phase 4Validation + RefinementUsing Tactile's ongoing device development projects, we were able to begin implementing and experimenting with the core UX patterns. Through this process, we gained valuable learnings in an effort to optimize the experience and validate solutions before moving forward with design refinement. This is where the Starbucks Pro Design System really began to take shape–by intentionally crafting unity between the brand, their apps, and all the connected devices that baristas use every day.While approaching visual design for the system, we employed a minimal color strategy of black and white plus copper accentuations. The simple use of the copper color gives all baristas a sense of craft pride by referencing physical materials seen in the higher-end Starbucks Reserve stores.These were just some of the elements that helped elevate important information without distracting customers or disrupting partner attention. Other aspects included high contrast text (adhering to strict accessibility guidelines), clear iconography, and simple, intentional typography. All of which came together to create a better informational hierarchy that's easy to read and understand. And always foundational to the process was the ability to build with enough flexibility to scale across a wide range of device types and sizes.Phase 5Finalization + System GuidelinesTactile worked closely with a variety of Starbucks stakeholder groups, over the span of a year, to deliver a holistic and intuitive design language for all of their connected equipment. The resulting Starbucks Pro Design System improves device usability by reducing steps and streamlining the engagement experience for partners. It also helps optimize the Starbucks product development process. Our work with Starbucks helps pave the way for a more coherent and connected equipment future.

Founder Nicky Crawford aims to restore hygiene, dignity and hope to the disadvantaged with his mobile shower units.Crawford saw a need to expand into mobile laundry services. To design and build his Mobile Laundry Bus, Crawford collaborated with the Industrial Design department at Georgia Tech. ID juniors and seniors Zaria Hardnett, David Hounyo, Lily Liang, Claudia Ross, and Anushka Vaidya worked on the project. \"Using their design and engineering skills, the team was involved in every step of the process, from brainstorming and sketching concepts to developing 3D models and ensuring the final design was practical and user-centered. Since the solution had to be mobile, and there was no guarantee of clean water at some locations, the students had to determine how to add large tanks of clean water. They thought through how the workflow for the helpers could work and then designed the layout of the washers and dryers for an effective operation.\" Sadly that's all the visual documentation I could find, but you can get a look at the bus, and hear more about Crawford's mission, in the news clip below.",

    "description": "We really are hurtling into the future here, folks.So this company Serve Robotics makes these sidewalk delivery robots. A restaurant worker loads them, then the autonomous 'bot drives itself over to your building. While the 'bots have a range of up to 25 miles, they're not that fast—they top out around 6 MPH—so most of the deliveries they're used for are within a 2-mile radius.However, now the company is partnering with Wing Aviation, a drone delivery provider. Under the arrangement, Serve's robots will transport the delivery to a Wing Autoloader station nearby. Then a Wing drone picks the order up and freaking flies it to your building.The arrangement means they can offer \"30 minute autonomous delivery across an entire city,\" says Serve CEO Dr. Ali Kashani.Other advantages:- Fast: Wing drones fly above the gridlock and Serve robots operate exclusively on sidewalks, so deliveries avoid being snarled in street traffic.- Cost Efficient: Drones and robots both lower delivery costs for the operator and consumer with no need for tipping.- Environmentally-Conscious: Both fully-electric, Wing and Serve reduce vehicle emissions associated with food delivery, as well as reducing traffic and congestion.- Safe: By keeping vehicles off the roads, Serve and Wing help to cut down on traffic accidents.- Convenient: Curbside robotic package pickup allows merchants to access drone delivery without modifying their facilities or installing new equipment.The companies say they'll roll out the arrangement \"in the coming months,\" though they don't say where. (Let me guess: San Francisco.)",

    "description": "As a pure object, I'm really impressed with the form of this Pathfinder modular mouse, by startup Orbital Works. Intended to provide the best possible UX for gamers, it's been designed with fanaticism.Developed from hundreds of hand scans and match analyses, Pathfinder fits your palm like a second skin and can be enhanced with pro-approved shapes until it feels like an extension of yourself.Defined by Research, Refined by Experts.Why is shape the most important factor when choosing the ultimate FPS mouse? We spent two years finding the answer, analyzing hundreds of hand scans and studying how gamers grip their mice during competitive matches. Throughout, we kept an open mind, focused on delivering a mouse that provides gamers with the perfect shape. GRIPSWe identified three groups of finger placement: front, center, and back along the length of the mouse. Some gamers prefer sculpted surfaces for greater control, while others favor flat surfaces for freer movement. HANDSWe discovered that our mouse must accommodate different widths on both the left and right sides of the palm. To create the ideal mouse length, it must respond to playstyle, not just hand size. One Small Change of Shape, One Giant Leap in GameplayWe concluded that the ultimate FPS mouse must be modular, allowing precise adjustments for hand size, play style, and grip preference. Our next objective is to ensure this modularity enhances gameplay in a meaningful way, encouraging gamers to explore until they find their perfect shapes. ValidationWe developed prototypes and tested them with top FPS gamers to determine the ideal level of modularity, focusing on where customizability has the greatest impact while maintaining aesthetic quality and a lightweight design. RefinementWe worked with top players and aimers to refine each modular shape through over 30 iterations, making sure all 2,500+ configurations will be top-performing and help you discover the Ultimate Mouse Patent-Pending MechanismOur Modular parts are rated for 20,000 cycles. Almost 3 years of changing shapes 20 times a day.PATHFINDER CoreLightweight with top-tier specs, designed to be future-proof for even greater customization. The $189 mouse will only have a production run of 4,000 units, the company says, to ensure quality.",

    "description": "The Spaghetti Chair, designed by architect Giandomenico Belotti in 1979, became a design classic of the '80s. The parallel lines of the PVC noodles gave it a striking look, and the steel-framed chair was suitable for indoor or outdoor use. It's still in production today.Over the years, Italian manufacturer Alias produced several variants. None of them (to my eye) capture the spirit of the original design well.More recently, the company has released a special edition that I think really breaks with Belotti's vision: Gone are the spaghetti straps, replaced with…hide leather. Modern update, or design crisis?",

With combined forces, we are bringing together agriculture, engineering and material design to achieve our common goal: Transforming the way materials are made.\"The company has invented a material called LOVR. It's a leather substitute made from hemp waste produced by the food industry.\"[It] is an all-natural, 100% biological single-layer surface material called LOVRTM (the letters stand for leather-free, oil-free, vegan and residue-based) that is being developed specifically with the automotive industry in mind. The hemp fibers and a fully bio-based adhesive are combined using a special technology and processed to become a surface material. This truly circular material is sourced from regional hemp fields and is fully recyclable or compostable once it has reached the end of its service life. It is produced from residues of the hemp industry that have no further use. In addition, it can be manufactured on existing industrial plants, thus enabling swift scalability – and is therefore also suitable for use in large-scale production.\"The material has attracted the attention of Volkswagen, who is investigating its application for automotive seating. If it passes VW's sniff test, the company says LOVR could start showing up in their vehicles by 2028.",

Unlike sandbags, these barrier wall systems are reusable, and can be stored flat.The design is simple, but ingenious: The more water they're keeping out, the stronger the structure becomes. That's because each component is L-shaped, braced diagonally with steel struts, and designed to be used with the bottom of the L pointed towards the water. As floodwaters rise, they weigh down on the bottom of that L, anchoring each component in place. The upright of the L cannot collapse, because it is held fast by the high tensile strength of the steel braces.In this video released by the hospital, you can see how effective the 9-foot-tall barriers are:",

    "description": "How to build long wood DIY picture ledges in minutes. These wood picture ledge shelves can be customized to the length and width you need and are a great way to display art and photographs!If you do a lot of DIYing, you may have enough scrap wood on hand to make these. If not, they can be made affordably with basic pine from the hardware store. When we moved into this house, I knew immediately I wanted to do something fun on our staircase walls. This project in particular was on the wall under the stairs: It needed something -- and I imagined some simple display shelves with photos along this wall. First I stuck some painter's tape to the wall to figure out the sizes of each one and get an idea of how it would look. I built three, four and five foot shelves. I wanted to go down low on the wall as much as possible because it just felt right visually to me. These shelves only come out about four inches from the wall. To build these you'll need three pieces of wood -- one 1x2 for the front, one 1x3 for the base, and one 1x4 for the back, all cut to the length you want. You can also make the shelf with a 1x4 on the bottom so it would be a bit deeper. I found the three inch to be fine but if you plan on leaning a bunch of frames I'd go with the four inch. You can see what I mean here:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

I found these cool \"Harry Potter\" candles last year and we absolutely fell in love with them. They are such a fun addition to our fall and Halloween decor this time of year. (But I think they could be carried through to the holidays easily!) Can you believe I've never seen any of the Harry Potter movies? I know! My sister and son chastise me often about that fact.  But because our son loves it so much, I grabbed these cool hanging candles last year.

Cozy up with some warm bread from the oven and a bowl of this hearty dish for an easy meal.  You know how I love a good crock pot meal!Many of you have tried my easy comfort food slow cooker recipes (chicken and dumplings, creamy chicken and wild rice and mac and cheese) crock pot dishes and love them as much as I do: Be prepared for a new favorite. This one may inch out my chicken and wild rice. It's that good. This chicken and noodle recipe calls for the thicker noodles, so it's more of a hearty meal than a typical chicken soup. If you like a creamier \"soup\" that you can pile high over mashed potatoes, this one is for you!  I found this recipe floating around on Facebook years ago, but there was no source.  I could tell from the photo that there was more to it than the few ingredients listed. So I added a few and it was absolutely delicious. If you're looking for an easy warm meal on a crisp fall evening, this is one is perfect!  This recipe only takes around three hours to make if you cook it on high: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    Here are the ingredients for this delicious crock pot creamy chicken and noodle soup: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

I've been hard at work transforming my home office with wallpaper and painted bookcases!  I know, I know...I say this a lot. But this space is turning into one of my all time favorite makeovers. I don't think I could love this room more!  I shared the design plan for this office makeover a few weeks ago. This project is really entails just finishing up this room more than redoing anything.  I've already built the wall of green bookcases and created a huge upholstered pin board on the opposite wall: The room looked great, but I wanted to add some warm finishing details and change a couple of things up.

I'm so glad I found it! Years ago I shared a tutorial on installing peel and stick wallpaper. I find it kind of satisfying to hang. It has plenty of stick, so you can readjust over and over if needed.  You will need clean walls and it is recommended to wait four weeks after painting to apply removable wallpaper.  During the install, I had to work around some art. I had a symmetrical set of ten Audubon prints on the long wall in my office, as you can see in this before pic: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Not only because it's so fresh and delicious, but because it's a recipe my late father-in-law passed down to us.  He grew up in Mexico and loved to cook for his loved ones. So much so, that once a year we would invite our friends over and he would cook for the huge group.  If a brave soul dared to help prep...they were subject to my father-in-law's scrutiny while they chopped or mixed. ;)  He was a stickler about his cooking and rightly so...every single thing he made was absolutely delicious and authentic. He could be intimidating at first, but was a big softie at heart and cooking for family and friends filled him with joy! Thankfully this is one of the recipes he handed down to us. I'm sure it's pretty standard as far as salsa recipes are concerned, but it's special to us because it brings back such happy memories when we make it: This quick salsa recipe is easy and so flavorful!  Here's my mild version of his salsa:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Can you even believe it? It's crazy to me that there is a whole generation that wasn't even alive when 9/11 occurred. If you've read my blog for long, you know New York City is near and dear to us. It's a city we love so very much. I always knew I'd love it, and when my husband took me on my first trip (just a few days before September 11, 2001) I found out I was right.  This photo always gives me chills. We're at the top of the Statue of Liberty and you can barely see the towers behind me: This was nine days before 9/11. Nine days later and the towers were gone. My husband was a band director at the time, and a few months after the attacks we were supposed to travel to Japan for a band trip. He canceled that trip and instead we took the students to New York City. SO many New Yorkers stopped us numerous times and thanked the kids for visiting. These first photos are from the Ground Zero Museum and tell the story of that day. This location is separate from the new museum — it used to be closer to Ground Zero but it looks like it’s moved to 14th street. If you visit the city I highly recommend visiting both.

I'm excited to make this room even warmer and cozier.  If you've read TDC for a while, you know I tend to slow down in the summer. I did some research a few months ago and am quite sure I have summer Seasonal Affect Disorder.  For as long as I can remember, I lose my energy and mojo in the heat. The sweating, humidity, bugs (mosquitos LOVE ME), the heat...it drains everything out of me. But once these slightly cooler days hit, I feel like myself again! I am happier, more energized and ready to tackle new projects! I love fall so very much. I accomplished a bunch of DIY projects before the summer, and this office redo is the first I want to tackle in the second half of the year. I hate to call it a redo...I'm just adding to what I've already done.  This room started out very pretty and light, but there wasn't a lot going on design-wise:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYRw13BwfzPVIvL9tqBzDjh85gAml-mcHgAPUGqKxBoFCk6B-c1jVHhaBjg0igkKzR1PCZqnPKzno4f3dSCRw6szebKY1zrQY0k0F7QHFLB9M3JP1TV-Ind3UVqtKZPrBiivSk8EPt3bjA-pSfzqRBYKNzQqTO-Kk-xazmb5_XyMLZPYVPmopCcQx5Nes/s16000/office%20with%20floating%20desk.jpg\"\u003e This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

I've shared a couple of them here...if you have old, yellowed cans with halogen bulbs, it's super easy to replace your old recessed lights with beautiful LED versions.You can also add character and detail where a recessed light is installed by using a simple kit that screws into the to change it to a hanging pendant light. For this method you need to have the a canned light that has a screw in light bulb.I did this in our little blue and white floral wallpapered hallway: And in our foyer vestibule when I added (you guessed it)...wallpaper there as well: Both of those options are SUPER simple and take no electrical knowledge at all!I do have some electrical experience, so I thought this next one would be especially easy. Although it turns out you don't need to know much other than how to wire a light fixture to do this one. So I thought...easy! 😣You know how sometimes what you think will be super difficult turn out to be a breeze, and projects you think will be easy turn out to be much harder than you thought? This was one of those harder than I thought ones.Shortly after finishing my closet makeover over the past couple of weeks, I thought about some updates I'd like to make to the little hallway outside the closet as well.It's a small space, but as you can see above, I love treating spots like that as tiny rooms I can decorate. :) We have a recessed light in this area that I knew would look great with a hanging light: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to make the softest fabric pumpkin pillows without a sewing machine.  These cute stuffed pumpkins are SO soft and will look great in your fall decor, or would work as cute pillows on chairs or sofas. It's easy to make fabric pumpkins and no sewing machine or experience is needed.  They are an easy knock off of the expensive Pottery Barn teddy bear pumpkin pillows. :) When I first saw those adorable stuffed pumpkins, I knew I had to make some of my own.  I ended up making a bunch of them for the price of ONE from the store.

I thought they were the cutest pumpkins/pillows -- so soft and fluffy!  But the price...nope. At least when I knew I could recreate them for a fraction of what they are charging.  I went to the craft store in search of the softest, fluffiest fabric I could find. I got three colors in very similar fabrics -- one light cream, one medium brown and one dark brown.  They are all SO SOFT and cozy. I just loved all three. The dark fabric is what I think is considered the true \"teddy bear\" fabric, but they all worked beautifully for this project.  I've never made my own fabric pumpkins, but I figured it out along the way. My first method worked OK, but then I did a little research and will be sharing the instructions I ended up using for the rest of the pumpkins.  This DIY fabric pumpkin how-to will work with both the fluffy fabrics I'm using and thinner options for cotton or velvet pumpkins.  First up, cut a rounded square or circle out of your fabric in the size you want:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Ten DIY updates to customize stock kitchen and bathroom cabinets.Over the years I've made a BUNCH of different DIY updates to basic kitchen, bathroom and laundry room cabinets that make them look so much more custom.You don't have to spend a ton on cabinets! I prefer to use inexpensive, unfinished cabinets for my projects and then dress them up. If you're willing to put the time and effort in, you can completely customize your stock cabinets with some time and sweat equity. I rounded up my ten favorite ways to update inexpensive cabinets and make them MUCH more functional and high end looking. 1. Paint your cabinets! OK, this one is the most obvious, but is also the DIY that makes the biggest impact for sure. If you want to transform your cabinetry by painting them, make sure and take the correct steps. Doing this correctly will make them super durable and looking beautiful for years!I painted all of our kitchen cabinets in our last house: Check out my cabinet painting tutorial (with a paint sprayer) to find out how I did it!Don't underestimate the difference a couple coats of paint will make -- this is my number one recommendation for updating your kitchen or bathroom.2. Extend cabinets to ceilingI've added this custom cabinetry touch in both of our homes. If your cabinets don't go to the ceiling, closing in that space can make them look more high end.I first tried this out at our last house by adding open shelving on top of our kitchen cabinets: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   Since we had about 18 inches to work with between the top of the cabinets and the ceiling, I opted to create a thick header, as well as the open decorative shelves at the top of the kitchen cabinets. Figuring out the balance is important if you want to try this DIY project. I've seen some people fill in a very large opening with just open spaces and no header -- this can look off if that open space is too tall. The cabinets and open shelving end up competing against each other. Adding a header with molding at the top helps to balance everything out. I've also seen some close in a large space with just a header, and that can feel super heavy. I recommend doing a combination of additional cabinets and/or open shelving and a header if you have significant empty space over your cabinets. I used much taller upper cabinets in our basement kitchenette, so we only had a small space to fill in above: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to make fall and holiday pillows for WAY less with placemats and more.  One of my all time favorite DIY projects is making pillows from placemats, table runners and all kinds of random linens.    This little trick is perfect for fall and holiday pillows. I mean, who wants to spend a fortune on pillows that will only be out for two to three months?  I've shared this little hack a few times, because it saves me so much money. The investment is in my time, but I'm so quick at these now it doesn't take long at all.  I like seasonal decor that can be used more than a couple weeks and that's easy to store away. These always fit both of those criteria. OH, and cheap. Also checks that one off.  I always love the Pottery Barn selection of fall pillows, but they are like $30+ each for just the pillow covers. When I want one, maybe. When I want a bunch, no way.  Years ago, I started looking at other ways to get the same look, for way less!  I found this runner at Marshall's (they have similar ones at TJ Maxx and HomeGoods too) and my plan starting coming together:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

Never forget a paint colorWe've all been there -- you need to touch up a spot, or you love a color so much you want to use it again. But did you use eggshell or satin?

We love this space so much and it's about time I show you the whole room.  I tackled so many DIY projects for this kitchen build and learned a ton along the way. I even had a few do-it-myself firsts during this process.  The value of our home was definitely increased with this project as well. (Although I will never leave this house if I can help it!)  We waited about five years to tackle this space after moving in. It was kind of a catch all spot before:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhgxcAv62CUvfqccHzHqqCu_nBzmW_y_Zp9DfwW54TitYU87CHbfZFLUn0cbT0Ky8xn5bI4jfBIloybs6Z9WIMD6bvbpE9sW233GRvyYhu76zv63I0UOn-gACJPtu2-WFD-2FuxVscO7u9qGlZCDNSKPs1_ZOr5rWxnXU_BfAEoQMHP2tZJAlAAfH5TGbM/s16000/basement%20kitchen%20plan.jpg\"\u003e I didn't have the builder carpet this area, thinking we would start this process right away. I was a little off on the timeline. ;)  We had wine fridges down here, and a microwave to make popcorn, but that was about it.  We had all of the water and plumbing (water line for fridge and plumbing for sink) roughed in when we built the house.  After I cleared everything out of here, it was time to start building a fun and functional space for my family to enjoy.  Before I could start anything, we had the outlets moved to fit the layout and up to counter height:   src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjocYJOjcMszoWDofypo9MQCq6SnI1A1faLJtfZ_yE9qzsDJbAVGsubOkTubh8gDacAYXwZOY1f56rHtu6GJiE3jO-MSFwGkw6ZUpDvg2hnra7RfYT9Uuhk0Fx2mvfZpc15oQN6f6SSvYL1FM0K3ag7X1TQe6GHfBB7bqeX2NkGWhPqEEnwbXBwAEOui7Y/s16000/unfinished%20kitchenette.jpg\"\u003e This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

    "description": "The quickest and easiest way to install tile (no mortar needed!). The tile project I'm sharing today is one of my favorites I've ever done -- first of all because it was SO easy, thanks to this awesome product, and because it is beautiful!  I fell hard for a square, slightly shimmery tile called Zellige. Turns out it was very trendy a few years ago...as usual I'm way behind on the trends. (And I'm fine with that.)  It has a wavy texture that makes it look handmade...and usually it is! The real stuff is VERY expensive, but I really wanted to use it for the small backsplash in our laundry/mud room: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     You can install in a straight stacked look like this for a more modern look, or in a brick pattern for a more traditional look. The thing is, authentic Zellige tile is handmade from clay and has an imperfect look that I don't always love. Also, it's usually installed very close with small grout lines (which adds to the imperfect look).  I've always preferred the more uniform versions I've seen, with a bit of contrast with the grout.  I did some research and found this ceramic version pictured above that still has the handmade look, but is very affordable! Plus each tile is uniform and the same size, but still has the pretty details that I loved about the real stuff.  It went into my cart! I was even more pleased in person -- they were so lovely! I had a couple hiccups in this tile process along the way because I didn't order enough at first. I had to wait on backorders and then the second shipment was much shinier than the first. I was able to pick and choose out of the boxes to find some that matched better. You'll probably be able to avoid this by buying all you need at once so they are from the same lot number. But overall the install process was a breeze! I used a non-mortar install product that makes the tile installation SUPER quick and mess-free. Before you start tiling, figure out the middle of the area you'll be working on. Since ours was the backsplash, I marked the middle and centered a tile on that:  I then lined up the tiles each direction to make sure I wasn't going to have any tiny slivers at the ends.  When I was sure of my layout, I pulled out the item that made the process go so quickly. It's a tile setting mat that you use instead of mortar:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

This easy solution is inexpensive and gives you instant privacy. This DIY is so simple and cheap, and helps with an annoying privacy problem that would be expensive or messy to fix otherwise. I've actually shared this \"hack\" before (a looong time ago), but it's one that's worth sharing again!I've used this for frosting glass on glass doors and interior windows and it is a great, inexpensive solution. Plus, it's easily removed if you ever change your mind. You can easily do this to any flat glass surface with very few tools and a little time. The first time I did this was on our glass pantry door ten years ago: I was able to frost our glass pantry door for next to nothing! (Although getting the film placed perfectly on those panes was a PAIN.) A few helpful readers told me about this trick forever ago. Who knew transparent contact paper is the easiest and cheapest way to make a window private? I was so pleasantly surprised when this actually worked!  We had a big bathroom window in the old house that I made private with this as well. I didn't think I'd need to do it again, until we moved into this house and realized the powder room window was placed in a less than ideal spot:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   Ha!

I've always felt for our guests especially. 😝 I don't know what took me so long, but I finally did this private window trick again and it worked like a charm.Now there are a few ways to do this, but I promise you this is the easiest. You can buy frosted window film, but those options are more costly. You can also use a frosted glass spray paint, but that's messy -- you have to worry about overspray and fumes...and it won't hold up well over time on a window or door that gets a lot of use.You can also use a glass etching cream to do this permanently, but I would only try that in extreme cases.  For this DIY method of frosting glass, you'll need transparent matte Contact paper: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to install your own landscape lighting, with no electrical knowledge needed!  Adding the warmth and character of landscape lighting to your home's exterior is not as hard ad you think! I promise it's not a difficult DIY project. It is incredibly easy to install your own landscaping lights. There is zero work with electricity other than plugging it in. You only have to do very simple wiring to complete this landscape lighting project.  The result is so worth the hour or so this project will take you! One of my favorite pastimes (especially in the summer) is driving through pretty neighborhoods at dusk and looking at the houses. I think homes look prettiest at this time of day.  There's always one beautiful detail of expensive houses that I notice -- they all have landscape lighting that makes the exteriors glow at night. It makes everything look even more lovely and expensive.  So years ago I figured out how to do it on my own and it’s so easy to do!  You must have an outside electrical outlet near where you want to install the lights. Keep in mind you will have a wire, so it can’t go over a sidewalk or driveway. You can hide the wire along the house and in this tutorial I use them in mulch.  There are only three things you’ll need to install the lights – the lights themselves, a power pack and wire.  This tutorial includes photos from both our old and current house. I love adding this lighting accent to our exterior!  1. Pick your landscape lighting. We’ll start at the hardware store, in the outdoor lighting aisle. There are solar lights that have come a long way, and if you pick those you can stop here. ;) Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "No stress tips for starting and growing your own vegetable garden.  The thought of trying to grow our own food used to intimidate me until so many of you helpful readers gave me a bunch of tips years ago. Since then I have learned it really doesn't need to take much time or effort to grow your own garden! Even as a beginner, you'll get a wonderful harvest if you follow just a few simple steps.  I planted my first vegetable garden nearly 15 years ago, and since then I've had one in the ground many times over the years. Some years life has just been too busy to get it going, and it's been a few since I had one planted.  Up till recently I've used the very basic 4x4 beds you can buy at most hardware stores:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   I found those trellis pieces by a dumpster and used them to keep little critters out. It definitely helped!  I also think having the garden right next to the noisy air conditioner helped deter the wildlife. These cedar raised garden beds are super easy to put together and a perfect for a beginner! You can buy multiples to make bigger gardens as well.  The problem with these garden kits is the wood is very thin, so even though it's cedar and should hold up well, I found they were only last a few years at best.  They are fairly inexpensive (as far as raised beds go), so not a huge deal. They are GREAT option if you're just starting out.  Till this year, my process for setting up my garden beds was simply to put my kit together (you'll need a drill and screws) and then dump garden soil inside. Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

We've made some updates to the exterior of our modern Craftsman home over the past couple of years that have made a BIG difference. It's about time I shared them with you!  Let's start with my favorite project. I've wanted to have this done since the day we moved in, and years later I finally made it happen.  I shared our garage doors a few years ago when I added some metal Craftsman hardware to the door trim:  This is such an easy and inexpensive garage door update!  But I had a bigger project in mind. I first had this pergola accent done over the back doors of our last house:  I loved that look, and knew it would look SO GOOD over the garage doors in this house.  This pergola accent is a great Craftsman style touch that adds some beautiful character to garage doors and more.  This time, I had the contractors (they did this project at the last house too) go a little simpler with the look:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "These are ten of my favorite ways to elevate the look of your home, both inside and out!  Over the years I've discovered some easy decor and DIY changes that make a big difference in our home.  I could make an endless list of ways to do this with bigger projects like crown molding, wall trim and built ins, but these examples are much simpler and less involved.  Most of these can be done in a few minutes. A few of them are projects that will take a little more time, but thankfully I have tutorials that will help you out if you decide to tackle them. ;) I've always thought that some of the more subtle changes make a big difference in a house, especially when repeated throughout.  They are the little touches that give your home a high-end look! A few of these are splurges, so when I update multiple like items all over the house, I do it over time. I'll grab one or two on trips to the store as the budget allows.  Some of these have taken me a year to finish, some aren't done and some I've just started! ALL are little details that I think give our home that extra little something. :) 1. Replace or paint floor HVAC grates For years I've spray painted our inexpensive floor vents to a darker color that flows with our floors better:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     I've done that with all of the basic tan floor grates that we've had in both of our houses over the years. They hold up surprisingly well! Last year I was strolling down an aisle at Lowe's when I noticed how many pretty floor vent options were available. I tried one of these cast iron metal grates in a room that day and fell in love:  Over the past year I've been grabbing one on trips to the hardware store here and there. Since we only have the floor vents on the main floor, I didn't have as many to replace as I thought.  I love the pretty Marquis design that fits in well with our modern Craftsman home details:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "I’ll be the first to admit that South Dakota wasn’t high on my vacation bucket list. But I ended up there this summer on a dad-and-daughter trip I took with some family members: and WOW, we loved it. It was a surprising and wonderful departure from our usual family trips, so I wanted to share some highlights in case anyone else is interested in breaking out of the more typical beach or theme park vacation routine. Growing up on the East Coast and now living in Florida, I haven’t spent much time in the upper Midwest. So these sights may be old hat for some of you. But just like our trip to the California desert earlier this year, this was a chance for us to soak up some new-to-us geography. Why We Vacationed In South Dakota South Dakota is home to lots of epic vistas, charming towns, and outdoor adventures. Continue reading A Summer Trip To South Dakota at Young House Love.",

    "description": "A friend of mine is pregnant and it’s reminding me how exciting it was to name our own kids. We love traditional names (aka: old-fashioned names, aka classic names) and both of our children are named after our grandparents – one on John’s side and one on my side. So I had fun putting together this list of my favorite 100 classic boy names. They feel established, like they stand the test of time, and can carry special meaning if they’re already names in your family. ALSO IS THERE ANYTHING CUTER THAN BABY SUSPENDERS?!? One interesting thing I found when I was writing this post was that many of the top ten most popular names for boys in 2024 are arguably pretty classic: #1: Liam #2: Noah #3: Oliver #4: James #5: Elijah #6: Mateo #7: Theodore #8: Henry #9: Lucas #10: William But beyond that short list of the most popular boy names this year, there are so many other classic boy names to choose from.
