    "description": "The Glory Peak Ski Resort is founded in 1966 by Bill Macklemore, a World War II veteran–turned–ski instructor who developed a site near Fortooth into a premier skiing destination (it is said that “Fortooth was one of those towns where reality was far more potent than myth”). His devotion to his business is so all-encompassing that his wife, Suzanne, leaves him, taking along their son, Bobby. Fast forward a few decades: Bill is expanding the ski resort, and Bobby is married to a woman named Annabelle. Bobby does not approve of the way Bill is expanding the ski runs, and the local Indigenous Le’Echuwanna people aren’t happy, either. Annabelle and Bobby have a daughter named Clover, who is the company’s presumed heir, but things change when her grandmother, Nanny A, a former professor, strident feminist, and shrewd businesswoman, arrives. Family obligations bring Nanny A to town, but business interests keep her there: She bands together with her daughter’s former lover, Gunther (a German skier and videographer), to take his company Wolfehaus into the stratosphere as Clover’s inheritance (if she even wants it) and the family legacy hang in the balance. Abrams’ small but remarkable cast of characters occupy a world in the Pacific Northwest that is a sight to behold. The towering achievements, business acumen, and grand ambition on display make for an engrossing story about family that is as grounded as it is lofty. All is not perfect at the foot of the mountain, and the difficult relationships are characterized with compelling emotional detail. Family legacy is key in this novel, but there are some literal cliffhanger moments that keep the story exciting. The narrative is told out of chronological sequence, but the author’s gift for storytelling keeps everything in sync.",

    "description": "Ed is a cowboy poet in the desert Southwest. He’s stable and reliable (even in the ways he finesses his alcoholism), settled, a stand-up guy who emerged bloodied but upright from domestic tragedy in his youth. And he’s found a calling in late middle age as a linchpin of Local 302, the Weepers, who go from town to town, funeral to funeral, and provide tears to prime the pump of grief in a world rapidly drying up into ugliness, flatness, disconnection. It’s not clear at first what the group should make of the newly arrived “kid,” a scrawny, taciturn presence who joins them for memorial services, intermittently, and who—though he doesn’t ever cry himself—contains a silent reservoir of sorrow that moves Local 302 to new heights (or depths) of conspicuous grief. Is the kid a petty criminal, a masochist, the victim of some terrible misdeed? Drifter, messiah, lost soul, blank screen upon which to project one’s own anxieties? All of the above, perhaps. Ed soon becomes the mysterious young man’s booster, apologist, protector, fan, friend, bail-payer, even matchmaker. Ed’s voice throughout the novel is darkly funny, wry, perceptive—charming. The kid, like many a cipher, never comes fully alive on the page, so the plot never quite kindles, but Mendelsund amply compensates for that with the playful wit and music of the prose.",
