    "description": "The book opens with a scene of a newborn daughter, Eleanor, on a mother’s chest, with the grandparent speaker experiencing sympathy twinges in her own womb (“Grandmothers”). Another poem prays for infants in their “sheltering globes” in an intensive care unit, where “my first grandchild” was treated (“Neonatal ICU Prayer”). In “Alternate Reality,” set at Christmastime, a 2-year-old granddaughter, Evelyn, misidentifies a sanitation worker as Santa Claus while on a wintry walk. During the Covid-19 pandemic, a speaker struggles to connect with her granddaughter over a video call and longs for in-person outings (“Grandparenting in the Time of Covid-19”). Foley shares other snapshots of life as a grandmother, from nature walks to quirky conversations to meals with grandchildren. Poems marvel at grandchildren’s wisdom; in “On the Eve of June,” when a dog dies, a granddaughter tells the speaker that the pup “has just gone home— / her old one.” Foley concludes with a fantasy of leaving the “uncivil world” behind to lead a more serene life, devoted to raising grandkids and appreciating the beauty of nature with them (“Holiness”). Overall, Foley’s poems are concise and sincere. She acutely captures youngsters’ silly speech, and the works effectively evoke the speakers’ surroundings; a pushy midwife at a granddaughter’s birth, she writes, “herds us like livestock / back to our holding pen, / to lap stale coffee” (“Grandmothers”). Some readers may find the collection’s depiction of grandparenthood to be somewhat idealized, as it glosses over many of the role’s emotional and physical challenges. However, the poet repeatedly transforms quotidian moments into soulful meditations; for example, upon spotting a granddaughter’s parents greeting the toddler from a window, a speaker tells readers, “Imagine / seeing your reason for being, / framed, like a photograph, / waving and smiling at you” (“Imagine”).",

    "description": "Onyx Chime, 16, has lived a sheltered life so far working as an assistant to her father, Ambroos Chime, the immortal Timekeeper, who controls time for all the Clockwork Lands. She quickly befriends Edison Lindquist, who will apprentice with her father before taking a position as Gear Master. Soon, Cornelia Castille arrives. She’s a mysterious socialite who has a unique relationship with Onyx. Given permission to travel from Center Wheel for the first time in her life, Onyx and Edison have an exciting day out but return to find that Ambroos has been kidnapped. Onyx, Cornelia, and Edison set out to rescue him, convincing Thaddeus Thackeray, an eccentric inventor obsessed with eternity, to take them in his airship. Along the way, they encounter many dangers and a mad doctor, whose capture of Ambroos is only the first step toward realizing his dangerous ambitions. This is an ingeniously creative novel, as cleverly constructed as the gears and cogs of Clockwork Lands. The lead is a delight—curious, clever, and resourceful—and inhabits a well-imagined world: “The air balloon drifted a couple hundred feet above the great lakes, weaving in and around floating islands with their metal foundations, creating a magnetic pull with the metals in the water so that they seemed to hover or float above the lively waves.” The inciting action of the story happens close to the middle of the novel because author Archie takes plenty of time with her worldbuilding and character development. Accompanying the story are many detailed illustrations and a map of the Clockwork Lands. Fortunately for readers, this book is the first in a planned series.",
