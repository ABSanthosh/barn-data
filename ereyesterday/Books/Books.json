    "description": "Cooley, professor of political science at Barnard College, and Dukalskis, associate professor of politics and international relations at University College Dublin, open with the West’s celebration of the USSR’s collapse in 1989. Victory in the Cold War was hailed as a triumph of freedom, and many pundits predicted that respect for human rights and free market capitalism would become so universal that it would mark “the end of history.” China was welcomed into the world economy with the universal assumption that its people would force democratic reforms, and soon-to-be-autocratic Russia, with an economy no larger than Italy’s, was of little consequence. Democracies spread, national incomes rose, and few disagreed with the maxim that capitalism and prosperity required freedom. Readers will squirm when the authors describe how matters began to change. Until the beginning of this century, dictators stumbled when dealing with Western “soft power,” which emphasized, besides movies and pop music, a quarrelsome liberal democracy, toleration of contradictory opinions within a nation, and opposition to injustice everywhere. No fools, they learned from their mistakes. Using a combination of modern technology and psychology (humans remain tribal; they love theirs and distrust others), old autocracies got their act together, and jingoistic right-wing movements, learning the same lessons, began thriving even in European social democracies. Once a modest threat, reformers barely exist today in the established autocracies of China, Russia, and the Middle East. Elsewhere, hypernationalistic autocrats began winning free elections decades ago, and to America’s 2024 victors, “liberal” is a dirty word. No polemic, this is a sober report, dotted with statistics, graphs, and political analysis.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/pe-shadrick-1/elephants-do-forget/",
    "description": "Emory is an older pachyderm living in a forest. While out for a walk one day, he finds that he can’t remember how to get home. A parrot asks if Emory needs help, and after the elephant admits that he might be lost, the bird says, “I’m happy to help you find your way. Just tell me, where did you come from? And I’ll have you home by the end of the day.” The parrot doesn’t recognize Emory’s description of his home, but offers to bring him to see a wise frog friend. The pair cross a river to reach the amphibian, who leads them to Emory’s herd. The other elephants thank the parrot and frog and invite them to celebrate Emory’s return: “We welcome you as guests and friends. You have been patient and generous, and this tale has come to a joyful end.” It’s not explicitly clear whether Emory has age-related memory loss or a more serious condition, but he’s never shown to be in real danger. This aspect also doesn’t detract from the cheerful, effective message to readers to “lend a helping hand” whenever they can. Letcher’s watercolor-style cartoon illustrations will be a big draw; the stubby-trunked elephants’ faces are especially expressive and endearing.",
