    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/michael-lewis-2/beneath-our-feet/",
    "description": "Lewis and Richardson, both of the British Museum, were inspired to assemble this book by the BBC TV series Digging for Britain, which describes the exploits of two English hobbyists who scour the countryside with their metal detectors. Readers will not regret looking it up. Organic objects decay (mostly); stone and bone survive; metals are a mixed bag. Amateur searchers, with or without detectors, find bottle caps, discarded toys, and metal scraps. Less often, items from distant times turn up—buttons, bullets, arrowheads, coins, jewelry, tools, and weapons. Almost no one finds a treasure trove or “hoard,” but “almost no one” among thousands of searchers produces a steady stream of bonanzas that will dazzle readers poring over the hundreds of crisp images. People on this island seemed to love burying stuff, and even Stone Age inhabitants had a taste for gold and knew what to do with it. Gold does not decompose, but it’s an exception, and most of the text describes efforts to find, extract, clean, reassemble, decipher, and interpret long-buried relics. Despite the lovely images, this book alone should not be anyone’s introduction to prehistoric Britain. The authors deliver a short summary of the era at the beginning of each chapter but stay focused on the objects themselves: the finders’ experience as well as that of the landowners. Rich hoards have sold for immense sums to private collectors, but precious metals and “treasures” belong to the nation, and public-spirited owners donate what they find.",

    "title": "SUSTAINABLE AMBITION",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/kathy-oneto/sustainable-ambition/",
    "description": "Life coach and public speaker Oneto offers a refreshing alternative to the hustle culture that defines much of modern professional life and can often lead to feelings of burnout. While drawing on personal experience and her own coaching insights, she challenges readers to reconsider how ambition is defined, what it means in practice, and how it can support, rather than sabotage, one’s well-being. The book, at its core, is both radical and comforting in its assertion that ambition isn’t inherently unhealthy, but simply needs recalibrating. To that end, Oneto introduces readers to the Sustainable Ambition mindset, which reframes ambition as something not directed at a specific target, but as a kind of personal compass; this, in turn, leads into her Sustainable Ambition Method, which suggests “aligning the right ambition at the right time with the right effort.” The author’s tone is neither prescriptive nor preachy, which sets the book apart from some others in the genre; instead, she invites readers into a place of reflection on their senses of truth and purpose, while providing prompts, exercises, and practical tools throughout. A particularly resonant aspect of the work is her call to “reclaim” ambition as a source of fulfillment, rather than one of self-erasure. Oneto doesn’t promise easy answers, nor does she make claims that seem too good to be true about her mindset or method, but she does offer a clear roadmap for sustainable growth that respects individuality. The book shows a clear intention to guide and support, and it may allow readers to develop a new way of thinking about one’s goals—especially at times when their motivation is low.",
