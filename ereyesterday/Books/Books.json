    "description": "In 2017, several years after her first suicide attempt, Rebolini became so tormented by a desire to die that she checked herself into a psychiatric ward. In the years since that stay, she has performed sweeping literary, sociological, historical, and psychological research on the topic of suicidality, in an “effort to stake a claim in a conversation dominated by fear and disgust.” Rebolini has been depressed or suicidal most of her life and comes from a “family replete with mental illness”; her own extreme lows mix with those of her brother, Jordan, and other close friends to grant personal shape to a broader inquiry into not only what prompts individuals to engage the extremity of suicide, but also what constitutes recovery from a suicide attempt. Even as the author advances professionally, and achieves other lifelong dreams like marriage and motherhood, the possibility of suicide never disappears, and even the highs of career and family successes necessitate a certain contemplative navigation. She extrapolates from her own financial stress and career ambitions to critique modern stressors like expectations of productivity and barriers to mental health care, and literary figures like Sylvia Plath and David Foster Wallace offer both general lessons and notches against which to measure the severity of her own experience. Rebolini admits that suicide is “tough to talk about because so much of it doesn’t make sense” and that normalizing suicidal thoughts and acts carries a risk. She insists, however, on trying to walk this careful line, and her effort counters the shame of those trying to dodge a persistent desire to not exist, while extending compassionate understanding of and gentle guidance to all those who care for and worry about loved ones struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sabrina-jeffries/hazardous-to-a-dukes-heart/",
    "description": "Lord Jonathan Leighton, third son of the Duke of Falconridge, was on a grand tour when he and thousands of other British civilians were forced into detainee camps in France. Jon attempted escape alongside his two best friends and his mentor, Dr. Isaac Morris, but they were captured and sent to prison, where Morris died before they were released. When, after 11 years away, Jon returns to England with plans to make good on his promise to find a husband for his mentor’s daughter, Victoria, he learns that his father and two brothers are dead and he’s inherited the dukedom; Tory now works as his sister’s governess. When he (falsely) tells Tory that her father left her a sizable dowry—providing the money himself seems like the best way to help her—she surprises him by responding that she does not wish to marry but would rather open a school for women artists like herself. They come to an agreement that Tory will be presented in Society and look for a husband until the end of the Season if Jon will attend sculpting lessons, but they soon find themselves unable to resist their mutual attraction. Both are hiding secrets, though, which become more complicated to maintain as their feelings grow. This new series kickoff hits all the notes of an old-school romance, with historical richness, delicious pining, and a lack of communication and trust keeping the pair apart. Secondary characters function as plot devices, but the leads are appealing. There are short references to atrocities Jon and others faced while in France, but the story never goes too deep, maintaining a light tone instead. One mystery thread is left open for future books.",
