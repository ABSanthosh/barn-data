    "title": "JURY DUTY IS MURDER",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/margaret/jury-duty-is-murder/",
    "description": "This novel take place in the aftermath of a high-profile trial, as 72-year-old retired teacher Helen Ryder (known to the other jurors as “Schoolmarm”) and other jurors reconnect after a series of suspicious deaths among their peers. Two months before, they voted to convict basketball player Roger “Buck” Dempsey for the murder of his wife, and now it appears that someone is exacting revenge. Helen, hardware store owner Harold Ashman (nicknamed “Shoe”), actor and science fiction writer Alex Manning (known as “Reporter”), and the lively exotic dancer Mindy Laine (aka “CeeCee”) investigate, which leads them into a web of deceit and danger. The novel does a great job of blending suspense with character-driven drama, as each juror brings their own personalities and emotion baggage to the proceedings. As they try to make sense of the unexplained deaths, difficulties arise—not just in the investigation, but also in their personal lives; for example, Helen’s family is threatening to place her in an elderly care home. Damon, who also writes bestselling novels as Margaret Brownley, manages to balance an entertaining whodunit with insights into the diverse worlds of the jurors, whose lives have been drastically changed by their shared experience. The pacing is tight, with each chapter revealing just enough to keep readers hooked. The dialogue, especially between Harold and Helen (“Helen shot a daggered look in Harold’s direction. ‘You actually listened to something I said? That’s a first’”), adds lighter moments to an otherwise tense narrative. Overall, this twisty novel offers a unique mix of courtroom drama and post-trial mystery, while its subtle romance elements make it feel well-rounded.",

    "title": "THE LIFE OF HEROD THE GREAT",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/zora-neale-hurston/the-life-of-herod-the-great/",
    "description": "Following on Moses, Man of the Mountain (1939), Hurston spent years studying the life of Herod the Great, the famed Jewish leader. Her editor rejected the resulting book, which wound up in a trunk and then, following her death, in flames—the trunk burned by a crew hired to clear out her house—and miraculously rescued by a passing sheriff’s deputy who knew she was a writer. Hurston had two apparent purposes: She wished to chronicle “the 3,000 years struggle of the Jewish people for democracy and the rights of man,” and she saw in Herod’s alliance with Rome a metaphor for the Cold War struggle between Russia and the United States. While many ancient sources portray Herod as a tyrant, anticipating the fiercer denunciation of his son as the scourge of both Jesus Christ and John the Baptist, Hurston builds on other accounts; in particular, she rejects the charge that a monstrous Herod ordered “the massacre of the innocents,” instead insisting that “he was beloved by the nation.” The Herod of her story is a smolderingly handsome man suitable for a romance novel, which earns him the attention of a lustful and decidedly bad Mariamne, who repaid his blandishments by plotting his death, bringing it instead on herself: “Mariamne was dead. Dead. Never to burn away annoyances with her hot, soft body.” Hurston sometimes writes with a kind of high-gothic-romance seriousness (“My own father is at fault for beseeching Caesar to reinstate this treacherous Hyrcanus in the priesthood”), mixing in charming if perhaps not quite appropriate Southernisms (“Cleopatra knew more ways to kill a cat besides choking it to death on butter”). Altogether, the manuscript, while an interesting historical document, lacks the polish of Hurston’s classic books, such as Dust Tracks on a Road and Their Eyes Were Watching God.",
