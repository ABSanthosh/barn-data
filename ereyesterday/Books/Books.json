    "title": "BEYOND ARCHITECTURE",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/barbaralee-diamonstein-spielvogel/beyond-architecture/",
    "description": "In commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), Diamonstein-Spielvogel, former LPC commissioner and nationally renowned arts advocate, invited people knowledgeable about the city’s architecture and history to “write freely on any and all…aspects of the built environment, including the role of preservation in a changing city.” The result is a diverse set of essays ranging from the history of the Bowne House, the oldest house in Queens, to the engineering challenges of adaptive reuse and the need to design and construct buildings that will endure beyond their original use. The book’s value lies with those essayists who encourage the LPC to lessen its fixation on the aesthetics of individual buildings—particularly regarding historic districts—and its timidity in the face of real estate interests. They urge the LPC to preserve, as New York Times architecture critic Michael Kimmelman writes, the “things that give the city and its neighborhoods their character, distinction, vitality, social cohesion, and meaning.” The intent is to protect and preserve the city’s cultural history (its intangible heritage), sites of ecological value (i.e., living landmarks), historic signage, and structural and mechanical building systems. Yet the book excludes the voices of the many people who think “beyond architecture,” including urban planners, urbanists, sociologists, and cultural scholars, among others. Historic preservation in New York City seems unable to escape the gravitational pull of individual buildings and the architectural profession. The book would have benefited from an essay reflecting on the LPC’s political, bureaucratic, and financial limitations and unrealized potential. Well worth reading, nonetheless, are thoughtful essays by Kimmelman and fellow architecture critic Paul Goldberger, architect Lisa Switkin, and the historic preservation scholar Andrew Dolkart.",

    "title": "THE IRISH GIRL",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ashley-e-sweeney/the-irish-girl/",
    "description": "It is October of 1886 when 13-year-old Mary Agnes (called Mary A.) Coyne gives her beloved grandfather, Festus Laffey, a tearful goodbye hug and kiss. She is on her way to America—alone, frightened, and excited. Although she had dreamed of seeing the world beyond western Ireland, she had not expected to leave on her own at such a young age. But her mother throws her out of the house after her 15-year-old half-brother Fiach attempts to rape her, blaming Mary A. for the attack. Her grandparents offer her sanctuary from her violent father and vengeful mother, but her grandmother grows ill and can no longer care for her. Her grandparents arrange for Mary A.’s maternal uncle and his family, living in Chicago, to provide a home for her. Arriving in Manhattan, she goes to the church that is supposed to send her on to Chicago and learns that she must live with and work for an Irish family in New York before the priest will pay for her train ticket. One month later, Mary A. heads west. After a warm and effusive welcome, her uncle makes it clear she must find a live-in service job in one of Chicago’s prominent houses. Joy and sorrow await her. The poignant narrative is helmed by a sturdy young protagonist who faces a series of obstacles and injustices with courage, picking herself up after each emotionally challenging (and sometimes tragic) setback and pushing forward with determination. Sweeney imbues her prose with a gentle Irish lilt: “a beauty she were, that Laffey girl, when she were young; such a shame what happened to her, do you think it could have been her—no, no, best not to say, best not to say.” Her depictions of life in Ireland, the tortuous journey across the Atlantic, and Mary A.’s experiences as a young immigrant, complete with the rampant bigotry and misogyny of the era, are always vivid and compelling.",
