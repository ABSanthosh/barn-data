    "description": "From author and comedian Raskin comes a sincere examination of the laws, history, and social norms surrounding Western society’s expectations for a successful relationship and marriage. Drawing on personal experience as well as interviews and first-person stories from American couples, she explores the cultural effects of marriage and how modern-day relationships continually change and evolve. Beginning by questioning what the actual definition of marriage is and why so many unions are often dissolved, she invites readers to explore the complexities of marriage in society today. “I think our changing world is developing a new relationship toward it. People considering marriage are confronting different variables…and it’s left them with a lot of uncertainty and differing opinions than past generations.” Weaving research and statistics with viewpoints shaped by her experiences with OCD and anxiety, Raskin challenges her audience to ask questions and to explore the “why” when deciding what modern-day marriage means to each person. Ten chapters explore the different variables to consider when determining whether marriage is right for someone, including sex, cultural norms, financial issues, couples therapy, religion, and divorce. Ending on a compassionate note, Raskin urges readers to define marriage for themselves and their individual needs. “I think the true value of modern marriage is getting to build your own definition of what it actually means to be married,” she writes. “In Western society at least, marriage has shifted from a requirement to a choice. And not just the choice of whether to get married, but the choice of what kind of marriage to build together.”",

    "description": "Newly 15-year-old Cat really wants her new girlfriend, Morgan, to get along with her friends, but they’re just not gelling. English Cat is part of the fashion-conscious, makeup-wearing group surrounding her school’s queen bee, Siobhan, while Irish Morgan hangs with an edgier, goth-leaning cohort. To make matters worse, Morgan and Siobhan are both running for head girl. The competition gets fierce, and to avoid favoring one person over the other, Cat auditions for the school play, Romeo and Juliet—and lands the lead! Now she’ll be too busy to help out with any campaigns. Meanwhile, Cat’s best friend, the Polish Zanna, is acting weird—it seems like she doesn’t want to listen to Cat’s many woes. What’s up with that? This sequel to 2023’s Never Trust a Gemini, which traverses the zodiac calendar from the self-focused Aquarius to the grounded Taurus, allows for solid character development while still delivering plenty of farcical rom-com antics. Cat and Morgan’s relationship remains strong, despite various elements attempting to foil them, which is sweet and refreshing. Cat’s narration (and much of the dialogue) is still chock-full of slang as well as her own hilarious coinages (she’s fond of invoking Aphrodite and exclaiming “gooseberries!”), and her chatty style will draw readers in. Woolf’s sophomore novel firmly establishes her as a young adult author to watch.",
