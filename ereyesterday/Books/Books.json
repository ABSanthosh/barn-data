    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/gia-gordon/my-so-called-family-2/",
    "description": "Twelve-year-old Ashley Dalton, who prefers to be called Ash, has one refuge in the world: a walnut tree in the yard of her foster mother’s rental house, where she lives along with her foster mother’s volatile son, his girlfriend, and their baby, who shares a room with Ash. Middle school, where Ash gets bullied for being unfeminine in her clothing and appearance, is scary and threatening. And then, making things worse, her new social studies teacher assigns the class to draw family trees. Ash’s past is no one’s business but her own. Eventually, with the help of her friends Gentry Noble (a gentle boy who’s lost his own mother) and Joss Cruz (a supremely cool girl who’s also concealing family secrets)—along with adults who listen to Ash, appreciate her talents, and ask the students to consider what they don’t know—she finds the courage to confide in a teacher and her friends about the trouble she’s in. Gordon’s middle-grade debut is gritty, messy, and honest, with complex, nuanced characters navigating a realistically complex world that includes abuse, drug use, and homophobia. Ash’s simple request at the end—“I want to live with people who actually care about me”—feels earned, and attainable. Ash and Gentry read white, and Joss is cued Latine.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/rajani-larocca/mauntie-and-me/",
    "description": "Whenever Priya’s extended family comes over, her older siblings and cousins run off to play, telling her that she’s too young to join them. Priya doesn’t mind, though, because she gets to hang out with Mauntie (“My Auntie”)—the nickname she’s given her mother’s sister. Both the youngest in their generations, the two experiment with extravagant hairstyles, eat delicious treats, and tell each other riddles. Then one day Priya’s cousin Aditi comes to visit. Aditi, who’s close to Priya’s age, ends up intruding on Priya and Mauntie’s time, taking over a game of Go Fish and answering Mauntie’s riddles before Priya has a chance to think them through. When Aditi announces that she and her family are moving back to the neighborhood and will be around more, Priya panics. Can she find a way to share Mauntie? This clearly written, deeply empathetic book is a tender look at how families grow over time, with relationships evolving as people change locations. The story’s message stops just short of preachy, while Alam’s art, with its visible pencil strokes and details such as patterns on the curtains and wallpaper, sets an intimate tone. The illustrations depict characters with a variety of skin colors, testifying to the diversity of the South Asian experience.",
