    "description": "Following his father’s death, white farm boy Solomon Hunt, 15, sets off in hopes of supporting his mother and younger siblings. He meets the Seer, a nonspeaking little person with a mysterious history, and helps free him from the museum where he’s on display. The two go on the run, crossing the American Empire border into Buffalo. As they gather up other performers, they’re pursued by ruthless showman Leopold J. Coop, who has lofty political ambitions, across a nation in which Abraham Lincoln was assassinated before becoming president. Progressing toward Hollywood via steam train, dirigible, and stagecoach, their growing company of outsiders includes Cleo, a Black girl who was being used in a terrifying carnival act; Angus, an unusually tall white boy, who was sold by his parents; and genderfluid Chinese and Irish American martial artist John (sometimes Joan) Chan. With savagery that cuts to the bone—and without glossing over North Britain’s racialized abuses—Peacock highlights the American entertainment industry’s exploitation of vulnerable, marginalized people in this tense, triumphant outing. As the zigzag journey winds its way to a climactic confrontation, the story explores the autonomy-seeking leads’ belief that “we all just want to be respected, be recognized as individuals and be worth something.”",

    "title": "FOREVER, CEDAR KEY",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/michael-presley-bobbitt/forever-cedar-key/",
    "description": "Roughly a year after the nuclear meltdown that precipitated the events of Godspeed, Cedar Key (2024),the remaining few hundred residents of the titular locale—about a quarter of its former population—are slowly rebuilding their economy and infrastructure. Despite damage from nuclear fallout and extreme weather, the locals have managed to start breeding chickens again and have even mastered using slow-burning wood to create fuel for cars and boats. Although the once-central clamming industry is no longer viable, some fauna have returned to the island, including a bounty of white shrimp. The story opens with the marriage of Cedar Key’s Luke Buck to a woman named Kinsey from Sumner, on the mainland. Their wedding symbolizes a tenuous peace between the two communities, who came to blows over old grudges and dwindling resources in the early days of the “new world.” As it happens, the wedding isn’t the only cause for celebration, because Col. Robert McCloud—long assumed dead—returns in a dramatic crash landing after more than a year on the mainland. Sent out from Cedar Key for reconnaissance, the colonel was shot down in the wilds of Florida, surviving only by using his old Marine Corps training. He discovers in short order that he was shot down by Isaac Skipjack, a known entity on the island and the son of Buddy Skipjack, a fisherman who was caught stealing clams in the late 1990s and later died in the back of a police car. Now, years later, Isaac is leading a Coast Guard ship full of other mainlanders, with violence on his mind.Bobbitt’s follow-up to his debut offers a reading experience that many readers will find similar to that of the first installment, which is a very good thing. Like its predecessor, this novel brims with characters whose attachments to one another feel real and carry emotional weight. For example, Mark David—a Cedar Key fisherman and the father of young mayor Hayes David—took young Isaac in years ago, but the boy soon discovered that Mark may have been involved in his biological father’s death. In addition, the author’s expertise about the culture and geography of the part of the country in which the series is set makes for a richly detailed, authentic-feeling read: “When the bay is glassy calm, and the tide is low, it’s easy for the farmer to think big thoughts about what everything means, to find allegory in a diving cormorant, metaphor in the interplay of light and water.” Such vivid prose abounds in these pages, and the action scenes studded throughout the narrative—most especially, the gun and naval battles in which characters on both sides of the conflict fight and die—make for a propulsive narrative through which readers will be happy to travel.",
