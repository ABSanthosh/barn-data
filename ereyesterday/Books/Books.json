    "description": "Debut author Rogers, a former financial planner, has some major problems with paper money. For one, currencies such as the United States dollar are not backed by anything substantial like precious metals; unlike years ago, when the U.S. had a gold standard, money now is issued purely on trust. This ushers in a host of problems: The government has the ability to manipulate the value of the dollar when they adjust interest rates, and, as the author explains, when governments create more currency “out of thin air, prices rise.” Enter into the global financial arena the “promise and potential of Bitcoin.” Per Rogers, part of the appeal of Bitcoin, a payment system using money that “can’t be made up out of thin air,” is that it reduces the risk of misuse by powerful figures—a government cannot simply make more Bitcoin tokens so that they can embark on massive, destructive projects like war. The book is more than just a work of advocacy for Bitcoin; it’s also about the relationships people have with money. The author proposes some intriguing ways in which Bitcoin, this “trustless, decentralized, and permissionless technology” could impact the world. Remove the power of groups like central banks to control money and, the argument goes, individuals can flourish in more free, productive ways. While Rogers reiterates the usual arguments against fiat currencies (like inflation), he also addresses impacts on the populace—for instance, he suggests that cryptocurrency could make absurdities like banks that are “too big to fail” obsolete. Portions of the text are dense and unwieldy: “Bitcoin offers the potential to free ourselves from the parasitic financial leeches draining the lifeblood from the economic body of humanity.” Ultimately, though, readers will come away with much to consider regarding how a technology like Bitcoin could be used to change the world for the better.",

    "description": "Lisa Owens, whose fiance’s death was never solved because of police ineptitude, became a cop, in large part, to make sure that others never experienced the pain and uncertainty that she did. Now she’s an overworked homicide detective whose boss is desperately trying to get her to focus on developing a personal life, apart from her career. Owens does take time off—and uses it to investigate the brutal killing of her best friend, Dorothy Jensen, a beloved mentor who was her middle school teacher years earlier. The retired educator lived in a condo on Stypman Island, a haven for people escaping the cold winters of the northern United States, where she was found beheaded with her eyes and tongue cut out. The meticulous Owens eventually joins forces with local cop Kim Witherspoon, whose law enforcement experience has been nothing short of nightmarish, as she’s been forced to work for a sexist, antigay, and morally bankrupt chief of police. The two women soon discover that Owens’ best friend’s murder is linked to drug trafficking, blackmail, and multiple other deaths. Numerous noteworthy elements fuel Foley’s narrative, including an impressively diverse cast of secondary characters, including a politician with twisted sexual proclivities, a naïve marine biologist, and a sleazy realtor. They effectively flesh out the multilayered mystery, and the author also explores environmental issues, such as global warming and marine plastic pollution, with subtlety and compassion. Infrequent moments of social commentary add brass-knuckle impact, as well: “He’s greedy, he doesn’t believe in climate change, he’s a racist, a misogynist, and he’s homophobic…He’s like half the men in Florida.”",
