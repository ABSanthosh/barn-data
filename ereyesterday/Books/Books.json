    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/rob-carpenter/of-kennedy-king/",
    "description": "As America reels with racial injustice, war, and political upheaval, the story alternates between snapshots of the two figures’ personal and political struggles. Kennedy—aka RFK, or, as some call his politically ruthless incarnation, “Bad Bobby”—is profoundly transformed by his brother John F. Kennedy’s assassination. He publicly pushes for civil rights reforms while also secretly investigating conspiracy theories about JFK’s death​. RFK’s political aspirations overlap with the struggle for racial justice and lead to a tense but working relationship with King, who often finds Kennedy’s efforts on race insufficient. Meanwhile, King struggles to bear the burden of leading the civil rights movement. Threats loom on all sides, from violent white supremacists to conflicts among activists. Increasingly exhausted, King’s prophetic instincts foreshadow his own tragic killing. Kennedy’s presidential campaign makes groundbreaking efforts to connect with Black voters, even agreeing to a politically risky meeting with the Black Panthers​. The novel culminates in his June assassination. Carpenter uses colloquial language and rich inner monologues to paint a detailed picture of two men with a shared vision of justice. Their struggles are effectively shown to be both personal and political: Kennedy yearns to move beyond his privileged detachment, and King finds the responsibility of being America’s moral conscience to be enormously heavy. The moral thrust of the novel takes a page from King’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail​” in its assertion that white moderates slowed progress on civil rights. Yet, despite the novel’s successful depiction of the era’s tense, sweat-drenched atmosphere of violence and political maneuvering, the novel may leave readers wondering whether it adds insight or merely revisits already well-documented events, especially as much of this historical ground was already covered in David Margolick’s 2018 nonfiction book The Promise and the Dream and elsewhere.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/flos-nullius/epitaph-proven/",
    "description": "Vaharja, the Recordkeeper, is one of the “phantasmal” Elegies (immortal, instinct-driven entities). Though she’s no longer human, she’s recently shared an experience with a mortal named Gyer. He’s a government operative in the colony of Golem who’s wanted for treason; as he fishes in a “quaint lake,” Vaharja tells him of the Elegies’ origin. The story involves an Elegy who consumed a woman’s body and was reborn as a human one thousand years later, which wasn’t so long ago in this narrative’s timeline. Vaharja’s tale ultimately centers around Liarua Fora, who’s part of a small group of people volunteering to join the Forerunners of Golem, a branch of Golem’s government. What starts as a tour of a building turns into a harrowing ordeal as Liarua and others fight off terrifying creatures and contend with a mysterious energy that infects and mutates humans. This leads to a climax involving Liarua’s fellow volunteers and FOG associates, as well as Gyer and, of course, Vaharja. The cast and corresponding subplots of Nullius’ sophomore series entry are abundant—some characters will pop into the story with few or no traits described. Narrative perspectives frequently shift, from that of an android (with an “almost human-level autonomy”) to one of the infected, to a member of a cyberterrorist organization trying to recruit someone. It’s the enthralling mystery that truly drives the story—what part in all of this does the “shadowy” group Scion Finis play, and will the reincarnated Elegy remember who she is/was? There’s copious technology in scientifically advanced Golem, though most of it is familiar (a portis is simply a mobile device). But most of Golem feels otherworldly, given the immortals, vicious beasts, and the curious fact that Gyer regularly converses with Vaharja, who easily reads and records his thoughts.",
