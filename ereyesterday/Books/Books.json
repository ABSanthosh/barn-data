    "description": "At the turn of the 21st century, three United States Navy nuclear submarines vanished, and only two were recovered by Naval Intelligence. The third, a massive Ohio-class sub, finally turned up in Barranquilla, Colombia, stashed inside a grotto in the Magdalena River. It appeared that some Navy admirals, possibly with Russian collusion, planned to sell the subs to cartels, facilitating the movement of tons of illegal drugs. CI5 agent Pat Coonan (also known as Agent Delta) is given orders to “discreetly eliminate” the traitors. His boss, Col. Marlon Berkowitz, presents the job as simple: Dispense with the treasonous Admiral Fullerton, as well as the Russian mercenaries guarding the sub. But Pat’s old nemesis is involved, the guards might be undercover agents of the Russian intelligence agency GRU, and even Putin himself may be embroiled. Pat’s further distracted by his new partner; Karina Reyes, head of the Triple K group, is contracted to send a message of deterrence by blowing up the sub, but Pat can’t keep his eyes off of her legs. Once onboard, a shocking discovery is made—the sub is loaded with ICBMs. Ortiz’s book works best in the context of its series; events from other installments are alluded to but not explained, such as a “waggish incident between the blonde-haired Jessica and the Triple K group’s gay operator back in Aruba.” (Asterisks also repeatedly direct readers to Ortiz’ different works.) This story doesn’t have a high quotient of suspense or action as Pat encounters surprisingly few obstacles. Ruthless killer Nina Tetriak merely hands him a note, and only a U.S. government agent points a gun at Pat—in error. Pat’s narrative musings are the main focus, so readers’ engagement with his persona (jaded, computer-illiterate, “phallocratic”) will likely determine their overall enjoyment. Ortiz does provide intriguing information on many subjects, including the “one hundred and seventy meters long by thirteen meters wide” Ohio-class submarines, pencil detonators “color-coded to indicate their delay time,” and even algae (“more than thirty thousand known species”).",

    "description": "Jones is an officer in the Canadian Navy deployed to Kandahar, Afghanistan, as one of the small number of Canadians there taking part in the American-led Operation Enduring Freedom. He is a drone operator, charged with eliminating enemy combatants from afar, guided less by moral restraint than a diligent regard for the rules of engagement. His superior Bell is less cautious and pines to let the bombs fly, almost killing a young boy they nickname Sahar (they nickname most of their targets) for the crime of suspiciously filling a sack with potatoes. Everywhere, Jones sees the ravages of war and violence (he witnesses a woman savagely stoned for her alleged adultery) and wrestles with the toll all of this exacts on his soul. (“I have forgotten how to human.”) He becomes the caretaker of a bizarre man he meets on base—he is not a soldier and resembles some sort of “tremendous gorilla-bear.” Jones nicknames him Bigfoot, though his actual name is Noah. Keeping Noah safe and hidden from the authorities is foolishly imprudent, but it’s an act of moral compassion that feels redemptive to Jones. The author artfully juxtaposes the ugly and the beautiful in war—his protagonist falls in love with Jen, his major, but military rules prevent him from even hugging her; real romance is replaced by discreet “chess games.” Meanwhile, a rapist targets the men on base, tasing the soldiers into submission before he violates them. The author’s prose sometimes falters, trying too hard for some creative amalgam of clever and moving—when Jones encounters a terrible scene, he thinks to himself, “No—not like this. No. No NO NO NO. Rewind, damnit—rewind!” However, the strength of the novel is its unflinching look at the absurdity of modern war, which reduces the destruction of human beings to a video game; the chilling senselessness of this is intelligently captured. This is a disturbing work of fiction, but a worthwhile one.",
