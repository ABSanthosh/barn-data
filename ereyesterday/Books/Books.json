    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/chad-lewis/the-persuasion-game/",
    "description": "Although candidate Donald Trump “vowed to drain the influence peddling swamp in Washington, DC,” author Lewis asserts in the book’s introduction, “he did the exact opposite” as president. Particularly egregious is the administration’s intermingling of corporate and foreign interests, which, the author says, benefited many with access to the Oval Office. As an advisor to the president, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani ran a “parallel version of the State Department,” according to Lewis, which leveraged his connections to develop ties with regimes in Turkey, Russia, and Venezuela. The author asserts that Guiliani and his associates skirted regulations that had been in place since the 1930s passage of the Foreign Agents Registration Act and adopted autocratic tactics inside the American political system. Per the book’s convincing analysis, the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection was a “natural outcome of the never-ending persuasion games that occurred during Trump’s presidency,” as the administration effectively created an alternate reality via disinformation that played upon his supporters’ worst fears and biases. Lewis, a global traveler who once resided in Russia, writes that he first noticed early signs of what he deemed to be Russian interference in American politics after seeing social media accounts parrot “Putin’s talking points” with “English grammar mistakes common for Russian speakers.” Although the author doesn’t hold back on its critiques of Trump administration tactics, his book’s main strength is its painstaking research, which yielded more than 3,000 endnotes. There’s also a laudable dedication to accessibility, as readers unacquainted with the nuances of contemporary geopolitics will find this book’s explanations clear and concise. To that end, Lewis supplements his engaging narrative with a wealth of charts, reproductions of primary sources, textbox vignettes, and other visual elements. A comprehensive timeline of cited administration connections to Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, and Venezuela appears in a useful appendix.",

    "title": "THE ROSE BOOK",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/phaidon-editors/the-rose-book/",
    "description": "With more than 200 color images and five essays, this sumptuous volume celebrates an iconic flower. Introduced by Kristine Paulus, collection development librarian at the New York Botanical Garden, essays include fashion historian Amy de La Haye’s overview of roses in clothing design; a piece by Victoria Gaiger, editor at Rakesprogress magazine, examining the use of roses in perfumes; and floral designer Shane Connolly’s consideration of the language of a flower long associated with goddesses of love. Rose, Gaiger discovered, the favorite scent of Marie Antoinette, later became a prominent note in Paul Poiret’s La Rose de Rosine and Chanel’s famous No. 5. Although the red rose has endured as a symbol of affection—notably, of course, on Valentine’s Day—Connolly reveals that roses of other hues send subtle messages, too. Michael Marriott, chairman of the Historic Roses Group, offers a glossary of rose types—damasks and floribundas, ramblers and rugosas, among many others. The blossom Sappho called “the queen of flowers” originated more than 30 million years ago and contains more than 150 wild species and tens of thousands of cultivars. Beloved by Greeks, Romans, and throughout the ancient world, the rose inspired festivals that still continue. Among the book’s images is a fragile gold and glass floral wreath dated to the third or second century B.C.E. Featured, as well, are delicate botanical drawings and paintings by a wide range of artists, including Vincent van Gogh, William Morris, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustav Klimt, Georgia O’Keeffe, and Salvador Dalí. Fashion plates display the creations of designers such as Christian Dior, Elsa Schiaparelli, Charles Worth, and Alexander McQueen. Not least, Ian Hamilton Finlay’s screenprint on tile takes as its motif Gertrude Stein’s famous line of poetry, “A rose is a rose is a rose.” Perhaps it’s all that needs saying.",
