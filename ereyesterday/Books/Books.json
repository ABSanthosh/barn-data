    "description": "Fifteen months after cult leader Patrick Nye ended his group’s hostage-taking at a theatrical gala by detonating bombs that killed 43 people, the case is ready to go to trial—with one hitch. John Horner, a senior advocate to the Crown Prosecution Service, needs someone to comb through the material that’s been excluded from the mountain of evidence to be presented in court to make sure that none of it is relevant, potentially complicating or weakening the case and risking its dismissal. The task falls to Eve Wren, who’s been working for the CPS since getting canned from a Shropshire law firm when the senior colleague she blew the whistle on blamed her for his mistakes. So, this time, Eve has every motive to be extra careful. If only that were equally true of DCS Seth Strutton, the senior investigating officer, and DS Gary Lees, the officer in charge. In the absence of their firm support, Eve soldiers on, sifting through box after box of potential evidence, unaware that a series of flashbacks to the fatal event are providing more and more information that would be incredibly useful to her. At length she discovers a burner phone that can’t be accounted for by any tallies of the phones used by the group or their victims, and the messages on that phone, which originally sound pretty bland, turn out to be damning. It’s right around then that Eve’s troubles begin to intensify to a boiling point.",

    "title": "SUMMER WITH SUNIL",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/alison-lister/summer-with-sunil-lorimer-real-love/",
    "description": "Sixteen-year-old trans boy Dominic is trapped on a boring vacation in tiny Liverpool, Nova Scotia, with his parents. But his summer takes a positive turn when he meets the captivating Sunil, a genderqueer teenager who’s staying in the beachfront cottage next door. The two soon develop a friendship—and maybe something more. Dominic spends the first quarter of the book being bored, and readers can’t blame him. The few conflicts that arise belong almost exclusively to Sunil, and even the climactic scenes feel small. Dominic’s character arc is flat, and any areas for potential growth (such as a comment that his mother isn’t “disabled or anything” due to her multiple sclerosis) don’t pay off. The prose succeeds at being accessible to reluctant readers but is otherwise unremarkable and is dotted with cliched phrases and tediously detailed descriptions. With that said, readers specifically looking for a fluffy romance about transgender teens might find something to appreciate in this story: Dominic and Sunil’s relationship is gentle and charming, and they are easy to root for. The novel also contains a much-needed depiction of teens who both know that they are queer and are still figuring some things out. Dominic is white, and Sunil is biracial, with a white dad and South Asian mom.",
