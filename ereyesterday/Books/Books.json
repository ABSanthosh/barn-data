    "title": "ENCOUNTERS WITH JAMES BALDWIN",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/stella-dadzie/encounters-with-james-baldwin/",
    "description": "This year marks the centenary of the birth of James Baldwin, an essayist and novelist whose reputation seems only to grow by the year. “Long before terms like ‘intersectionality’ and ‘non-binary’ entered our common parlance, Baldwin recognised the complex ambiguities that define our sexual identity,” writes activist and educator Stella Dadzie in her introduction. “His bequest to future generations was a fierce abhorrence of injustice and an equally fierce belief in the enduring power of love.” This anthology collects essays and poems inspired by Baldwin’s life and work from people who knew him personally or simply came to know him through his writing. Lindsay Barrett recalls meeting the author in Paris, where the famous Baldwin complimented him on a piece he had published and offered to read a draft of his novel. Nii Ayikwei Parkes writes about first discovering Baldwin “when I needed him, in a library in Reading, after a newspaper round on the same foldable green bike that I had ridden into a busy traffic intersection when I felt my father leave the earth.” Scholars like Toyin Agbetu and Michelle Yaa Asantewa excavate the worldview that underpinned Baldwin’s writing, while poets including Roy McFarlane and Ewuare X. Osayande grapple with his ideas in verse. The book also contains numerous photographs of Baldwin from various periods of his life. The pieces are numerous and relatively short, treating the reader to a sampling of perspectives on Baldwin that demonstrate his profound influence not only on writers but also on various academic fields and artistic media. Uniting them is Baldwin’s belief that, despite the tragedies of the past and present, there may still be a bright future ahead. As Parkes writes, “His essays carried and still carry more hope in the world than I have, and I desperately needed hope.”",

    "title": "SPIRITUS EX MACHINA",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lc-von-hessen/spiritus-ex-machina/",
    "description": "In “The Contagion,” the Dreiyer family’s annual road trip includes a stop at a bed-and-breakfast—that’s where 7-year-old Sylvia peeks into a trunk of dolls, one of which, she swears, moves on its own. Decades later, when looking for inspiration for a TV show she’s working on, she returns to the inn and makes a startling discovery. Von Hessen’s 14 stories herein tackle such diverse subgenres as the undead, body horror, and something more Lovecraftian (“Spectral Golem”), but there’s a discernible theme of identity that runs throughout the book. Characters interrogate their pasts; the narrator of “The Patent-Master” travels to an island coastal town, where the discovery of their late mother’s former profession is the first of many surprises. In one of the collection’s highlights, “The Obscurantist,” Brooklyn-based Andrei’s lifelong obsession with a girl who once appeared on an obscure variety show ultimately leads him down a dark path. These tales are bleak, forgoing humor and zeroing in on individuals who find themselves in miserable, appalling, or lethal circumstances. A few of the entries dive deep into visceral and grotesque imagery; one that’s sure to turn stomachs is “Roscoe’s Malefic Delights,” which is about a newly opened eatery with only one item on its menu: These “delights” (“reminiscent of blood-drained white worms or skinned, flattened rats’ tails or stringy strips of tripe”) definitely don’t look appetizing, but their appearance may not be their worst attribute. In every chilling moment and unexpected turn, the author’s prose is nothing short of intoxicating—unforgettable passages equate one man with “the human embodiment of a prolonged sigh”; a “sloshing” akin to a “half-empty jar of preserves” describes something that ideally shouldn’t be making that sound.",
