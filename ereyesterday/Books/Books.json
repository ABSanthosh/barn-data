    "description": "This exuberant rhyming ode to reading is primed to get kids excited about the wonders awaiting them between the pages of a book. As the authors wisely point out, books are perfect anytime, anywhere—and they’re for everyone. Readers are encouraged to give books as gifts, to share them with friends and family, and even to write and illustrate their own books. Savor them at bedtime, too. There are even options for the youngest kids—board books with flaps to lift and mirrors adorning the pages so that tiny listeners can admire and make faces at themselves. Just like readers, books vary in appearance and type—long, short, hard, soft, and everything in between. And who says books must only be read? Some books even help us sing. Best of all, you don’t have to buy books: Public libraries offer them for free! Return what you finish, then borrow more—as often as you like. What’s a better deal than that? If this book doesn’t turn kids into ardent readers, nothing will. Besides the bouncy, jubilant verses, the energetic illustrations will do the trick, brimming with ebullient colors and featuring a cast of spirited readers, diverse in terms of both race and age.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ginger-park/sukas-farm/",
    "description": "Kwan lives on a quiet mountainside in 1941. Whether his family eats depends on what his father, a woodcarver, and his mother, a painter, can sell at the farmers market. After Kwan overhears his parents worrying over the lack of food in their onggi pot, he ignores their warnings to stay away from Suka’s Farm and approaches the old Japanese man for a job, introducing himself as Aoki—his legally assigned Japanese name. Cantankerous Mr. Suka initially turns Kwan down but finally lets him help care for the goats. Bit by bit, Kwan chips away at Mr. Suka’s harsh exterior with persistence and kindness that the old man eventually returns. Kwan solidifies Mr. Suka’s respect when he recovers the goats after they go missing, and Mr. Suka asks Kwan to tell him his real, Korean name. The well-paced narrative artfully weaves in Korean terms and cultural references, such as the children’s song “Santoki,” which Kwan’s parents sing on the way to market and Kwan whistles to entice the goats. Chen uses soft washes and blends of bright colors to bring warmth to the detailed landscapes and cartoon portraits. In an authors’ note, the Parks explain that they drew inspiration from their father’s experiences working on a goat farm as a child.",
