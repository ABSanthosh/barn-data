    "description": "After a short prologue that finds Nathan Liddle helpless “as a bug on its back” and expecting to be killed at any moment by his beautiful wife, Eve Thayer, a psychiatrist, the story flashes back three weeks to the couple’s strained marriage. While their new baby, Rosewyn, is the proverbial bundle of joy, her needs and bouts of ill health add strain to their relationship. So does Nathan’s careless extramarital affair with a free-spirited woman named Nicole. A parallel plot thread follows Det. Rita Myers and her handling of multiple local crimes. The two threads converge when Rosewyn is kidnapped from the home of babysitter Barbara Singleton. For a while, suspicion falls on Donald Barry—a disgruntled patient of Eve’s—and his wife, Gail, but some strange additional twists widen the circle of suspects. The surprise return of the baby doesn’t solve the original crime; it just deepens the mystery. Parlato’s thriller is breezy but a bit muddled, full of feints, shadowy suspicion, and an 11th-hour murder. Short chapters ricochet among the first-person perspectives of Eve, Nathan, and Rita, making for a quick read and giving the illusion of pace. Both Eve and Rita commiserate about their jobs and their struggles to achieve the elusive work-life balance, Eve with her old friend Rachel and Rita with her brother Danny. The overall effect resembles a Lifetime thriller: half skillfully executed soap opera, half diffuse whodunit.",

    "description": "London-based chef Paul Delamare is depressed by the death of his lover, Marcus, who left him a charming cottage in Belgravia, and unhappy that one of Marcus’ relatives is harassing him. But Paul’s friend Julie, a food editor, gets him work at her magazine and keeps his spirits up. Paul has long been friends with Christian Wagner, a self-obsessed celebrity chef fallen on hard times. Because Christian has broken his arm, Paul—who’s too nice for his own good—agrees to fill in for him with the intensive beginners’ course he’s supposed to lead at the posh Chester Square Cookery School, located in a mansion where Christian lives as well as teaches. The students are naturally disappointed that Christian isn’t teaching, but the oddly mixed group members all seem to appreciate Paul’s first lesson on knife techniques. On his way to work the next morning, Paul sees that the glass door to Christian’s flat is smashed—and when he goes in to investigate, he finds Christian with his head nearly hacked off by the cleaver Paul had used in class the day before, and promptly faints. A Chester Square employee finds Paul passed out and calls the police. Since the students want the classes to continue, a shaky Paul carries on even though he senses that the police suspect him for his knife skills. Paul slowly learns more about the students and things he never knew about Christian. When one of his students dies, Paul realizes that he’d better uncover the killer before the police pin the murders on him—and his determined search to unravel the serpentine puzzle may be just what he needs to restart his life.",
