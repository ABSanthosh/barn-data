    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jenny-valentine/a-girl-called-joy/",
    "description": "Finding the silver lining in every situation has been the hallmark of Joy Applebloom’s personality. In Valentine’s series opener, Joy is moving “home” to the U.K., somewhere she’s never been, along with her 13-year-old sister, Claude, and her mum and dad. They’re leaving Zanzibar to go live with their injured granddad, a big change after being in places like Mumbai, Hanoi, and Mexico City. Granddad is settled in his ways, but slowly Joy figures out ways to spend time with him and even make him laugh. When she enters formal schooling for the very first time as a 10-year-old, despite being “genuinely, properly all geared up for it,” she struggles to cope in this “silver-lining-free zone,” with its unfamiliar routines and social codes. But Joy, who’s cued white, finally meets a British Jamaican boy named Benny; they bond over the beauty of the old oak tree growing in the playground, which gives her hope again. But when the oak is threatened by plans to build a new school, Joy and Benny are galvanized into action. Told from Joy’s first-person point of view, the storytelling is clever and funny while dealing with age-appropriate challenges. Lefevre’s clean and imaginative black-and-white illustrations are scattered throughout this relatable and charming story.",

    "description": "Returning to the U.K. to live with Granddad continues to bring new experiences. When Joy’s teacher goes on medical leave for a knee replacement, the new teacher, Mr. Suarez, surprises the class with his exuberance. Joy, who reads white, and best friend Benny, who’s Black, want to befriend new student Phoebe, but Joy worries that her efforts are coming across as annoying. The people in Joy’s inner circle have all sorts of new things going on in their lives—a new executive chef job for her dad, a new boyfriend for her sister (“and a new favorite word, which is PRIVACY”), a new love of gardening for Granddad, and new contact lenses for Benny to replace his glasses. To top it all off, Joy notices signs that her family might be moving again. Having put down roots, Joy is “quietly working on remembering the silver linings” of her old life, when she was home-schooled and traveled around to interesting new places. “Planet Joy,” as Claude terms it, is still as optimistic a place as ever; Joy still believes that life is “crammed full of upsides and silver linings and surprises.” This uplifting story explores bumps in the road without being patronizing. Joy’s comical and clever narration is delightful and is enhanced by charming illustrations.",
