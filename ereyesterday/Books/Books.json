    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ankit-panda/the-new-nuclear-age/",
    "description": "This timely book delves into a host of issues connected to nuclear weapons, with conclusions that are, to say the least, disturbing. Panda, who has extensive experience as a writer and government adviser specializing in military geopolitics, brings a great deal of research material to the task, combining historical information with novel insights. He notes that strategic deterrence kept the peace during the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, backed up with an underpinning structure of treaties and agreements. Most of these have become redundant, while China has vastly increased its nuclear arsenal. Panda believes that this could push the U.S. into upgrading its own stockpile, sparking a three-cornered arms race. He also devotes important attention to the potential for conflict between India and Pakistan, which is often overlooked in the West. Then there are wild cards, notably Iran and North Korea. They show scant regard for international nonproliferation rules and are pouring resources into nukes and missiles to carry them. Along the way, Panda examines new delivery systems such as hypersonic glide vehicles and long-range cruise missiles, which add another layer of volatility. Several countries have lower-yield nuclear weapons for battlefield operations, but their use could easily escalate into strategic strikes. Panda is concerned that deterrence might be no longer sufficient to ensure peace, although he does not see any real alternatives. He suggests that the big powers could establish avenues to defuse incidents that might spin out of control, but these would need to be overseen outside the public spotlight. Most of all, some fresh thinking and awareness among policymakers are required. Panda’s book is a good place to start.",

    "description": "As soon as Daniel Brooker turns 18 years old, he heads to the Department of Designated Dates to find out when he will die of natural causes; in this peculiar alternate reality provocatively conjured by the author, anyone can procure this information (a technological instrument called a “gizmotron” makes this possible) if they so choose. To his astonishment and despair, Daniel finds out that he will die when he is only 27 years old and commences a life of endless dissipation—a “slow descent into fuckuppery.” Like most “shorters,” he forms friends with his own kind: Naomi is a hippie doomed to die at 25 and Brian is a drug dealer whose life will end at 34. Daniel becomes, in the opinion of his father, a “dumbass with no direction,” an addict lost in the haze of drug abuse, though still heroically clinging to some semblance of moral dignity. The author perspicaciously imagines the kind of world that would arise from this grim knowledge, one split between Gnostics—those who believe one should choose not to know, to avoid the terrible psychic cost of such information—and Watersons, religious zealots who believe an early death is a sure sign of moral turpitude and an expression of God’s disfavor. Daniel descends from a family of Gnostics but feels compelled to know his lifespan nevertheless, and that information proves crushing to him, an invitation to see his existence as essentially pointless (a moral predicament intelligently conveyed by Fletcher).  At the heart of this fascinating novel is the moral meaning of one’s mortality. Everyone in this strange world will perish, but those who expect long lives can postpone a wrenching reflection on their finitude. Shorters like Daniel are not afforded such luxury; unable to cope at so young an age with such weighty issues, he devotes himself to chasing oblivion. The allure of knowing, the author makes clear, is overwhelming, but the consequences can be existentially devastating. Fletcher poignantly captures Daniel’s unenviable plight; here, he succumbs to sadness when Naomi dies on schedule: “I felt so insignificant. I am so tired of being alive. The fucking rat race. We’re just a bunch of worthless fucks scraping for meaning in a cold remorseless world. Holding onto each other as we disparate. Searching for meaning where there is none.” This literarily plain, even cliched writing style is maintained throughout the entire novel—the absence of any poetic spark is the principal failing of this otherwise stirring work. The tale is told from Daniel’s perspective, in the first person, and so this ends up working—he sounds just like any wounded young man would, if more intelligent than most. In place of stylized prose, a verisimilitude is impressively achieved. A thoughtful rumination on human mortality is achieved as well, one that cannily investigates the wages of too much knowledge.",
