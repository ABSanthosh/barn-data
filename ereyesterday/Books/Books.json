    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/mackenzie-angeconeb/the-fragments-that-remain/",
    "description": "Born in Canada just 12 months apart to a “young urban Indigenous couple full of dreams,” Alexander and Andria struggle with self-worth and identity in this debut by Anishinaabekweauthor Angeconeb. The “honorary twins,” Andy the painter and Ally the poet, are mirrors of each other, but despite their close connection, they keep their struggles with emptiness hidden. Andy feels like “a hollow shell,” and Ally is consumed by addiction. The first section focuses on Andy’s feelings, relayed in vignettes and letters that begin “Dear Brother,” as she describes watching Ally succumb to addiction. Unable to cope following his overdose death, she pushes friends away. After she discovers a shoebox of Ally’s poems, she’s confronted with the depth of his pain. The second section shifts to Ally’s perspective, revealing his internal battles through his poetry: “i have no identity, / no sense of self.” In the final section, Andy begins to face the weight of her grief, her feelings of powerlessness, and the ways she and her older brother lived through one another. She embarks on a healing journey, finding strength through friends and connecting with her cultural heritage across generations of colonial cultural dislocation. This introspective, character-driven novel in which events are relayed after the fact moves slowly, offering a powerful exploration of identity and trauma through its emotional depth.",

    "description": "The story begins in the year 1831 of the Lucretian Era, a very early indication that this novel involves multiple layers of complex worldbuilding. Yamir Varro, the chief neuroscientist at Connectome Labs, has uploaded a copy ofhis brain into the android Y1, who narrates approximately a third of the novel in journallike “Logfiles.” Initially, Y1 longs for the company of Yamir’s wife, who refuses to interact with an android, and he regrets how he treated his college-aged son: “I missed so many of his milestones—losing his first baby tooth, playing his first game of stickball, shaving for the first time—because I was always at work.” Yamir is a pioneer, and his lab is on the verge of a major breakthrough, butthe world’s largest organized religion, The Temple, does not endorse his work. Olma, the Temple’s science and technology supervisor, is tasked with monitoring all emerging research that falls outside the faith’s strictures, and the novel closely follows her progress in its early stages. The tension soon ratchets up as Yamir’s lab is sold by Grady Leos, its owner, to the Temple and the androids are tasked with forced labor on a Martian settlement, as the Temple believes their leader, El, wants humans to eventually populate the red planet. What follows is a power struggle that pits the desires of Y1, Yamir and his family, and Olma against one another in an often thrilling narrative. The thoughtful, depressed android is an intriguing central character throughout. However, his logfiles are often overly and off-puttingly technical—“The repairs to the ASV3 aren’t going well. Zaltana replaced the leg destroyed by the explosion with one taken from the ASV2, but not every input aligns”—as well as occasionally repetitive. The close third-person narration following Yamir and Olma also relies on frequent scene-setting to remind readers of the stakes involved, which can, at times, become tiresome. Still, the central story and frequent twists will keep engaged readers hooked to the end.",
