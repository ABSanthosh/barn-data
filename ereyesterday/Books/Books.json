    "description": "One day, Dustin is planning to spend an epic summer in Japan with his baseball team, playing the sport he loves more than anything. The next, he’s at the funeral of his 20-year-old cousin, a college baseball player with an undetected heart condition. There, Dustin meets Andrea, and despite his negative first impressions, they grow close. In the coming months, Dustin and Andrea attend several more funerals together, leaning on one another as they navigate the deceased people’s different ends. A constant undercurrent in this story of loss is how Dustin’s life as a baseball player and the culture of the sport influence the way he engages with the world. This verse novel for reluctant readers doubles as a love letter to baseball—a game that, like life and death, connects people. The beauty in Wolf’s word choices and in his poems’ line breaks creates an emotional tone that beckons to readers, inviting them to reflect on their own mortality and place in the world. Song titles make up the titles of the poems, inviting readers on a musical journey. Major characters present white.",

    "description": "As a framework for his detailed advice on navigating the real estate business (in particular the practice of “flipping”—buying a distressed property, rehabbing it, and selling it for a profit), the author offers his “M.B.P.E.” method, which he modestly describes as “a waterfall of energy that will lead you to a revolutionary change as a human being, in your relationships with others, in your work and business.” The letters stand for “morning” (Iasiello emphasizes the importance of getting up very early every day), “prayer” (which he claims will “help you feel less lonely), “biohacking” (which is “regulating one’s body and mind through breathing, healthy food, supplements and proper use of sleep”), and “exercise” (which is important “because your mental and physical state is the first step towards getting results in real estate and life in general”). After making these clarifications, the author’s emphasis shifts almost entirely away from “life in general” to real estate as Iasiello explains the basics of his business to newcomers looking to start on their own. “In most cases when flipping real estate, your product is money, delivered quickly and smoothly,” he writes, with the kind of knowing directness that characterizes the whole book. “Your ideal client is someone who lives in your target neighborhood, needs money fast, and is willing to sacrifice some of the value of their home to get cash.” The author is pleasingly blunt when discussing everything from pre-foreclosures to evictions to absentee homeowners and the details of probate. He gives wise and easy-to-follow advice on how to spot likely properties, how to find buyers (“the engine that will keep your investment potential alive”), how to craft effective networks and ads, and dozens of other related topics. His narrative energy also applies to his life advice, but most readers will be coming here for the real estate tips, and they’ll be well rewarded.",
