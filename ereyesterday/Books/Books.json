    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-booras/green-of-each-window/",
    "description": "A married man (generously called Adonis) engages in various sexual escapades with a parade of different women. Readers begin the story knowing that Adonis has died, and the author uses a variety of different formats to tell the story of his downfall. These include poetry, short prose, quotes (some of which are in French), and scripts (for both screen and stage). Each section is paired with a particular song that is meant to “run parallel to the works but not in real time, not in sync.” These songs are listed in small blocks throughout, while a separate companion book titled Crystalline Green includes a playlist with additional poems, plays, and song tracks that accompany Adonis’ journey. The songs range from mainstream (“Run This Town” by JAY-Z) to more obscure (“A Forest” by Clan of Xymox). Characters and scenarios throughout both volumes include the mundane (employees working at an office) and the fantastical (God massaging someone’s feet; the Devil surfing). Booras occasionally crafts some truly thought-provoking passages: “This is why I prefer foreplay to sex. This is why I write more than I live.” Unfortunately, there’s not a relatable character to be found; Adonis’ immaturity is downright alienating. While Thaïs, his married colleague and “true love” is in the hospital, for example, Adonis explains that he cheated on her because, “You were sick.” Intense eroticism (“I penetrate myself / so I may feel what you feel”) alternates with performative introspection (“Have I not invented this pain? / This cock that bends / toward sadness / like a flower made heavy by rain?”). This results in a text that’s essentially an overblown ode to maleness. The experimental form is unique—but, like its main character, the book does little to endear itself to readers.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/nicola-hanefeld/the-unspeakable-breaking-my-familys-silence-surrounding-the-holocaust/",
    "description": "Now living in Germany, Hanefeld, who was born in 1958, grew up in England with her English mother and Czech father. The six relatives she knew on her father’s side were her grandparents, an aunt, and a great-uncle and great-aunt, who’d all resettled in England. The family never spoke of their background, and it was only in her late teens that Hanefeld realized they were German-speaking Czech Jews who fled their homeland just before the start of World War II. In 2004, a year before her father’s death, he unexpectedly sent her his aunt’s 1935 passport with a note that she and other close relatives, whom the family never mentioned, were murdered in concentration camps in German-occupied Czechoslovakia. That document prompted her to undertake a painstaking investigation, aided by family correspondence, her own fluency in German, and historical archives. As she tells of how she reconstructed the stories of her relatives’ lives, Hanefeld details some of her own memories and the emotional impact of her discoveries. After providing some background with a family-tree diagram, she devotes a chapter to each of 16 people, concluding with a dialogue between herself and her first cousin about the family’s legacy of silence, followed by an epilogue; she also includes a timeline and an extensive list of references. Overall, this is not a dramatic, novelistic memoir; at times, the narrative is slowed by excessive detail, and at others, the author summarizes and speculates when research couldn’t fill in gaps. However, her stories effectively reveal her family members as businesspeople, lawyers, homemakers, and students with everyday, unremarkable concerns, and, intriguingly, that appears to be Hanefeld’s point: “This is the quieter, less dramatic side of the Holocaust, but it too deserves attention,” and “the impact of personal narratives is greater than speaking abstractly about the vast numbers of people murdered.” She also discusses salient questions of identity, and how suppressed trauma can affect succeeding generations.",
