    "description": "Since his death in 1977, there has been no shortage of books about Elvis Presley, and each generally attempts to provide new insights into the legendary performer. Gibson is no different, in that she makes the claim that Presley’s sense of style matched his sometimes introverted, sometimes confident personality, both on- and offstage, whether he wore blue suede shoes, black leather pants, or bedazzled leisure suits. In other words, Gibson argues that one’s image, developed over time, can profoundly change one’s sense of identity and self-worth. Gibson certainly proves her thesis; however, in an age when images are so pervasive and research on the subject is so widespread, is this point in any way unique? The author, with jubilance and a conversational tone, believes it is; some readers may feel otherwise. Because of the narrow scope of her argument, the book largely becomes another linear historical survey of the entertainer’s life from his youth, when he thought he could become a caped superhero, to his death as a bloated, wasted shadow of his former self. Gibson names the looks that Elvis sported—from the “Young Pretender” and “Rockabilly Rebel” to the “Star-Spangled Superstar”—and how those styles influenced fans and future musicians, including k.d. lang, Harry Styles, and Lana Del Rey. Also included in the book are delightful photographs showing readers Elvis’ clothing styles, looks that Gibson explains chapter by chapter. Even with these images, though, much of the book reads like another straightforward chronology of a celebrity already revered by so many.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-barrett/the-greatest-us-opens/",
    "description": "Award-winning golf writer Barrett recounts in crisp, polished prose the stories of 20 U.S. Opens played at America’s toughest courses under the most difficult conditions. He begins in 1913 with amateur Francis Ouimet’s takedown playoff with England’s two finest professionals at The Country Club outside Boston. Barrett describes their play up close, with details that all golfers will enjoy. It was all amateur Bobby Jones in 1923 taking down the likes of Gene Sarazen and Walter Hagen to win his first U.S. Open in a playoff against Scotland’s Bobby Cruickshank before a crowd of 10,000. Throughout, Barrett provides excellent profiles of many players, like Cruickshank, whom readers might not be familiar with. In 1930, amateur Jones won his fourth U.S. Open, then retired at age 28. Two years later, Cruickshank would again contend but lose to Sarazen, who won his second Open by three strokes. Barrett neatly covers Ben Hogan’s miraculous comeback at Merion and the long-shot win by Jack Fleck at the fearsome Oakland Hills before reaching The King: Against a crowded, talented field, Arnold Palmer won his only Open in 1960 at Cherry Hills. At Oakmont the following year, he was beaten in a playoff by a young Jack Nicklaus. In 1973, Johnny Miller captured his Open by shooting a historic final-round 63. Tom Watson finally outlasted Nicklaus at Pebble Beach in 1982. Barrett closes his comprehensive book not with Brooks Koepka’s or Bryson DeChambeau’s multiple wins but with Jon Rahm, whose birdies at Torrey Pines’ last two holes brought victory.",
