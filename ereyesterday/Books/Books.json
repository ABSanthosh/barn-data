    "description": "Watts’ elegant sophomore novel follows Lewis, who’s from Arizona, and Australian Eloise—a married couple living in New York City—on a convoluted road trip through Nevada, California, Arizona, and Utah. The main purpose of the trip is to allow Eloise to study the Colorado River for her dissertation and give Lewis, who works for a foundation dedicated to land art, an opportunity to check on a project they’d been supporting. Quietly, Eloise also hopes their adventure will help her husband move through the grief of his mother’s death, which has been consuming their lives as he seeks out increasingly unorthodox ways to heal. While traveling across the barren landscape, Eloise begins to wonder if she’s pregnant. She struggles with whether to tell Lewis—who has never felt further away, despite their physical proximity—or if she should give in to her instinct to “continue to suspend [herself] in the amber of waiting.” The trip serves as the novel’s throughline while Eloise, the narrator, surfaces past memories and alludes to a very different present. The book is written in the second person as Eloise addresses Lewis, discussing their complicated marriage, love, art, death, climate change, wildfires, and America’s strange, dangerous, and expansive beauty, to name a few. Watts writes beautifully about grief, loneliness, and memory. One particularly poignant moment happens when Eloise realizes their future child will know their grandmother only through stories. She describes this as “an odd sort of mourning—grieving a future I didn’t know I’d even been so certain of.” This sorrowful knowing permeates the whole novel, which is less concerned with plot than with cataloging the couple’s relationship. Whether in love or nature, Watts’ prose artfully renders the mundane and majestic in equal measure.",

    "description": "Keira has fought and defeated powerful forces of evil in the past, but now she faces what may be the hardest battle of her life. She’s been targeted by the hired killers of the Artec corporation, which uses dead people to generate cheap electricity, “human batteries, condemned to writhe and scream and beg, without anyone ever seeing and knowing.” Keira and her friends have recently destroyed one of Artec’s plants and untethered the ghosts who’d been chained up in horrible pain. Living in the town of Blighty, her cottage is hidden in the cemetery, and she has the support of friends Mason and Zoe in her endeavors, but Artec’s getting closer to finding her. A visitor who makes her apprehensive turns out to be a local woman who wants Keira to check her home for ghosts. The place is ghost-free, but in the neglected garden of the house next door she finds ghosts who beg her for help in uncovering their killer, a distraction she must attend to. Keira, Zoe, and Mason’s plans to destroy Artec are aided by Mikhail, an Artec employee who fears for his life because Schaeffer, the ruthless head of the company, is killing off disloyal people, just as he’d killed Keira’s parents. When Mikhail reveals Artec’s new base, a decrepit shopping mall that hides offices buried deep underground, Keira, her friends, and the black cat that lives within her resolve to attack. The result is a horrifying life-and-death battle.",
