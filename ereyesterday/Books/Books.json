    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/danielle-prescod/the-rules-of-fortune/",
    "description": "Prescod made her literary debut with the memoir Token Black Girl (2022), about how growing up Black in a mostly white community in Connecticut led to depression, an estrangement from Black culture, and a serious eating disorder. A veteran of the fashion and beauty industries, she offers a unique perspective on both Black and white spaces, and her first novel reflects some of this hard-earned knowledge. Meet the Carter family: There’s patriarch William Carter, Jr., who rose from humble beginnings to become a self-made billionaire; his wife, Jacqueline, a former actress who chose a comfortable role as a wife and mother over the grind of the spotlight; loyal son Asher, who’s quietly flunking out of Harvard Business School; and daughter Kennedy, an aspiring filmmaker. The Carters are preparing to gather at their massive Martha’s Vineyard estate to celebrate William’s 70th birthday, and Kennedy has been working on a video about her father to be shown at the party. But self-made men often harbor secrets, and when William dies unexpectedly before the event can get underway, an uneasy Kennedy finds herself taking a closer look at her father’s past. She’s unable to stop chasing truths better left hidden, especially about William’s relationship with a mysterious friend called Kofi and their tangled ties to a development in Ghana. The setup is promising and story intriguing; readers will find themselves invested in how the Carters weather the storm of revelations. But Prescod spends too much time telling, not showing. Cliches worm their way into the story—at least two Carters vomit because they’re upset, for example—and the character development never reaches deeper than surface level.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/randy-boyagoda/little-sanctuary/",
    "description": "With their lives destabilized by war and a devastating sickness spreading, Sabel, who has “wood-coloured” skin, sits down with her family to share a last meal before leaving home. But instead of the family leaving together, Appa and Amma send the kids—Sabel, Reya, Theri, Verlane, and S’Jin—off on their own. After a turbulent and disorienting trek, they find themselves at an abandoned school on an island in another country with children from other unnamed “falling-down” places. These young people are called sugar diamonds; their powerful, “high-life” parents have used their connections—and lots of ghee, the new currency—to get them to some sort of safety. Now they’re to bide their time until a ship arrives in 10 days. But with circumstances becoming increasingly suspicious, it’s hard for them not to question whether their caretakers have other motivations. Boyagoda’s young readers’ debut explores themes of hope, belief, and resiliency. As details about the unraveling state of society are revealed, the story raises questions about and comparisons to past and present conflicts. Sabel is at the center of the narrative, but readers also hear directly from supporting characters—such as red-haired, green-eyed Chynoweth, a bookseller’s daughter who’s coerced into overseeing the children, and black-skinned Jaka, the eldest grandson of the “war-making man everyone called The General”—who nevertheless feel underdeveloped.",
