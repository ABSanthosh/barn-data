    "description": "Caro Ogunyemi works as an engineer aboard the spaceship Calamity, and there isn’t a piece of tech she can’t operate, repair, or hack. While her crew is on leave, she accepts a job to infiltrate Shikigami, a luxury prison planet for wealthy criminals operated by the Pierce family. Her mission is to find evidence that Carmichael Pierce has a secret lab at the prison where he’s using stolen tech to build supersoldiers out of unwilling test subjects. Caro’s shameful secret is that she worked for Pierce a decade ago, and she suspects some code she developed and attempted to destroy might be part of the supersoldier protocol. Once on planet, Caro learns that most of Pierce’s attempts to create supersoldiers have failed, with the exception of a terrifying specimen they call Leviathan—and her bungled attempt to infiltrate the prison puts her into a face-off with him. During the life-or-death fight, Caro discovers that her touch deactivates Leviathan’s chip, which allows him to reason and think for himself as long as she can keep her hands on him. Caro feels instantly attracted to Levi as his real self, and he feels a similar pull, calling her “angel” and begging her not to abandon him. Caro is charmed by the man behind the programming and vows to save him. With the help of two undercover friends, Caro makes a plan to destroy all of Pierce’s records and extract Levi. Everything that can go wrong does, leading to a series of high-stakes and at times hilarious adventures. Caro is a robust, interesting character, and her sweet romance with Levi allows her to forgive herself for past mistakes. The gang’s adventures on the prison planet are a rollicking good time, with complex, fast-paced plotting and intricately choreographed action sequences.",

    "description": "New York Times journalist Watkins writes with exactitude and compassion, digging deeply in archives to capture a high-stakes tale that played out internationally during the early 1970s, when the Northern Irish sectarian war against British domination (the Troubles) was at its brutal extreme. While the Provisional IRA received a new generation of recruits due to outrage following Unionist excesses like the “Bloody Sunday” massacre, weapons were in short supply. With a sprawling cast, Watkins focuses on the “Philadelphia Five,” a group of ordinary-seeming blue-collar Irish Americans with covert ties to the Republican cause, eventually “charged with trafficking hundreds of rifles to the IRA.” But for years, their complicated multistate network maintained “plausible deniability” via involvement with NORAID, a charity outwardly devoted to aiding beleaguered Catholic communities: “It was a fragile arrangement, having a public-facing organization as the front for a decidedly illegal transcontinental gun-smuggling operation.” Watkins ably captures the quirky personalities and gritty working-class backdrop of the American side, but she alternates it with the chilling narrative of how one smuggled rifle armed a young woman in Belfast in 1973, on an IRA mission ending with her own shooting and imprisonment. As Watkins notes, while the Troubles would endure for another 25 years, the brazen actions of the Philadelphia Five predictably provoked an unwelcome diplomatic firestorm: “Officials in Belfast and London had been making the case, nearly since the Troubles had started, that the majority of the IRA’s arsenal came from American hands.” And despite their cocky Irish patriotism, “As the boys in Belfast were fighting the British Army, the boys in NORAID were barreling toward their own confrontation, with the US Department of Justice.”",
