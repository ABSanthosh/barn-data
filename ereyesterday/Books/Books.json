    "description": "Justyce Dreadmiller, the self-made owner-manager of the boutique grocery store Mildred’s Market, has long suffered the routine shoplifting of “pouting young nymphet” Yvette Cartier. Every few days, the entitled, beautiful Yvette pilfers several high-end items—perfumes, cosmetics, lubricants, and the like—from Justyce’s shelves. Justyce has just purchased a Japanese-made novelty conveyor belt (the eponymous At-Your-Beck Felicity Conveyor) to help set the Market apart, a substantial investment that makes Yvette’s shoplifting increasingly hard on his bottom line. When Yvette purloins $700 worth of inventory in a single day, he knows he must do something to put her in her place. Justyce believes in “solving his own problems in his own ways, on his own initiative, and at his own convenience, in as straightforward a manner as was practicable,” an approach that has, in the past, meant leaving his high school bully drugged and castrated in a swamp. For Yvette, the plan is slightly less grisly: He will simply humiliate her in the most sadistic manner imaginable. For that, he will need, among other things, the help of his seductive son, an aphrodisiacal ointment that delays climax, and a few novel augmentations of the At-Your-Beck Felicity Conveyor. Landon’s prose is nearly Joycean in its verbosity, which, in addition to slowing down the novel’s pace, creates an ironic friction with the ribald subject matter. Here, the author describes Yvette’s magnetic effect on men: “Gentlemen from all walks of life would ogle our subdebutante everywhither she set her pretty young feet and, to boost her libidinal ego, she would play little games with these poor sitting ducks by coyly making goo-goo eyes at the throbbing love muscles inside their trousers.” The book builds to a preposterous (and literal) climax—aided by what amounts to a Rube Goldberg machine composed of sex toys—that is almost too abstracted to either scintillate or offend. Readers who enjoy both high postmodernism and BDSM will have fun with this one.",

    "description": "Rory, a former Honor Warrior, loves Ingefær, a battle wizard, very much. They have traveled together for years working as bounty hunters and are ready to begin the next part of their journey together: marriage. While Rory has been hesitant to propose to Ingefær after so many of his loved ones have died, Furæyar Shrine, with its dazzling colors and beautiful view, feels like the right place to finally pop the question (“the gardens were the grandest spot for romance in Vanaby, perhaps the entire Realm”). However, as soon as Rory gets down on one knee, the shrine erupts in flames. He and Ingefær rush to help people, but in the aftermaththey are arrested for suspicion of causing the magically created fire. Lieutenant Smergasil is quick to point fingers at the outsiders, and while Rory is released, Ingefær is kept in jail until the trial, leaving Rory to find the true fire mage who started the conflagration and free her. The task proves difficult, as things have changed recently in the city of Vanaby, with military control giving lieutenants an incredible amount of power—and humans are not looked upon kindly in this land. Vecka creates compelling difficulties and character challenges that help drive the fast-paced plot and add to the already exciting mystery narrative. The lieutenant and his men watch Rory like a hawk as he’s challenged to use his wits and words to figure out how to free Ingefær. If he lifts a finger against a resident of Vanaby, he’ll find himself back in jail as well; for a former Honor Warrior, this is a great strain, and the author effectively shows how Rory struggles with it. Similarly, Ingefær must struggle to choose between escaping to live as a fugitive or staying locked up until her innocence is proved by the identification of the true culprit.",
