    "description": "As a framework for his detailed advice on navigating the real estate business (in particular the practice of “flipping”—buying a distressed property, rehabbing it, and selling it for a profit), the author offers his “M.B.P.E.” method, which he modestly describes as “a waterfall of energy that will lead you to a revolutionary change as a human being, in your relationships with others, in your work and business.” The letters stand for “morning” (Iasiello emphasizes the importance of getting up very early every day), “prayer” (which he claims will “help you feel less lonely), “biohacking” (which is “regulating one’s body and mind through breathing, healthy food, supplements and proper use of sleep”), and “exercise” (which is important “because your mental and physical state is the first step towards getting results in real estate and life in general”). After making these clarifications, the author’s emphasis shifts almost entirely away from “life in general” to real estate as Iasiello explains the basics of his business to newcomers looking to start on their own. “In most cases when flipping real estate, your product is money, delivered quickly and smoothly,” he writes, with the kind of knowing directness that characterizes the whole book. “Your ideal client is someone who lives in your target neighborhood, needs money fast, and is willing to sacrifice some of the value of their home to get cash.” The author is pleasingly blunt when discussing everything from pre-foreclosures to evictions to absentee homeowners and the details of probate. He gives wise and easy-to-follow advice on how to spot likely properties, how to find buyers (“the engine that will keep your investment potential alive”), how to craft effective networks and ads, and dozens of other related topics. His narrative energy also applies to his life advice, but most readers will be coming here for the real estate tips, and they’ll be well rewarded.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/stephanie-nina-pitsirilos/event-horizon-stories-of-no-turning-back/",
    "description": "This collection’s central theme is the concept of “event horizons,” or moments of no return—like crossing the boundary of a black hole. The stories involve cosmic decisions and characters confronting uncertain futures. Most of the characters face moral dilemmas as they navigate such issues as intergalactic relationships and immortality, with their stories taking place in such diverse settings as living rooms, space stations, and far-off exoplanets. Pitsirilos has assembled an eclectic roster of creators from many different mediums, resulting in a work that is diverse in both forms and perspectives. One of Pitsirilos’ standout stories, “Orteez Funeral Home,” is set in the titular mortuary. The building has preserved its original purpose while accommodating some modifications, like replacing bricks with steel and installing a viewing pillar that launches coffins into space for a final journey to the sun. A woman named Evangeline has requested that the story’s narrator attend her viewing, creating an emotionally charged atmosphere as she reflects on their connection. Overall, the work collected here is impressive, the visual elements especially so. Various styles of illustration are used; occasionally there’s a feeling of incongruity when some mediums abut each other, such as the real-life photography that sits alongside comic-book illustrations. The stories themselves are varied; some pieces, like “Klon,” explore more futuristic themes, like advancements in cloning technology that have made reincarnation a reality, while others, like “The Fold,” remain in the realm of SF but address more universal themes, such as the roles stories play in remembering loved ones we can no longer be with (“Stories deceive that they hold no weight”). All should prove a delight for SF aficionados.",
