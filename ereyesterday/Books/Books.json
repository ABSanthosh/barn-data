    "description": "Thalia Eichel awakens somewhere unfamiliar with only fleeting memories. She soon runs into Alistair, the God of Protection, who reluctantly tells her she’s dead. He doesn’t know how it happened, and Thalia doesn’t remember. With help from Alistair, Thalia returns home to Druin, a labor town in a medieval-like fantasy realm, only to discover that her parents and twin brother are likely dead as well. Signs point to her family’s probable murderer: King Vitalis of the royal city of Varedon. In fact, Thalia’s brother Demetrius is alive and looking for her—as far as he knows, she is just missing. A reunion between the two is possible if Thalia and Alistair can track down a legendary medallion that can allegedly restore life. All the while, an underground organization plots a rebellion against the royals, stirring up mortals, gods, and goddesses. The author masterfully handles an extensive cast, shifting narrative perspectives between Thalia, Alistair, Demetrius, and others. Individual character arcs shine, from Alistair’s father, the King of the Gods, objecting to his son “mingling with the mortals” to Thalia’s best friend Torin Lehr fighting in bouts for a mysterious company promising info on Thalia’s whereabouts. Much of this first installment in Mavis’ series follows Thalia hunting the titular jewel while hinting at a secret involving an Eichel ancestor that may explain why someone has apparently targeted her family. Mortals and immortals alike wind up imprisoned and in peril, offering plenty of opportunities for Thalia to prove she’s capable in physical confrontations. The author portrays richly drawn environments, including the gods’ home planet where a luxurious palace sits near a crashing waterfall, and an “ethereal” forest housing such magical creatures as pixies and a lilac-colored stag.",

    "description": "When a youngster and his grandma receive notice that his school is switching to at-home learning, the boy becomes concerned. So far, the family has relied on his phone for their internet needs; now they’ll need a computer. His grandmother reminds him, “We weave to get what we need….It’s how we’ve always survived.” She shears a sheep, cleans the wool, collects plants, makes dyes, and weaves “in prayer.” When the deadline approaches, the boy uses technology to help her get the word out, so they can sell the rug in time. The book refreshingly models generational harmony, demonstrating a future in which children can hold on to sacred traditions while using tech for good. Vandever and illustrator Mitchell effectively aim to teach many young readers about the significance of weaving to the Navajo people and present images of weaving tools. In addition, there’s a section on the importance of using parental controls and monitoring how one’s children use the internet. Amid beautiful full-color illustrations, the text employs easily digestible words and short sentences, which will be helpful for younger children.",
