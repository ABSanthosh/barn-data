    "description": "Starting her third year at the Arcanum Training Institute for Marvelous and Uncanny Endeavors, Ella, a 13-year-old Black girl whose great-grandfather, Jean-Michel Durand, created the institute, has a lot on her plate. Along with keeping up with her magic lessons, Ella’s determined to uncover more of the secrets and lies surrounding the world of Conjurors and Marvellers—and her school in particular. This pursuit leads her to explore mysteries surrounding New Orleans’ Underworld and the history of the creation of the Cards of Deadly Fate, a conjure deck used to imprison people. She still has the help of best friends Jason and Brigit, and this time even more classmates join them. But will their search for answers be worth it, or will their efforts unravel the fabric of their magical society in possibly irreparable ways? Clayton continues to expand on the complex and fascinating magical world she’s populated with dynamic and appealing primary and supporting characters. This sequel delves even deeper into the culturally diverse world Ella and her friends inhabit, taking readers on an emotional ride. This work will best be appreciated by those who are familiar with the earlier books in the series.",

    "description": "Sacramento certainly has its dark side. Like every big city, it has its share of homelessness. Residents struggle to keep up with the high cost of living in California. Housing is too often unaffordable, thanks in part to an influx of telecommuting tech workers from the Bay Area. But Freeman ignores the city’s real struggles, offering instead a collection of stories that could take place just about anywhere. In “The Former Detective,” Jamil Jan Kochai’s hero works at the Port of Sacramento but seems never to have left Afghanistan. Editor Freeman’s “Intersections” takes place largely in the West Bank city of Bethlehem. “The Sacrament,” Reyna Grande’s story about a painter and a sex worker, is set in East Sacramento, a locale not particularly known for art or sex work. And Luis Avalos’ “A Textbook Example,” supposedly set in Broderick (now called West Sacramento), actually takes place largely on the campus of UC Davis. Two of the stories really do give a sense of what Sacramento is (or was) like. Naomi J. Williams’ “Sakura City” provides a powerful look at Sacramento’s now-destroyed Japanese community, and Nora Rodriguez Camagna’s “Painted Ladies” at life in the Sacramento River Delta. For the most part, though, the collection is a study in lost opportunities. Surely a noir set in the capital city of the country’s most populous state, the city that gave rise to the Gold Rush, offers the chance to chronicle misdeeds that are genuinely Californian.",
