    "description": "In the forlorn aftermath of his parents’ deaths during the Covid-19 epidemic, 30-something Dawson Wozniak moves from California to Puerto Vallarta; as a book editor, he’s able to work remotely, and he pines to start his life anew. One evening, he shares a furtive kiss with Ivan, who works at the apartment complex where Dawson lives. The two hear a loud argument and then witness a young man falling off the roof to his death. Ivan is anxious to conceal his whereabouts at the time of the incident and convinces Dawson to keep mum, but after the death is ruled an accident Dawson is bedeviled by guilt over their lack of full disclosure. In this subtly composed narrative, Dawson pursues a relationship with Ivan, who is both unsure of their compatibility—they hail from “different worlds,” he believes—and his own sexuality. As evidence of foul play mounts regarding the death of Benito Perez, the young man who fell (or was pushed) off the roof, Dawson grows increasingly fretful that he has neglected to take his own moral responsibility seriously. In stirringly candid terms, Ivan challenges his sense of duty: “Do you realize how American you sound right now? Talking about truth and justice? You come here to our country and tell us how to do things. It’s so…ingenuo, what’s the word…like simple. You are ready to ruin other lives, so you can settle your own conscience.” This is a deeply layered novel that intelligently explores issues of sexual identity, grief, and moral accountability. In each case, Meis avoids any sententious moralizing; instead, he relates a consuming story in powerfully simple prose.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/rudy-ridolfo/job-junky/",
    "description": "Ridolfo started working when he was only 12 years old, manning the counter at his parents’ grocery store, the humble beginning to an extraordinarily long, diverse list of jobs. Before he broke into show business as an actor and an indie filmmaker, he had no choice but to support himself with a “lifetime of phantom jobs,” which amounted to 40 years of disposable positions. In this brief memoir, fewer than 100 pages long, he reflects on nearly 50 of the most eventful ones, each presented as a comic (and sometimes dramatic) anecdote. While he worked jobs in his eventual profession—actor, screenwriter, even an actors workshop instructor—he filled plenty of random roles: lumberyard worker, martial arts teacher, and night club manager, to name a small sampling. In one particularly entertaining vignette, he describes working as a translator for someone appearing in court who pretended he was unable to speak English (“Sorry. I don’ understand… issa not true”). From this wry tale emerges a thoughtful refection on the nature of transitory employment. Ridolfo was rarely fired—maybe half a dozen times—because he never presented himself as too good for a job (he’d adopted his mother’s “unspoken gracious undertone”). Also, he was buoyed by his own professional aspirations: “Then again, I was at an advantage because I believed that I was going to create something that I was pursuing so it was a lot easier for me to detach myself because I was driven by something else.” This is an admirably candid, astute remembrance, one that should captivate anyone stuck in the waiting room of a dead-end job, planning for something more.",
