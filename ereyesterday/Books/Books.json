    "description": "It is easy to think of electric vehicles, green energy, and other advanced technology as surefire ways to save the planet, but award-winning journalist Beiser, author of The World in a Grain, advises us to look at the issues more deeply to assess the true costs. The author focuses on the metals required to power new-gen tech, which include huge amounts of copper and nickel as well as cobalt, boron, lithium, and less familiar substances like gallium and germanium. These elements are necessary for batteries and chips that support everything from EVs and smartphones to wind turbines and solar panels. A critical problem is that mining and refining these metals can, if not done carefully, create horrifying environmental and humanitarian problems. The key players in the global business are China and Russia, which deliberately chose to accept the damage in order to cut costs and corner the market. Both countries have shown themselves willing to leverage their positions for geopolitical advantage. Other countries have acknowledged the danger and are trying to catch up in the marketplace, but there is a long way to go. Beiser also investigates the global market in scrap, noting that the recycling of the metals in tech devices is useful but often exploitative to laborers. The U.S. has huge mineral resources, but to develop them without damaging the environment would be expensive. Beiser argues that the higher costs must be borne and that the cheap ride enjoyed so far is not really so cheap. This is a message that many people might not want to hear, but the author underlines the point that there is no real alternative.",

    "description": "Working under the cover of media investor, Falk is supposed to help Russian opposition journalists come up with stories damaging to the Kremlin. His latest success is with blogger Anton Basmanny, an openly gay provocateur known for his outrageous man-on-the-street livestreams whose viral performance video from a high-ranking Russian official's secret villa leads to the official's deposal. On the same flight as the one intended to whisk Falk to safety, tech billionaire Paul Obrandt is seen seated with a mystery woman (her identity is key) shortly before he's reported dead by an elaborately planned suicide. Not believing her Russian-born father did such a thing, his feisty and fearless 23-year-old daughter, Maya, leaves their Los Angeles home to pursue the truth in Portugal, where he left her a house. Hooking up (in both senses of the term) with Falk, she risks her life to find out not only what happened to her old man, but also where $5 billion missing from his investment account went. A classic globe-trotter, the novel spreads its cold-blooded killings among several countries. But unlike most spy fiction, it's driven in the liveliest sense by young characters who reflect their generation. Falk, a millennial who wears Weezer tees, and Maya, who was up for a part in a Peacock vampire series, are an irresistible pairing. The aspirations of youth also drive the backstory of Paul Obrandt's efforts as a 25-year-old billionaire to effect positive political change in Russia during the fading days of the Yeltsin administration through the creation of a telecom firm. Good luck with that.",
