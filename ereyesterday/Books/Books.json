    "description": "Roberts, an academic and author, draws on insights from the fields of history, archaeology, and genetics to trace the stories of her chosen animals and plants and their effect on our lives. Dogs, wheat, cattle, corn, rice, chickens, horses, potatoes, and apples‚Äîshe tracks each to their geographical origin and traces how they evolved as they became part of the human world. Evidence from archaeology and genetics is supplemented by lively anecdotes, often from the author‚Äôs personal experience. Along the way, she shares fascinating bits of lore from all over the scientific and historical maps. The rapid spread of corn into the Old World after Columbus‚Äô first voyage, the discovery of Neolithic cheese strainers, the presence of a distinctive strain of rice in West Africa, and the possible effect of the last Ice Age on the extinction of horses in the Americas‚Äîthese are just a few of the stories the book explores. The focus isn‚Äôt strictly historical, though‚Äîfor example, the chapter on rice looks at the impact of genetic modification on food crops and its possible role in feeding the poorest parts of the world. The relationships between these species and the humans who domesticated them, and continue to depend on them, are always at the forefront of the discussion. The final chapter looks at the evolution of Homo sapiens and its spread across the globe, along with some of our adaptations to the different environments we inhabit, such as lighter skin color to enhance vitamin D absorption in high latitudes. Best of all, the book is thoroughly readable, even when exploring the details of genetics. Popular science at its best.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/richard-harland/ferren-and-the-invaders-of-heaven-the-ferren-trilo/",
    "description": "In a distant-future Australia, Ferren has led the human Residuals in resisting the Humen, powerful artificial beings that have been taking unwitting Residuals into their military service. Now the Humen prepare to face off against the hosts of Heaven, a fight that Ferren and others anticipate will end in the Humen‚Äôs defeat. It seems the Humen have a new leader: an ‚Äúevil angel‚Äù who zips across the sky in a flying ship. Hoping to align themselves with God‚Äôs messengers, the Residuals turn to Miriael, a warrior angel ‚Äúshot down‚Äù from Heaven who‚Äôs now essentially a hybrid, part-spiritual and part-physical. If she can convince Heaven‚Äôs forces to join with humans (‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs stopping Heaven saying yes to an alliance? Why are they taking so long about it?‚Äù), then maybe they can take down the Humen once and for all. Harland focuses this final installment of his fantasy series on action. The set pieces are memorable‚ÄîMiriael, along with Ferren‚Äôs sister Shanna, witness angels and Humen clash; myriad Residuals flee their enemy in the midst of an intense hailstorm; and the lengthy, riveting climax is searing. While the text includes occasional recaps covering prior volumes, the appreciation of some character dynamics relies heavily on readers‚Äô knowledge of the earlier books. Plenty of story unfolds in this novel, however, as one character‚Äôs demand to oversee the Residuals‚Äô assembly sparks contempt and another‚Äôs subdued romantic feelings beget petty jealousy. Tension steadily builds as the Humen work on an ‚Äúunimaginably huge construction‚Äù for a purpose not immediately apparent. The author rounds out this brisk finale with appearances from archangels, Miriael‚Äôs ‚Äúvisionary dreams,‚Äù and a wholly satisfying wrap-up.",
