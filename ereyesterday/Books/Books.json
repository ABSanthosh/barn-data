    "title": "BUILDING THE METROPOLIS",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/alexander-wood/building-the-metropolis/",
    "description": "Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, writes Wood, historian of American architecture and urbanism, New York City “grew into one of the world’s largest, most important, and dynamic cities.” Roughly 1 million buildings—an astonishing number—went up in the city during that period. In his deeply informed and informative account, Wood describes how population growth and a robust economy gave rise to a large and sophisticated construction industry. He deftly describes the numerous and complex arrangements that provided much-needed office buildings, homes, factories, railway stations, bridges, streets, and subway lines. We read, often in detail, about large construction firms, building trade associations, the mechanics of tunnel construction, labor unions, architectural offices, and wrecking companies. Wood introduces us to government workers and officials such as Thomas F. Gilroy (head of the city’s Department of Public Works in the 1890s) and labor organizers such as Morris Rosen. After the city consolidated in 1898, Wood extends his gaze beyond Manhattan’s skyscrapers to the lower-density outer boroughs. Throughout, he attends to the many conflicts between business and labor over the length of the workday, safety, and wages; contractor competition for private commissions and lobbying for public works projects; and city government efforts to manage the corruption, labor unrest, noise and disruption, and the regulatory demands of building activity. For those fascinated by urban development (particularly construction and particularly in New York City), reading this substantial history is time well spent. What primarily matters to Wood, however, are facts. Consequently, he refrains from any attempt at a more general understanding of building construction. In the last chapter, after a brief summary, the story simply ends.",

    "title": "JURY DUTY IS MURDER",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/margaret/jury-duty-is-murder/",
    "description": "This novel take place in the aftermath of a high-profile trial, as 72-year-old retired teacher Helen Ryder (known to the other jurors as “Schoolmarm”) and other jurors reconnect after a series of suspicious deaths among their peers. Two months before, they voted to convict basketball player Roger “Buck” Dempsey for the murder of his wife, and now it appears that someone is exacting revenge. Helen, hardware store owner Harold Ashman (nicknamed “Shoe”), actor and science fiction writer Alex Manning (known as “Reporter”), and the lively exotic dancer Mindy Laine (aka “CeeCee”) investigate, which leads them into a web of deceit and danger. The novel does a great job of blending suspense with character-driven drama, as each juror brings their own personalities and emotion baggage to the proceedings. As they try to make sense of the unexplained deaths, difficulties arise—not just in the investigation, but also in their personal lives; for example, Helen’s family is threatening to place her in an elderly care home. Damon, who also writes bestselling novels as Margaret Brownley, manages to balance an entertaining whodunit with insights into the diverse worlds of the jurors, whose lives have been drastically changed by their shared experience. The pacing is tight, with each chapter revealing just enough to keep readers hooked. The dialogue, especially between Harold and Helen (“Helen shot a daggered look in Harold’s direction. ‘You actually listened to something I said? That’s a first’”), adds lighter moments to an otherwise tense narrative. Overall, this twisty novel offers a unique mix of courtroom drama and post-trial mystery, while its subtle romance elements make it feel well-rounded.",
