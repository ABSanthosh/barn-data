    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/tanya-konerman/mud-to-the-rescue-how-animals-use-mud-to-thrive-and-survive/",
    "description": "In these colorful pages, the author discusses the benefits of having plenty of mud around when you’re a member of the animal kingdom. Several types of birds need mud in their everyday lives to help keep their nests sturdy and safe from predators. Macaws eat mud to calm their stomachs and counter poisons—they’re just one of over 200 species that have been documented engaging in geophagia, or eating mud. Turtles all over the globe use mud to protect themselves from inclement weather, whether it’s too hot or too cold. Both elephants and hippos roll in mud to cool themselves off and protect their skin (“A nice layer of mud blocks pests and parasites that itch or make elephants and hippos sick”). The text’s layout pairs prey animals with natural predators that use mud in the same way; readers learn that alligators use mud to protect their eggs, just like the flamingos they hunt. At the back of the book, each of the animals mentioned in the main text receive a dedicated paragraph containing more detailed information. The book also includes a glossary, author’s note, and labeled examples of various species’ footprints. Konerman uses repetitive text to introduce problems that animals encounter for which mud is the solution. (The seminarrative text is lyrical but contains no fictional elements.) On some pages, there are additional, mud splattered text boxes providing more fun facts about the animals (“Duck-billed platypus has a rubbery snout that can sense its prey’s tiny electrical currents in the mud”). Cataldo depicts animals in their environments in realistic illustrations, including details to help readers develop a deeper understanding of the material.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/chi-ho-kwong/indigo-1/",
    "description": "Ella Summer writes for an occult publication called Mars, covering urban legends, reptilian conspiracy theories, and other stories for which there is no proof. (As her editor likes to tell his reporters, “To have proof is called science, not the occult!”) When one of Ella’s former university professors dies mysteriously of apparent starvation, she drops what she’s working on to investigate. Professor Wilhelm was conducting research on humanity’s origins that challenged the theory of evolution, and he shared a special quality with Ella: the ability to communicate telepathically with plants and animals. Could this ability have any connection to the suspicious circumstances of his death? Her investigation soon draws the attention of certain men dressed in black, who apparently visited Wilhelm shortly before his death; Ella’s editor warns her off the case, protesting that it’s too dangerous. With the help of her co-worker Gene, Ella presses on and discovers the professor’s notebook, which is filled with information about so-called Indigo Children—aliens sent from distant stars to help Earth in some unknown way whose inability to adapt to the planet often makes them depressed or even suicidal. Could the professor have been one of these Indigo Children? Could Ella? And if she is, how is she meant to save the world—and would she even want to? The book’s standout feature is the truly transportive illustration work of Chi-Kit Kwong, which is both richly textured and filled with arresting, memorable imagery. Some of the author’s sentences are slightly awkward (case in point: “To have proof is called science”), but the story is engaging and filled with fun twists, particularly once the outlandish conspiracy theories of the magazine begin to overlap with Ella’s quest to understand the professor’s death. Despite the nods to contemporary urban legends, this world feels entirely original, and it’s one that readers will want to return to after the volume ends.",
