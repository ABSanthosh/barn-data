    "description": "New York Times journalist Watkins writes with exactitude and compassion, digging deeply in archives to capture a high-stakes tale that played out internationally during the early 1970s, when the Northern Irish sectarian war against British domination (the Troubles) was at its brutal extreme. While the Provisional IRA received a new generation of recruits due to outrage following Unionist excesses like the “Bloody Sunday” massacre, weapons were in short supply. With a sprawling cast, Watkins focuses on the “Philadelphia Five,” a group of ordinary-seeming blue-collar Irish Americans with covert ties to the Republican cause, eventually “charged with trafficking hundreds of rifles to the IRA.” But for years, their complicated multistate network maintained “plausible deniability” via involvement with NORAID, a charity outwardly devoted to aiding beleaguered Catholic communities: “It was a fragile arrangement, having a public-facing organization as the front for a decidedly illegal transcontinental gun-smuggling operation.” Watkins ably captures the quirky personalities and gritty working-class backdrop of the American side, but she alternates it with the chilling narrative of how one smuggled rifle armed a young woman in Belfast in 1973, on an IRA mission ending with her own shooting and imprisonment. As Watkins notes, while the Troubles would endure for another 25 years, the brazen actions of the Philadelphia Five predictably provoked an unwelcome diplomatic firestorm: “Officials in Belfast and London had been making the case, nearly since the Troubles had started, that the majority of the IRA’s arsenal came from American hands.” And despite their cocky Irish patriotism, “As the boys in Belfast were fighting the British Army, the boys in NORAID were barreling toward their own confrontation, with the US Department of Justice.”",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-mas-masumoto/every-peach-is-a-story/",
    "description": "Midori, a young Japanese American girl, strides into her family’s orchard, followed by her Jiichan (Grandfather), to find ripe peaches. She takes a bite of one but…“crunch!” It’s still too hard. Jiichan urges Midori to be patient: “You’ll know it’s ready when it tastes like a story.” Jiichan likens green peaches to the family’s ancestors when they first set foot in the United States: “Things weren’t ready. They felt like strangers.” Time goes by, and Midori picks up a yellow peach; it’s firm but has a soft spot. Midori’s father compares it to the family farm: “We [began] by planting roots in America in one spot.” More time passes, and when Jiichan hands Midori another peach, she takes a juicy bite and detects the seeds of her family’s efforts embodied in the sweet fruit. The seasons pass, and Jiichan dies. In his absence, Midori returns to the orchard, drawing on his guidance as she employs her senses and picks a peach that truly tastes like a story. Narrated in a mix of free verse and prose, the Masumotos’ spare, haikulike text is simple yet laden with lush imagery. Using loose inky-black lines awash with vivid splashes of green, yellow, orange, and blue, Tamaki’s gorgeous illustrations propel this quiet tale forward, evoking Midori’s energy and curiosity.",
