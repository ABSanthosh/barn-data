    "description": "Alexander longs to be a champion wrestler—he yearns to train at an elite palaestra and receive the laurel crown of victory from none other than the Caesar, Marcus Aurelius. He’s naturally gifted and has never been defeated, but for the time being he merely fights in disreputable matches (upon which drunks and criminals wager) arranged by his father, Marcus, a carpenter of modest means, in the Roman neighborhood the Subura. Such informal bouts can be dangerous—those who lose their bets can be violently vindictive, and a local gang leader, Flavius, aims to commandeer Alexander’s career for his own profit (such perils of ancient Rome are vividly depicted by the author). An opportunity arises when Marcus asks Aulus Virius, an old friend from his days in the navy, to help Alexander; he arranges for the youth to train with Gaius, a renowned wrestling coach. Part of the deal is that Marcus must return to the navy, a fraught exchange given the brewing of rebellion among the Germanic tribes and the Sarmatians. A bright future seems to dawn for Alexander, but his prospects dim when he is quickly expelled from Gaius’ school for illicit gambling and Marcus is killed in an ambush while at sea. In the aftermath of these disasters, Alexander’s mother, Elena, decides to move the two of them back to her homeland of Delos and enjoy the hospitality of her well-heeled brother, Nikos. Alexander begins to train again with Demetrius, a rival of Gaius and an old friend of Marcus. Alexander still aspires to become a great champion, and to win the love of Zoe, who was once the paramour of his chief competitor in Delos, the smug Dario. Carrington’s command of the relevant historical information is extraordinary, and as a result both Rome and Delos are brought to pulsing life. For all its greatness and wealth, Rome is depicted here as a morally squalid place brimming with dangers and temptations to vice. Alexander’s ambition is palpable—he can’t bear the thought of sinking into eternal oblivion, his name forgotten. (He’s driven by a desire for “A place among the elite. A name held in the highest regard. A reputation worthy of the greatest wrestlers.”) The author provides a powerfully dramatic backdrop for Alexander’s quest for fame—while in Delos, he learns an extraordinary family secret, one his mother has zealously guarded his entire life that could potentially threaten them if discovered. Carrington’s writing style is straightforward and simple, unadorned by poetic embellishments or narrative gimmicks. The story’s strength lies in its engrossing plot and painstakingly crafted characters—there are no contrived types in this story, no obviously manufactured token personalities. (There is so much depth in the portrayal of Elena, she could warrant a novel of her own.) This is exactly what a discerning reader should expect from historical fiction—rigorous verisimilitude, complex characterization, and an enthralling plot.",

    "description": "After being charged with assault for breaking the nose of his high school’s bullying star quarterback with a soda can, Sam is remanded to a juvenile holding facility. He’s initially outraged to be assigned Anne of Green Gables as required reading by Mrs. Martinez, his teacher at the facility, which is nicknamed Blue Gables for the color of its roof. Still, he knows that being his best self for the six weeks until his court date can help him avoid serious legal consequences, so he reluctantly starts reading. In its pages, Sam finds another strong-willed, misunderstood young person who aches for a stable home—and shares his red hair. With gentle prodding from supportive adults and a perceptive roommate, he also catches glimmers, through Anne’s resilience and persistence, of a better way forward. Walters acknowledges his intent to pay homage to a novel that has “transcended countries, cultures, time, and place,” and he slips quotes from L.M. Montgomery’s original into his narrative. The conclusion feels true to the original classic’s spirit more than this story’s relatively gritty events or tone but nonetheless delivers the tough, vulnerable protagonist to a sweet but unlikely fate that most readers will find thoroughly well deserved and satisfying.",
