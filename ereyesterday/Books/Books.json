    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jeanne-theoharis/king-of-the-north/",
    "description": "For decades, biographers have focused on Martin Luther King Jr.’s successful leadership in the South while suggesting that his Northern activism failed because it lacked direction and local support. Theoharis, a professor of political science at Brooklyn College, upends this narrative by painstakingly documenting King’s relentless and impassioned battles against Northern discrimination and police brutality, an effort that had its origins in his experiences as a graduate student in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Author of The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks (2013), Theoharis also presents a fully developed picture of Coretta Scott King’s activism, both in tandem and apart from her husband, whom she met as a student in Boston. Neither of the Kings forgot the racism they encountered as students in the North, and they worked with local organizers to address it throughout their lives. Yet time and time again the same white Northern politicians who praised King’s civil rights work in the South either fell silent or became combative when King turned his attention to the systemic racism of the North. Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley did everything in his power to stop civil rights progress in the city and defended his white neighbors who “threw rocks, eggs, and firecrackers” at civil rights marchers as “fine people, hard-working people.” The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, and other mainstream news outlets often ignored or actively refuted King’s accusations of Northern racism, creating a documentary history that has shaped King’s legacy ever since. By looking beyond these sources, Theoharis depicts a complex, radical King whose fight against Northern racism alternately inspires and infuriates.",

    "title": "CINCINNATI LEE, CURSE BREAKER",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/heidi-heilig/cincinnati-lee-curse-breaker/",
    "description": "After Cincinnati Lee, an American girl who has some Chinese heritage, snags her ailing 135-year-old archaeologist great-great-great-grandfather’s diary, she learns about a clay idol from Peru that he looted (and which has cursed the family) and the legendary Spear of Destiny (a relic rumored to grant immense power, but at great peril). Determined to right past wrongs, Cincinnati works to recover the idol. In doing so she unravels an international web of secrets involving corporate art smugglers, curse-bearing relics, and her own family history. Along the way, Cincinnati is supported by friends: Parsley, a Black classmate at her posh private school and the daughter of a celebrity musician, and Felix, who presents Latine and is an amateur forger whose father works with Cin’s mom at the Cosmopolitan Museum of New York. The settings and characters are well developed, and laugh-out-loud dialogue accompanies the bold, fast-paced narrative. References to other adventure stories, real places, and true-to-life political controversies (such as the Hobby Lobby smuggling scandal) abound, adding depth and inviting readers to reflect on questions of cultural heritage and museum ethics. As Heilig writes in her author’s note, “When the treasure we put on display is evidence of a crime, what will future generations believe about our values?” This story is hilarious, smart, and respectfully rendered, and the writing is accessible while still feeling literary.",
