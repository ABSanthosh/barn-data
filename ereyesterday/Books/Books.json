    "title": "FIGHTING ANTISEMITISM TODAY",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/theodor-w-adorno/fighting-antisemitism-today/",
    "description": "The German philosopher and sociologist Theodor Adorno (1903-1969) remains famous today for his Marxist critiques of popular culture as well as for a prose style as intricately knotty as a macrame vest. Among his most characteristically memorable pronouncements was this: ‚ÄúThe critique of culture is confronted with the last stage in the dialectic of culture and barbarism: to write a poem after Auschwitz is barbaric, and that corrodes also the knowledge which expresses why it has become impossible to write poetry today.‚Äù Less daunting than this statement is his lecture to a German audience in 1962, published in German in 1963, and here translated into English for the first time. In just over 40 pages of compelling speech, Adorno outlines the nature of antisemitism, some reasons why it persists, and why it has been long embedded in our educational institutions. Adorno argues that antisemitism often begins ‚Äúin the family home.‚Äù It is reinforced in schooling. ‚ÄúI suspect that a considerable number of teachers still sympathize silently, tacitly, non-explicitly with antisemitism.‚Äù What is the answer? Open-mindedness, a global sensibility, and an awareness of class and cultural conflict. ‚ÄúEffective prevention of antisemitism is inseparable from a prevention of nationalism in all its forms. One cannot be against antisemitism on the one hand while being a militant nationalist on the other.‚Äù Following the lecture in this book is an interpretive essay by the scholar Peter Gordon, situating the talk in the context of Adorno‚Äôs larger concerns with ‚Äúgroup solidarity.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe warm feeling of a collective bond,‚Äù Gordon writes, increases when the group expels those ‚Äúwho bear the stigma of difference.‚Äù Delivered over 60 years ago, Adorno‚Äôs lecture could be heard as fresh news today.",

    "description": "The Hellas Station is a trailblazing Mars colony staffed by only a handful of international, highly competent astronauts. One of these exceptional colonists is extra-special: Adam Flynn is the first human born on Mars (sadly, his mother died from cancer in the radiation-rich environment). Seventeen-year-old Adam has matured to be a survival-hardened and resourceful youth who has helped to ready Hellas Station for an influx of nearly 100 new settlers, all of whom are on a long, one-way trip and expect to spend the rest of their lives on the red planet. But Adam is emotionally unprepared for the arrival of the group, which includes 25 more young people, many of them genius-level high-achievers. They all know Adam‚Äôs story (unbeknownst to him, the first ‚ÄúMartian‚Äù boy is a celebrity figure on Earth) and treat him with a blend of curiosity and disdain. The military commander of the newcomers, Col. Griggs, is a glory-seeking, aggressive type (with two not-so-nice teenagers of his own) who usurps the authority of the established colonists and is particularly condescending to Adam, insisting he is just a ‚Äúkid‚Äù and ignoring hisadvice on all matters Martian. Things begin to go badly: Adam notices an especially powerful dust storm bearing down on the complex, and the installation‚Äôs power failures are traced to a frightening infestation by a hitherto-unsuspected Martian life form. At first appearing as dark patches or tiny larvae, the marauders turn out to be countless beetlelike insects. Of course, Col. Griggs and his Earth allies vainly perceive the discovery of life on another planet as an opportunity for naming rights, and as a new potential food source. Adam, on the other hand, figures out quickly that it is the humans who are on the menu.The first-person-narrated story begins on a note recalling Andy Weir‚Äôs popular novel The Martian¬†(2011), sharing an emphasis on the hard science of exoplanet survival skills and making the most of limited resources, with the added YA-friendly perspective of a teen hero with a (very) circumscribed upbringing abruptly coming to terms with having other humans around who are his own age, particularly of the macho-jock and mean-girl sort. (Whatever raging-hormones youthful romance happens here is dialed considerably down.) At around the midway point, with the onslaught of the bug menace, things take a more Hollywood action-movie turn, which is ironic considering how frequently the youthful characters reference celluloid SF (especially 1986‚Äôs Aliens) and deny that their plight resembles hack scriptwriting: ‚ÄúIf this were a movie, I‚Äôd grin triumphantly and say something clever. She‚Äôd laugh and give me a fist-bump. Except my life doesn‚Äôt seem to be shaping into that kind of movie.‚Äù Actually, that really is more or less what transpires, with Adam and select others doing superheroic acts in an oxygen-starved atmosphere and facing off against unimaginable hordes with the most meagre homebrew weaponry while tossing off courageous asides. There is gruesome gore and a shocking body count, underlying the message that haughty grown-ups should give more credence to precocious astro-kids, especially when it comes to monsters.",
