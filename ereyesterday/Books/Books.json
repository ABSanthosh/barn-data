    "description": "Emma Moskowitz has a lot going for her—she’s a licensed marriage and family therapist who’s just turned in the first draft of a book on maintaining healthy relationships; she has a successful YouTube channel; she lives in a very nice Los Angeles apartment; and she’s happily planning her wedding to Ryan, a man she loves. And yet, after a conversation that’s over in \"less time than it took to watch a network sitcom,\" she’s suddenly very single and focused on all the other traits that make her who she is: She’s someone who’s always getting dumped; she has generalized anxiety disorder, sensory sensitivity issues, and a lack of innate knowledge about social expectations; she hates vegetables and sharing food. What she decides to do next is unexpected: Rather than canceling the wedding, she initiates Operation: Save My Date. She determines that she will, despite all the initial arguments from her loved ones and online fans, find a replacement groom and prove that Western ideals of dating and marriage are not the only ways to establish a loving, worthwhile relationship. Her following explodes and she winds up partnering on a podcast that does extremely well, which lands her on a very well-known talk show. And along the way, she experiences failures, embarrassment, and successes in her quest.",

    "description": "Jessamine Bricker has a history of succeeding even in the worst of circumstances. When her teen mother opted out of raising her, Jess’ Nana Blanche “clipped coupons like a fiend” to pay her tuition at Wren Hill Day School for Young Ladies, where blue-collar Jess rubbed elbows with Nashville’s old-money princesses. Jess went on to nurture her upper-class connections at tony Harrow University, parlaying them into a three-year stint working for one of the city’s “most feared wedding planners.” Realizing that spoiled young women with more money than sense might crave more than a single day of indulgence, she opens Bricker Consultants, helping wealthy young men create over-the-top proposals to delight their prospective brides. Working with grooms-to-be when the real clients are, of course, the brides is a tricky business that Jess handles with exceptional finesse. Still, Trenton Tillard IV provides a special challenge. Trenton’s already proposed to Diana Helston, but without the spectacle the social media influencer feels her Helston LuxeGram brand deserves. So Diana calls in Jess to guide Trenton into a more appropriate “Will you…?” Diana spirits Jess away to Golden Ash spa for a week of yoga, facials, and proposal planning. Unfortunately, the getaway also includes weird lights in the woods, corpses, and a police investigation. The silver lining is Golden Ash chef Dean Osbourne and his wonderfully quirky family, who offer Jess a tantalizing glimpse of life outside the perils of princess-pleasing.",
