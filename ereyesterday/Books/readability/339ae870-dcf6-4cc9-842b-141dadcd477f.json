  "description": "After she’s caught in a compromising situation, California teacher Jane is unceremoniously fired. She then applies for the “types of jobs that [won’t] check a record.” Fortunately, she finds one—a couple (including a popular writer of airport novels) takes her on as nanny to their 10-month-olds Franny and Zooey. Then, Jane gets a reply to another application; porn actor Lola hires her to communicate with her fans, engaging in generally salacious cyberchats as “Lola” to persuade clients to pay for premium content. That’s something Jane can do during Franny and Zooey’s naptime. While these unfiltered online conversations are relatively new territory for Jane, she’s an unexpected natural at sexting. Certainly, she doesn’t want the twins’ mothers knowing what she does during some of her nannying hours, but she soon comes to the frightening realization that someone may have caught on to her surreptitious side-gig. Kicherer deftly satirizes modern pornography and porn addiction—Jane easily handles multiple chats using generic responses that don’t dissipate the mesmerized clients’ sexual energy. Jane finds the activity “curious,” but it gradually turns into a routine, and she doesn’t really consider the implications of the X-rated written content until later. The author’s concise and often irreverent prose pulls no punches—the cyberchats engage in topics that will make some readers blush and others cringe. At the same time, the story deftly contrasts these pornographic conversations with Jane caring for two infant twins who are oblivious to all that she’s typing on her laptop. A darker aspect of the porn job slowly and effectively creeps in; interacting with faceless usernames may seem harmless, but there’s a chance one of these individuals knows too much. The ending, which suits the overall tone, won’t likely be forgotten.",

  "text": "THE WEDDING PEOPLE by Alison Espach ‧ RELEASE DATE: July 30, 2024 Uneven but fitfully amusing. Betrayed by her husband, a severely depressed young woman gets drawn into the over-the-top festivities at a lavish wedding. Phoebe Stone, who teaches English literature at a St. Louis college, is plotting her own demise. Her husband, Matt, has left her for another woman, and Phoebe is taking it hard. Indeed, she's determined just where and how she will end it all: at an oceanfront hotel in Newport, where she will lie on a king-sized canopy bed and take a bottle of her cat’s painkillers. At the hotel, Phoebe meets bride-to-be Lila, a headstrong rich girl presiding over her own extravagant six-day wedding celebration. Lila thought she had booked every room in the hotel, and learning of Phoebe's suicidal intentions, she forbids this stray guest from disrupting the nuptials: “No. You definitely can’t kill yourself. This is my wedding week.” After the punchy opening, a grim flashback to the meltdown of Phoebe's marriage temporarily darkens the mood, but things pick up when spoiled Lila interrupts Phoebe's preparations and sweeps her up in the wedding juggernaut. The slide from earnest drama to broad farce is somewhat jarring, but from this point on, Espach crafts an enjoyable—if overstuffed—comedy of manners. When the original maid of honor drops out, Phoebe is persuaded, against her better judgment, to take her place. There’s some fun to be had here: The wedding party—including groom-to-be Gary, a widower, and his 11-year-old daughter—takes surfing lessons; the women in the group have a session with a Sex Woman. But it all goes on too long, and the humor can seem forced, reaching a low point when someone has sex with the vintage wedding car (you don’t want to know the details). Later, when two characters have a meet-cute in a hot tub, readers will guess exactly how the marriage plot resolves. Uneven but fitfully amusing.
