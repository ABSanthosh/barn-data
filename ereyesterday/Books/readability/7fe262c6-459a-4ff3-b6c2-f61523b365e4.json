  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Stellar Heir? I’ve always loved martial arts movies like Fists of Fury, Enter the Dragon, Ip Man and a ton of others. I’ve also always loved space operas like The Expanse, Dune and of course Star Wars. So, I decided to merge those two into one story and Stellar Heir was born. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Stellar Heir, what would they be? Jael – “Seven Nation Army” Goni – “Can’t Hold Us” Yekkt – “Bad Guy” Prahven Haanj – “The Devil’s Den” Merzi – “Elastic Heart” What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? My favorite genre has got to be Sci-fi, and really any sub-genre of Sci-fi. I’ve written a couple of books now and Sci-fi is definitely my favorite genre to write in. Its fun and it seems to come easier for me than fantasy. What books are on your TBR pile right now? My TBR pile is shamefully high right now, but some of them are Flamespitter, Wraith, and The Trilisk Ruins. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? My favorite scene that I wrote was a John Wick/Daredevil style fight through the corridors of a flagship. The MC helps a creature he finds aboard as he is trying to escape and the two fight their way through. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I always have one of my three cats on my lap while writing. Sometimes more. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Because of my love of martial arts my favorite quote I often think about is from “A Book of Five Rings” by Miyamoto Musashi. “There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get better, stronger, richer, quicker, or smarter. Everything is within. Everything exists. Seek nothing outside of yourself.” If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? That the choices we make define who we are. Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly.",
