  "description": "Thanks to her great mop of flaming-red hair and some unfortunate incidents on the first day, Theodosia “Bunny” Baxter’s hopes of invisibly blending in at her new middle school may be dashed. But the ensuing notoriety leaves her alternative scheme—being expelled, so she can go to school with her best friend—all the more doable. Or so she thinks. As it turns out, she’s not very good at bad behavior, among the many endearing qualities that will draw readers to her. Bunny fumbles her way toward successfully coping with many things, including bullying, pressure to sign up for an athletic competition, complex feelings about being adopted, and anxiety attacks that manifest in part as serious rashes. Roberts tucks engaging classroom activities into this already thematically robust tale—like the fizzy social dynamics in an experimental initiative-building class called Discoveries, the ins and outs of creating a garden of native plants, and tagging monarch butterflies—as she artfully tracks a profound transformation in her protagonist’s sense of self. The changes may be Bunny’s doing, but she’s helped along by a generously sized cast of almost uniformly supportive adults and peers (plus one great dog). By the book’s buoyant end, even one prickly girl’s repeated insistence that she’s not Bunny’s friend is sounding hollow. Bunny is cued white, and there’s some racial diversity in the supporting cast.",

  "text": "SEE YOU IN THE COSMOS by Jack Cheng ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 28, 2017 Riveting, inspiring, and sometimes hilarious. If you made a recording to be heard by the aliens who found the iPod, what would you record? For 11-year-old Alex Petroski, it's easy. He records everything. He records the story of how he travels to New Mexico to a rocket festival with his dog, Carl Sagan, and his rocket. He records finding out that a man with the same name and birthday as his dead father has an address in Las Vegas. He records eating at Johnny Rockets for the first time with his new friends, who are giving him a ride to find his dead father (who might not be dead!), and losing Carl Sagan in the wilds of Las Vegas, and discovering he has a half sister. He even records his own awful accident. Cheng delivers a sweet, soulful debut novel with a brilliant, refreshing structure. His characters manage to come alive through the “transcript” of Alex’s iPod recording, an odd medium that sounds like it would be confusing but really works. Taking inspiration from the Voyager Golden Record released to space in 1977, Alex, who explains he has “light brown skin,” records all the important moments of a journey that takes him from a family of two to a family of plenty. Riveting, inspiring, and sometimes hilarious.
