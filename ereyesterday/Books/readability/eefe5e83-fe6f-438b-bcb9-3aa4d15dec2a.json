Best books of the year lists are starting, some AI messes, and more. See what you might have missed. Business Insider recommended nonexistent books to staff as it leans into AI I think there are interesting use cases for AI and LLMs. This might put me in the minority among folks who work in book media. I also think that it is the greatest cheat yet invented in the age of the electron. Both of these things can be true. The difference between a situation where AI use is valuable and where it is a cheat comes down to this simple question: are you using it to help you make something good or are you using it just to get something done? Done has never been easier.  It is the allure of getting to done that seduces folks, like apparently some higher-up at Business Insider, to use AI to make a list of books to read about (wait for it) “good business journalism.” The problem: some of the books either didn’t exist or were incorrectly attributed. Clearly the idea here was to provide some examples and motivation to employees (good and noble idea), but without making sure the list was good, you just make an awful mess. If you were an employee of this company or managed by this person, why would you take anything they offer seriously again? This isn’t just any old mistake; it is a revelation about values and motivation. The first arrow of error here was not using AI; it was mistaking providing and unvetted and clearly unread books as some sort of productivity doggy toy, whose only purpose was to perform leadership and education, not actually and meaningfully provide it. James Cameron To Adapt Joe Abercrombie’s The DevilsIn Between Avatar Movies It takes a lot for me to devote a spot to adaptation news anymore, but James Cameron, who movie-per-movie might be the most successful director of all time (check the tape and fight me), adapting a horror novel makes the grade:  “How do I describe ‘The Devils?’ A sharply witty horror adventure? An epic battle between good and evil except most of the time you can’t tell which is which? A twisted, stylish, alt-universe middle-ages romp, where your best hope of survival is the monsters themselves? This is Joe Abercrombie in absolute peak form, opening up a whole new world and an ensemble of delicious new characters.”  At this point, Cameron is only set to co-write the screenplay with Abercrombie, but with no director announced it is hard not to assume that Cameron isn’t at least considering getting behind the camera for it. Horror is huge in theaters and one of the fasting growing book genres, but I can’t help but wonder if the box-office success and critical adulation of Sinners might have turned Cameron’s head. He clearly has horror-action bona fides, maybe some the greatest of all time, but at the very least the run Coogler’s modern masterpiece is having would give confidence to someone taking on The Devils. AI Clones of Books Are Showing Up on Amazon Here is how this works. A real book from an author (self-pub or traditional) gets listed on Amazon. Then, some scammer thinking there might be interest in that book, uses AI “read” the book and rewrite the contents using different language. The name of the author is changed, but stays close enough to stay confusing. A cover image is generated (in this case some sort of deepfake that sorta-kinda looks like the person in question. Then, you upload this AI-abomination to Amazon, charge a couple of bucks for a Kindle only version (or a few dollars more than that for an AI generated audiobook), and then you hope to catch the coattails of the legitimate books’s marketing, publicity, and other awareness to sell a few copies. This is not exactly a new strategy (if you have ever fallen for the “summary of East of Eden” versus the real thing you know this) but like I wrote yesterday, the speed of cheating differs by an order of magnitude. Michelle Obama Announces New Book Coming This Fall I really didn’t know what to expect from Michelle Obama’s next book. Becoming was a sensation, but it didn’t seem like it left a lot of meat on the bone for more memoir/autobiography. And she doesn’t seem interested in a straight-forwardly political book, though I thought there was a slim chance (and maybe it is just my wishful thinking) that a “here’s-what-I-believe” style book could come as a precursor to a return to political life. That’s now what this book is. The Looks is essentially a coffee table book of her life in fashion. It is timed to prime gift book season (November 4th), and if you are going to do a fashion book, this is a pretty interesting version of it:  “Featuring the voices of Meredith Koop, Obama’s trusted stylist, as well as her makeup artist Carl Ray, hairstylists Yene Damtew, Johnny Wright, and Njeri Radway, and many of the designers who have dressed Obama for notable events, The Look brings readers behind the scenes not only to reveal how her most memorable looks came together but also to tell a powerful story about how we present ourselves. Not something I myself care about, but I can see the appeal. Will be curious to see how it sells. Amazon Names Its Best Books of the Year so Far Headline here is that Wild Dark Shore by Charlotte McGonaghy is the leader at the turn for their best book of the year, and I can confirm that it is quite good. She now has three very good novels under her belt, and has poured cement to make her very own corner: literary, climate novels featuring strong relationships and characters that book clubs can access. Among the other top 10 titles on the list, I can also vouch for Memorial Days by Geraldine Brooks. There are a lot of grief memoirs, and it can be difficult to stand out. Here’s how Brooks does it: she is just a better writer than 95% of people writing. Simple, but not easy.",
