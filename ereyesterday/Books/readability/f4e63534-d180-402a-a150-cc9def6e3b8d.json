  "text": "04 Dec 2024 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Broken Heart (The Hearts of Sawyers Bend Book 7)? Sterling and Forrest have been a part of the Hearts of Sawyers Bend series since the beginning. They’ve had a rought start and I had so much fun bringing them back together! What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Romantic Suspense!! What books are on your TBR pile right now? Right now I’m re-listening to the Codex Alera series by Jim Butcher. It’s an amazing mix of fantast, action, intrigue and romance. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? It’s hard to choose! I had so much fun writing this book, but the first time Sterling decodes a clue was really fun, and I loved writing the ending. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) Not really, unless lots of coffee counts as a quirk.
