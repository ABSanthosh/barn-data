  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Defense of Huo Quiana (Shadow Casters Series Book 2)? Oddly enough, the spark for this series came from when I was on an evening walk with my wife and we were making shadow puppets on the side of a walkway tunnel, which inspired my idea for a magic system based on forming shadow symbols! But Shadow Casters is so much more than that. It is truly inspired from an assortment of my favorite books, movies, shows, and video games, like Avatar: The Last Airbender, Harry Potter, Fullmetal Alchemist, Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy, and so many others…creating a set of characters and an intriguing story that I’m thrilled to share with the world! Defense of Huo Quiana is the second book in the series and specifically explores seeing the world through others’ perspectives, even when it’s challenging or uncomfortable. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Ironically I read more science fiction than I read fantasy! But I love both, and I read plenty of both genres. After I finish the Shadow Casters series, I’d like to write a sci-fi series I’ve had planned for several years. What books are on your TBR pile right now? So, so many! I just finished reading Book 3 in the Red Rising series so I’m eager to finish the rest of those. I also have heard such good things about The Sword of Kaigen that I’d like to read it too. At some point I’d really like to get to the Expanse Series and I’m really intrigued by what I’ve heard about The Will of the Many. I’ve also been putting the books of all the fellow indie authors I interact with on my TBR so the list is getting quite long! What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I have to pick two. Without spoiling anything, the “casters’ clash” scene in Torcia and the scene in the Wellinway Mountains where the main characters execute Nigel’s big plan to confront the raiders are my two favorite parts in Book 2! Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) Not really… unless you count re-reading and over scrutinizing chapters to a fault in the wee hours of the night a quirky writing habit haha! Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? I want to do a better job of figuring out how to embrace it, but I’ve always loved a quote from the movie 3 Idiots – “Make your passion your profession, then work becomes play.” Creative writing is definitely my passion so I’m doing all I can to make that path a reality! If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? An excitement for the characters/direction of the series, a deeper desire to see the world from others’ perspectives, and an excitement to read more!
