  "text": "06 Feb 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Forest Walk on a Friday? I’ve been writing personal essays for decades, and have had many published in literary journals and magazines around the world. While I mostly focus on writing novels, I wanted to pull together my strongest essays in a collection to give readers a sense of my journey as a person, which informs my writing. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I love reading historical fiction, but I write mostly contemporary fiction or creative nonfiction essays. What books are on your TBR pile right now? The Wolf Hunt by Ayelet Gundar-Goshen, My Favorite Plant: Writers and Gardeners on the Plants They Love, A Person is a Prayer by Ammar Kalia, The Language of Trees by Katie Holten, What We Give Away by Paulette Stout What scene in your book was your favorite to write? My favorite essay in the book is The Roads We Travel, about a relationship I had in my 20s when I was contemplating becoming religious in Judaism. Much of the relationship was spent on the road as we lived in different states, and I paralleled the idea of a journey with my religious journey. I think it was effective. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I have several writing playlists and I love lighting candles in my writing space. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? That it’s ok to be human and have flaws. You can still love your life. And that life is about evolving, not about staying the same. Buy The Book Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly. meghan Recommended Posts",
