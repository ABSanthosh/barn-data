  "description": "Even before the author could read, his grandmother wrote him letters almost weekly. “In fact,” he notes, “I have few memories that come before my remembrance of receiving regular missives from ‘Mama Ceal’ as we called her.” For almost 30 years (until his grandmother died in 1995), these letters were a constant presence in Pryor’s life. Blending his own story with that of his grandmother (as retold in her letters), the author offers a fascinating look at Black life in Arkansas during the eras of Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement, and beyond. Born Lucille Hatch in 1920s rural Arkansas, Mama Ceal lived a life like many Black Americans in the segregated South. Impoverished and denied access to the opportunities afforded white children, Lucille ended her formal schooling after she completed the eighth grade. Despite her limited education and subsequent full-time job as a live-in maid, Mama Ceal forged her own family and used her precious spare time to become a prolific writer who left behind a treasure trove of letters to her descendants. The letters, which are scattered throughout Pryor’s narrative, provide ample fodder for the author to retell his grandmother’s stories of growing up in a “shotgun house” (“you could shoot a shotgun through the open front door and the shot could exit through the open back door without hitting a thing”). They also serve as a springboard for the author to reflect on American race relations more broadly; Pryor recounts conversations with his own children about systemic racism and social injustice in the wake of the murders of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. While the book does not shy away from the ways in which racism continues to affect Black families more than 100 years after the birth of Mama Ceal, it is ultimately a love letter from a grandson to his grandmother. “Without any signs or indications that she would be successful,” the author writes, “Mama Ceal did what she could to make her small world better.”",

  "text": "LOVE, PAMELA by Pamela Anderson ‧ RELEASE DATE: Jan. 31, 2023 A juicy story with some truly crazy moments, yet Anderson's good heart shines through. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 46 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller The iconic model tells the story of her eventful life. According to the acknowledgments, this memoir started as \"a fifty-page poem and then grew into hundreds of pages of…more poetry.\" Readers will be glad that Anderson eventually turned to writing prose, since the well-told anecdotes and memorable character sketches are what make it a page-turner. The poetry (more accurately described as italicized notes-to-self with line breaks) remains strewn liberally through the pages, often summarizing the takeaway or the emotional impact of the events described: \"I was / and still am / an exceptionally / easy target. / And, / I'm proud of that.\" This way of expressing herself is part of who she is, formed partly by her passion for Anaïs Nin and other writers; she is a serious maven of literature and the arts. The narrative gets off to a good start with Anderson’s nostalgic memories of her childhood in coastal Vancouver, raised by very young, very wild, and not very competent parents. Here and throughout the book, the author displays a remarkable lack of anger. She has faced abuse and mistreatment of many kinds over the decades, but she touches on the most appalling passages lightly—though not so lightly you don't feel the torment of the media attention on the events leading up to her divorce from Tommy Lee. Her trip to the pages of Playboy, which involved an escape from a violent fiance and sneaking across the border, is one of many jaw-dropping stories. In one interesting passage, Julian Assange's mother counsels Anderson to desexualize her image in order to be taken more seriously as an activist. She decided that “it was too late to turn back now”—that sexy is an inalienable part of who she is. Throughout her account of this kooky, messed-up, enviable, and often thrilling life, her humility (her sons \"are true miracles, considering the gene pool\") never fails her. A juicy story with some truly crazy moments, yet Anderson's good heart shines through.
