Whether it’s uncovering hidden gems, analyzing literary trends, or championing diverse voices, Book Riot’s editorial team is here to keep you informed and inspired. View All posts by Community Book Riot has been doing what we do since 2011: recommending buzzy and under-the-radar books, reporting on headlines from the world of books and publishing, and bringing you progressive, feminist, inclusive bookish content. We’re the largest independent editorial book site in North America, and that’s all thanks to you. We currently host 20+ newsletters and six podcasts covering a wide range of genres, categories, and themes, plus giveaways and book deals for smarter book buying. We drop daily doses of breaking news to help you stay in the know and level up your reading life, including resources for improving media literacy and combating book bans and censorship. We do this work because it matters, and offer most of it to our readers at no cost.  In 2025 and beyond, we want to bring you even more: more recommendations, more news, more bookish deep dives and hot takes. We can do that with the support of our All Access members.  As an All Access Member, you get more books and more perks. You’ll have access to community features like commenting and poll participation, and the opportunity to interact with other book lovers like you. You’ll get unlimited access to exclusive bonus content, including expert insights about publishing and book culture, and recommendations from the editorial desk. You’ll also be supporting the work of an independent media company, and we can’t thank you enough for that. If you believe that coverage of books and reading should be just as diverse as books and readers are and want to support the work we do, we hope you’ll consider becoming an All Access member today. In Reading Color A weekly newsletter focusing on literature by and about people of color!",
