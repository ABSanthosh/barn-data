  "description": "This year marks the centenary of the birth of James Baldwin, an essayist and novelist whose reputation seems only to grow by the year. “Long before terms like ‘intersectionality’ and ‘non-binary’ entered our common parlance, Baldwin recognised the complex ambiguities that define our sexual identity,” writes activist and educator Stella Dadzie in her introduction. “His bequest to future generations was a fierce abhorrence of injustice and an equally fierce belief in the enduring power of love.” This anthology collects essays and poems inspired by Baldwin’s life and work from people who knew him personally or simply came to know him through his writing. Lindsay Barrett recalls meeting the author in Paris, where the famous Baldwin complimented him on a piece he had published and offered to read a draft of his novel. Nii Ayikwei Parkes writes about first discovering Baldwin “when I needed him, in a library in Reading, after a newspaper round on the same foldable green bike that I had ridden into a busy traffic intersection when I felt my father leave the earth.” Scholars like Toyin Agbetu and Michelle Yaa Asantewa excavate the worldview that underpinned Baldwin’s writing, while poets including Roy McFarlane and Ewuare X. Osayande grapple with his ideas in verse. The book also contains numerous photographs of Baldwin from various periods of his life. The pieces are numerous and relatively short, treating the reader to a sampling of perspectives on Baldwin that demonstrate his profound influence not only on writers but also on various academic fields and artistic media. Uniting them is Baldwin’s belief that, despite the tragedies of the past and present, there may still be a bright future ahead. As Parkes writes, “His essays carried and still carry more hope in the world than I have, and I desperately needed hope.”",

  "text": "LOVE, PAMELA by Pamela Anderson ‧ RELEASE DATE: Jan. 31, 2023 A juicy story with some truly crazy moments, yet Anderson's good heart shines through. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 33 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller The iconic model tells the story of her eventful life. According to the acknowledgments, this memoir started as \"a fifty-page poem and then grew into hundreds of pages of…more poetry.\" Readers will be glad that Anderson eventually turned to writing prose, since the well-told anecdotes and memorable character sketches are what make it a page-turner. The poetry (more accurately described as italicized notes-to-self with line breaks) remains strewn liberally through the pages, often summarizing the takeaway or the emotional impact of the events described: \"I was / and still am / an exceptionally / easy target. / And, / I'm proud of that.\" This way of expressing herself is part of who she is, formed partly by her passion for Anaïs Nin and other writers; she is a serious maven of literature and the arts. The narrative gets off to a good start with Anderson’s nostalgic memories of her childhood in coastal Vancouver, raised by very young, very wild, and not very competent parents. Here and throughout the book, the author displays a remarkable lack of anger. She has faced abuse and mistreatment of many kinds over the decades, but she touches on the most appalling passages lightly—though not so lightly you don't feel the torment of the media attention on the events leading up to her divorce from Tommy Lee. Her trip to the pages of Playboy, which involved an escape from a violent fiance and sneaking across the border, is one of many jaw-dropping stories. In one interesting passage, Julian Assange's mother counsels Anderson to desexualize her image in order to be taken more seriously as an activist. She decided that “it was too late to turn back now”—that sexy is an inalienable part of who she is. Throughout her account of this kooky, messed-up, enviable, and often thrilling life, her humility (her sons \"are true miracles, considering the gene pool\") never fails her. A juicy story with some truly crazy moments, yet Anderson's good heart shines through.
