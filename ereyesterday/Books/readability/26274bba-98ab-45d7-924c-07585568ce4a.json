These six brand-new sports romance novels bring all the feels, from fiery chemistry to inspiring journeys on and off the field. Whether you’re a fan of swoon-worthy athletes, fierce competition, or the perfect mix of love and ambition, these reads are sure to score big with you! Chase Lovett Wants Me by Helena Hunting Release Date: January 10 2025 Chase Lovett. Star of my (unrequited) fantasies. Hottest guy on campus. Hockey god. And thanks to a fire in the dorms, he just became my accidental roommate. My name is Cammie Lovelock and this is the worst, best thing that’s ever happened to me. Buy on Amazon Face Me Off (Cessna U Hockey Book 2) by Kimberly Readnour Release Date: January 9 2025 She’s the chaos to my control, the temptation I can’t resist—even if it ruins me. Maddy Grimes hates me, and I deserve it. But one heated mistake leads to a secret pact, and the more we spend time together, the more our frenemies-with-benefits fling feels real. Loving her could cost me everything. Letting her go might cost me more. Buy on Amazon Shoot Your Shot (New England Bay Sharks Book 2) by Hannah Gray Release Date: January 9 2025 Realizing I will lose her again before I truly have her back, I offer her a deal. Ten days to prove we should have never separated. Ten days to redeem myself. And ten days to come clean about everything I’ve been hiding. Should be easy enough, right? Buy on Amazon The Fake Play (Pucking Daddies) by Mia Mara Release Date: January 9 2025 Luke Smith only takes one thing in life seriously. Hockey. He thinks every problem can be solved with a grin. And those big brown puppy-dog eyes? His get-out-of-jail-free card. But not this last time… and now it’s my job to fix his reputation before he gets traded. To keep the puck bunnies away, I agree to fake date him. A complete puck-up. Buy on Amazon The Puck Chase (Fairfield U Book 3) by G.N. Wright Release Date: January 10 2025 Starting my senior year at FU everything was as perfect as always, but sometimes just because you play on the same team, doesn’t mean you can play nice. And it turns out I enjoy taunting a certain teammate just as much as I enjoy being on the ice. Buy on Amazon Rafferty (A Pittsburgh Titans Novel) by Sawyer Bennett Release Date: January 14 2025 Rafferty Abrams has been having the time of his life since joining the Pittsburgh Titans, but a poorly thought out one-night stand is about to cause unwanted drama with potentially serious repercussions.
