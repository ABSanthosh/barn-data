  "description": "This book opens in a similar manner to the author/illustrator’s Kirkus-starred earlier work, My Love for You Is Like a Garden (2023), with its titular sentence, followed by nonrhyming text—this time, inviting readers to imagine affection on a scale of the vastness of space. As an adult and a child (both portrayed as pale-skinned) sit together on what appears to be a grassy hill, they look up at the night sky as the text describes love with evocative phrases. The last book featured a lot of real-world sensory description, and there’s understandably less of that this time—one can’t touch stars or smell planets—but it still manages to be engaging by using star-watching similes, including “as radiant as a meteor shower” and “as dependable as the phases of the moon.” An illustrated glossary encourages readers to go back and find various objects, and a solar system diagram and moon-phase chart add helpful information. Again, the real star of this book (no pun intended) is Smetana’s imagery, which combines watercolor and collage. Although the stars, planets, and galaxies are somewhat less complex than the last book’s flowers, they are beautiful, with intricate compositions reminiscent of Eric Carle’s work.",

  "text": "LITTLE BLUE TRUCK'S SPRINGTIME From the Little Blue Truck series by Alice Schertle ; illustrated by Jill McElmurry ‧ RELEASE DATE: Jan. 2, 2018 Uncomplicated fun that sets readers up for the earlier, more-complicated books to come. Little Blue Truck and his pal Toad meet friends old and new on a springtime drive through the country. This lift-the-flap, interactive entry in the popular Little Blue Truck series lacks the narrative strength and valuable life lessons of the original Little Blue Truck (2008) and its sequel, Little Blue Truck Leads the Way (2009). Both of those books, published for preschoolers rather than toddlers, featured rich storylines, dramatic, kinetic illustrations, and simple but valuable life lessons—the folly of taking oneself too seriously, the importance of friends, and the virtue of taking turns, for example. At about half the length and with half as much text as the aforementioned titles, this volume is a much quicker read. Less a story than a vernal celebration, the book depicts a bucolic drive through farmland and encounters with various animals and their young along the way. Beautifully rendered two-page tableaux teem with butterflies, blossoms, and vibrant pastel, springtime colors. Little Blue greets a sheep standing in the door of a barn: “Yoo-hoo, Sheep! / Beep-beep! / What’s new?” Folding back the durable, card-stock flap reveals the barn’s interior and an adorable set of twin lambs. Encounters with a duck and nine ducklings, a cow with a calf, a pig with 10 (!) piglets, a family of bunnies, and a chicken with a freshly hatched chick provide ample opportunity for counting and vocabulary work. Uncomplicated fun that sets readers up for the earlier, more-complicated books to come.
