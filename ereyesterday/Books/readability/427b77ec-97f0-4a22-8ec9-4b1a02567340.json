  "description": "Carl Box calls it “a bit of mischief” when he learns that Aunt Lillian has left him land in France upon her apparent death. He doesn’t want to travel at all, much less for someone he barely knows, and what little he does know of his aunt suggests she was estranged from the family for unclear reasons. When he arrives in Paris, he does all of the right things; he goes to her apartment and searches for information. After retrieving her ashes, Carl learns three things about his aunt: She is, in fact, alive; she’s being pursued by a mysterious killer; and she’s been smuggling KGB documents from Moscow to Paris to use as leverage to free her lover from wrongful imprisonment in a psychiatric institution. She has, along with faking her own death, selected her nephew to lend credibility to this ruse, but once he becomes a suspect in her murder, Lily gets him to help her gather information and escape certain death. Graham folds these larger-than-life events together masterfully, using humorous dialogue and specific details to bring readers into the world and make it real. Her vivid descriptions make easy work of picturing each situation and place: “Billy had taken to his Prussian blue dog bed like an overwrought lady in a Victorian melodrama.” Likewise, Graham does a remarkable job of building suspense throughout her novel, and each section comes with both new questions and answers, continually giving readers fresh developments to ponder. Additionally, the cast’s voices infuse levity and personality into the text. For example, in response to Carl revealing that the police suspected him to be Lily’s killer, she replies nonchalantly: “‘But of course you didn’t,’ she said soothingly while spooning potatoes onto [Carl’s] plate.” These parts swirl together to create a striking balance of excitement, humor, and sincerity, perfect for anyone seeking a lively, twisty adventure.",

  "text": "WARD D by Freida McFadden ‧ RELEASE DATE: March 4, 2025 A superior entry in the night-on-the-nightmare-ward genre. A medical student is assigned an overnight shift to observe a Long Island hospital’s psychiatric ward and help with emergencies. You’d never guess what happens next. Amy Brenner isn’t even interested in psychiatry, the one medical specialty she’s never considered for her own career. Nor is she interested any more in Cameron Berger, the classmate who ended their relationship so that he could spend more time studying, and she’s not pleased to learn that he’s switched his rotation with another student so he can spend some of the next 13 hours persuading Amy to rekindle their romance. Predictably, Cam will be the least of Amy’s troubles. Apart from Dr. Richard Beck and nurse Ramona Dutton, everyone else on Ward D is much more dangerous, from elderly Mary Cummings, whose knitting needles aren’t plastic but sharpened steel, to William Schoenfeld, who’s stopped taking the medications that were supposed to silence the voices telling him to kill people, to Damon Sawyer, who’s confined in Seclusion One and can’t possibly escape, unless a power outage neutralizes the locks. Most threatening of all is Jade Carpenter, whose close friendship with Amy ended eight years ago when Amy turned her in for what ended up being only one of a whole series of thrill crimes. McFadden measures out the complications, revelations, and betrayals with such an expert hand that readers anxiously trying to figure out whom Amy can trust as her goal shifts from ticking off a toilsome requirement to surviving the night may well end up wondering whom they can trust themselves. And isn’t provoking that kind of paranoia what medical thrillers are all about? A superior entry in the night-on-the-nightmare-ward genre.
