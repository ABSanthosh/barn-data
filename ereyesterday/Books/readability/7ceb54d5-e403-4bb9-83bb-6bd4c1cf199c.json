  "text": "14 May 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write First Ascent (Ascending Carbon Series Book 1)? I’m inspired by our natural world, and not just here on Earth, but everywhere and everywhen. I learn something new every day, and my characters represent that quest for knowledge and discovery. For this book, I spent a year working closely with physicists and engineers at the International Space Elevator Consortium, ISEC. What did I learn? You and I are very likely to see the world’s first working space elevator in our lifetime. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of First Ascent (Ascending Carbon Series Book 1), what would they be? Elevator by Drug Store Romeos. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Hard science fiction, especially first contact and time travel stories that are based on real science. What books are on your TBR pile right now? More from Craig Falconer, Peter Cawdron, and Rysa Walker. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I enjoy writing scenes that take characters (and readers) by surprise. Twists, in the language of plot. In this book, there are several, but a favorite has the main character receiving breaking news from the other side of the world. She looks up with a quizzical expression and says, “Wait… there are two?” Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) While I write, I’m surrounded by story props, some of which I make myself. For this book, I constructed several allotropes of carbon from a molecular kit! Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? My favorite word is “discover.” My newsletters always start with, “Science Fiction Begins with Science.” If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Our universe is grander than we know and more amazing than we can imagine.
