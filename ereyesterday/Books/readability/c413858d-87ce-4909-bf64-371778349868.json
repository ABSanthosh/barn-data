  "description": "Devon Paige has made a grave misstep: She was caught mid-kiss with Bentley Preston, husband of her employer Julianna. Devon has worked hard to build up her clientele as a personal chef in Boston, but Julianna Preston is quick to get the word out, and soon Devon is fired from all her contracts but one. At loose ends, she accepts a job offer as dining services director at the Rockwood boarding school in New Hampshire, desperate to get away from all the attention. When Devon arrives in New Hampshire, there is a surprise waiting for her: a blast from the past in the form of history and government teacher (and soccer coach) Kyle Holling. Back in 2007, Devon spent one romantic night with Kyle, then never saw him again. Kyle is now divorced and available, and their attraction has not gone away. Bouchard’s romance trundles along at a good speed. In the course of the story, the author touches on questions of whether there is ever room for second chances in romance and what to do when life throws you a curveball. Devon is entirely relatable in the position in which she has found herself, if not necessarily for how she got there. While her chemistry with a paramedic called Heath seems anything but natural—it’s a placeholder romance from the start—her big-sisterly relationship with basketball player David Anders, who remains her only client after her initial indiscretion, is a welcome side plot that shows the caring nature of her character. The glimpse into the world of boarding-school gossip is also fun (Devon observes, “Apparently, I had fled one scandal-ridden situation for another one”), avoiding predictable tropes about going from the big city to a small town. Bouchard does not settle for a one-dimensional story, and the romance fares better because of it.",

  "text": "THE LAST LETTER by Rebecca Yarros ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 26, 2019 A thoughtful and pensive tale with intelligent characters and a satisfying romance. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 195 Our Verdict GET IT Kirkus Reviews' Best Books Of 2019 A promise to his best friend leads an Army serviceman to a family in need and a chance at true love in this novel. Beckett Gentry is surprised when his Army buddy Ryan MacKenzie gives him a letter from Ryan’s sister, Ella. Abandoned by his mother, Beckett grew up in a series of foster homes. He is wary of attachments until he reads Ella’s letter. A single mother, Ella lives with her twins, Maisie and Colt, at Solitude, the resort she operates in Telluride, Colorado. They begin a correspondence, although Beckett can only identify himself by his call sign, Chaos. After Ryan’s death during a mission, Beckett travels to Telluride as his friend had requested. He bonds with the twins while falling deeply in love with Ella. Reluctant to reveal details of Ryan’s death and risk causing her pain, Beckett declines to disclose to Ella that he is Chaos. Maisie needs treatment for neuroblastoma, and Beckett formally adopts the twins as a sign of his commitment to support Ella and her children. He and Ella pursue a romance, but when an insurance investigator questions the adoption, Beckett is faced with revealing the truth about the letters and Ryan’s death, risking losing the family he loves. Yarros’ (Wilder, 2016, etc.) novel is a deeply felt and emotionally nuanced contemporary romance bolstered by well-drawn characters and strong, confident storytelling. Beckett and Ella are sympathetic protagonists whose past experiences leave them cautious when it comes to love. Beckett never knew the security of a stable home life. Ella impulsively married her high school boyfriend, but the marriage ended when he discovered she was pregnant. The author is especially adept at developing the characters through subtle but significant details, like Beckett’s aversion to swearing. Beckett and Ella’s romance unfolds slowly in chapters that alternate between their first-person viewpoints. The letters they exchanged are pivotal to their connection, and almost every chapter opens with one. Yarros’ writing is crisp and sharp, with passages that are poetic without being florid. For example, in a letter to Beckett, Ella writes of motherhood: “But I’m not the center of their universe. I’m more like their gravity.” While the love story is the book’s focus, the subplot involving Maisie’s illness is equally well-developed, and the link between Beckett and the twins is heartfelt and sincere. A thoughtful and pensive tale with intelligent characters and a satisfying romance.
