  "text": "16 Oct 2024 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Burn the Freeze? I’ve always been fascinated with how the mind potentially relates to the universe. I’ve also been involved with corporate America and seen the greed that many are consumed with. I think those two parts of my background were the impetus for this story. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Burn the Freeze, what would they be? They’re in their forties so it would most likely not be current. I’d say anything that has an edge and rebellious spirit to it – The Clash, punk rock, Public Enemy. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Thrillers, Sci-Fi, Classics. What books are on your TBR pile right now? The Midnight Library, The One. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? The scenes where the main character is tapping into universe intelligence. I also enjoy creating a dystopian world. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Don’t judge others. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Try to do what they can to eliminate the polarization and hatred that some people seem consumed with. Also, try to understand new technology since it’s what people in power ultimately use to govern society.
