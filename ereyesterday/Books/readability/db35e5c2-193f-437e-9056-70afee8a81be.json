  "text": "This content contains affiliate links. When you buy through these links, we may earn an affiliate commission. I read about 100 books a year, and most of those are queer. Since I started my book blog The Lesbrary, queer books—especially sapphic books—have taken over my reading life, and I couldn’t be happier about it. But that means that trying to narrow down a favourites list is tricky. I keep a running list of more than 100 sapphic books I recommend, never mind other queer books.Recently, though, a BookTuber I follow invited members to submit a list of their top 20 books of all time. Since I already put in the work of narrowing down my favourites for that, I thought I’d share them with you! Of the 20 books I submitted, 15 were queer, naturally.Because most of my reading has been sapphic (thanks to the Lesbrary), most of these books are, too. I also know that if I was asked on a different day, this list would change dramatically. It’s a good reminder of the range of genres, formats, and age categories that resonate with me: historical fiction, epic fantasy, kids’ graphic novels, memoir, manga, and sci-fi horror are all represented in my faves. Without further ado, here is the ranked list of my favourite queer books of all time, starting with #15. Content for All Access Members continues below.
