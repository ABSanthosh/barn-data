  "description": "At first, Judy Ruono seems to be a guileless 20-something, while the seemingly omnipotent Foundation is portrayed as a many-tentacled organization that enslaves young women as part of their plans to blackmail powerful figures around the world. However, it soon becomes clear that the Foundation isn’t the unassailable juggernaut it seems to be, and that Judy’s no pushover. Although she’s initially fooled by the Foundation’s promises of an overseas acting gig, it isn’t long before she begins to unravel the awful truth about “Panomnes Productions” and the “Gartfoil Agency.” She’s helped in this endeavor by a couple of new acquaintances with whom she bonds after surviving a murder attempt: former lawyer James Torquil Graham and his friend Roddy, both from Scotland. The trio are undeniably brave and resourceful, but they aren’t superheroes; Blackwood pointedly renders them as ordinary folks. Indeed, they effectively embody one of the novel’s central themes: that ordinary people can be powerful when push comes to shove. This is developed further when Judy moves beyond the goal of her own liberation and sets out to champion other victims of the wealthy Foundation. In many ways, Blackwood delivers a revenge fantasy that feels well suited to the present day, despite its future setting. It’s too often bogged down by unwieldy lines, however, as in this late sketch of a major villain: “He had an air that denied any possibility of reform, but only of stunned acceptance for a while with the pretence of cooperation with humanity before, in time, another means might present itself for taking revenge on society for whatever were its faults in his eyes.” Still, the adventure remains engaging, largely due to the lively interplay between Judy, James, and Roddy, and the triumphant glee they find in taking on corrupt and dangerous institutions.",

  "text": "DEVOLUTION by Max Brooks ‧ RELEASE DATE: June 16, 2020 A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 229 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Are we not men? We are—well, ask Bigfoot, as Brooks does in this delightful yarn, following on his bestseller World War Z(2006). A zombie apocalypse is one thing. A volcanic eruption is quite another, for, as the journalist who does a framing voice-over narration for Brooks’ latest puts it, when Mount Rainier popped its cork, “it was the psychological aspect, the hyperbole-fueled hysteria that had ended up killing the most people.” Maybe, but the sasquatches whom the volcano displaced contributed to the statistics, too, if only out of self-defense. Brooks places the epicenter of the Bigfoot war in a high-tech hideaway populated by the kind of people you might find in a Jurassic Park franchise: the schmo who doesn’t know how to do much of anything but tries anyway, the well-intentioned bleeding heart, the know-it-all intellectual who turns out to know the wrong things, the immigrant with a tough backstory and an instinct for survival. Indeed, the novel does double duty as a survival manual, packed full of good advice—for instance, try not to get wounded, for “injury turns you from a giver to a taker. Taking up our resources, our time to care for you.” Brooks presents a case for making room for Bigfoot in the world while peppering his narrative with timely social criticism about bad behavior on the human side of the conflict: The explosion of Rainier might have been better forecast had the president not slashed the budget of the U.S. Geological Survey, leading to “immediate suspension of the National Volcano Early Warning System,” and there’s always someone around looking to monetize the natural disaster and the sasquatch-y onslaught that follows. Brooks is a pro at building suspense even if it plays out in some rather spectacularly yucky episodes, one involving a short spear that takes its name from “the sucking sound of pulling it out of the dead man’s heart and lungs.” Grossness aside, it puts you right there on the scene. A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy.
