View All posts by Erica Ezeifedi During the inaugural sermon in January, Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde made a plea for Trump to have mercy on queer people and migrants. This was, unsurprisingly, met with ire. She was called a “Radical Left hard line Trump hater” and asked to issue an apology. Well, she didn’t, and now her bestselling book How We Learn to Be Brave — described as “an inspirational guide to the key junctures in life that…pave the way for us to become our most courageous selves”—will have a young adult and a picture book version. Bryan Bliss will adapt the young adult version, We Can Be Brave, while Holly Hatam will illustrate the picture book version, I Can Learn to Be Brave. In a statement, Budde said, “Every day, children and adolescents face challenges that require great courage — from taking their first steps to walking through the doors of a new school. With these books, I hope to remind young readers that learning to be brave is simply part of life.” The young adult book is expected this year, October 25th, and the picture book the summer of 2026.
