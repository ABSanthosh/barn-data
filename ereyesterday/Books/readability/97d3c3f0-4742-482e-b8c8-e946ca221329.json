  "description": "Princess Kiar is already worried about the kingdom of Valenia’s upcoming winter as wildlife eats or tramples the realm’s crops. She’s further unnerved when her grandmother forwards a vague warning (“the past has come back”). This may be a reference to the kingdom’s bog, which is seemingly getting bigger and overtaking the pasture. Kiar feels a presence out in that bog, as if something is watching her and her loved ones, including her foster brother and romantic interest Tuan. Indeed, locals describe raiders resembling walking trees with an eerie “stiff-jointed” style of mobility invading their farmsteads, apparently after the livestock. These monstrous “bog-walkers” are difficult to take down, which Kiar and her family quickly learn during a confrontation that leaves King Tir seriously injured. Valenians aren’t the only ones under threat of the expanding bog; someone from northern enemy territory of Noermark asks for Kiar’s help. The princess desperately searches for background about the bog-walkers—where they’re from and why they seem particularly afraid of her. Nods to the first installment in the series, The Swan Harp (2024), are clearly and concisely woven into Kiar’s first-person narration, though a few relatively minor characters pop up with no reminders of their pre-existing relationships. Kiar and her family are a well-rounded bunch, most of them “swanfolk” with an ability to shift between swan and human forms. They find themselves in exhilarating battle scenes that require combat skills and shrewdness as well as magic. The bog-walkers are exceedingly creepy, even after the story illuminates their mysterious origin. A rousing first half is followed by a somewhat less-exciting second half and a noticeably prolonged final act. Nonetheless, the closing pages offer surprises and plenty of reasons to stick around for the upcoming finale.",

  "text": "IF ONLY I HAD TOLD HER by Laura Nowlin ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 6, 2024 A heavy read about the harsh realities of tragedy and their effects on those left behind. In this companion novel to 2013’s If He Had Been With Me, three characters tell their sides of the story. Finn’s narrative starts three days before his death. He explores the progress of his unrequited love for best friend Autumn up until the day he finally expresses his feelings. Finn’s story ends with his tragic death, which leaves his close friends devastated, unmoored, and uncertain how to go on. Jack’s section follows, offering a heartbreaking look at what it’s like to live with grief. Jack works to overcome the anger he feels toward Sylvie, the girlfriend Finn was breaking up with when he died, and Autumn, the girl he was preparing to build his life around (but whom Jack believed wasn’t good enough for Finn). But when Jack sees how Autumn’s grief matches his own, it changes their understanding of one another. Autumn’s chapters trace her life without Finn as readers follow her struggles with mental health and balancing love and loss. Those who have read the earlier book will better connect with and feel for these characters, particularly since they’ll have a more well-rounded impression of Finn. The pain and anger is well written, and the novel highlights the most troublesome aspects of young adulthood: overconfidence sprinkled with heavy insecurities, fear-fueled decisions, bad communication, and brash judgments. Characters are cued white. A heavy read about the harsh realities of tragedy and their effects on those left behind.
