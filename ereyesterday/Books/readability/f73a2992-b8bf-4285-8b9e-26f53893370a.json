  "description": "“Dear Cutie: You are invited to the annual Pig Town Party,” reads the invitation that floats through the narrator’s mail slot. The child, tan-skinned with triangular black pigtails, a cartoonishly square jaw, and dots for eyes, agrees that she is a cutie, but she has many questions, not the least of which is, “Where is Pig Town?” The porcine mail carrier whom she asks for directions darts through a hole in a hedge, and when the girl follows, she ends up in a town populated entirely by anthropomorphic pigs. When the child finds the eponymous party in full swing, all the pigs seem to be in costume. What’s more, pigs keep complimenting her costume, even though she isn’t wearing one, just her regular blue dress. When Cutie is announced as the winner of the costume contest, the child wonders if there’s been a mistake. That’s when the real Cutie, a pig wearing an identical blue dress, appears and demands her rightful prize, a huge chocolate cake; this has all been a case of mistaken identity. But the child refuses to back down. Marked by droll humor in both the text and the images, this farcical tale stars a protagonist with outsize expressions and a big personality. The satisfying resolution sees the mischievous youngster get her just deserts.",

  "text": "THE LEAF THIEF by Alice Hemming ; illustrated by Nicola Slater ‧ RELEASE DATE: Aug. 1, 2021 A hilarious autumnal comedy of errors. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 10 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller A confused squirrel overreacts to the falling autumn leaves. Relaxing on a tree branch, Squirrel admires the red, gold, and orange leaves. Suddenly Squirrel screams, “One of my leaves is…MISSING!” Searching for the leaf, Squirrel tells Bird, “Someone stole my leaf!” Spying Mouse sailing in a leaf boat, Squirrel asks if Mouse stole the leaf. Mouse calmly replies in the negative. Bird reminds Squirrel it’s “perfectly normal to lose a leaf or two at this time of year.” Next morning Squirrel panics again, shrieking, “MORE LEAVES HAVE BEEN STOLEN!” Noticing Woodpecker arranging colorful leaves, Squirrel queries, “Are those my leaves?” Woodpecker tells Squirrel, “No.” Again, Bird assures Squirrel that no one’s taking the leaves and that the same thing happened last year, then encourages Squirrel to relax. Too wired to relax despite some yoga and a bath, the next day Squirrel cries “DISASTER” at the sight of bare branches. Frantic now, Squirrel becomes suspicious upon discovering Bird decorating with multicolored leaves. Is Bird the culprit? In response, Bird shows Squirrel the real Leaf Thief: the wind. Squirrel’s wildly dramatic, misguided, and hyperpossessive reaction to a routine seasonal event becomes a rib-tickling farce through clever use of varying type sizes and weights emphasizing his absurd verbal pronouncements as well as exaggerated, comic facial expressions and body language. Bold colors, arresting perspectives, and intense close-ups enhance Squirrel’s histrionics. Endnotes explain the science behind the phenomenon. A hilarious autumnal comedy of errors.
