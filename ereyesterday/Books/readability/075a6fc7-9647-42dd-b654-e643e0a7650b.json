  "description": "In these pages, anecdotes from the author’s life, career, and participation in sports exemplify his teachings, which extol the virtues of integrity, timeliness, humility, discipline, a positive attitude, and continual improvement (Rogers focuses on Thursdays because he emailed his first motivational message to coaching clients on that day in 2019). The author cites his father and his high school football coach as his greatest mentors, but he also highlights other people as examples of excellence, like his popular barber—Rogers notes his barber’s success isn’t due to his haircutting savvy but to his personality. The author also praises various businesses, like the Markel Group, a company that emphasizes honesty, fairness, and even humor in their work style. Among Rogers’ original concepts is “Treadmill Accountability,” which takes the idea that treadmills don’t lie and uses it as a metaphor for brutal honesty with oneself in the personal and professional spheres. The aphorism “God gave us two ears and one mouth for a reason” inspires the author’s command to “Respect the Ratio,” meaning leaders should listen more than they talk. Rogers cautions against “The Waiting Place,” a state characterized by hesitation and procrastination in which progress dies. He concludes with a reminder that there’s “no finish line” to self-improvement. (As an extra motivational push, Rogers signs off each message with “Average sits on the bench.”) The book’s short chapters and weekly reading structure will make it easy for leaders to stay inspired. Rogers also infuses his advice with humor: One of his team’s “three simple rules” is “Do not be f****** late.” The author unabashedly encourages black-and-white thinking, and some observations (“We all know the professionals execute the boring while the amateurs lie to themselves”) lack nuance. The sports metaphors may seem excessive and unrelatable to those uninterested in professional athletics.",

  "text": "THE CULTURE MAP BREAKING THROUGH THE INVISIBLE BOUNDARIES OF GLOBAL BUSINESS by Erin Meyer ‧ RELEASE DATE: May 27, 2014 These are not hard and fast rules, but Meyer delivers important reading for those engaged in international business. A helpful guide to working effectively with people from other cultures. “The sad truth is that the vast majority of managers who conduct business internationally have little understanding about how culture is impacting their work,” writes Meyer, a professor at INSEAD, an international business school. Yet they face a wider array of work styles than ever before in dealing with clients, suppliers and colleagues from around the world. When is it best to speak or stay quiet? What is the role of the leader in the room? When working with foreign business people, failing to take cultural differences into account can lead to frustration, misunderstanding or worse. Based on research and her experiences teaching cross-cultural behaviors to executive students, the author examines a handful of key areas. Among others, they include communicating (Anglo-Saxons are explicit; Asians communicate implicitly, requiring listeners to read between the lines), developing a sense of trust (Brazilians do it over long lunches), and decision-making (Germans rely on consensus, Americans on one decider). In each area, the author provides a “culture map scale” that positions behaviors in more than 20 countries along a continuum, allowing readers to anticipate the preferences of individuals from a particular country: Do they like direct or indirect negative feedback? Are they rigid or flexible regarding deadlines? Do they favor verbal or written commitments? And so on. Meyer discusses managers who have faced perplexing situations, such as knowledgeable team members who fail to speak up in meetings or Indians who offer a puzzling half-shake, half-nod of the head. Cultural differences—not personality quirks—are the motivating factors behind many behavioral styles. Depending on our cultures, we understand the world in a particular way, find certain arguments persuasive or lacking merit, and consider some ways of making decisions or measuring time natural and others quite strange. These are not hard and fast rules, but Meyer delivers important reading for those engaged in international business.
