  "description": "Invoking Sun Tzu’s The Art of War, O’Neill-Butler explores the subversive, surprising, and often brilliant tactics of artists fighting for social change. Ten case studies spanning five decades illustrate the original ways artists have demonstrated against unjust practices, “from protesting to philanthropy, and from wheat pasting to planting a field of wheat.” O’Neill-Butler, a former editor of Artforum, shares her intimate knowledge of these movements and draws on conversations with activists, including the painter Faith Ringgold, the art critic Lucy Lippard, and the photographer Nan Goldin. Their protests transformed museums: In the 1960s, the Art Workers Coalition forced the Museum of Modern Art to allow free admission, to include more artists of color, and to take a moral stance against the Vietnam War by juxtaposing photos of the My Lai massacre with Picasso’s Guernica. The Ad Hoc Women Artists’ Committee shamed the Whitney Museum to include more work by women by issuing a forged press release on museum letterhead announcing that half the artists in a touted exhibition would be women. Goldin, who had become addicted to OxyContin, organized PAIN to demand that museums end “artwashing” by the billionaire Sackler family, creators of the drug, by removing their name from galleries and rejecting their donations. These artists changed not only the art world but broader society. Benny Andrews of the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition brought drawing classes to men incarcerated in the so-called Tombs, a program that eventually spread to jails and prisons throughout the country. Edgar Heap of Birds, known for his innovative monoprints, endowed galleries to showcase Native American art. Painter Rick Lowe restored dilapidated shotgun shacks in Houston to create low-income housing and community cultural spaces. For a volume about art and artists, the book contains too few visuals, but O’Neill-Butler’s vivid writing makes up for that shortcoming.",

  "text": "DAVID HOCKNEY edited by Norman Rosenthal ‧ RELEASE DATE: June 3, 2025 A beautifully produced, engaging homage. Celebrating a beloved artist. Published to coincide with a major exhibition of works by British-born artist David Hockney (b. 1937) at the Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris, this lushly illustrated volume offers a detailed overview of the artist’s life and work, along with chapters focused on his various styles and subject matter, a chronology, and a glossary of the many techniques he employed in his art, including camera lucida, computer, and video. Contributors of essays include noted art historians and curators, such as Norman Rosenthal, who edited the volume; Simon Schama; Anne Lyles; James Cahill; and François Michaud. Growing up in the north of England, Hockney was drawn to the light and sparkle that he found in Hollywood movies. When he finally arrived in Los Angeles, the sunlit landscapes inspired him, and his new sense of artistic freedom concurred with sexual freedom: As a gay man, he felt liberated from the constraints that had weighed on him in Britain, even in the “relative Bohemia” of the Royal College of Art. Essayists reflect on his artistic interests, such as landscapes, portraiture, flowers, and the opera—for which he created boldly exuberant sets—as well as on his influences and experimentation. Michaud examines the impact on Hockney of a visit to Paris in the 1970s, where he became familiar with Henri Matisse and his contemporaries from museum exhibitions. In the 1990s, visiting his mother and friends in Yorkshire, Hockney painted both outdoors and in the studio, experimenting with various media—including the photocopier and fax machine—as he worked to render the woodsy landscape. As a companion to the exhibition, the volume offers stunning reproductions of Hockney’s prolific works. Enormously popular with museumgoers, Hockney, Rosenthal exults, “transforms the ordinary and the everyday into the remarkable.” A beautifully produced, engaging homage.
