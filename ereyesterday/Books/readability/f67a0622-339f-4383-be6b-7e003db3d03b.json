From hauntingly beautiful prose to thought-provoking narratives, these recent releases are must-adds to your TBR list. Here are the standout titles that deserve a spot on your shelf. L. Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of the Future Volume 41 by L. Ron Hubbard (Author) and more Release Date: April 22, 2025 Step into the extraordinary with L. Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of the Future Volume 41—an anthology that promises the unexpected, the thought-provoking, and the unforgettable. Celebrating the best new voices in speculative fiction, this collection offers gripping tales of science fiction, fantasy, and beyond. Buy on Amazon The Day After His Crucifixion by Merikay McLeod Release Date: April 7, 2025 At last the women speak. While the crucifixion/resurrection event is traditionally told through men’s eyes, The Day After His Crucifixion brings Yeshua the Nazarene’s story alive through the testimony of women who knew him and followed his teachings. Shocked by his brutal execution, these New Testament eye witnesses gather to comfort one another and remind themselves of how Yeshua set them free, bringing them life abundant. Buy on Amazon The Float Test by Lynn Steger Strong Release Date: April 8, 2025 From Lynn Steger Strong, critically acclaimed author of Flight, a sophisticated and layered novel about sisters, betrayal, love, and climate change, for readers of The Dutch House and The Most Fun We Ever Had. Buy on Amazon The Summer That Shaped Us by Lori Wilde Release Date: April 22, 2025 In the Gulf of Mexico, near South Padre, sits a private island with a bit of a magic about it: the colors are brighter, the food tastes better, and turtles and cranes find sanctuary there. The billionaire heiress who built the thriving resort on Hobby Island exclusively for crafters, Eloisa Hobby, is as much a mystery as she is a mentor. Those with troubles are invited in the aftermath of an emotional turmoil, and with help from the other crafters on the island Eloisa acts as a sounding board while she gently and unobtrusively guides the visitors toward healthy resolutions in their lives. Only a few receive the honor of a golden ticket. Buy on Amazon The Death of Us by Abigail Dean Release Date: April 15, 2025 Together, Edward and Isabel move to London. They are young and in love, occupied by friends, work and fun. But late on a spring evening when they are thirty years old, their home is invaded by a serial killer. In the wake of this violation, each tries to come to terms with a night that changed everything — and their marriage begins to crumble. Buy on Amazon The Pretender by Jo Harkin Release Date: April 22, 2025 Set in the tumultuous period of the Tudors’ ascent, The Pretender brings to life the little-known story of Lambert Simnel. From humble beginnings as a peasant boy, Lambert’s life takes an astonishing turn when, at just ten years old, he becomes a claimant to the English throne as one of the last of the Plantagenet line. As Lambert navigates the treacherous waters of royal intrigue and court life, complex themes of identity, power, and destiny unfold, weaving a tapestry of ambition and survival in a world where the stakes couldn’t be higher.
