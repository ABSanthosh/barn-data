  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Starbreaker: Volume 1? Believe it or not, it was the old Spelljammer series way back in the 80s/90s that started this idea brewing in my mind decades ago! I was simply enthralled by the idea of having a fantasy story that simply takes place on a larger scale than just a single world or plane as traditionally done in fantasy. More than that as well, I wanted magic to be a part of regular everyday life for everyone in the story, having it fit the role of technology as typically found in science fiction. After putting all of that together and stewing on it a time, I eventually came up with Starbreaker, in which we see our main character, Sylvas, go from a simple mage on a small, uncontacted planet, to a person who will save the entire galaxy. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? For me, it’s all things fantasy. I’ve loved it for as long as I can remember and it is always my comfort place to go for my reading, which is absolutely perfect as it gives me all the fuel I need for my own writing. There have been many a series of mine inspired by things that I have read, all mashed together into something I found fresh and exciting. What books are on your TBR pile right now? For me I have ‘The City That Would Eat the World’ by John Bierce, and ‘This Inevitable Ruin’ by Matt Dinnaman! What scene in your book was your favorite to write? Oooh, this one is a huge spoiler and I can only hint to it – when Sylvas realizes that everything he was leading up to, wasn’t in fact what he was told it would be. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I almost always walk and write at the same time! I have a nice standing desk and treadmill that I lock myself into first thing most mornings to get my words in for the last several months, and I find that it gets my mind and body going very quickly, especially when one (or both!) of them is dragging. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? “I can do this” – it’s an easy way to ground myself when the work and responsibilities get a bit overwhelming and hasn’t failed me yet! If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? That it was fun! More than anything I hope that readers enjoy the stories that I put out, especially my funnier ones! If I managed to get you to smile or laugh at least once during a book, I consider it a huge victory! Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly.",
