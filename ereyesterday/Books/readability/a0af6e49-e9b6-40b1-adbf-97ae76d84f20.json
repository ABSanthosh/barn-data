Christopher Nolan is adapting Homer’s The Odyssey to the big screen, and it promises a star-studded cast. Zendaya, Tom Holland, Anne Hathaway, Lupita Nyong’o, Robert Pattinson, and Elliot Page are all attached, and we’ve just gotten our first look at Matt Damon as Odysseus. The IMDB description of Nolan’s The Odyssey is that it “Follows Odysseus in his perilous journey home after the Trojan War, showcasing his encounters with Polyphemus, the Sirens, Circe, and finishing with his reunion with his wife, Penelope.”We don’t have much more in the way of details at the moment, except that The Odyssey is a “mythic action epic shot across the world using brand new Imax film technology. The film brings Homer’s foundational saga to Imax film screens for the first time.” Production begins in the spring and will be filmed partially in Sicily. It comes out July 2026.
