  "description": "In the present day, Alexandra Lizska is the CEO of a corporation that provides shelter for abused women in the San Francisco Bay Area. She’s a skilled fundraiser, and she’s achieved success on her own without any support from friends or family and without a college degree. However, her world is upended when her estranged mother, Margaret, dies, leaving behind a lightly fictionalized memoir called Owned, which focuses on its main character’s relationship with a “big deal” real-life artist in New York named Bernard Barenbaum.As it turns out, Margaret was one of Bernard’s sexually submissive lovers in the ’80s; he even had her sign a “consensual contract.” During their time together, he carved a B onto her body with an X-Acto knife in a backyard ceremony. Bernard is the reason why Margaret and Alexandra (who’s called Amy in the fictionalized memoir) moved from Ohio to Brooklyn when Alexandra was a child. When Alexandra journeys to New York City as an adult to settle her late mother’s affairs, she begins reading the soon-to-be-published book. Her first impulse is to block its publication but, as it turns out, she has no legal power to do so. She continues reading and finds “every chapter a new shock,” and she finds out more details about Margaret and Bernard’s connection than she ever wanted to know. In addition, Alexandra finds out more about her own childhood in the story of “Amy.” The novel captures the reader’s attention early with the very first mention of the term slave. As the details of Margaret’s voluntary servitude are revealed, it becomes apparent that she had few limits on what she was willing to do for Bernard—although she did have some, as in a scene in her book in which she was given the option to either go to a dungeon or participate in group sex. As Bernard tells her, “Both will happen eventually, but I’ll let you decide which you’d like next.” Such is his way of always explaining things, as if he has the right to command; the resulting tension between Bernard and Margaret enlivens the narrative. Somewhat less compelling is the story of the friendship that develops between Amy and Bernard’s adopted son, Daniel, the child of one of Bernard’s former lovers; he’s portrayed as a strange boy who takes pleasure in things such as keeping pet cockroaches. As he and Amy grow closer, he becomes determined to help her with a chronic kidney problem that’s plagued her all her life. This storyline makes for a pleasant contrast to the rest of the novel, but the structure of Synan’s work is such that there’s little suspense regarding the severity of Amy’s health problem—as, obviously, she grows up to become the successful Alexandra. The secrets revealed about Bernard, Margaret, and the bizarre ways of adults are of much greater interest throughout.",

  "text": "INTERMEZZO by Sally Rooney ‧ RELEASE DATE: Sept. 24, 2024 Though not perfect, a clear leap forward for Rooney; her grandmaster status remains intact. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 27 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Two brothers—one a lawyer, one a chess prodigy—work through the death of their father, their complicated romantic lives, and their even more tangled relationship with each other. Ten years separate the Koubek brothers. In his early 30s, Peter has turned his past as a university debating champ into a career as a progressive lawyer in Dublin. Ivan is just out of college, struggling to make ends meet through freelance data analysis and reckoning with his recent free fall in the world chess rankings. When their father dies of cancer, the cracks in the brothers’ relationship widen. “Complete oddball” Ivan falls in love with an older woman, an arts center employee, which freaks Peter out. Peter juggles two women at once: free-spirited college student Naomi and his ex-girlfriend Sylvia, whose life has changed drastically since a car accident left her in chronic pain. Emotional chaos abounds. Rooney has struck a satisfying blend of the things she’s best at—sensitively rendered characters, intimacies, consideration of social and philosophical issues—with newer moves. Having the book’s protagonists navigating a familial rather than romantic relationship seems a natural next step for Rooney, with her astutely empathic perception, and the sections from Peter’s point of view show Rooney pushing her style into new territory with clipped, fragmented, almost impressionistic sentences. (Peter on Sylvia: “Must wonder what he’s really here for: repentance, maybe. Bless me for I have. Not like that, he wants to tell her. Why then. Terror of solitude.”) The risk: Peter comes across as a slightly blurry character, even to himself—he’s no match for the indelible Ivan—so readers may find these sections less propulsive at best or over-stylized at worst. Overall, though, the pages still fly; the characters remain reach-out-and-touch-them real. Though not perfect, a clear leap forward for Rooney; her grandmaster status remains intact.
