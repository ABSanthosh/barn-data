  "text": "22 May 2025 Portal Problems: 6 Fantasies Where Worlds Collide Fall through the veil—literally. These fantasy novels explore portal magic, multiverse collisions, and characters caught between worlds. If you love Narnia vibes with adult stakes and stunning worldbuilding, step in. Lost and Stolen Gods (Labyrinth of Gods Book 1) by Debbie Cassidy Release Date: April 4, 2025 The night a monster killed my grandmother, I was whisked away to a war-torn realm of gods. To claim vengeance, I’ll need to ascend by proving my worth in a series of lethal trials. My only ally is a dangerous fire elemental whose wicked mouth sets my pulse racing. If the trials don’t kill me, then his dark allure might just be my undoing. Buy on Amazon Monthollow by J. M. Unrue Release Date: May 7, 2025 Four hundred years ago, the small Kingdom of Monthollow was thrust into chaos. Twin sons were born to the King. Who would be the heir? What would it take to resolve this conundrum, especially with the King in failing health? This is the story behind Monthollow, a short fantasy, a time of trial so reminiscent of the current day. Buy on Amazon He Who Fights with Monsters by Shirtaloon \u0026 Travis Deverell Release Date: May 20, 2025 He was promised a life of wandering his new home and having adventures, but things got out of hand pretty quickly. He met with kings and gods, fought interdimensional cults, and got in a knife fight with the guy who creates universes. He didn’t win. What he’d never done was roam around, having nice, sensible adventures. He hadn’t even seen the hometown of his friends, and that had been the first destination on his list. Buy on Amazon Forged in Stillness (Backyard Starship Book 27) by J.N. Chaney and Terry Maggert Release Date: May 18, 2025 Reformed, repackaged, and re-engineered, the Stillness reveal that they never went away. They merely waited. Watching. Planning. And those plans will collide with the rising stars of an empire based on justice and action. Out in the deep black, Abel Tudor and his crew will fight to prove that command isn’t given, it’s earned—and their parents chose well, giving them the helm to a warship that could change history with one fateful journey. Buy on Amazon Crown of Betrayal and Blood (Dragons of Tirene Book 3) by Nina Frost Release Date: May 13, 2025 In the short time since Lark Axton first arrived in Tirene, everything has changed. After the drachen rose from their slumber and embarked on a ravenous rampage across two kingdoms that ended in the king of Tirene’s death, rumors of unrest beyond the castle walls began to swirl. Sterling/Knox—the prince of both Tirene and her heart—must prepare to take the throne, and although the nobles believe the drachen were vanquished, Lark remains unconvinced. Buy on Amazon The Wolf Guard’s Mate (Marked Beneath the Moon Book 3) by Lola Glass Release Date: May 7, 2025 I hooked up with my twin sister’s brother-in-law under the full moon… and ended up mated to him. Did I mention that he’s a stoic, grumpy a-hole? Or that he abducted me and locked me in his gigantic mansion in the forest? Yeah, okay, so things could be worse.
