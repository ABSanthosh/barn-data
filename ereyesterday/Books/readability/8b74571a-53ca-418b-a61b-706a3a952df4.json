  "description": "“Again and again, we are told that Adonai is and always has been merciful and compassionate,” writes Rosensaft in the book’s introduction, adding, “yet, we know that no such divine intervention…that no divine lovingkindness manifested itself at Auschwitz.” In this poetic reconfiguring of the Bible’s Book of Psalms, the author reinterprets the ancient writings (“in what may well be the ultimate manifestation of chutzpah”) in the context of the Holocaust (Rosensaft’s brother was killed in a Birkenau gas chamber in 1943). A legal scholar by trade, the author has published multiple works that combine memoir, poetry, and Holocaust remembrances. In these pages, responding to all 150 Psalms individually, the author balances his mastery of Jewish theology with a raw writing style that is unafraid to question, lash out at, and lament God’s seeming passivity in the face of evil. In his response to Psalm 23, a Biblical passage that has comforted Jewish and Christian believers for millennia, the author describes feelings of “emptiness” where there exists “no shepherd / only foes” as the children of God walk “through the valley of death.” Similarly, in his reimagining of Psalm 101, the author declares to God, “I will not sing to You…while slaughters of the innocent / remain unpunished.” As the son of Holocaust survivors who was born in a displaced persons camp in Germany shortly after the war, Rosensaft writes from a place of deep-seated pain and generational trauma. The work’s final section, “The Relentless Continuum of History,” highlights the perpetuation of antisemitic tropes (such as the notion that Jewish “killers…betrayed Christ”). One concluding poem, “Simhat Torah Requiem,” recalls the horrific events of October 7, 2023, stating that, “the ss have returned / to merge into hamas”; another laments the death of both Palestinian and Jewish children as Adonai and Allah watch in “anguish.”",

  "text": "THINK YOU'LL BE HAPPY MOVING THROUGH GRIEF WITH GRIT, GRACE, AND GRATITUDE by Nicole Avant ‧ RELEASE DATE: Oct. 17, 2023 Some of Avant’s mantras are overstated, but her book is magnanimous, inspiring, and relentlessly optimistic. Memories and life lessons inspired by the author’s mother, who was murdered in 2021. “Neither my mother nor I knew that her last text to me would be the words ‘Think you’ll be happy,’ ” Avant writes, \"but it is fitting that she left me with a mantra for resiliency.” The author, a filmmaker and former U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas, begins her first book on the night she learned her mother, Jacqueline Avant, had been fatally shot during a home invasion. “One of my first thoughts,” she writes, “was, ‘Oh God, please don’t let me hate this man. Give me the strength not to hate him.’ ” Daughter of Clarence Avant, known as the “Black Godfather” due to his work as a pioneering music executive, the author describes growing up “in a house that had a revolving door of famous people,” from Ella Fitzgerald to Muhammad Ali. “I don’t take for granted anything I have achieved in my life as a Black American woman,” writes Avant. “And I recognize my unique upbringing…..I was taught to honor our past and pay forward our fruits.” The book, which is occasionally repetitive, includes tributes to her mother from figures like Oprah Winfrey and Bill Clinton, but the narrative core is the author’s direct, faith-based, unwaveringly positive messages to readers—e.g., “I don’t want to carry the sadness and anger I have toward the man who did this to my mother…so I’m worshiping God amid the worst storm imaginable”; \"Success and feeling good are contagious. I’m all about positive contagious vibrations!” Avant frequently quotes Bible verses, and the bulk of the text reflects the spirit of her daily prayer “that everything is in divine order.” Imploring readers to practice proactive behavior, she writes, “We have to always find the blessing, to be the blessing.” Some of Avant’s mantras are overstated, but her book is magnanimous, inspiring, and relentlessly optimistic.
