These six literary fiction novels explore the human experience with intricate prose, deep themes, and unforgettable characters. If you’re ready for a reading journey that leaves an impact, these books belong on your shelf. In Defense of Earth by Marlen Suyapa Bodden Release Date: April 4, 2025 Axy, a super-android from an exoplanet, lied to humans by saying that it came to Earth to help them reverse climate change and provide limitless clean energy for the planet. But if Axy completes its true mission, its actions will kill all life on Earth. Buy on Amazon Sleep by Honor Jones Release Date: May 13, 2025 From a dazzling new talent, the story of a newly divorced young mother forced to reckon with the secrets of her own childhood when she brings her daughters back to the big house where she was raised. Buy on Amazon The Names by Florence Knapp Release Date: May 6, 2025 In the wake of a catastrophic storm, Cora sets off with her nine-year-old daughter, Maia, to register her son’s birth. Her husband, Gordon, a local doctor, respected in the community but a terrifying and controlling presence at home, intends for her to name the infant after him. But when the registrar asks what she’d like to call the child, Cora hesitates… Buy on Amazon One Timer With A Wingman (Riverside U) by R.C. Stephens Release Date: May 7, 2025 Alone, broke, and pregnant was not how I envisioned my junior year of college. Neither was Aaron Murray, hockey wingman and campus heartbreaker. He’s the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen—and now he’s crashing my vacation. Even worse, he ends up sitting next to me on the plane. I can’t escape his cocky demeanor… or his gorgeous green eyes—at least for the next four hours. Buy on Amazon The Correspondent by Virginia Evans Release Date: April 29, 2025 Sybil Van Antwerp has throughout her life used letters to make sense of the world and her place in it. Most mornings, around half past ten, Sybil sits down to write letters—to her brother, to her best friend, to the president of the university who will not allow her to audit a class she desperately wants to take, to Joan Didion and Larry McMurtry to tell them what she thinks of their latest books, and to one person to whom she writes often yet never sends the letter. Buy on Amazon The Director by Daniel Kehlmann Release Date: May 6, 2025 G.W. Pabst, one of cinema’s greatest directors of the 20th century, was filming in France when the Nazis seized power. To escape the horrors of the new and unrecognizable Germany, he fled to Hollywood. But now, under the blinding California sun, the world-famous director suddenly looks like a nobody. Not even Greta Garbo, the Hollywood actress whom he made famous, can help him. Buy on Amazon zaida Recommended Posts",
