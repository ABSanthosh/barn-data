Zainab Williams Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more. The Anti-Amazon Deal Days If Jeff Bezos dropping an amount of cash I can’t wrap my head around on his gaudy Venice wedding while Republicans say yes to the biggest transfer of wealth from the poor to the wealthy has you searching for something anything to cheer on, Bookshop.org, Libro.fm, and the American Booksellers Association are promoting ant-Prime Day sales and efforts. We can’t buy our way out of the cesspool, but there are some wonderful indie booksellers who work hard to nourish their communities, do right by their staff and neighbors, and would, I’m sure, appreciate some love and support this week. Everyone listen up. I have a super important PSA: One of my favorite shows has been renewed. Slow Horses will have a seventh season and I cannot wait to spend more time with Gary Oldman’s flatulent Jackson Lamb. It took me until last year to jump on the Slow Horses wagon because I didn’t expect it to be so funny and I wasn’t looking for a new grimdark show. Blame it on the sullen gray marketing and my ignorance of the Slough House books the show is adapted from. I’m a longtime fan of Oldman and maybe I’m biased when I say he steals the show as Lamb, but this witty spy series has big reach and has won more than a few awards–it’s a must-watch. I cannot wait for Season 5 in September, and as a literary media professional I feel obligated to promise that I’ll one day read the books.

Give the Artists Basic Income I won’t pretend to have even passing knowledge of Ireland’s arts economy but, after reading this opinion on the country’s Basic Income for the Arts Pilot Scheme, I’m keeping my fingers crossed for the writers and other artists overseas that this becomes a lasting program. The scheme offers €325 (about $381) per week to approved applicants producing creative work to support an economy that seems to benefit greatly from the work of (predominantly) writers. This comes from the National Campaign for the Arts in response to the promising results from the pilot: “The pilot scheme has supported artists to secure more sustainable housing, address health issues, start families and even establish pension schemes. The findings affirm what the arts sector has long known: the deep precarity of the arts requires sustained, courageous support – support that not only transforms the lives of artists, but also strengthens the society they help to shape.” A six-month extension has been granted to the pilot and the government is considering longer term plans. It’s that time! Book Riot’s editors and contributors have selected their best books of the year so far, and what a list. You’ll find excellent 2025 reads in a wide variety of genres and categories, and books that speak to every reader. I personally couldn’t be more excited for the opportunity to shout out my favorites. Check out the list and pick up a great read. The comments section is moderated according to our community guidelines.
