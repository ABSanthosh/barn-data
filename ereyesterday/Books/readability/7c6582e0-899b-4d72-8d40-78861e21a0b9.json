Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more. It feels a little early to be listing the best books of the year so far, and not just because of the calendar. As Big Books go, 2025 has been pretty quiet. While we haven’t yet seen the kind of literary hit that leads to “book of the year” chatter, there have been some standout releases, and the New York Times captures many of them in its list of the best books of the year so far. I can vouch for We Do Not Part, was delighted to see Stone Yard Devotional get a mention, and am a bit surprised that Katie Kitamura’s excellent Audition didn’t make the cut. How many of the 15 featured titles have you read? This Old Thing? It is a truth universally acknowledged that a new internet platform focused on writing will give rise to literary experiments…and Substack’s time has come. Folks are publishing fiction, releasing their memoirs one chapter at a time, writing book reviews, and offering commentary on the publishing industry. That the experimentation will happen is predictable in the best of ways and can lead to genuinely innovative work—I’m not knocking any of the folks Nicholas Konrad profiles in the New Yorker piece I’ve linked above. But I’d like to have a word with him about this: The literary mainstream has always been shaped (for both better and worse) by intermediary institutions like university creative-writing programs, plucky little journals, and newspaper book reviews. Perhaps Substack could have a similar era of influence, becoming a place where people gather for an accessible twenty-first-century version of literary community, collaborate on the formation of new readerly sensibilities, and share their own experiments at high speed and low cost. The literary mainstream Konrad invokes—shaped by creative writing programs, indie journals, and newspaper book sections—hasn’t existed in any coherent form for at least 20 years. In a total coincidence, it’s been about that long since Web 2.0 kicked off the blogging boom that democratized literary discourse and gave rise to the first wave of indie newsletters. If Substack ends up serving as a new kind of literary institution—one that fosters community, cultivates sensibility, and rewards experimentation at speed and low cost—great. But let’s not pretend we haven’t seen this before. Don’t talk to me of the old magic, child. I was there when it was written. It’s Complicated I missed Mother’s Day, but honestly, it’s never too late for a round-up of books about complicated mothers. Whatever “complicated” means to you, there’s a rec on this list to ring your bells and give you plenty to talk about in therapy.
