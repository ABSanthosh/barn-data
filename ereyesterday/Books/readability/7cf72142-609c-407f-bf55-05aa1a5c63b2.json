  "description": "Gwendolyn Richards bickers with her mother on a regular morning as the family is preparing to begin another day. With roosters crowing in the yard and Gwen’s dad getting ready for a humdrum shift at the nearby sugar factory, mother and daughter share local news until Gwen’s best friend, Sharon, arrives to walk with Gwen to school. Along the way, Sharon teases Gwen about Lenwell Turnbull, a classmate who’s clearly smitten with Gwen (“Even Ms. Bridgewater probably see how all you looking at each other on de landing when you tink nobody watching”). As the story unfolds, readers are treated to flirtatious high school moments between Gwen and Lenwell, complete with note-passing and meaningful glances across classrooms. Gwen grows closer to Lenwell just as her mother begins to fall ill with a disease; the deeper her feelings grow for Lenwell, the sicker her mother becomes, and the correlation is confusing for Gwen. Everything comes to a head when Gwen’s father hatches an unexpected plan to secure Gwen’s future, one that seems to leave no room for Lenwell. Told from Gwen’s perspective throughout, the narrative follows her daily life, which consists primarily of days at school and at home. While the scenes can begin to feel repetitive—the pacing lags as each day bleeds slowly into the next—the author does an admirable job of showing how a teenage crush can grow into a deeper and more meaningful relationship. The story also thoughtfully explores the ways in which adolescents continue to look to their parents for guidance, alternately mirroring, resisting, and ultimately growing through those relationships. While the book would have benefitted from additional setting details to help ground the reader in time and place, the Caribbean-English dialogue adds a rich, authentic voice to this unhurried tale. What the story lacks in suspense it makes up for with emotional nuance and thematic depth, tackling issues such as caregiving, young love, and finding happiness in the shadow of loss.",

  "text": "POWERLESS From the Powerless Trilogy series , Vol. 1 by Lauren Roberts ‧ RELEASE DATE: Nov. 7, 2023 A lackluster and sometimes disturbing mishmash of overused tropes. The Plague has left a population divided between Elites and Ordinaries—those who have powers and those who don’t; now, an Ordinary teen fights for her life. Paedyn Gray witnessed the king kill her father five years ago, and she’s been thieving and sleeping rough ever since, all while faking Psychic abilities. When she inadvertently saves the life of Prince Kai, she becomes embroiled in the Purging Trials, a competition to commemorate the sickness that killed most of the kingdom’s Ordinaries. Kai’s duties as the future Enforcer include eradicating any remaining Ordinaries, and these Trials are his chance to prove that he’s internalized his brutal training. But Kai can’t help but find Pae’s blue eyes, silver hair, and unabashed attitude enchanting. She likewise struggles to resist his stormy gray eyes, dark hair, and rakish behavior, even as they’re pitted against each other in the Trials and by the king himself. Scenes and concepts that are strongly reminiscent of the Hunger Games fall flat: They aren’t bolstered by the original’s heart or worldbuilding logic that would have justified a few extreme story elements. Illogical leaps and inconsistent characterizations abound, with lighthearted romantic interludes juxtaposed against genocide, child abuse, and sadism. These elements, which are not sufficiently addressed, combined with the use of ableist language, cannot be erased by any amount of romantic banter. Main characters are cued white; the supporting cast has some brown-skinned characters. A lackluster and sometimes disturbing mishmash of overused tropes.
