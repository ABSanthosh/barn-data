  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Chasing Headlines (Chasing Victory Book One)? What inspired me… So I wrote a short story in 2006 about these characters. They’re older in that short read, with this fun, witty banter and an undercurrent of longing. I always wanted to write more to their story, and often got asked to…And I could think of a number of ways it could go, but nothing really solidified in my brain as like: this! This is the rest of their story! So, finally, in 2021 in the midst of a writing prompt challenge, another short story showed up. But it was back in time, when they were in college. And it occurred to me, then, that maybe before I could go forward in time…I needed to go back to where they began. And when I looked around at other stories I had written that I wanted to do more with – I had several that were focused on college athletes. Which spurred the idea that maybe I could write a series of sports romances focused on a single university, and spanning multiple sports. So, one of the things I managed to do in Chasing Headlines is introduce all the MMC’s of the core group of books that will make up the Chasing Victory series – the QB who will be a Senior by the time we focus on him (he’s a junior, here). The Hockey player whose story will begin in his sophomore year. The Soccer player whose story will be set before Chasing Headlines. I kept having editors tell me this and such character didn’t need to be in there, or maybe I could consolidate this one into that one. Ok, except that guy’s going to play an integral role in book 2, so, while I get it, I’d prefer to keep the whopping 2 paragraphs where Liv talks about him in book 1. I have side stories that include most of the cast who wear athletic uniforms. I had to build the entire world of Texas State Tech in such a way as it could be a foundation for several series. It made this entry a bit lengthier than I intended, but I’m hopeful that as we go, people who choose to read more than one book will find the crossovers to be positive and interesting. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Chasing Headlines (Chasing Victory Book One), what would they be? Of course I have my Spotify playlist for this one, too. Breslin’s theme song is “Other Side” by Lo Spirit. Since my MMC’s this far have been representing on the mental health front, there’s a lot of correlation with Lo Spirit’s lyrical focus. Liv’s would be “Birds Still Sing” by Taylor Acorn. The line: “Not everyone stays but the real ones do” is central to her character, and a core belief. Her brother was there when their mother left. Her father wasn’t as present as he could have been, losing sight of the fact his 7 year old daughter needed to feel safe, cared for and loved. With that need unfulfilled for most of her life, she grows up to chase a dream that isn’t really hers, hoping to stop being “left behind” by the only family she had left. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I read a wide variety of books, with Mystery books being amongst my favorites. But I also read a lot of Sport Romances and Shifter / Fated Mates books. So, I’m all over the place. My favorite genre to write is equally as all over the place. I’m excited to continue my Chasing Victory series, but I’d be lying if there weren’t a couple of dragon shifter works vying for my attention. In the background. What books are on your TBR pile right now? On my TBR right now is: Louisa’s Passion by Shelley Sommers, Any Other Day by Jenna McCall, and Heartless by Ian Feldman. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I think that has to be one of the ones I added in the rewrite – where Liv and Breslin face off at the senior center (where he’s doing his community service). Liv shows up to interview one of the residents and he’s making it difficult for Liv to get into the center, refusing to unlock the door. And then he does, but she wasn’t expecting it, so she misses her opportunity. We’re in Liv’s head and she’s exasperated by this guy, and they’re just really annoying each other. So, she makes a show of coming on to him, and I’m trying to give all the body language signs that he’s eating it up even as she’s feeling self conscious…and then she finds herself pulled in by her own attraction to him. So much so, she almost can’t pull herself away to follow through with her plan. It was fun and flirty and it was meant to show, on the one hand, how made for each other they are. And on the other, how determined Liv can be that even the guy she’s been crushing on all this time won’t deter her ambitions. There’s a bit of foreshadowing in it, but not obviously so. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) My son has taken to getting up in the morning and laying on my lap before school. This isn’t so much a writing habit as it is a writing obstacle. But he’s adorable all curled up there. *sigh* If anyone ever wonders what it’s like to try to stick to their writing habit when you have kids and a FT job…Imagine the stories of cats lying on laps and replace it with a 4 year old at 5:30 a.m. making it impossible to even reach the keyboard. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? I’m not super original in this space, so it’s still the “never give up” thing. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? “We’re never as alone as we fear.” – Ernest Hemingway. The way this took shape in Chasing Headlines has to do with the “found family” trope. Families come in many different shapes and sizes throughout our lives. Breslin faces the loss of his family even as Liv clings to the threads of hers. But in the process of finding each other, they discover the beginnings of a new, rather eclectic version of “family.” And however strangely those bonds are forged, this version of family may prove to be stronger than the ones Liv \u0026 Breslin were each born with.
