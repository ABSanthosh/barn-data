  "description": "Each group is seeking an ancient gem-encrusted ceremonial dagger while a new Stonehenge is constructed, as both instruments are needed to reconnect with the Mkultrans, who first visited Earth 4,500 years ago. The extraterrestrials are intrigued by humans’ biological similarities to them (“Except that a Mkultran has a third nostril and a giant cephalopod-looking creature sitting atop his head”), but the would-be colonizers find humanity insufficiently advanced. They meet Haggur, a powerful psychic, who’s tasked with contacting them once humankind is ready for them. Haggur created the aforementioned dagger and taught witchcraft to Morgen an Spyrys and Pythia, who have an ongoing rivalry. Morgen is the novel’s narrator, whose “quasi-omniscient” asides detail a disastrous chain of events involving various characters; she currently inhabits the body of Harvey Ferguson, assistant to the world’s richest man, Buchanan Sanderborn. Elsewhere, Shaniqua Bishop, a young researcher, becomes a willing host for Pythia after the latter is unleashed from a cookbook in which Morgen imprisoned her 50 years ago. In a parallel storyline, Morton Richardson, a Midwestern insurance company president, eavesdrops on his wife, resulting in sexual insecurity and “psychic-emotional angst” that acts as a beacon to “predators circling around in the mystical Fourth Dimension.” Sumac’s outlandish work of speculative fiction presents readers with a sprawling, mystical battle across the ages. Over the course of the novel, the author weaves together a number of complex plotlines, which collectively result in a humorous alternate-history tale. The ongoing references to taxonomy and to the evolutionary behavior of alien races offer darkly comic observations on the dangerous dog-eat-dog mentality that earthly, spiritual, and alien species all seem to share. However, characters’ ongoing concerns about sexual prowess somewhat detract from the otherwise slick storytelling.",

  "text": "DEVOLUTION by Max Brooks ‧ RELEASE DATE: June 16, 2020 A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 230 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Are we not men? We are—well, ask Bigfoot, as Brooks does in this delightful yarn, following on his bestseller World War Z(2006). A zombie apocalypse is one thing. A volcanic eruption is quite another, for, as the journalist who does a framing voice-over narration for Brooks’ latest puts it, when Mount Rainier popped its cork, “it was the psychological aspect, the hyperbole-fueled hysteria that had ended up killing the most people.” Maybe, but the sasquatches whom the volcano displaced contributed to the statistics, too, if only out of self-defense. Brooks places the epicenter of the Bigfoot war in a high-tech hideaway populated by the kind of people you might find in a Jurassic Park franchise: the schmo who doesn’t know how to do much of anything but tries anyway, the well-intentioned bleeding heart, the know-it-all intellectual who turns out to know the wrong things, the immigrant with a tough backstory and an instinct for survival. Indeed, the novel does double duty as a survival manual, packed full of good advice—for instance, try not to get wounded, for “injury turns you from a giver to a taker. Taking up our resources, our time to care for you.” Brooks presents a case for making room for Bigfoot in the world while peppering his narrative with timely social criticism about bad behavior on the human side of the conflict: The explosion of Rainier might have been better forecast had the president not slashed the budget of the U.S. Geological Survey, leading to “immediate suspension of the National Volcano Early Warning System,” and there’s always someone around looking to monetize the natural disaster and the sasquatch-y onslaught that follows. Brooks is a pro at building suspense even if it plays out in some rather spectacularly yucky episodes, one involving a short spear that takes its name from “the sucking sound of pulling it out of the dead man’s heart and lungs.” Grossness aside, it puts you right there on the scene. A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy.
