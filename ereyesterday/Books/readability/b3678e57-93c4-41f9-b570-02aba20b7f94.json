  "description": "Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, writes Wood, historian of American architecture and urbanism, New York City “grew into one of the world’s largest, most important, and dynamic cities.” Roughly 1 million buildings—an astonishing number—went up in the city during that period. In his deeply informed and informative account, Wood describes how population growth and a robust economy gave rise to a large and sophisticated construction industry. He deftly describes the numerous and complex arrangements that provided much-needed office buildings, homes, factories, railway stations, bridges, streets, and subway lines. We read, often in detail, about large construction firms, building trade associations, the mechanics of tunnel construction, labor unions, architectural offices, and wrecking companies. Wood introduces us to government workers and officials such as Thomas F. Gilroy (head of the city’s Department of Public Works in the 1890s) and labor organizers such as Morris Rosen. After the city consolidated in 1898, Wood extends his gaze beyond Manhattan’s skyscrapers to the lower-density outer boroughs. Throughout, he attends to the many conflicts between business and labor over the length of the workday, safety, and wages; contractor competition for private commissions and lobbying for public works projects; and city government efforts to manage the corruption, labor unrest, noise and disruption, and the regulatory demands of building activity. For those fascinated by urban development (particularly construction and particularly in New York City), reading this substantial history is time well spent. What primarily matters to Wood, however, are facts. Consequently, he refrains from any attempt at a more general understanding of building construction. In the last chapter, after a brief summary, the story simply ends.",

  "text": "KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON THE OSAGE MURDERS AND THE BIRTH OF THE FBI by David Grann ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 18, 2017 Dogged original research and superb narrative skills come together in this gripping account of pitiless evil. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 68 Our Verdict GET IT Kirkus Reviews' Best Books Of 2017 New York Times Bestseller IndieBound Bestseller National Book Award Finalist Greed, depravity, and serial murder in 1920s Oklahoma. During that time, enrolled members of the Osage Indian nation were among the wealthiest people per capita in the world. The rich oil fields beneath their reservation brought millions of dollars into the tribe annually, distributed to tribal members holding \"headrights\" that could not be bought or sold but only inherited. This vast wealth attracted the attention of unscrupulous whites who found ways to divert it to themselves by marrying Osage women or by having Osage declared legally incompetent so the whites could fleece them through the administration of their estates. For some, however, these deceptive tactics were not enough, and a plague of violent death—by shooting, poison, orchestrated automobile accident, and bombing—began to decimate the Osage in what they came to call the \"Reign of Terror.\" Corrupt and incompetent law enforcement and judicial systems ensured that the perpetrators were never found or punished until the young J. Edgar Hoover saw cracking these cases as a means of burnishing the reputation of the newly professionalized FBI. Bestselling New Yorker staff writer Grann (The Devil and Sherlock Holmes: Tales of Murder, Madness, and Obsession, 2010, etc.) follows Special Agent Tom White and his assistants as they track the killers of one extended Osage family through a closed local culture of greed, bigotry, and lies in pursuit of protection for the survivors and justice for the dead. But he doesn't stop there; relying almost entirely on primary and unpublished sources, the author goes on to expose a web of conspiracy and corruption that extended far wider than even the FBI ever suspected. This page-turner surges forward with the pacing of a true-crime thriller, elevated by Grann's crisp and evocative prose and enhanced by dozens of period photographs. Dogged original research and superb narrative skills come together in this gripping account of pitiless evil.

Bestselling \u003ci\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/i\u003e staff writer Grann (\u003ci\u003eThe Devil and Sherlock Holmes: Tales of Murder, Madness, and Obsession\u003c/i\u003e, 2010, etc.) follows Special Agent Tom White and his assistants as they track the killers of one extended Osage family through a closed local culture of greed, bigotry, and lies in pursuit of protection for the survivors and justice for the dead. But he doesn\u0026#39;t stop there; relying almost entirely on primary and unpublished sources, the author goes on to expose a web of conspiracy and corruption that extended far wider than even the FBI ever suspected. This page-turner surges forward with the pacing of a true-crime thriller, elevated by Grann\u0026#39;s crisp and evocative prose and enhanced by dozens of period photographs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n                                        Dogged original research and superb narrative skills come together in this gripping account of pitiless evil.\n                                        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n                                \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n                                \n\n                                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                        \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePub Date:\u003c/b\u003e April 18, 2017\u003c/p\u003e\n                                        \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eISBN:\u003c/b\u003e 978-0-385-53424-6\u003c/p\u003e\n                                    \u003c/div\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                        \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePage Count:\u003c/b\u003e 352\u003c/p\u003e\n                                        \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePublisher:\u003c/b\u003e Doubleday\u003c/p\u003e\n                                    \u003c/div\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                        \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eReview Posted Online:\u003c/b\u003e Feb. 1, 2017\u003c/p\u003e\n                                         \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKirkus Reviews Issue:\u003c/b\u003e Feb. 15, 2017\u003c/p\u003e\n                                    \u003c/div\u003e\n                                \u003c/div\u003e\n\n                                \n\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                \n                            \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
