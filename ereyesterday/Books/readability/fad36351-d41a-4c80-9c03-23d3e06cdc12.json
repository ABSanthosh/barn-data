  "description": "Callie is grieving both her mother, who died three years ago, and everything she left back in London after her father moved them to the mountains of Northern Ireland. Her life is further upended when a house mysteriously crash-lands in her garden before turning invisible. The house’s desperate owner, magician Winnifred Potts, asks Callie for help. Winnifred was using a magic substance known as Wanderdust to move her home, but something went wrong, and the Wanderdust scattered. Winnifred can’t leave her house, so Callie must look for the Wanderdust. She enlists her new friend Sam, but before they can start searching, they discover the cause of the disaster: Callie’s homesickness was so severe that it repelled the magic, jeopardizing both Winnifred and her house. After the guilt-ridden Callie attempts to use Winnifred’s magic to return to London, her efforts only make the situation more dire. But Callie’s sudden revelations about friendship and home help her as she decides to put things right, leading to a disappointingly rushed climax. Though the fantastical elements are intriguing, they feel overshadowed by the heavy-handed moral (“Home isn’t a place…Home is the people”). Playful illustrations are interspersed thoughtfully, breaking up the text for younger readers. Callie and Sam are light-skinned, while Winnifred has box braids and is depicted with darker skin.",

  "text": "HORRIBLE HARRY SAYS GOODBYE From the Horrible Harry series , Vol. 37 by Suzy Kline ; illustrated by Amy Wummer ‧ RELEASE DATE: Nov. 27, 2018 A fitting farewell, still funny, acute, and positive in its view of human nature even in its 37th episode. A long-running series reaches its closing chapters. Having, as Kline notes in her warm valedictory acknowledgements, taken 30 years to get through second and third grade, Harry Spooger is overdue to move on—but not just into fourth grade, it turns out, as his family is moving to another town as soon as the school year ends. The news leaves his best friend, narrator “Dougo,” devastated…particularly as Harry doesn’t seem all that fussed about it. With series fans in mind, the author takes Harry through a sort of last-day-of-school farewell tour. From his desk he pulls a burned hot dog and other items that featured in past episodes, says goodbye to Song Lee and other classmates, and even (for the first time ever) leads Doug and readers into his house and memento-strewn room for further reminiscing. Of course, Harry isn’t as blasé about the move as he pretends, and eyes aren’t exactly dry when he departs. But hardly is he out of sight before Doug is meeting Mohammad, a new neighbor from Syria who (along with further diversifying a cast that began as mostly white but has become increasingly multiethnic over the years) will also be starting fourth grade at summer’s end, and planning a written account of his “horrible” buddy’s exploits. Finished illustrations not seen. A fitting farewell, still funny, acute, and positive in its view of human nature even in its 37th episode.
