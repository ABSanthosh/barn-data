  "description": "Most people in a given society are workers, observes Honneth in this accessible work of political philosophy, and it is “one of the major deficiencies of almost all theories of democracy” that this fact is not of central importance. Workers can be made the backbone of civil society by creating dignified conditions that promote cooperative, social behavior; if poorly run, a society will instead produce egocentric, us-against-them citizens. That’s precisely what we have, Honneth argues, because workers lack the freedom, the opportunity, and the incentive to contribute to “societal prosperity.” Whereas the Hegelian ideal of work produces independence and honor, the reality in capitalist societies is very different: workers are oppressed not just by the usual machinations of the bosses but also by such things as the fragile gig economy of the present, the suzerainty of finance and speculative capital, and the outsourcing of labor “to hugely underpaid remote workers all over the globe.” Add to that companies that break unions, that time workers’ bathroom breaks, and that view employees as fungible, and you have no chance of creating a society in which, as Adam Smith wished, “workers can fully understand the laws, accept them on rational grounds and embrace their meaning.” In short, workers are present, but they are not actors in a precarious society that does not value them. There are remedies, Honneth notes: one can reform capitalism, or one can fetter capitalism with laws and labor market reforms. He holds that a middle way between the two is “the moral order of the day,” one that contributes to human dignity and that allows workers a voice in the conditions of their labor.",

  "text": "ON FREEDOM by Timothy Snyder ‧ RELEASE DATE: Sept. 17, 2024 An incisive, urgently relevant analysis of—and call to action on—America’s foundational ideal. An examination of how the U.S. can revitalize its commitment to freedom. In this ambitious study, Snyder, author of On Tyranny, The Road to Unfreedom, and other books, explores how American freedom might be reconceived not simply in negative terms—as freedom from coercion, especially by the state—but positive ones: the freedom to develop our human potential within sustaining communal structures. The author blends extensive personal reflections on his own evolving understanding of liberty with definitions of the concept by a range of philosophers, historians, politicians, and social activists. Americans, he explains, often wrongly assume that freedom simply means the removal of some barrier: “An individual is free, we think, when the government is out of the way. Negative freedom is our common sense.” In his careful and impassioned description of the profound implications of this conceptual limitation, Snyder provides a compelling account of the circumstances necessary for the realization of positive freedom, along with a set of detailed recommendations for specific sociopolitical reforms and policy initiatives. “We have to see freedom as positive, as beginning from virtues, as shared among people, and as built into institutions,” he writes. The author argues that it’s absurd to think of government as the enemy of freedom; instead, we ought to reimagine how a strong government might focus on creating the appropriate conditions for human flourishing and genuine liberty. Another essential and overlooked element of freedom is the fostering of a culture of solidarity, in which an awareness of and concern for the disadvantaged becomes a guiding virtue. Particularly striking and persuasive are the sections devoted to eviscerating the false promises of libertarianism, exposing the brutal injustices of the nation’s penitentiaries, and documenting the wide-ranging pathologies that flow from a tax system favoring the ultrawealthy. An incisive, urgently relevant analysis of—and call to action on—America’s foundational ideal.
