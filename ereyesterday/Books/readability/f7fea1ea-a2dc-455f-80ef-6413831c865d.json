  "description": "Darius Anah, 17, lives with his mother and younger sister, Mahlah, in a city where every major milestone—known as a Life Event—is dictated by The Book of Zalmon. The teens’ father was a Leaver, someone who took off for the Town Beyond, past the forest surrounding Zalmon, which is a source of great shame—and also temptation—for Darius. The government justifies its control of the citizens by claims that it promotes “equal opportunity and liberty.” Instead of a Natural Death, which is presented as deeply traumatic, people spend their last days before their assigned death dates at a facility called Quiet End. Physical affection is restricted to “conception duties.” Despite this intrusion, there are rumors of an Underground world. One day at work, Darius peeks at his boss’ account at Central Processing, hoping to see whether his crush might be his Life Match. When he looks up Mahlah’s life partner, he’s horrified to learn she’s been assigned an imminent death date. Darius spirals out of control as he attempts to save her life and, in the process, discovers a shocking web of dark secrets. The narrative beautifully combines dystopian elements with a moving story of love, grief, and defiance. The engaging, evocative writing builds suspense and develops characters in ways that will keep readers invested. Main characters are cued white.",

  "text": "IF HE HAD BEEN WITH ME by Laura Nowlin ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 1, 2013 There’s not much plot here, but readers will relish the opportunity to climb inside Autumn’s head. The finely drawn characters capture readers’ attention in this debut. Autumn and Phineas, nicknamed Finny, were born a week apart; their mothers are still best friends. Growing up, Autumn and Finny were like peas in a pod despite their differences: Autumn is “quirky and odd,” while Finny is “sweet and shy and everyone like[s] him.” But in eighth grade, Autumn and Finny stop being friends due to an unexpected kiss. They drift apart and find new friends, but their friendship keeps asserting itself at parties, shared holiday gatherings and random encounters. In the summer after graduation, Autumn and Finny reconnect and are finally ready to be more than friends. But on August 8, everything changes, and Autumn has to rely on all her strength to move on. Autumn’s coming-of-age is sensitively chronicled, with a wide range of experiences and events shaping her character. Even secondary characters are well-rounded, with their own histories and motivations. There’s not much plot here, but readers will relish the opportunity to climb inside Autumn’s head.   (Fiction. 14 \u0026 up) Pub Date: April 1, 2013 ISBN: 978-1-4022-7782-5 Page Count: 336 Publisher: Sourcebooks Fire Review Posted Online: Feb. 12, 2013 Kirkus Reviews Issue: March 1, 2013",
