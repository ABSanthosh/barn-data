  "description": "Every Sunday, Martin, his parents, and his dog, Maize, go to his grandparents’ house. Every visit is the same; bored one day, Martin decides to “[step] out into the unknown.” In detailed, action-packed double-page spreads in muted colors, Martin and Maize trek across several landscapes, from the “freezing cold of ice caps” to the “baking heat of lava flows.” Their epic adventures turn out to be a rousing game of make-believe; exhausted after a day of play, Martin eagerly anticipates filling his family members in on all his exploits. Eagle-eyed readers will realize that this is an imaginative journey, with several objects from around the house, seen in earlier spreads, ingeniously included in Martin’s daydreams. His mother’s Bundt cake becomes a volcano leaving hot lava trails, while the “arid desert” is his grandpa’s sleeping face. Cross-hatching and detailed shading give the tale a charmingly retro feel. Originally published in Brazil and translated into English, this tale uses clever wordplay in conjunction with the art to further call back to the previously seen items (at one point, we’re told that the boy and the canine are “within an arm’s length of sacred creatures”—a reference to Martin’s father’s dragon tattoo sleeve). Readers will eagerly return again and again to get lost in Tolentino's sumptuous landscapes. Martin and his family are light-skinned.",

  "text": "ON THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN by Tish Rabe ; illustrated by Laura Hughes ‧ RELEASE DATE: June 21, 2016 While this is a fairly bland treatment compared to Deborah Lee Rose and Carey Armstrong-Ellis’ The Twelve Days of... Rabe follows a young girl through her first 12 days of kindergarten in this book based on the familiar Christmas carol. The typical firsts of school are here: riding the bus, making friends, sliding on the playground slide, counting, sorting shapes, laughing at lunch, painting, singing, reading, running, jumping rope, and going on a field trip. While the days are given ordinal numbers, the song skips the cardinal numbers in the verses, and the rhythm is sometimes off: “On the second day of kindergarten / I thought it was so cool / making lots of friends / and riding the bus to my school!” The narrator is a white brunette who wears either a tunic or a dress each day, making her pretty easy to differentiate from her classmates, a nice mix in terms of race; two students even sport glasses. The children in the ink, paint, and collage digital spreads show a variety of emotions, but most are happy to be at school, and the surroundings will be familiar to those who have made an orientation visit to their own schools. While this is a fairly bland treatment compared to Deborah Lee Rose and Carey Armstrong-Ellis’ The Twelve Days of Kindergarten (2003), it basically gets the job done.
