  "description": "Cooley, professor of political science at Barnard College, and Dukalskis, associate professor of politics and international relations at University College Dublin, open with the West’s celebration of the USSR’s collapse in 1989. Victory in the Cold War was hailed as a triumph of freedom, and many pundits predicted that respect for human rights and free market capitalism would become so universal that it would mark “the end of history.” China was welcomed into the world economy with the universal assumption that its people would force democratic reforms, and soon-to-be-autocratic Russia, with an economy no larger than Italy’s, was of little consequence. Democracies spread, national incomes rose, and few disagreed with the maxim that capitalism and prosperity required freedom. Readers will squirm when the authors describe how matters began to change. Until the beginning of this century, dictators stumbled when dealing with Western “soft power,” which emphasized, besides movies and pop music, a quarrelsome liberal democracy, toleration of contradictory opinions within a nation, and opposition to injustice everywhere. No fools, they learned from their mistakes. Using a combination of modern technology and psychology (humans remain tribal; they love theirs and distrust others), old autocracies got their act together, and jingoistic right-wing movements, learning the same lessons, began thriving even in European social democracies. Once a modest threat, reformers barely exist today in the established autocracies of China, Russia, and the Middle East. Elsewhere, hypernationalistic autocrats began winning free elections decades ago, and to America’s 2024 victors, “liberal” is a dirty word. No polemic, this is a sober report, dotted with statistics, graphs, and political analysis.",

  "text": "THE BACKYARD BIRD CHRONICLES by Amy Tan ; illustrated by Amy Tan ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 23, 2024 An ebullient nature lover’s paean to birds. A charming bird journey with the bestselling author. In his introduction to Tan’s “nature journal,” David Allen Sibley, the acclaimed ornithologist, nails the spirit of this book: a “collection of delightfully quirky, thoughtful, and personal observations of birds in sketches and words.” For years, Tan has looked out on her California backyard “paradise”—oaks, periwinkle vines, birch, Japanese maple, fuchsia shrubs—observing more than 60 species of birds, and she fashions her findings into delightful and approachable journal excerpts, accompanied by her gorgeous color sketches. As the entries—“a record of my life”—move along, the author becomes more adept at identifying and capturing them with words and pencils. Her first entry is September 16, 2017: Shortly after putting up hummingbird feeders, one of the tiny, delicate creatures landed on her hand and fed. “We have a relationship,” she writes. “I am in love.” By August 2018, her backyard “has become a menagerie of fledglings…all learning to fly.” Day by day, she has continued to learn more about the birds, their activities, and how she should relate to them; she also admits mistakes when they occur. In December 2018, she was excited to observe a Townsend’s Warbler—“Omigod! It’s looking at me. Displeased expression.” Battling pesky squirrels, Tan deployed Hot Pepper Suet to keep them away, and she deterred crows by hanging a fake one upside down. The author also declared war on outdoor cats when she learned they kill more than 1 billion birds per year. In May 2019, she notes that she spends $250 per month on beetle larvae. In June 2019, she confesses “spending more hours a day staring at birds than writing. How can I not?” Her last entry, on December 15, 2022, celebrates when an eating bird pauses, “looks and acknowledges I am there.” An ebullient nature lover’s paean to birds.
