  "description": "Artificial intelligence, according to its advocates, holds out the promise of an end to mind-numbing, exploitative work. Casilli, a professor of sociology at the Institut Polytechnique de Paris and the author of numerous books on the social impact of technology, vehemently disagrees. He argues that it has merely changed the type of labor and the structure of the exploitation, and he has a mountain of research to support his case. AI systems are far from autonomous, he says. To get them to work at all requires the input of huge amounts of data, and there is a constant need for additions, checks, and revisions. The work is usually done not by employees but by contractors. The pay is poor and the benefits are nonexistent. Casilli provides several case studies to illustrate his points, with Amazon’s Mechanical Turk being the most illustrative. The service uses an army of freelance “clickworkers” around the globe for various types of data input, with the unifying factor being the poor rates of remuneration. Casilli acknowledges that AI is evolving at a startling rate but that probably means that it will require more human input at the lower end of the value scale, not less. He proposes a “universal digital income,” a basic level for digital workers that could be partly financed by a tax on platforms. It is a compelling idea, but implementation would be difficult. In any case, Casilli has identified a host of problems in the brave new world of AI, and perhaps this book can be a good place to start thinking about solutions.",

  "text": "ELON MUSK by Walter Isaacson ‧ RELEASE DATE: Sept. 12, 2023 Alternately admiring and critical, unvarnished, and a closely detailed account of a troubled innovator. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 68 Our Verdict GET IT Kirkus Reviews' Best Books Of 2023 New York Times Bestseller A warts-and-all portrait of the famed techno-entrepreneur—and the warts are nearly beyond counting. To call Elon Musk (b. 1971) “mercurial” is to undervalue the term; to call him a genius is incorrect. Instead, Musk has a gift for leveraging the genius of others in order to make things work. When they don’t, writes eminent biographer Isaacson, it’s because the notoriously headstrong Musk is so sure of himself that he charges ahead against the advice of others: “He does not like to share power.” In this sharp-edged biography, the author likens Musk to an earlier biographical subject, Steve Jobs. Given Musk’s recent political turn, born of the me-first libertarianism of the very rich, however, Henry Ford also comes to mind. What emerges clearly is that Musk, who may or may not have Asperger’s syndrome (“Empathy did not come naturally”), has nurtured several obsessions for years, apart from a passion for the letter X as both a brand and personal name. He firmly believes that “all requirements should be treated as recommendations”; that it is his destiny to make humankind a multi-planetary civilization through innovations in space travel; that government is generally an impediment and that “the thought police are gaining power”; and that “a maniacal sense of urgency” should guide his businesses. That need for speed has led to undeniable successes in beating schedules and competitors, but it has also wrought disaster: One of the most telling anecdotes in the book concerns Musk’s “demon mode” order to relocate thousands of Twitter servers from Sacramento to Portland at breakneck speed, which trashed big parts of the system for months. To judge by Isaacson’s account, that may have been by design, for Musk’s idea of creative destruction seems to mean mostly chaos. Alternately admiring and critical, unvarnished, and a closely detailed account of a troubled innovator.
