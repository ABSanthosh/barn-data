  "text": "23 Oct 2024 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write SCHROEDER? I promise I am not skimping out with this answer, but I can only respond with — life. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of SCHROEDER, what would they be? They are in the book! The SCHROEDER soundtrack : “I’m Still Standing” by Elton John; “Once in a Lifetime” by Talking Heads; “Reinventing Your Exit” by Underoath; “Call on Me” by Eric Prydz; “Atlantis” by Donovan; “September” by Earth, Wind, \u0026 Fire; “Such a Night” by Elvis; “Jingle Bell Rock” by Bobby Helms; “The Girl From Ipanema” by Astrud Gilberto \u0026 Stan Getz; “Beyond the Sea” by Bobby Darin; “Adagio in D Minor” by John Murphy, “Time to Say Goodbye” by Sarah Brightman \u0026 Andrea Bocelli. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? It varies and depends on my mood. Right now it’s Nonfiction, Philosophy, Psychology, Self-Help, \u0026 Biographies. But yes, most of the time you’ll find me reading Literary Fiction, Satire, Horror, \u0026 Thrillers. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl (reread); Einstein: His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson; The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy; Horror Movie by Paul Tremblay; Self-Reliance \u0026 Other Essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson; The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (reread). What scene in your book was your favorite to write? Any scene where Schroeder is recalling or seeing something pleasant. Particularly his anxious ramblings of “things that bring him joy” when he is almost caught after killing one of his victims. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) Other than having copious amounts of various frozen chocolates in the freezer and at the ready, no. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Don’t fear the reaper. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Treat each other well. You never know what someone else is going through. And, life is short. Time is more valuable than anything money can purchase. Use it wisely because time moves oh, so fast, and cannot be reclaimed.
