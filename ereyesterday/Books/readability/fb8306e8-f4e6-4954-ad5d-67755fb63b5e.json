Catch up on the most popular stories from this week’s editions of Today in Books.Details Emerge in Sexual Assault Allegations Against Neil Gaiman 100 Books to Look For in 2025 It’s always a good day when the folks at The Millions drop their winter books preview, and this year’s is no exception. Among the 100 most anticipated books of winter 2025 are, yes, many titles that have appeared all over most-anticipated lists this season (Death of the Author, We Do Not Part, Stag Dance), but they’re accompanied by under-the-radar selections that are virtually guaranteed to introduce you to forthcoming releases you haven’t heard of yet. Among the new additions to my TBR are an investigation into Spotify’s origins and influence on music, an essay collection about Y2K, and a dystopian story set in Texas in 2038 described as “a mash-up of Olivia Butler, Ray Bradbury, and John Steinbeck.” Sold. Boston’s First Romance Bookstore Opens This WeekendThe last few years have seen a boom in bookstores focused exclusively on romance, and this weekend, Boston will join the growing list of cities that can boast of having one. Lovestruck Books, located in Harvard Square, will open Friday, January 17 with a celebration that will include raffles, tarot card readings, blind-date-with-a-book opportunities, a coffee tasting hosted by the in-store cafe run by George Howell Coffee, and a chance to create custom jewelry. Per a release issued earlier this week, owner Rachel Kanter hopes Lovestruck will become “a vibrant community where guests can indulge in their love for romance, explore new narratives, and feel a sense of belonging,” noting that the store will emphasize “titles penned by women, BIPOC, LGBTQIA+ authors, and more.” May her efforts succeed.
