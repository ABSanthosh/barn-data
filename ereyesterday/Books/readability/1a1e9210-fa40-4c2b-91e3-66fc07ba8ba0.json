  "description": "Twenty-five years into his prolific career, Lemire (Minor Arcana, 2025, etc.) humbly reflects on his expansive bibliography and guides readers through his progression from producing his own self-published zines to inking production deals with Netflix. Each chapter primarily focuses on one book’s genesis and is packed with character studies, sketches, and archival photos. Lemire worked constantly, committed himself to his craft, and held on to stories and ideas for years before finding the bandwidth to develop them. Starting in the mid-’90s, he recounts self-publishing and distributing his own comics while living in Toronto. (His first zine, Ashtray #1, is reprinted in full in the book’s appendix.) He won a Xeric Grant in 2005 for his book Lost Dogs, which garnered the attention of small publishing houses. While working on his Essex County books in 2007-2008, DC Comics showed interest and opened a door that led to multiyear runs of mainstream comics like Trillium, Animal Man, and Sweet Tooth (now a Netflix series). After leaving DC for a disappointing stint at Marvel, Lemire now prioritizes his creator-owned serials. His memoir is written not as a comic but as a straightforward text, and frequent clichés suggest that, compared to the taut action of his comics, this format might require more words than Lemire is accustomed to working with. His early years were “a roller coaster of exciting things”; writing volume 2 of Essex County was “just…incredible.” While at DC, “learning how to write mainstream comics was only half the battle,” and a pitch meeting was “just throwing stuff against the wall and seeing what stuck.” On his initial breakthrough with DC/Vertigo, he says, “Talk about being at the right place at the right time.” Despite some clunky prose, the book’s lavish trove of behind-the-scenes lore and Lemire’s unbridled energy are capable of inspiring budding cartoonists.",

  "text": "Q\u0026A by Adrian Tomine ‧ RELEASE DATE: Oct. 15, 2024 A cartoonist’s gentle and charming epistolary memoir. A cartoonist uses fans’ questions to trace his personal history. Tomine began self-publishing his work at the age of 16. Since then, he’s developed a devoted fandom that, he says, has stuck by him for almost three decades. Although cartooning is a solitary profession, Tomine says his relationship with his readers has helped him stave off the loneliness that is, so often, a hazard of the job. He writes, “It’s never felt that way. In fact, I often think of my career as a decades-long conversation between myself and an amorphous, mostly anonymous group of people who are for some reason drawn to my work.” In Q\u0026A, Tomine continues this conversation by responding to some of the most common queries, which include how to correctly pronounce his name (which, it turns out, Tomine didn’t know until a trip to Japan), his favorite brands of art supplies, his ability to balance the inspirations and frustrations of parents, and his thoughts about adapting his comics into films. He also offers career advice, describing how he got his start at theNew Yorker, spelling out his opinions on self-publishing and marketing, and providing ideas for connecting with comic artists who could serve as role models or mentors. Although this memoir doesn’t necessarily contain a clear character arc, it does provide a fascinating insight into a beloved artist’s personal history. Tomine’s writing is compassionate, empathetic, and tongue-in-cheek, and his narratorial voice has the intimate, confessional frankness of a good friend. The book’s visuals—which include Tomine’s illustrations—are a welcome addition to the text.
