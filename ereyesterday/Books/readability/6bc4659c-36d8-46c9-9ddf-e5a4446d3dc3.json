  "description": "When a youngster and his grandma receive notice that his school is switching to at-home learning, the boy becomes concerned. So far, the family has relied on his phone for their internet needs; now they’ll need a computer. His grandmother reminds him, “We weave to get what we need….It’s how we’ve always survived.” She shears a sheep, cleans the wool, collects plants, makes dyes, and weaves “in prayer.” When the deadline approaches, the boy uses technology to help her get the word out, so they can sell the rug in time. The book refreshingly models generational harmony, demonstrating a future in which children can hold on to sacred traditions while using tech for good. Vandever and illustrator Mitchell effectively aim to teach many young readers about the significance of weaving to the Navajo people and present images of weaving tools. In addition, there’s a section on the importance of using parental controls and monitoring how one’s children use the internet. Amid beautiful full-color illustrations, the text employs easily digestible words and short sentences, which will be helpful for younger children.",

  "text": "WHY A DAUGHTER NEEDS A MOM by Gregory R. Lange ; illustrated by Sydney Hanson ‧ RELEASE DATE: May 1, 2019 New parents of daughters will eat these up and perhaps pass on the lessons learned. All the reasons why a daughter needs a mother. Each spread features an adorable cartoon animal parent-child pair on the recto opposite a rhyming verse: “I’ll always support you in giving your all / in every endeavor, the big and the small, / and be there to catch you in case you should fall. / I hope you believe this is true.” A virtually identical book, Why a Daughter Needs a Dad, publishes simultaneously. Both address standing up for yourself and your values, laughing to ease troubles, being thankful, valuing friendship, persevering and dreaming big, being truthful, thinking through decisions, and being open to differences, among other topics. Though the sentiments/life lessons here and in the companion title are heartfelt and important, there are much better ways to deliver them. These books are likely to go right over children’s heads and developmental levels (especially with the rather advanced vocabulary); their parents are the more likely audience, and for them, the books provide some coaching in what kids need to hear. The two books are largely interchangeable, especially since there are so few references to mom or dad, but one spread in each book reverts to stereotype: Dad balances the two-wheeler, and mom helps with clothing and hair styles. Since the books are separate, it aids in customization for many families. New parents of daughters will eat these up and perhaps pass on the lessons learned.
