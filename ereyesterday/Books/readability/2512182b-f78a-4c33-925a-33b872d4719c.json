With relatable characters, heart-pounding drama, and life-changing moments, these stories are perfect for anyone ready to relive their youth—or explore it for the first time. Ready for your next YA obsession? Fate of the Storm (Demon Storm Book 8) by Valerie Storm Release Date: May 13, 2025 For a moment, Kari and Ari have a moment of peace. There is a glimmer of light that threatens to wash away the darkness as they finally bind their fates together in a formal ceremony. Then Kari’s moment of joy comes to a halt as the world shakes and Taris is ripped apart. The Lord of Demons, Velthas, has risen. Buy on Amazon Lifebound (Royal Sins Book 1) by D.N. Hoxa Release Date: May 6, 2025 Not when I was five and told them about the boy with pointy ears who saved my life in the forest. Not during the thirteen miserable years of bullying and being labeled the town weirdo. Until a guy with golden eyes and a royal guard escort shows up at my door to drop a bombshell. That little boy? Yeah, he’s real. Buy on Amazon Breaking Coven, Building Dreams (The Excommunicated Witch Savant Book 1) by Isabel Campbell and Michael Anderle Release Date: May 2, 2025 Jo Locket’s extraordinary magical gifts make her a threat to the Coven’s rigid order. When forced to swear a blood oath of obedience, she responds with defiance, earning instant excommunication and exile. With nothing but her raw savant powers of illusion and healing, Jo flees to Seattle seeking her renegade aunt, who once escaped the same fate. Her ambitious plan: transform her “Mt. Shasta Experience” train shows into a profitable enterprise to fund something revolutionary… Buy on Amazon The Survivor Wants to Die at the End (They Both Die at the End Series Book 3) by Adam Silvera Release Date: May 6, 2025 Paz Dario stays up every night, waiting for the Death-Cast call that would mean he doesn’t have to keep faking his way through this lonely life. After a devastating day, Paz decides he’s done waiting around for Death-Cast. If they say he’s not dying, he’ll just have to prove them wrong. But right before Paz can die, a boy saves his life. Buy on Amazon Summer Girls by Jennifer Dugan Release Date: May 13, 2025 Cass has a rule about dating summer girls—just say no. Every year, her idyllic beach town is flooded with summer girls, the obnoxious daughters of the rich, who stay in their families’ summer homes, sail their yachts, and generally make things unbearable for townies like Cass. Birdie is the ultimate summer girl. She’s the daughter of a wealthy real estate developer dad and a social media influencer mom, and this summer Birdie happens to be in big trouble for accidentally crashing her boyfriend’s very expensive car. Buy on Amazon Audre \u0026 Bash Are Just Friends by Tia Williams Release Date: May 6, 2025 Scorching-hot summer. Scorching-hot chemistry.
