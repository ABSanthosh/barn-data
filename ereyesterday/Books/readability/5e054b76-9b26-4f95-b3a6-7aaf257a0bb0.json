  "text": "Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more. I had several summer reading lists I wanted to link to but thought “I can’t link to more than one of these in a day that is too much” and then I thought “but if I make today’s newsletter a collection of them then I CAN.” So that’s what we have have for you today in Today in Books. Summer reading lists. A lot of them. And I think they were all written by humans. Mostly. Pretty sure. __________________________________ The J.P.
