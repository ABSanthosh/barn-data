  "description": "It’s been 11 years since clawed, flesh-eating, giant aliens attacked Earth, and their ever-present flying disks continue to patrol the planet. Electronic technology and communications were wiped out by electromagnetic pulses, and billions died. Now the air and water are tainted, and humans in “converter” breathing masks subsist in scattered fortifications or exist independently as bandits and loners. The nameless hero (who, readers eventually learn, is ex-military) traverses ruins of the western United States as a self-appointed messenger, carrying notes from desperate holdovers from one redoubt to another. In self-imposed exile, she’s tortured by grief over the loss of her fighter-pilot husband and their children; she also faces survivors who embrace lawlessness, nihilism, or cannibalistic cultism. Starling’s compact work reads like a splatterpunk version of Cormac McCarthy’s grim novel The Road (2006), combined with the second half of H.G. Wells’ The War of the Worlds (1898); like the Martians in the latter work, the extraterrestrials in this one howl continuously, and like Wells’ narrator, Starling’s protagonist is nameless and navigates a psychological and physical landscape of devastation. Scattered supporting characters have disturbing, unhelpful ways of dealing with humankind’s fall. A sickening cyborg called “the Crone” even manages to raise a barbaric army that’s as inhumane as the alien invaders: “What seemed like hundreds of them followed over every angle of the rim, crazed and swarming warriors carving through the darkness and staining the black night red. Some wore exotic military uniforms, gaudy jackets flared with ribbons of superfluous rank and trophies of the slain.” The details of the invasion itself are left for readers to supply, which effectively puts the emphasis squarely on the immediate mood. Along the way, the author gets across a sense of fear of what lies around every corner, and reveals the visible and invisible scars of the traumatized.",

  "text": "PROPHET SONG by Paul Lynch ‧ RELEASE DATE: Dec. 5, 2023 Captivating, frightening, and a singular achievement. As Ireland devolves into a brutal police state, one woman tries to preserve her family in this stark fable. For Eilish Stack, a molecular biologist living with her husband and four children in Dublin, life changes all at once and then slowly worsens beyond imagining. Two men appear at her door one night, agents of the new secret police, seeking her husband, Larry, a union official. Soon he is detained under the Emergency Powers Act recently pushed through by the new ruling party, and she cannot contact him. Eilish sees things shifting at work to those backing the ruling party. The state takes control of the press, the judiciary. Her oldest son receives a summons to military duty for the regime, and she tries to send him to Northern Ireland. He elects to join the rebel forces and soon she cannot contact him, either. His name and address appear in a newspaper ad listing people dodging military service. Eilish is coping with her father’s growing dementia, her teenage daughter’s depression, the vandalizing of her car and house. Then war comes to Dublin as the rebel forces close in on the city. Offered a chance to flee the country by her sister in Canada, Eilish can’t abandon hope for her husband’s and son’s returns. Lynch makes every step of this near-future nightmare as plausible as it is horrific by tightly focusing on Eilish, a smart, concerned woman facing terrible choices and losses. An exceptionally gifted writer, Lynch brings a compelling lyricism to her fears and despair while he marshals the details marking the collapse of democracy and the norms of daily life. His tonal control, psychological acuity, empathy, and bleakness recall Cormac McCarthy’s The Road (2006). And Eilish, his strong, resourceful, complete heroine, recalls the title character of Lynch’s excellent Irish-famine novel, Grace (2017). Captivating, frightening, and a singular achievement.
