  "description": "In the latest in the Critical Lives series, Goodby and Wigginton, Thomas scholars at Sheffield Hallam University, offer a brisk but comprehensive look at the life of Dylan Thomas (1914-1953), eschewing the popular image of a “rumpled, Dionysiac…summoner of elemental powers” in favor of a more nuanced portrait of a driven, focused writer who had penned a dozen “masterpieces” by the time he was 19-and-a-half. The book moves confidently through Thomas’ upbringing in a “middling prosperous” suburb of Swansea, his grammar school education, and his complicated relationship with his father, D.J., who named his son after a character in a Welsh medieval tale. From there we progress to the poet’s early adulthood, and the authors make note of both Thomas’ periods of intense productivity and his ambition; after his first collection, 18 Poems, was published in 1934 to not insignificant acclaim, Thomas wanted to build on its success “as quickly as possible,” and Twenty-Five Poems was published less than two years later. In between the two collections, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara, whom he would marry. Next, the authors address World War II and its effect on Thomas, as well as his work making wartime documentaries for Strand Films, concluding with the poet’s four tours of America in the early 1950s before his untimely death at the age of 39. This slim volume ably summarizes the events of the poet’s life, but where it “fill[s] a gap” is in the “critically informed attention” it pays to Thomas’ writing, offering close reads of many of the poems and the “puns, wordplay and rhetorical devices” he employed. “The life is read in the light of [Thomas’] work, rather than the other way around,” the authors write.",

  "text": "LOVE, PAMELA by Pamela Anderson ‧ RELEASE DATE: Jan. 31, 2023 A juicy story with some truly crazy moments, yet Anderson's good heart shines through. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 35 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller The iconic model tells the story of her eventful life. According to the acknowledgments, this memoir started as \"a fifty-page poem and then grew into hundreds of pages of…more poetry.\" Readers will be glad that Anderson eventually turned to writing prose, since the well-told anecdotes and memorable character sketches are what make it a page-turner. The poetry (more accurately described as italicized notes-to-self with line breaks) remains strewn liberally through the pages, often summarizing the takeaway or the emotional impact of the events described: \"I was / and still am / an exceptionally / easy target. / And, / I'm proud of that.\" This way of expressing herself is part of who she is, formed partly by her passion for Anaïs Nin and other writers; she is a serious maven of literature and the arts. The narrative gets off to a good start with Anderson’s nostalgic memories of her childhood in coastal Vancouver, raised by very young, very wild, and not very competent parents. Here and throughout the book, the author displays a remarkable lack of anger. She has faced abuse and mistreatment of many kinds over the decades, but she touches on the most appalling passages lightly—though not so lightly you don't feel the torment of the media attention on the events leading up to her divorce from Tommy Lee. Her trip to the pages of Playboy, which involved an escape from a violent fiance and sneaking across the border, is one of many jaw-dropping stories. In one interesting passage, Julian Assange's mother counsels Anderson to desexualize her image in order to be taken more seriously as an activist. She decided that “it was too late to turn back now”—that sexy is an inalienable part of who she is. Throughout her account of this kooky, messed-up, enviable, and often thrilling life, her humility (her sons \"are true miracles, considering the gene pool\") never fails her. A juicy story with some truly crazy moments, yet Anderson's good heart shines through.
