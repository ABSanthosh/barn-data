  "text": "15 Apr 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Love \u0026 Other Cures for the Recently Undead? I was golfing with a friend and we were talking about zombies and zombie cures. It got me thinking about the psychology impact of going through a zombie apocalypse and what that would look like for the people left behind. The more I thought about it, the less I could let it go. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Love \u0026 Other Cures for the Recently Undead, what would they be? “The Night We Met” by Lord Huron-I feel like this song was written for them. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Psychological mystery, fantasy, quiet horror. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Lady Tan’s Circle of Women by Lisa See- it’s for my book club! What scene in your book was your favorite to write? The tennis court scene (wink, wink). Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) No real quirky habits other than I use the WORACLE cards pretty regularly. They’re a deck of cards I created to help with the writing process. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? This thing isn’t going to write itself. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? That there’s still hope after trauma. Buy The Book Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly. meghan Recommended Posts",
