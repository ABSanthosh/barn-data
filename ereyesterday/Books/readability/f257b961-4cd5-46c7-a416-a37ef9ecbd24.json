  "text": "11 Jun 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Woe is Wednesday? This is the third book in my Story Smith Mystery series, which can be read as a standalone. I wanted to give private eye Story Smith an easy case for a change and then have her quickly discover that it is her most complicated and dangerous so far. I also like the false identity trope, where she gets to pretend to be someone else for a while, giving her a chance to act out of character in a fun way that propels her into more trouble than she ever imagined possible. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Woe is Wednesday, what would they be? Woe is Wednesday takes place in the summer of 1955, when Rock Around the Clock by Bill Haley \u0026 His Comets was the number one hit. That’s a great theme song for the Story Smith Mystery series. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? My favorite genres to read are romance and mystery, preferably a mix of both, which is what I’m writing now. What books are on your TBR pile right now? I have many books on my TBR pile right now, including fiction and nonfiction. They include Now or Never by Janet Evanovich, The Corpse in the Closet by Lucy Score, Dead Man’s List by Karen Rose, Dreams of El Dorado by H.W. Brands, and Mark Twain by Mark Chernow. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I love writing the WowWee It’s Wednesday party scene in the beginning of the book because it was fun watching Story pretend to be someone totally out of character and go on a pretend date with her crush, Steve Evans. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I often write with my cat, Summer, on my lap. She’s my muse. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? My motto as a writer is “I love writing fun, romantic, witty, and suspenseful books for the joy of my readers. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? My overall theme with all my books is that love wins, good wins.
