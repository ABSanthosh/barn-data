  "description": "Lulu feels safe as she swims around in the mangrove roots closely tethered to her mama. After rushing sea waters knock the tiny turtle off her perch on her mother’s shell, she’s tossed about and briefly faces her greatest fear of being left alone, before her mama quickly returns. Lulu soon learns that although some things in the oceans are frightening, others are helpful, and she builds trust in herself and her community with her mama’s guidance. Öztürk’s full-color illustrations bring the seabed to life with electric colors and many species in action, including a puffed-up pufferfish and a wood-hauling octopus. Surprisingly, nowhere does the author use or define the term hullabaloo, and although young readers may enjoy the sound of the word, they’ll surely wonder about its meaning. Being in unfamiliar places can be quite scary for children without caregivers around, and this book effectively encapsulates such feelings in its portrayal of the vastness of the deep; however, it also allays such fears with a soothing, motherly tone and assurance of neighborly support.",

  "text": "PETE THE CAT'S 12 GROOVY DAYS OF CHRISTMAS by James Dean ; illustrated by James Dean ‧ RELEASE DATE: Sept. 18, 2018 Pete’s fans might find it groovy; anyone else has plenty of other “12 Days of Christmas” variants to choose among Pete, the cat who couldn’t care less, celebrates Christmas with his inimitable lassitude. If it weren’t part of the title and repeated on every other page, readers unfamiliar with Pete’s shtick might have a hard time arriving at “groovy” to describe his Christmas celebration, as the expressionless cat displays not a hint of groove in Dean’s now-trademark illustrations. Nor does Pete have a great sense of scansion: “On the first day of Christmas, / Pete gave to me… / A road trip to the sea. / GROOVY!” The cat is shown at the wheel of a yellow microbus strung with garland and lights and with a star-topped tree tied to its roof. On the second day of Christmas Pete gives “me” (here depicted as a gray squirrel who gets on the bus) “2 fuzzy gloves, and a road trip to the sea. / GROOVY!” On the third day, he gives “me” (now a white cat who joins Pete and the squirrel) “3 yummy cupcakes,” etc. The “me” mentioned in the lyrics changes from day to day and gift to gift, with “4 far-out surfboards” (a frog), “5 onion rings” (crocodile), and “6 skateboards rolling” (a yellow bird that shares its skateboards with the white cat, the squirrel, the frog, and the crocodile while Pete drives on). Gifts and animals pile on until the microbus finally arrives at the seaside and readers are told yet again that it’s all “GROOVY!” Pete’s fans might find it groovy; anyone else has plenty of other “12 Days of Christmas” variants to choose among .
