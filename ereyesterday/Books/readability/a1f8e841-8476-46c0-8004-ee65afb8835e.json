Just when you thought Best Books of the Year season was over, a new list enters the frame! r/Books, a subreddit with 26 million users, has announced their picks for the best books of 2024. These were all nominated by users and ranked by number of upvotes. Winners were announced in categories including Best Debut, Best Literary Fiction, Best Mystery or Thriller, Best Short Story Collection, Best Poetry, Best Science Fiction, Best Fantasy, Best Non-English Fiction, Best YA, Best Romance, Best Horror, Best Nonfiction, Best Book Cover, and Best Translated Novel. This is an interesting list that includes some of the big titles of the year that showed up on many Best Books of 2024 lists, like James by Percival Everett, but the variety of categories means that there are also books named that you may not have heard of, like Trans Liberation Station by Nova Martin. The winners are pretty heavily skewed towards male writers, though, which is perhaps not a surprise for Reddit. (About two thirds of their users are men.) Here are some of the 2024 winners of the r/Books Best Books of 2024. Best Non-English Fiction of 2024: Les Yeux de Mona by Thomas Schlesser Best Horror of 2024: Bury Your Gays by Chuck Tingle Best Nonfiction of 2024: The Message by Ta-Nehisi Coates Best Translated Novel of 2024: The Empusium by Olga Tokarczuk, translated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones Best Book Cover of 2024: Absolution by Jeff VanderMeer You can find all of the winners as well as runners up at r/Books.
