  "description": "The German philosopher and sociologist Theodor Adorno (1903-1969) remains famous today for his Marxist critiques of popular culture as well as for a prose style as intricately knotty as a macrame vest. Among his most characteristically memorable pronouncements was this: “The critique of culture is confronted with the last stage in the dialectic of culture and barbarism: to write a poem after Auschwitz is barbaric, and that corrodes also the knowledge which expresses why it has become impossible to write poetry today.” Less daunting than this statement is his lecture to a German audience in 1962, published in German in 1963, and here translated into English for the first time. In just over 40 pages of compelling speech, Adorno outlines the nature of antisemitism, some reasons why it persists, and why it has been long embedded in our educational institutions. Adorno argues that antisemitism often begins “in the family home.” It is reinforced in schooling. “I suspect that a considerable number of teachers still sympathize silently, tacitly, non-explicitly with antisemitism.” What is the answer? Open-mindedness, a global sensibility, and an awareness of class and cultural conflict. “Effective prevention of antisemitism is inseparable from a prevention of nationalism in all its forms. One cannot be against antisemitism on the one hand while being a militant nationalist on the other.” Following the lecture in this book is an interpretive essay by the scholar Peter Gordon, situating the talk in the context of Adorno’s larger concerns with “group solidarity.” “The warm feeling of a collective bond,” Gordon writes, increases when the group expels those “who bear the stigma of difference.” Delivered over 60 years ago, Adorno’s lecture could be heard as fresh news today.",

  "text": "ROSE BOOK OF BIBLE CHARTS, MAPS AND TIME LINES by Timothy Paul Jones ‧ RELEASE DATE: Sept. 1, 2005 Worthwhile reference stuffed with facts and illustrations. A compendium of charts, time lines, lists and illustrations to accompany study of the Bible. This visually appealing resource provides a wide array of illustrative and textually concise references, beginning with three sets of charts covering the Bible as a whole, the Old Testament and the New Testament. These charts cover such topics as biblical weights and measures, feasts and holidays and the 12 disciples. Most of the charts use a variety of illustrative techniques to convey lessons and provide visual interest. A worthwhile example is â€œHow We Got the Bible,” which provides a time line of translation history, comparisons of canons among faiths and portraits of important figures in biblical translation, such as Jerome and John Wycliffe. The book then presents a section of maps, followed by diagrams to conceptualize such structures as Noah’s Ark and Solomon’s Temple. Finally, a section on Christianity, cults and other religions describes key aspects of history and doctrine for certain Christian sects and other faith traditions. Overall, the authors take a traditionalist, conservative approach. For instance, they list Moses as the author of the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) without making mention of claims to the contrary. When comparing various Christian sects and world religions, the emphasis is on doctrine and orthodox theology. Some chapters, however, may not completely align with the needs of Catholic and Orthodox churches. But the authors’ leanings are muted enough and do not detract from the work’s usefulness. As a resource, it’s well organized, inviting and visually stimulating. Even the most seasoned reader will learn something while browsing. Worthwhile reference stuffed with facts and illustrations.
