  "description": "Those in London society who have met Miss Lydia Hope-Wallace know her only as a painfully shy, absurdly wealthy spinster. That’s because almost no one knows that she’s also responsible for the radical pamphlets published by her anonymous alter ego, “H,” on topics like universal suffrage and the right to divorce—not even the Earl of Strathrannoch, with whom H has been corresponding for several years. As a result, things are a bit awkward when she sneaks north to Scotland to propose to the Earl, only to find, when she arrives at his castle, that he actually doesn’t know Lydia or H, and someone else has been writing to her under his name. Arthur Baird, the earl, quickly realizes that his brother, Davis, has been masquerading as him. Though in her embarrassment Lydia tries to escape, the unexpected chaos of a stampeding herd of zebras provides her with a chance to reconsider, and she decides to help Arthur figure out the mystery behind his brother’s behavior. They are almost immediately attracted to each other, and though Arthur is loathe to get involved with a woman he thinks belongs to his brother, circumstances soon lead them to pretend to be newlyweds, which leads to a series of red-hot encounters and allows both to imagine what it might be like to actually marry. This sequel to Ne’er Duke Well (2024) brings more political intrigue and suspense to the world of the woman-run Belvoir’s Library, with a similar heat level and comedic sensibility. Though the plot is a bit disjointed, the almost-slow-burn chemistry between Arthur and Lydia—and the scorching scenes that follow—keep the pages turning. With the help of a lovely Scottish backdrop (and accents), Vasti’s fans, as well as those looking for a post-Bridgerton story, will be pleased.",

  "text": "THE LAST LETTER by Rebecca Yarros ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 26, 2019 A thoughtful and pensive tale with intelligent characters and a satisfying romance. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 189 Our Verdict GET IT Kirkus Reviews' Best Books Of 2019 A promise to his best friend leads an Army serviceman to a family in need and a chance at true love in this novel. Beckett Gentry is surprised when his Army buddy Ryan MacKenzie gives him a letter from Ryan’s sister, Ella. Abandoned by his mother, Beckett grew up in a series of foster homes. He is wary of attachments until he reads Ella’s letter. A single mother, Ella lives with her twins, Maisie and Colt, at Solitude, the resort she operates in Telluride, Colorado. They begin a correspondence, although Beckett can only identify himself by his call sign, Chaos. After Ryan’s death during a mission, Beckett travels to Telluride as his friend had requested. He bonds with the twins while falling deeply in love with Ella. Reluctant to reveal details of Ryan’s death and risk causing her pain, Beckett declines to disclose to Ella that he is Chaos. Maisie needs treatment for neuroblastoma, and Beckett formally adopts the twins as a sign of his commitment to support Ella and her children. He and Ella pursue a romance, but when an insurance investigator questions the adoption, Beckett is faced with revealing the truth about the letters and Ryan’s death, risking losing the family he loves. Yarros’ (Wilder, 2016, etc.) novel is a deeply felt and emotionally nuanced contemporary romance bolstered by well-drawn characters and strong, confident storytelling. Beckett and Ella are sympathetic protagonists whose past experiences leave them cautious when it comes to love. Beckett never knew the security of a stable home life. Ella impulsively married her high school boyfriend, but the marriage ended when he discovered she was pregnant. The author is especially adept at developing the characters through subtle but significant details, like Beckett’s aversion to swearing. Beckett and Ella’s romance unfolds slowly in chapters that alternate between their first-person viewpoints. The letters they exchanged are pivotal to their connection, and almost every chapter opens with one. Yarros’ writing is crisp and sharp, with passages that are poetic without being florid. For example, in a letter to Beckett, Ella writes of motherhood: “But I’m not the center of their universe. I’m more like their gravity.” While the love story is the book’s focus, the subplot involving Maisie’s illness is equally well-developed, and the link between Beckett and the twins is heartfelt and sincere. A thoughtful and pensive tale with intelligent characters and a satisfying romance.
