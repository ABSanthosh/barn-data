  "description": "London-based chef Paul Delamare is depressed by the death of his lover, Marcus, who left him a charming cottage in Belgravia, and unhappy that one of Marcus’ relatives is harassing him. But Paul’s friend Julie, a food editor, gets him work at her magazine and keeps his spirits up. Paul has long been friends with Christian Wagner, a self-obsessed celebrity chef fallen on hard times. Because Christian has broken his arm, Paul—who’s too nice for his own good—agrees to fill in for him with the intensive beginners’ course he’s supposed to lead at the posh Chester Square Cookery School, located in a mansion where Christian lives as well as teaches. The students are naturally disappointed that Christian isn’t teaching, but the oddly mixed group members all seem to appreciate Paul’s first lesson on knife techniques. On his way to work the next morning, Paul sees that the glass door to Christian’s flat is smashed—and when he goes in to investigate, he finds Christian with his head nearly hacked off by the cleaver Paul had used in class the day before, and promptly faints. A Chester Square employee finds Paul passed out and calls the police. Since the students want the classes to continue, a shaky Paul carries on even though he senses that the police suspect him for his knife skills. Paul slowly learns more about the students and things he never knew about Christian. When one of his students dies, Paul realizes that he’d better uncover the killer before the police pin the murders on him—and his determined search to unravel the serpentine puzzle may be just what he needs to restart his life.",

  "text": "TO DIE FOR by David Baldacci ‧ RELEASE DATE: Nov. 12, 2024 Fast-moving excitement with a satisfying finish. The feds must protect an accused criminal and an orphaned girl. Maybe you’ve met him before as protagonist of The 6:20 Man (2022): Ex-Army Ranger Travis Devine, who’d had the dubious fortune to tangle with “the girl on the train,” is now assigned by his homeland security boss to protect Danny Glass, who's awaiting trial on multiple RICO charges in Washington state. Devine has what it takes: He “was a closer, snooper, fixer, investigator,” and, when necessary, a killer. These skills are on full display as the deaths of three key witnesses grind justice to a temporary halt. Glass has a 12-year-old niece, Betsy Odom, and each is the other’s only living relative—her parents recently died of an apparent drug overdose. The FBI has temporary guardianship of Betsy, who's a handful. She tells Travis that though she’s not yet 13, she's 28 in “life-shit years.” The financially well-heeled Glass wants to be her legal guardian with an eye to eventual adoption, but what are his real motives? And what happens to her if he's convicted? Meanwhile, Betsy insists that her parents never touched drugs, and she begs Travis to find out how they really died. This becomes part of a mission that oozes danger. The small town of Ricketts has a woman mayor who’s full of charm on the surface, but deeply corrupt and deadly when crossed. She may be linked to a subversive group called \"12/24/65,\" as in 1865, when the Ku Klux Klan beast was born. Blood flows, bombs explode, and people perish, both good guys and not-so-good guys. Readers might ponder why in fiction as well as in life, it sometimes seems necessary for many to die so one may live. And what about the girl on the train? She's not necessary to the plot, but she's a fun addition as she pops in and out of the pages, occasionally leaving notes for Travis. Maybe she still wants him dead.  Fast-moving excitement with a satisfying finish.
