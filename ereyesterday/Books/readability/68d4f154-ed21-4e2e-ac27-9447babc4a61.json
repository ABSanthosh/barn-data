  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Ghost and Tell? Ghost and Tell is book ten in my Ghost Detective series, so by now Audrey and I are basically co-workers. This time, she’s dealing with a dead schoolteacher, a buried scandal, and a raccoon who’s way too comfortable stealing evidence. There’s no deep, soul-searching inspiration behind it—just my love of murder mysteries, snarky banter, and fictional chaos. It also lets me explore what it would be like to live with a talking cat… which is exactly as ridiculous as it sounds. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Ghost and Tell, what would they be? Audrey (my ghost-whispering PI): “Try Everything” by Shakira, because she’s going to trip, fall, faceplant, and still keep going. Thor (her grumpy, food-obsessed cat): “I Want It That Way” — he has strong opinions about kibble. Bandit (the raccoon): “Smooth Criminal” by Michael Jackson. No explanation needed. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I love reading the same kinds of books I write—cozy mysteries with a paranormal twist, snarky characters, and a whole lot of heart. Give me ghosts, witches, and small-town secrets any day of the week. That said, I’ve also been dipping into some non-paranormal psychological thrillers lately—as long as they’re not too dark. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Right now, I’ve got The Last Devil to Die by Richard Osman, The Dead Romantics by Ashley Poston, and a few others I picked up purely because the covers were pretty or the blurbs made me laugh-snort. I’m a mood reader, so what I plan to read and what I actually read are often two very different things. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? Oh, the taser scene. That one had me giggling at the keyboard. I won’t spoil it, but let’s just say someone seriously underestimated Audrey—and for once, she didn’t tase herself. There was adrenaline, righteous fury, and a very satisfying zap. Easily one of my favorite moments to write in Ghost and Tell. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I wish I had something quirky to share, like wearing a yellow beret every time I write—but I don’t. I like to write in silence, and if there’s too much noise around, I’ll put on headphones and listen to thunderstorm sounds. That’s about as exciting as it gets. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? “Done is better than perfect.” That one’s served me well. Also: don’t skip coffee, and always back up your files. Seriously. Always. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? That even with ghosts and murder, my books are really about life. I want readers to laugh, escape the real world for a bit, and come away feeling lighter than when they started. If I can deliver a few laughs and a few surprises along the way, then I’ve done my job.
