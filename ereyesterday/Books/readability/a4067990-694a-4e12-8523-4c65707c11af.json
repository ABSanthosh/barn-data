These characters bend the rules, break the mold, and refuse to play by the script written for them. Perfect for readers who like their fantasy and sci-fi sharp, smart, and deeply character-driven. Thing Beyond Reason: First Contact, the Becoming (The Thing Trilogy Book 3) by Kendall Williams Release Date: May 2, 2025 A universe is going dark, and human destiny hangs in the balance… Jason and Arkan, the alien, play the Game as equals. Now they must part ways. On Mars, Jason makes a miraculous discovery. Something that alters gravity itself! Is this what he has been seeking all along? Did he discover it, or did it discover him? Does it even matter as he confronts evil personified, embedded in the fabric of time? Buy on Amazon Archer’s Moon: Dawn of Legends (Legends of Ansu Book 1) by J.W. Webb Release Date: June 10, 2025 Sorcery, vengeance, passion, and war! As a deity, Argonwui knows she can have it all. Watching the green world spinning below, she ventures down to explore and learn about the lesser beings dwelling amongst that swirling gas. A quick visit to relieve the monotony up there among the floating clouds. What could go wrong? Buy on Amazon Key of Power (Dynamis Novels Book 3) by Nancy Golden Release Date: March 24, 2025 King Rugal holds the Key of Power, but not even he fully understands what it can do. Whoever unlocks its secret can use that knowledge to their advantage, but only the rightful King of Elayas can wield its power. Will the Key of Power help Rugal defeat the coming evil, or will Rugal be forced to use it to destroy everything he loves? Buy on Amazon The Girl Who Wouldn’t Die by Jeff Abugov Release Date: June 7, 2025 She’s of our time, but she doesn’t age. Our epic tale follows the immortal woman through many lifetimes—past, present, and future—her struggle to keep her secret; her remorse in leaving loved ones when it’s time to move on; and her hardships slipping into her next identity. Violence, sex, adventure, and romance abound, but one thing’s for sure…eternal youth ain’t all it’s cracked up to be. Buy on Amazon Darkness, Light, and Fire (The Life And Times Of Gunnery Sergeant Jackson Mason Book 2) by Mark Jordan Release Date: June 15, 2025 In “Darkness, Light, and Fire,” the galaxy faces an unprecedented threat as an ancient, dark, and menacing enemy threatens to launch a relentless invasion, shaking the foundations of the galactic community. Heroes must rise to confront the growing threat, leading a desperate fight to turn the tide before the galaxy is consumed by darkness. Buy on Amazon The Phoenix Pencil Company by Allison King Release Date: June 3, 2025 In this dazzling debut novel, a hidden and nearly forgotten magic—of reforging pencils, bringing the memories they contain back to life—holds the power to transform a young woman’s relationship with her grandmother, and to mend long-lost connections across time and space.
