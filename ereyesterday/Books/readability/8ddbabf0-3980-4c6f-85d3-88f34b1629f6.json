  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Attie’s Amazing Adventures: Blueprints \u0026 Buried Truths? I’m a mix of farm girl grit and city girl spark, and for years, friends told me I should write my biography. Many of my real-life adventures, inventions, mistakes, and significant “aha” moments are woven into the CHARMS Book Series. Of course, it’s fiction… so unless you really know me, you’ll never quite be able to tell what’s true and what’s made up (and I’m not telling). I created this series for the smart girls, the curious ones, the kids who like to build things, ask big questions, and aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty. I wanted to write from a teen’s point of view, because that’s where the real magic and real growth happen. These books combine storytelling with life skills, career exploration, and real-life situations that teens are currently facing. Sometimes the best way to find answers is to read about someone else figuring them out, too. And sometimes, the best example is just being a good one. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Attie’s Amazing Adventures: Blueprints \u0026 Buried Truths, what would they be? Attie McAllister: “Roar” by Katy Perry. She’s inventive, determined, and a little rebellious (in the best way). “Roar” fits her perfectly. Attie is the kind of girl who builds rocket prototypes before breakfast and solves mysteries before curfew. This anthem captures her resilience, brainpower, and quiet confidence, even when the stakes get high. Jenny: “Confident” by Demi Lovato. Jenny brings the sparkle, the sass, and the social media savvy. She’s Attie’s ride-or-die best friend, and she knows how to take charge with flair. “Confident” celebrates her bold energy and unapologetic enthusiasm, whether she’s vlogging a clue hunt or hyping up Attie’s inventions. Raye: “Believer” by Imagine Dragons. Raye is introspective but fiercely loyal. She questions everything, often looking beneath the surface to find deeper truths. “Believer” taps into her quiet fire, her journey through loss, and her determination to rise stronger. She’s the one who feels deeply and channels that into action. Aunt Loxley: “Unstoppable” by Sia. She’s part artist, part secret agent, part mentor, and 100% wild card. This track captures her free-spirited energy, unexpected wisdom, and a past she doesn’t always talk about. She’s on her own mission, always chasing wonder, always ready to drop a truth bomb wrapped in a metaphor. Jackson: “Whatever It Takes” by Imagine Dragons. The perfectionist. The builder. The man with a plan… until it doesn’t go according to plan. Jackson has major “I’ll figure it out, even if it breaks me” energy. This song hits his drive to prove himself and support the team, even when his confidence falters. Attie’s Dad: “Safe and Sound” by Capital Cities. Cool under pressure, loyal to the core, and operating on a need-to-know basis. This low-key bop has secret-agent vibes with a protective streak. It’s the theme of a dad who might disappear on a mission but always leaves behind a breadcrumb trail and a backup plan. Attie’s Mom – “I Lived” by One Republic, NASA scientist. Mission-driven. Master of the clipboard and countdown. Attie’s mom is composed under pressure but has a fire in her belly. This power anthem represents every spreadsheet she’s color-coded and every system she’s launched, earthbound or otherwise. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I read everything. Truly. If it has a spine and words, I’ll give it a shot. Right now, the stack on my bedside table is about 20 books deep and dangerously close to toppling. I have a little rotation system: one YA book (to stay in tune with my audience), one historical fiction (because I love a good time-travel-without-jetlag moment), one business or personal development book (hello, lifelong learner), one gloriously trashy beach read (we all need a little romcom), and one random pick from the librarian’s “staff favorites” shelf. Rinse and repeat. As for writing, I live in the YA space because I believe those years are the most important for building confidence, curiosity, and a sense of purpose. But let’s be honest, I’m sneaking in a little history, leadership, and rom-com sparkle too. So yes, I read widely, but I write where the magic meets the mission. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Next up on my nightstand is Britannica’s Encyclopedia Infographica. It’s this beautifully designed, brainy feast of facts, and yes, I seriously want a copy just to display on my bookshelf like a trophy. It’s the kind of book that makes you smarter just by flipping through it… or at least feel smarter while doing so. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I am absolutely loving unveiling “The Six,” unraveling the meaning behind HELIOS, and connecting the dots between past and present. Writing those scenes felt like peeling back layers of a hidden history, one that reminds us how dangerous it is to erase people, ideas, or innovations just because they were ahead of their time. But honestly? The real fun was hiding clues throughout the book. Think of them as Easter eggs for the curious reader. Some are subtle, some are bold, and I’m still waiting to see who spots them all first. The truth is in there… if you know where to look. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) Before I ever type a word, I go on a long trek, sometimes through the woods, sometimes just wandering with no map, letting the characters and outline unravel in my mind. It’s my pre-writing ritual, like downloading the story from the sky. And almost every time, something strange or wonderful happens on that walk… which usually ends up in the book. So if you spot an oddly specific moment in the story, chances are it really happened – on a trail somewhere, just me, my boots, and a very busy imagination. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? “Get your hands dirty!” Whether it’s building something, fixing a problem, planting an idea, or just figuring out life, nothing significant happens if you’re afraid to dig in. I believe the best learning (and the best living) comes from doing. Mistakes, messes, and all. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Share it. Pass it on to a classmate, a teacher, a librarian, or a friend. I know there are more girls out there who love to “get their hands dirty” building things, solving problems, and chasing big ideas – just like I do. The CHARMS series is for them. And hey, don’t forget to get on the waitlist for the Secret Book Society… It’s just for Charms readers, and trust me, you want to be on the inside of this adventure.
