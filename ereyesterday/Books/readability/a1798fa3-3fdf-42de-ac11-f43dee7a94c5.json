Zainab Williams Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more. The Devil Wears Prada Again And we’re not calling it faux pas. Emily Blunt spilled the tea on The Devil Wears Prada 2, revealing that it goes into production in July. The 2006 adaptation of Lauren Weisberger’s novel, The Devil Wears Prada, featuring Hollywood heavies Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, and Blunt, was a commercial success. I found it deeply entertaining and can’t wait for the sequel even though I–we–know next to nothing about it. The original follows Andy (played by Hathaway) who lands a job as assistant to worst boss ever Miranda Priestley, editor-in-chief of one of the biggest fashion magazines in the industry. Weisberger, who worked a stint assisting none other than Anna Wintour before writing her bestseller (Wintour is unbothered), does have a sequel, Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns, upon which the second film may or may not be based. We’ll find out some time before it premieres on May 1, 2026. The Dua Lipa Book Club Expands Dua Lipa is taking her book club video series to Spotify. Service95 Book Club is described as “a space to enjoy all things literary, including Dua’s Monthly Reads and exclusive Q\u0026As between her and the authors, plus the best new book releases, reading recommendations from our team and more ways for you to read the world differently.” The podcast will feature both new interviews and conversations from the archive, and Dua’s summer book club picks were announced in celebration of the launch. They are: This House of Grief by Helen Garner, Dream Count by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and Fearless and Free by Josephine Baker. Her current June read is Widow Basquiat by Jennifer Clement.

The Next Dr. Who Series I always wanted to get into Dr. Who, but there are so many episodes, the fandom is so huge and passionate, I just haven’t scrounged up the energy. And, guess what? The Dr. Who franchise is getting even bigger and reaching out to the youngest Whovians with an animated series coming to BBC’s pre-school channel. The description kinda puts me in mind of The Magic School Bus series (of books and animated television)–fun! I’m not sure how you watch it if you don’t have access to CBeebies, but if it does well I can see it reaching other streaming platforms eventually. The 2025 Women’s Prize Winners in Fiction and Nonfiction The Women’s Prize is one of the biggest awards in the UK for literary achievement. It goes to a female-identifying writer of any nationality who has published a book in English in the UK over the previous year. Established in 1996, the award expanded in 2023 to also include a Women’s Prize in the category of nonfiction. A longlist in each category is announced in February (fiction and nonfiction), followed by a shortlist in April (fiction and nonfiction).
