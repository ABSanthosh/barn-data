  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write We Play Games? I’d wanted to write a psychological thriller about a married couple for a while, but I felt like so many plots had already been done. I wanted We Play Games to stand out, which is why I focussed on a toxic marriage where both are equally dark and dangerous. There’s a power play between Effie and Ben. Sometimes she has the upper hand, whereas other times he does. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of We Play Games, what would they be? “Toxic” by Britney Spears! What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Suspense and horror are my favourites, but I am a mood reader so I dip in and out of literary, fantasy and YA books too. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Probably half of the paperbacks and hardbacks that I own! I’ve been mostly listening to audiobooks so there’s a huge stack waiting for me. The latest Paula Hawkins book is on there. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? The very last scene that involves a side character. I can’t reveal too much because of spoilers! But the character in question had some really funny lines in the first draft that I ended up cutting because it was too jarring in tone. But I wish they’d made it in because they were a lot of fun to write. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) My cat scratches my feet from about 11am until I feed him lunch. But that’s probably more of a hindrance than anything! Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? “Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper” – Formation by Beyonce. Every time I have an unpleasant experience in this industry, I use those feelings of disappointment and anger to fuel me on to work even harder. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? One of the main characters believes she’s a terrible person and ends up fulfilling that belief. But if she’s been able to understand as a young person that she could be a better person, she could have saved herself from that fate. So always believe you can do better.
