  "description": "This timely book delves into a host of issues connected to nuclear weapons, with conclusions that are, to say the least, disturbing. Panda, who has extensive experience as a writer and government adviser specializing in military geopolitics, brings a great deal of research material to the task, combining historical information with novel insights. He notes that strategic deterrence kept the peace during the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, backed up with an underpinning structure of treaties and agreements. Most of these have become redundant, while China has vastly increased its nuclear arsenal. Panda believes that this could push the U.S. into upgrading its own stockpile, sparking a three-cornered arms race. He also devotes important attention to the potential for conflict between India and Pakistan, which is often overlooked in the West. Then there are wild cards, notably Iran and North Korea. They show scant regard for international nonproliferation rules and are pouring resources into nukes and missiles to carry them. Along the way, Panda examines new delivery systems such as hypersonic glide vehicles and long-range cruise missiles, which add another layer of volatility. Several countries have lower-yield nuclear weapons for battlefield operations, but their use could easily escalate into strategic strikes. Panda is concerned that deterrence might be no longer sufficient to ensure peace, although he does not see any real alternatives. He suggests that the big powers could establish avenues to defuse incidents that might spin out of control, but these would need to be overseen outside the public spotlight. Most of all, some fresh thinking and awareness among policymakers are required. Panda’s book is a good place to start.",

  "text": "ABUNDANCE by Ezra Klein \u0026 Derek Thompson ‧ RELEASE DATE: March 18, 2025 Cogent, well-timed ideas for meeting today’s biggest challenges. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 14 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Helping liberals get out of their own way. Klein, a New York Times columnist, and Thompson, an Atlantic staffer, lean to the left, but they aren’t interrogating the usual suspects. Aware that many conservatives have no interest in their opinions, the authors target their own side’s “pathologies.” Why do red states greenlight the kind of renewable energy projects that often languish in blue states? Why does liberal California have the nation’s most severe homelessness and housing affordability crises? One big reason: Liberal leadership has ensnared itself in a web of well-intentioned yet often onerous “goals, standards, and rules.” This “procedural kludge,” partially shaped by lawyers who pioneered a “democracy by lawsuit” strategy in the 1960s, threatens to stymie key breakthroughs. Consider the anti-pollution laws passed after World War II. In the decades since, homeowners’ groups in liberal locales have cited such statutes in lawsuits meant to stop new affordable housing. Today, these laws “block the clean energy projects” required to tackle climate change. Nuclear energy is “inarguably safer” than the fossil fuel variety, but because Washington doesn’t always “properly weigh risk,” it almost never builds new reactors. Meanwhile, technologies that may cure disease or slash the carbon footprint of cement production benefit from government support, but too often the grant process “rewards caution and punishes outsider thinking.” The authors call this style of governing “everything-bagel liberalism,” so named because of its many government mandates. Instead, they envision “a politics of abundance” that would remake travel, work, and health. This won’t happen without “changing the processes that make building and inventing so hard.” It’s time, then, to scrutinize everything from municipal zoning regulations to the paperwork requirements for scientists getting federal funding. The authors’ debut as a duo is very smart and eminently useful. Cogent, well-timed ideas for meeting today’s biggest challenges.
