  "description": "The author suffered sexual abuse at the hands of Mr. Jay, a next-door neighbor and trusted family friend. The assaults began before the Hettes started kindergarten and continued for years. The psychological fallout from such “capital-T Trauma” was profound—as an adult, the author became a relentless workaholic, precluding genuine intimacy or authentic friendship with others. In fact, the aftermath of her trauma, more than the abuse itself, turned out to be the deepest and most abiding source of her pain, a terrifying insight conveyed by the author with admirable candor and lucidity in this affecting memoir. Years later, after earning a doctorate in neuroscience and becoming assistant dean of a prestigious pre-med program, a colleague’s “dyspeptic rant” and a fellow dean’s mealy mouthed response to it prompted Hettes to reveal to her colleagues that she was the survivor of sexual abuse. Reeling from yet another episode of “revictimization,” the author sought the help of a therapist, Piper Manna, determined to overcome the “mountains of self-revulsion, hatred, and shame” her tormentor had left her with. Hettes’ writing verges on the poetic as she describes the heartbreaking fear that her suffering is permanent: “Perhaps, our pasts are not words on a page, but rather tattoos on our minds and hearts. Thus, we are marked—as abused, as violated, as victimized—with ink that permeates every tissue layer.” The narrative is bolstered by Manna’s fascinating insights into the human psyche and the author’s expert knowledge of the human brain (she fascinatingly details the strain her self-castigation put on her limbic system). While often challenging to read, given the grim nature of the abuse, the memoir includes moments of humor and hope, and it is inspiring to chart Hettes’ journey from despair to a degree in “self-studies.”",

  "text": "LOVE, PAMELA by Pamela Anderson ‧ RELEASE DATE: Jan. 31, 2023 A juicy story with some truly crazy moments, yet Anderson's good heart shines through. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 46 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller The iconic model tells the story of her eventful life. According to the acknowledgments, this memoir started as \"a fifty-page poem and then grew into hundreds of pages of…more poetry.\" Readers will be glad that Anderson eventually turned to writing prose, since the well-told anecdotes and memorable character sketches are what make it a page-turner. The poetry (more accurately described as italicized notes-to-self with line breaks) remains strewn liberally through the pages, often summarizing the takeaway or the emotional impact of the events described: \"I was / and still am / an exceptionally / easy target. / And, / I'm proud of that.\" This way of expressing herself is part of who she is, formed partly by her passion for Anaïs Nin and other writers; she is a serious maven of literature and the arts. The narrative gets off to a good start with Anderson’s nostalgic memories of her childhood in coastal Vancouver, raised by very young, very wild, and not very competent parents. Here and throughout the book, the author displays a remarkable lack of anger. She has faced abuse and mistreatment of many kinds over the decades, but she touches on the most appalling passages lightly—though not so lightly you don't feel the torment of the media attention on the events leading up to her divorce from Tommy Lee. Her trip to the pages of Playboy, which involved an escape from a violent fiance and sneaking across the border, is one of many jaw-dropping stories. In one interesting passage, Julian Assange's mother counsels Anderson to desexualize her image in order to be taken more seriously as an activist. She decided that “it was too late to turn back now”—that sexy is an inalienable part of who she is. Throughout her account of this kooky, messed-up, enviable, and often thrilling life, her humility (her sons \"are true miracles, considering the gene pool\") never fails her. A juicy story with some truly crazy moments, yet Anderson's good heart shines through.
