  "text": "27 Nov 2024 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Dreams That Bind Us (Romancing the Keys Book 3)? My husband and I visit Key West regularly, and there’s a particular coffee shop we stop at every day. One day as we left through a back alley, I nearly ran over someone on the sidewalk and realized what a great meet cute it would make for a romance story. That was the start of Dreams That Bind Us. James and Anna had both been introduced in A Dove in Paradise and they both screamed the need for their own story. When I placed them into the meet cute idea, the story ran from there. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Dreams That Bind Us (Romancing the Keys Book 3), what would they be? “Come To My Window” by Melissa Etheridge. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Definitely romance, but I try to read as many sub-genres as possible. My favorites right now are contemporary, romantasy, and romcom. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Bad Demon by Sherilee Gray, Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros, How My Neighbor Stole Christmas by Meghan Quinn, and Golden Touch by Sarina Bowen. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I had fun with this entire book because it flowed so well. But my favorite would have to be the meet cute – the crash at the coffee shop. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I need jazz playing in the background and a cup of coffee or tea nearby. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Focus on the positive as often as possible and never stop moving forward. When it feels like it’s at it’s worst, you’re very close to a breakthrough.
