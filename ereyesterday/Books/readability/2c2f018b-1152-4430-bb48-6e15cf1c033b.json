View All posts by Kelly Jensen Arkansas ‘has introduced ‘s legislation mirrors Illinois’s anti-book ban bill in that it ties a small pool of money to anti-book ban policies in libraries state wide. It applies both to public school libraries and public libraries statewide. HB1028 repeals Arkansas Code § 5-27-212, then provides criminal protections for library workers and school employees when claims are made that they have provided “obscene material.” Colorado – Senate Bill 63 Sponsors: Lisa Cutter and Dafna Michaelson Jenet Last year, Colorado passed an anti-book ban bill that covered public libraries. How the bill started–a robust piece of legislation that addressed many elements of the current book and library censorship regime–was not how it ended. The initial bill addressed both school and public libraries. What passed covered only public libraries. This year, Senators are going back in hopes to protect public schools from book banning. The bill requires public schools have a formal process for reconsidering books and, if a book challenge arises, those schools must follow the policy. If there’s no policy, the challenge is null and void. The bill also emphasizes that book challenges are open records, something that was a court-decided issue in Colorado in the earlier years of this book censorship wave School library workers, volunteers, and contractors would be protected for defending the availability of books in their collection. Connecticut – Senate Bill 523 (“Don’t Ban Books” Law) Introduced by Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff and Senator Ceci Maher Connecticut passed library protections in a larger bill addressing youth wellness in 2023. It opened up a pool of money for public libraries who met a list of criteria, including policies related to not banning books. This year, the state is pushing for an even broader suite of protections for libraries–and surprising no one, the legislators pushing for such protections have already drawn the uneducated ire of Libs of TikTok. The “Don’t Ban Books” bill would ban book bans in public schools and public libraries, while also strengthening protections for library workers from criminal and civil litigation. Massachusetts – SD 141 and HD 625 (simultaneously filed bills in both legislative bodies), HD 2779 SD 141 filed by Julian Cyr HD 625 filed by John Francis Moran and Adam J. Scanlon HD 2779 filed by Aaron L. Saunders Last year, Massachusetts attempted to pass their own anti-book ban bill, but it did not progress during the legislative session. The first two bills, SD 141 and HD 625, each referred to as “An Act Regarding Free Expression” seek the same outcome as last year’s bill: books cannot be banned in public schools or public libraries over political ideology or partisanship. Librarians would find expanded protections when put in the position to defend the position of books in their collection. HD 2779’s language and intent is similar to the above. It’s not uncommon for more than one bill with a similar theme or idea to be filed for a session–and in cases like this, it will likely help support passage of such a bill. New Mexico – House Bill 27, the “Librarian Protection Act” Introduced by Kathleen Cates You may remember that New Mexico proposed a similar bill in 2024, but that bill died before progressing. This meant that the legislature didn’t get to it, not that it was killed along the way. The bill is back for this legislative session and has already started to progress positively. It addresses public libraries, noting that they must have policies aligned with the American Library Association’s Library Bill of Rights. Public libraries would not be allowed to ban books based on partisan ideology or based on protected classes. New York – Senate Bill 1099, Senate Bill 1100, and Assembly Bill 3368 Senate Bill 1099 introduced by Senators May, Comrie, Harckham, Hinchey, and Webb Senate Bill 1100 introduced by Senators May and Comrie Assembly Bill 3368 introduced by A. Lavine, Levenberg, Seawright, and Simon It is common to see several similar bills filed in both bicameral and unicameral legislatures. That’s the case in New York state, where several bills addressing books and libraries have been introduced. It is likely some of them will be combined to create fewer, more robust bills. Senate Bill 1099 addresses school libraries and is being called the “Freedom to Read” Act. This would permit school librarians and other school library personnel the right to curate collections that showcase a variety of stories and voices that meet the needs of their students. Senate Bill 1100 is very similar to the above, but its focus is on the same ability to curate robust, diverse collections in public libraries, as well as hospital libraries and qualifying Reservation libraries. Funding these institutions would require having policies in place to protect librarians and their material selections. Assembly Bill 3368 repeats Senate Bill 1100’s intentions, but it more clearly notes that the above-named libraries must adopt the American Library Association’s Library Bill of Rights or similar in order to receive funding. Michigan – HB 6034 and HB 6035 HB 6034 introduced by Veronica Paiz HB 6035 introduced by Carol Glanville HB 6024 requires every public library to have a collection development policy that addresses the entire life cycle of all materials in its collection. In other words, how materials are selected and who selects them, as well as who can weed materials and what criteria are used to make those decisions. Crucially, every library must have a process for how materials can be challenged by the public–remember that the right to speech and the right to petition should be upheld in public libraries, too. The policy needs to also outline when, where, and how such reconsideration requests are approached. Not every complaint will be met with a formal review. Something unique in HB 6034 is that it requires anyone challenging a book to have read and reviewed the entire thing before complaining and they must be a resident of the library’s service area. HB 6035 mirrors what’s in the public library bill but applies it to district libraries throughout the state. These bills do not apply to public school libraries. New Hampshire – Senate Bill 208 Sponsored by Senators Altschiller, Fenton, Long, Perkins Kwoka, Rosenwald and Representatives Watters, Selig, Wallner, Balboni, and M. Murray Applicable to both public school libraries and public libraries, this New Hampshire bill would require policies related to the collections kept at each. It emphasizes the professional expertise of librarians, and it also codifies the fact libraries exist to share diverse, inclusive, wide-ranging collections to meet the needs of users. This bill would strengthen criminal protections for library workers. Oregon – Senate Bill 1583 Sponsored by Senator Frederick, Senator Steiner, Senator Gelser Blouin, Senator Jama, Senator Manning Jr, Representative Nelson, Representative Sanchez Issued with a declaration of emergency, this bill would protect materials in public school libraries and classrooms from being banned for discriminatory reasons. Rhode Island – Senate Bill 238, The “Freedom to Read Act” Sponsored by Senators McKenney, Bissaillon, Gallo, Gu, Lawson, Tikoian, and Britto Last year, Rhode Island Senators had a freedom to read bill on deck, though it died in committee. This year’s bill has a lot more enthusiasm around it, thanks in part to a similar bill being successfully passed in New Jersey (and the New Jersey governor has spoken up about Rhode Island’s bill as well). Senate Bill 238 would require all public schools and public libraries to have a collection policy, outlining the materials that the library collects and where and how they make decisions about weeding material (again, weeding is a professional duty in libraries). While citizens would be allowed to challenge material, materials could not be removed from public schools or public school libraries for ideological, political, or discriminatory reasons. This bill is really well written, and it does an excellent job identifying the roles and responsibilities of libraries and library workers. It codifies the Miller Test in it as the prevailing standard for defining obscenity as well. Check this one out if you’re looking for ways to pursue such freedom to read legislation in your state. Tennessee – Senate Bill 701 and House Bill 715, twin bills dubbed the “Freedom to Read Act”; House Bill 1051 SB 701 was introduced by Sara Kyle  House Bill 715 was introduced by Justin Jones House Bill 1051 was introduced by Sam McKenzie These first two bills, filed together as the “Freedom to Read Act,” would make it against the law to remove books in public school libraries, in public libraries, and in public institutions of higher education based on political ideology or partisan beliefs. Libraries would be required to have a policy in place outlining the right to read patrons have, and they would need to identify the professional reasons why materials may be removed (in other words, the actual, legitimate reasons for weeding). House Bill 1051 is focused on classroom libraries and repeals the “Age Appropriateness Act of 2022.” It would not allow for book banning based on political ideology or protected classes, something absent in the prior legislation (and why we have seen such wide-ranging, large-sweeping bans in Tennessee schools). The bill still stipulates that books are “age appropriate” when in classroom libraries–something that could and is easily exploited–but it outlines that background of the creator of the material and the content within are not to be the reason for applying such a standard. A strong point in this bill, though? If a book is challenged on the basis of “age appropriateness,” it cannot be removed from the classroom while being reviewed. At Fort Campbell, Kentucky, schools–part of the Department of Defense Education Activity–cart fulls of books are being removed from shelves per directives to rid schools of most anything not about cishet, able-bodied, Christian white men. Goodbye books about slavery and civil rights. Duval County Public Schools (FL) will decide what to do with Identical by Ellen Hopkins in the coming weeks. It’s that district’s first challenge and was challenged back in fall 2023. Moms For Liberty is thoroughly cited throughout this “news” story. Cy-Fair Independent School District (TX) has torn out entire chapters from textbooks covering topics they disagree with, such as climate change. This story says it happened “quietly,” but we’ve known this was happening since the moment it was announced. North Gibson Schools (IN) will not be banning Ready Player One from freshman English classes. What students think about the state-wide book bans in South Carolina. Enjoy the quote from one of the committee members who says they’re not banning books but simply “keeping kids away from books.” The doublespeak is sure working harder and harder. “Gindlesperger and other council members said Hyer’s experience serving on the board previously and her work with the nonprofit board that supports the library made them want to select someone else.” No you read that right. The Eagle, Idaho, city council has been denying new appointees to the library’s board for reasons like their experience working in libraries. This is the same city council responsible for a bill in the state that would allow city administration to fire library directors–all of this is, of course, because the library won’t ban books that city officials are brainwashed not to like. This story is paywalled, but the decision not to relocate six books in the Columbia County Library (GA) has been appealed by a local book banner. It’s students who continue to be the voice of reason here. In Marblehead Public Schools (MA), there’s a proposal to ban all flags that aren’t the US, city, state, or MIA/POW flags. Students are fighting back. Tennessee’s book banning law has led to 1,400 books being banned. Despite an anti-book ban bill proposal, I’m more concerned that we’re going to see Tennessee pulling a Utah or South Carolina and creating a state-sanctioned banned list. The Kite Runner has been banned in Volusia County Public Schools (FL) after one parent performed passages from it at a recent school board meeting. Scottsdale Unified School District (AZ) have banned 16 books after a letter from a conservative local group complained about them. Additional titles have been restricted for use as well. This story is paywalled, but democratic legislators in Virginia are seeking a study on how expansive book bans have been throughout the state over the last four years. A new law in California requires that every book banned in prisons across the state be documented. You can read about that–as well as the list of banned books in prisons–over here. The Arkansas State Library Board will not reject any association with the American Library Association because….I cannot believe we’re still debating this many years on that librarians have a professional association like nearly every other damn profession in the country. Carroll County Schools (MD) may eliminate all of the librarian positions in their middle and high schools next year due to “budget cuts.” Recall Maryland has an anti-book ban law. This is a convenient way to continue circumventing the law. There’s a new opening on the library board at Alpena Public Library (MI). This is possibly going to go very badly for the library. 16 YA books in Kootenai County’s Community Library Network (ID) will be relocated into their new adults only room. Guaranteed this is just the first 16. They have 125+ more titles to review for consideration. Here’s what to know about this library’s systems codification of book censorship. Also, here’s the internal memo from the Community Library Network on how they want to deeply restrict children and teen access with their library cards.",

Libraries would be required to have a policy in place outlining the right to read patrons have, and they would need to identify the professional reasons why materials may be removed (in other words, \u003ca href=\"https://bookriot.com/what-is-weeding/\"\u003ethe actual, legitimate reasons for weeding\u003c/a\u003e). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHouse Bill 1051 is focused on \u003cem\u003eclassroom \u003c/em\u003elibraries and repeals the “Age Appropriateness Act of 2022.” It would not allow for book banning based on political ideology or protected classes, something absent in the prior legislation (and why we have seen such wide-ranging, large-sweeping bans in Tennessee schools). The bill still stipulates that books are “age appropriate” when in classroom libraries–something that could and is easily exploited–but it outlines that background of the creator of the material and the content within are not to be the reason for applying such a standard. A strong point in this bill, though? If a book is challenged on the basis of “age appropriateness,” it cannot be removed from the classroom while being reviewed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt Fort Campbell, Kentucky, schools–\u003ca href=\"https://bookriot.com/department-of-defense-education-activity-demands-book-bans-curriculum-censorship-in-its-schools/\"\u003epart of the Department of Defense Education Activity\u003c/a\u003e–cart fulls of books are being removed from shelves per directives to rid schools of most anything not about cishet, able-bodied, Christian white men. \u003ca href=\"https://clarksvillenow.com/local/books-mentioning-slavery-civil-rights-removed-from-shelves-at-fort-campbell-schools/\"\u003eGoodbye books about slavery and civil rights\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDuval County Public Schools (FL) will decide what to do with \u003cem\u003eIdentical \u003c/em\u003eby Ellen Hopkins in the coming weeks.
