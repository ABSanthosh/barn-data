  "description": "Magda Batey, the implant physician at a Pittsburgh fertility clinic, directs the lead embryologist, 36-year-old Emily Daugherty, to meet with and gracefully reject two potential clients; they’re risky prospects that could bring down Batey’s success numbers. Emily is surprised when the couple in question turns out to be her former college boyfriend, Ben Holiday (“The only man I’d ever thought of having a child with, and I just let him go.”), and his wife, Ally. Emily can’t bring herself to disappoint the pair, who’ve suffered four miscarriages, so they advance in the clinic’s IVF process, where, according to Emily, “The real conjuring of life occurs behind closed doors, in a highly regulated laboratory led by me.” Reinard then begins interspersing chapters from Ally’s perspective; she’s a marketing analyst who’s annoyed by Ben’s job switch, which moved them fromShelby, North Carolina, to Pittsburgh, and she’s harboring secrets. The women’s fates become intertwined, as Emily also undergoes IVF at the same time. Overall, Reinard crafts an enjoyable, twisty suspense novel that calls to mind Paula Hawkins’ 2015 bestseller The Girl on the Train. As the story goes on, the author nicely develops her two main female characters with nuanced complexity; readers may not find either to be completely likable, but they always remain compelling. Reinard also effectively depicts Emily’s chilling egotism and questionable ethics, as conveyed in flashbacks and particularly in the clinic, where she sees the embryos as “my babies” before they’re anyone else’s.",

  "text": "IT STARTS WITH US by Colleen Hoover ‧ RELEASE DATE: Oct. 18, 2022 Through palpable tension balanced with glimmers of hope, Hoover beautifully captures the heartbreak and joy of starting over. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 242 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller The sequel to It Ends With Us (2016) shows the aftermath of domestic violence through the eyes of a single mother. Lily Bloom is still running a flower shop; her abusive ex-husband, Ryle Kincaid, is still a surgeon. But now they’re co-parenting a daughter, Emerson, who's almost a year old. Lily won’t send Emerson to her father’s house overnight until she’s old enough to talk—“So she can tell me if something happens”—but she doesn’t want to fight for full custody lest it become an expensive legal drama or, worse, a physical fight. When Lily runs into Atlas Corrigan, a childhood friend who also came from an abusive family, she hopes their friendship can blossom into love. (For new readers, their history unfolds in heartfelt diary entries that Lily addresses to Finding Nemo star Ellen DeGeneres as she considers how Atlas was a calming presence during her turbulent childhood.) Atlas, who is single and running a restaurant, feels the same way. But even though she’s divorced, Lily isn’t exactly free. Behind Ryle’s veneer of civility are his jealousy and resentment. Lily has to plan her dates carefully to avoid a confrontation. Meanwhile, Atlas’ mother returns with shocking news. In between, Lily and Atlas steal away for romantic moments that are even sweeter for their authenticity as Lily struggles with child care, breastfeeding, and running a business while trying to find time for herself. Through palpable tension balanced with glimmers of hope, Hoover beautifully captures the heartbreak and joy of starting over.
