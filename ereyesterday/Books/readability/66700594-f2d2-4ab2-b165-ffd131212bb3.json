  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Secret Baby For The Damaged Billionaire Boss? I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of a single, impulsive moment having profound, life-altering consequences. I wanted to explore what happens when two intelligent, driven people from vastly different worlds are bound together by an undeniable secret. The inspiration was to see how a fiercely independent woman like Aspen would navigate the shock of her past colliding with her present, and how a deeply controlled and emotionally scarred man like Jaxon would react to the ultimate disruption—a child he never knew he had. It’s about healing, the unexpected paths to family, and the transformative power of love and vulnerability. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Secret Baby For The Damaged Billionaire Boss, what would they be? Aspen Hayes: “Unwritten” by Natasha Bedingfield (for her journey of embracing the unexpected and forging her own path) and “Fight Song” by Rachel Platten (for her fierce protectiveness as a mother). Jaxon Mercer: “Demons” by Imagine Dragons (for his internal struggles and past trauma) and perhaps “A Sky Full of Stars” by Coldplay (for the moment he truly opens up to love and family). Aspen \u0026 Jaxon as a Couple: “Rewrite the Stars” (from The Greatest Showman) because their connection was so unexpected, and they had to overcome so much to be together. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Romance. Yes, absolutely! I love reading contemporary romance with strong emotional arcs, complex characters, and a satisfying journey to a happy ending, which is exactly what I aim to create in my own writing. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Oh, it’s always growing! Right now, I’m excited to dive into the latest from Tessa Bailey, a new Emily Henry, and I’ve heard great things about Carley Fortune’s newest release. I also have a Lucy Score book I’ve been meaning to get to. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? The beach scene in the final chapter (Chapter 24) was incredibly rewarding. Seeing Jaxon, Aspen, and Elias (with baby Evelyn on the way!) so happy and at peace, building sandcastles and just being a family, felt like the perfect culmination of their tumultuous journey. It was a moment of pure joy and demonstrated how far Jaxon had come from the closed-off man he was. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) Music in the background is a must! I usually have an instrumental playlist or movie scores playing – something atmospheric that sets the mood without distracting me with lyrics. And a constant supply of tea, definitely. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Let go and let God. (And in terms of writing, perhaps trusting the characters to lead the story where it needs to go!) If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Life is unpredictable, and sometimes the most unexpected paths and unplanned moments lead to the greatest happiness and healing. Also, that vulnerability isn’t weakness, and everyone deserves a chance at love. Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly.",
