  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write The Spring in My Heart? Lux and Oliver have been with me for quite some time, urging me to share their story. Both characters carry the weight of their individual pasts and previous relationships, having experienced pain and hardship. They enjoyed a perfect night on Christmas Eve, but reality crashed in and tore them apart. Now, they face a second chance together, battling against exes, old instincts, and their own internal struggles to find happiness. The inspiration for this book comes from the dedicated single dads I know and the women who love deeply and wholeheartedly. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of The Spring in My Heart, what would they be? For Lux: There’s a song called Puntería (Good Aim) by Shakira and Cardi B that is perfect because Oliver knows just what to do and say to take her breath and words away. Oliver’s theme song would be Amar de Nuevo (Love Again) by Rauw Alejandro because she gives him all the right feelings and has reached his heart, but he’s still afraid of loving her because he’s dragging his past on his back. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I like to read sociopath/psychopath and romantic suspense (Crime, mafia, cartel). I do love to write RS. I’m actually back in that world right now. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Way too many, but here are some: Amor in the 305 by Shelly Cruz and When Javi Dumped Mari by Mia Sosa. I’m patiently waiting for Can’t Get Enough by Kennedy Ryan, Kill Your Darlings by Peter Swanson, and Kiss Her Goodbye by Lisa Gardner. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? This book is full of little moments for me. The scene where they meet again in the book was super special and awkward because both characters felt that. What happens after they have a big fight and Ollie has to face himself. There’s one scene where Lux goes completely off on everyone, and that was like watching your bestie put her foot down because, no, you’re not going to treat me any kind of way. You know? But there’s also the epilogue because they earned it. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I have a heater on, sparkling water, LoFi Hip Hop playing, and a blankie on my lap. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? I always sign Stay Fearless. It doesn’t mean I don’t have fears, but I encourage myself and those around me to embrace challenges and face them head-on. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? The love you long for is possible and out there. Don’t let your past whisper otherwise.
