If you’re looking for stories that reflect real feelings and refuse to look away, this collection delivers page after page of impact. Dragonfly Down by Annette Masters Release Date: June 17, 2025 Dragonfly Down is an intriguing psychological thriller that questions what is most important when lives are at stake: following one’s intuition or facing facts? With gripping family secrets, heart-pounding suspense, and chilling twists, a teen’s dark and dangerous fight to find her sister will test the limits of love, loss, and loyalty. Buy on Amazon Fall for Now (The Infected Dead Book 13) by Bob Howard Release Date: June 6, 2025 Ed and Jean Jackson survived the early days of the apocalypse with the help of their close friends, Chief Barnes and Kathy McGinley. Over the years since the infection began, they chose to step back from the battle against the infected dead and remain within the safety of the shelter hidden in Green Cavern. Now, they have embarked on a perilous mission of their own to attempt the rescue of a group of survivors who are clinging to life near Niagara Falls and the Finger Lakes of New York. Buy on Amazon Spirit Hunter (The Path Of Pathos Book 4) by Simon Shugar Release Date: June 8, 2025 In the fragile calm after a kingdom-breaking war, Tomi has finally found something worth keeping: a quiet life in Elkswood, among friends who feel like family. But the land he loves has other plans. Fires bloom across the countryside without cause. Whispers of rebellion rise among the fief lords. And deep beneath it all, something ancient begins to stir. Tomi, a hunter with Pathos, a rare gift that links him to the world around him, and to Kit, the red kite who sees what he cannot, is drawn into a rising storm. Buy on Amazon Evergreen Conservatory (Society of Magical Botanists Book 2) by Heather Schneider Release Date: May 30, 2025 Ever since enrolling at Evergreen Academy last year, I have struggled to belong in the elite world of plant magic and affinity powers.
