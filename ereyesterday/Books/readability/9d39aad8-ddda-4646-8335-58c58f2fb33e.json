  "description": "Wuthnow and Saunders, of the Institute for National Strategic Studies, emphasize that just as the 2008 Olympics marked China’s emergence as a global heavyweight, the recent military demonstrations against Taiwan symbolize a new era for the People’s Liberation Army. It’s stronger, more modern, and more confident today, yet there remain intrinsic flaws that neither technology nor money will solve. American soldiers swear allegiance to the Constitution, the PLA to the Communist Party. Almost all officers and many lower ranks are Party members, and political indoctrination takes up a major part of their time even after basic training. Mao Zedong’s word was law until his death in 1976, when, following the disastrous Cultural Revolution, his successors aimed to clean up the mess he left. Few deny their success, which included reforming the PLA, although that remains a work in progress. The authors remind readers that authoritarian states must pay especially close attention to their military, whose professionals, like soldiers everywhere, look down on civilians. They add that, during its early decades, the military budget was not a top priority, and the PLA continued its tradition of raising money by commercial activity, which institutionalized a great deal of corruption. They recount 50 years of efforts to modernize as well as shrink the army and rein in the three negative consequences of party-army relations—autonomy, corruption, and ideological divergence. They conclude that it has been largely successful, although the PLA remains a quasi-independent self-policing organization. Along the way, readers will learn more Chinese acronyms, Chinese bureaucratic maneuvering, technical details, and scholarly military minutiae than they want to know, but they will also receive genuine insights into the transformation of this former shambling empire into a global superpower and rival.",

  "text": "ONE DAY, EVERYONE WILL HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AGAINST THIS by Omar El Akkad ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 25, 2025 A philosophically rich critique of state violence and mass apathy. An Egyptian Canadian journalist writes searchingly of this time of war. “Rules, conventions, morals, reality itself: all exist so long as their existence is convenient to the preservation of power.” So writes El Akkad, who goes on to state that one of the demands of modern power is that those subject to it must imagine that some group of people somewhere are not fully human. El Akkad’s pointed example is Gaza, the current destruction of which, he writes, is causing millions of people around the world to examine the supposedly rules-governed, democratic West and declare, “I want nothing to do with this.” El Akkad, author of the novel American War (2017), discerns hypocrisy and racism in the West’s defense of Ukraine and what he views as indifference toward the Palestinian people. No stranger to war zones himself—El Akkad was a correspondent in Afghanistan and Iraq—he writes with grim matter-of-factness about murdered children, famine, and the deliberate targeting of civilians. With no love for Zionism lost, he offers an equally harsh critique of Hamas, yet another one of the “entities obsessed with violence as an ethos, brutal in their treatment of minority groups who in their view should not exist, and self-decreed to be the true protectors of an entire religion.” Taking a global view, El Akkad, who lives in the U.S., finds almost every government and society wanting, and not least those, he says, that turn away and pretend not to know, behavior that we’ve seen before and that, in the spirit of his title, will one day be explained away until, in the end, it comes down to “a quiet unheard reckoning in the winter of life between the one who said nothing, did nothing, and their own soul.” A philosophically rich critique of state violence and mass apathy.
