  "text": "15 Jan 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write DAEMONS (The Riddle of the Storm)? I wrote my first novel (Branwen) for middle schoolers to young adults. It was a retelling of THE SWORD IN THE STONE narrated by a young girl. My series (THE SHADOW WAR) I wrote for young adults. I am an eclectic reader. My favorite genres are epic fantasy, military history, historical fiction and adventure stories of all types. I thought it might be fun to write something that incorporated them all. One not specifically geared to young adults. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of DAEMONS (The Riddle of the Storm), what would they be? I suppose you could consider the STORM to be something like the rabbit hole Alice fell into taking her to another world. For fun, “White Rabbit” by Jefferson Airplane. What books are on your TBR pile right now? The Forgotten Kingdom by Signe Pike Arkangel by James Rollins. One of my favorite authors. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? The first time Hal sees Maggie. Henry’s pet long tooth. Which turns out to be a saber-tooth tiger. There were many more, but that was fun. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I write many notes, most of which I can’t find when I need them. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Judge people for who they are, not who they are supposed to be. Dogs are people too. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Consider what a world would be like if no one taught you to fear someone based solely on their race or religion.
