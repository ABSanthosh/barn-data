  "description": "Parker Hanson is a New Hampshirite and former investigative reporter now doing PI work. But sitting long hours on stake-outs without falling asleep requires a “generous amount of caffeine,” which (“along with a poor family history”) factored into Parker’s recent heart attack before his 45th birthday. On a current case, when he’s not watching baseball or going to cardiac rehab, Parker is shadowing Mark Bowman, deputy chief of staff in Governor Jack Gordon’s office.  Mark’s wife Brooke, an attractive woman in her mid-30s, hires Parker to find out if her suddenly distant husband is having an affair. “If he is, then he’s an idiot,” Parker thinks. But when trailing Mark, Parker sees him get into a woman’s car. Then a truck intentionally hits the couple’s car, engulfing it in flames, and the truck driver flees. Mark and the woman—who turns out to be Parker’s former co-worker, reporter Maggie Malone—are dead. Parker noses around the newspaper and talks to Maggie’s roommate, discovering that the journalist was investigating a private forest management concern called Tree Kings that had been awarded a state contract by the Gordon administration; a government IT staffer discovered that Tree Kings’ bid for the contract had been tampered with after the submission deadline, and Mark wouldn’t let the matter rest. The writing is crisp, but the plot is predictable. Still, Parker is an engaging character, one to root for. The theme of fatherhood weaves through the narrative; another thread follows Parker’s recovery efforts after his heart attack (the camaraderie at cardiac rehab fleshes out the protagonist). Baseball references pepper the text, but there’s no need to italicize them—or such other emphasized comments as “Good question.” The late-stage introduction of the sweet bloodhound Minerva is a welcome extra.",

  "text": "DEVOLUTION by Max Brooks ‧ RELEASE DATE: June 16, 2020 A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 243 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Are we not men? We are—well, ask Bigfoot, as Brooks does in this delightful yarn, following on his bestseller World War Z(2006). A zombie apocalypse is one thing. A volcanic eruption is quite another, for, as the journalist who does a framing voice-over narration for Brooks’ latest puts it, when Mount Rainier popped its cork, “it was the psychological aspect, the hyperbole-fueled hysteria that had ended up killing the most people.” Maybe, but the sasquatches whom the volcano displaced contributed to the statistics, too, if only out of self-defense. Brooks places the epicenter of the Bigfoot war in a high-tech hideaway populated by the kind of people you might find in a Jurassic Park franchise: the schmo who doesn’t know how to do much of anything but tries anyway, the well-intentioned bleeding heart, the know-it-all intellectual who turns out to know the wrong things, the immigrant with a tough backstory and an instinct for survival. Indeed, the novel does double duty as a survival manual, packed full of good advice—for instance, try not to get wounded, for “injury turns you from a giver to a taker. Taking up our resources, our time to care for you.” Brooks presents a case for making room for Bigfoot in the world while peppering his narrative with timely social criticism about bad behavior on the human side of the conflict: The explosion of Rainier might have been better forecast had the president not slashed the budget of the U.S. Geological Survey, leading to “immediate suspension of the National Volcano Early Warning System,” and there’s always someone around looking to monetize the natural disaster and the sasquatch-y onslaught that follows. Brooks is a pro at building suspense even if it plays out in some rather spectacularly yucky episodes, one involving a short spear that takes its name from “the sucking sound of pulling it out of the dead man’s heart and lungs.” Grossness aside, it puts you right there on the scene. A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy.
