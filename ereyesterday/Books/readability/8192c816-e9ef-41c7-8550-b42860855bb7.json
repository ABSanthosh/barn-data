  "description": "What fun! Fans of challenging seek-and-find puzzles will love this clever book, comprised of 10 “fantastical connected mazes” set out on double-page spreads. Each maze is packed with tiny, cleverly illustrated details and minuscule human figures (they’re generally too small to discern skin color), set against a variety of scenes, among them the Magic Forest, Steampunk, Land of the Sweets, Fairy-Tale Land, and Super Future. Some mazes include multiple levels; many are quite tricky. Each requires readers to enter from the left side of the spread and exit from the right; captions direct puzzlers to locate several items within each vividly colored maze. This isn’t always easy, considering how many red herrings there are. Oh, and don’t forget the pesky penguin, which kids are tasked with locating on each spread. Happily, the answer key at the back provides solutions. Best of all, this book gives children a wonderful opportunity to slow down, learn to focus, test their patience, turn away from screens, and hone their visual-discrimination skills. Another plus: While kids may choose to tackle these mazes solo, they’ll enjoy themselves even more when they share them with a friend. Either way, this offering is guaranteed to provide stimulating diversion.",
