  "description": "This exuberant rhyming ode to reading is primed to get kids excited about the wonders awaiting them between the pages of a book. As the authors wisely point out, books are perfect anytime, anywhere—and they’re for everyone. Readers are encouraged to give books as gifts, to share them with friends and family, and even to write and illustrate their own books. Savor them at bedtime, too. There are even options for the youngest kids—board books with flaps to lift and mirrors adorning the pages so that tiny listeners can admire and make faces at themselves. Just like readers, books vary in appearance and type—long, short, hard, soft, and everything in between. And who says books must only be read? Some books even help us sing. Best of all, you don’t have to buy books: Public libraries offer them for free! Return what you finish, then borrow more—as often as you like. What’s a better deal than that? If this book doesn’t turn kids into ardent readers, nothing will. Besides the bouncy, jubilant verses, the energetic illustrations will do the trick, brimming with ebullient colors and featuring a cast of spirited readers, diverse in terms of both race and age.",

  "text": "ON THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN by Tish Rabe ; illustrated by Laura Hughes ‧ RELEASE DATE: June 21, 2016 While this is a fairly bland treatment compared to Deborah Lee Rose and Carey Armstrong-Ellis’ The Twelve Days of... Rabe follows a young girl through her first 12 days of kindergarten in this book based on the familiar Christmas carol. The typical firsts of school are here: riding the bus, making friends, sliding on the playground slide, counting, sorting shapes, laughing at lunch, painting, singing, reading, running, jumping rope, and going on a field trip. While the days are given ordinal numbers, the song skips the cardinal numbers in the verses, and the rhythm is sometimes off: “On the second day of kindergarten / I thought it was so cool / making lots of friends / and riding the bus to my school!” The narrator is a white brunette who wears either a tunic or a dress each day, making her pretty easy to differentiate from her classmates, a nice mix in terms of race; two students even sport glasses. The children in the ink, paint, and collage digital spreads show a variety of emotions, but most are happy to be at school, and the surroundings will be familiar to those who have made an orientation visit to their own schools. While this is a fairly bland treatment compared to Deborah Lee Rose and Carey Armstrong-Ellis’ The Twelve Days of Kindergarten (2003), it basically gets the job done.
