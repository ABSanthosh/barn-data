  "description": "After a quartet of 4-year-olds built a block tower together at a Drag Queen Story Hour during Provincetown’s Family Week, their parents—an interracial, interfaith (Asian/white and Jewish) lesbian couple, an interracial, interfaith (Black/white and Jewish) gay couple, and a single lesbian mother (presumed white)—all decided to vacation together henceforth. But this Family Week, they’re bringing more emotional baggage than luggage. Milo (who’s academically gifted as well as trans) and his twin sister, Lina, are struggling with Milo’s upcoming departure for a fancy boarding school. Avery is heartbroken over her fathers’ impending divorce and the forthcoming baby sibling (Daddy’s new female partner is pregnant). Meanwhile, Mac, who’s been attending summer school to avoid repeating seventh grade, is just trying to figure out what he’s good at, especially in comparison to the gifted and people-pleasing Milo. With each weekday forming its own chapter, this short book packs in a lot and relies on overwhelmingly long sentences; as a result, the characters, conflicts, and emotions end up feeling rushed and underexplored. The breathless pace also means that each family feels more like a rough sketch rather than fully fleshed-out individuals. Milo and Lina are biracial (Asian and white), Avery’s biracial (Black and white), and Mac presents white.",
