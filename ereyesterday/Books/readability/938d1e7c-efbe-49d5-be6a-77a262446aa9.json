  "description": "The author, an integrative healthcare practitioner, takes readers on a journey through the ins and outs of reiki, framing it as a method of healing and rejuvenation—and not, she clarifies, as a kind of religious belief. Reiki, a Japanese term meaning “universal life energy,” is a “non-invasive relaxation technique,” the author says, intended to help the body, mind, and spirit align in a state of peak health. Although users of reiki often do so on a regular basis, there’s no limit to how frequently it can be practiced, the author says. Much of what Torok discusses are the practicalities of the reiki experience, such as the various options available during a session—during which the subject may either be lying down or seated, for example—and the physical sensations that one may expect, such as temperature changes, tingling, and so on. She also delves into how to find a legitimate practitioner, as reiki is not federally licensed in the United States, and she suggests questions to ask before booking a session. The author’s information comes from various sources, including cited scientific studies, books, anecdotes about clients, and Torok’s personal experiences. Readers who are already familiar with reiki are not likely to find anything new or particularly helpful in this guide, but for beginners, it offers a trove of information. Starting with thorough explanations of what reiki is, it logically segues into the hows and whys of an often misunderstood practice. Its subject matter covers the basics in largely straightforward terms, although some passages feel less well defined, as when the author notes that reiki practitioners work with the “metaphysical experience of vibrational frequency and the healing potential of unconditional love.” Still, Torok’s warm tone and straightforward delivery ultimately make for an engaging read for anyone who’s considered reiki therapy.",

  "text": "F*CK IT, I'LL START TOMORROW by Action Bronson ; photographed by Bonnie Stephens ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 20, 2021 The lessons to draw are obvious: Smoke more dope, eat less meat. Like-minded readers will dig it. The chef, rapper, and TV host serves up a blustery memoir with lashings of self-help. “I’ve always had a sick confidence,” writes Bronson, ne Ariyan Arslani. The confidence, he adds, comes from numerous sources: being a New Yorker, and more specifically a New Yorker from Queens; being “short and fucking husky” and still game for a standoff on the basketball court; having strength, stamina, and seemingly no fear. All these things serve him well in the rough-and-tumble youth he describes, all stickball and steroids. Yet another confidence-builder: In the big city, you’ve got to sink or swim. “No one is just accepted—you have to fucking show that you’re able to roll,” he writes. In a narrative steeped in language that would make Lenny Bruce blush, Bronson recounts his sentimental education, schooled by immigrant Italian and Albanian family members and the mean streets, building habits good and bad. The virtue of those habits will depend on your take on modern mores. Bronson writes, for example, of “getting my dick pierced” down in the West Village, then grabbing a pizza and smoking weed. “I always smoke weed freely, always have and always will,” he writes. “I’ll just light a blunt anywhere.” Though he’s gone through the classic experiences of the latter-day stoner, flunking out and getting arrested numerous times, Bronson is a hard charger who’s not afraid to face nearly any challenge—especially, given his physique and genes, the necessity of losing weight: “If you’re husky, you’re always dieting in your mind,” he writes. Though vulgar and boastful, Bronson serves up a model that has plenty of good points, including his growing interest in nature, creativity, and the desire to “leave a legacy for everybody.” The lessons to draw are obvious: Smoke more dope, eat less meat.
