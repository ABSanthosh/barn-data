  "description": "Rising senior Ethan Granger lives a comfortable life in a gated community in Ottawa. He has a fickle girlfriend, Nora, whom he considers worth the heartache. The fact that his father is a self-described “smooth talker”—or, Ethan admits to himself, a liar—is brought home again when he sees his dad with some men in a strip mall parking lot in town at the same time that he’s supposedly just leaving the airport. After attempting to dig into his father’s business dealings on his own, Ethan hires private investigator Imani Abboud. But when she advises him that something illegal is going on and he should avoid danger by ceasing to look further, Ethan decides to continue on his own. Enlisting best friend Owen, old schoolmate Aki, and Nora (between breakups), Ethan stakes out an address he got from the PI. Eventually Jean-Guy, Aki’s boyfriend, helps with surveillance, too. An epilogue shares the impact on Ethan’s family of his completed investigation. His first-person narration will ensnare readers immediately, sustaining their interest as this compact, strongly paced story navigates red herrings and subplots. Aki and PI Abboud are well rounded in their secondary roles. Main characters read white; names cue ethnic diversity in the supporting cast.",

  "text": "IF HE HAD BEEN WITH ME by Laura Nowlin ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 1, 2013 There’s not much plot here, but readers will relish the opportunity to climb inside Autumn’s head. The finely drawn characters capture readers’ attention in this debut. Autumn and Phineas, nicknamed Finny, were born a week apart; their mothers are still best friends. Growing up, Autumn and Finny were like peas in a pod despite their differences: Autumn is “quirky and odd,” while Finny is “sweet and shy and everyone like[s] him.” But in eighth grade, Autumn and Finny stop being friends due to an unexpected kiss. They drift apart and find new friends, but their friendship keeps asserting itself at parties, shared holiday gatherings and random encounters. In the summer after graduation, Autumn and Finny reconnect and are finally ready to be more than friends. But on August 8, everything changes, and Autumn has to rely on all her strength to move on. Autumn’s coming-of-age is sensitively chronicled, with a wide range of experiences and events shaping her character. Even secondary characters are well-rounded, with their own histories and motivations. There’s not much plot here, but readers will relish the opportunity to climb inside Autumn’s head.   (Fiction. 14 \u0026 up) Pub Date: April 1, 2013 ISBN: 978-1-4022-7782-5 Page Count: 336 Publisher: Sourcebooks Fire Review Posted Online: Feb. 12, 2013 Kirkus Reviews Issue: March 1, 2013",
