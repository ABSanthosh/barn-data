Zainab Williams Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more.It’s Been 20 Years Since Twilight Published?!The impact of Stephenie Meyer’s angsty teen vampire romance continues to ripple across YA and publishing even two decades later, so why not give the enduring series a glow up? Little, Brown Books will release three new special editions of Twilight set to hit shelves on September 30th so fans of the series can celebrate the birth of Bella, Edward, and company with sprayed edges and a foil-stamped slip case to compete with any of the romantasy novels being freshly spat out by the printing presses today–and that’s just the Deluxe Collector’s Edition. Also hitting shelves are the 20th Anniversary Edition paperback (don’t worry paperback peeps, you also get sprayed edges) and the Deluxe Hardcover Collection with all four books in the series, plus the Edward POV retelling of the first book. The big deluxe hardcover set comes in a wraparound box and the books have, you guessed it, stained edges. I have to wonder how many BookToks we’ll be seeing about these editions.The Biggest Science Fiction Books of 2025And you thought we were done with most anticipated lists (same same), but we can’t forget about the genre-specific lists. Den of Geek released its list of the “biggest” science fiction books publishing this year. I suppose it’s not fair to categorize this list as most anticipated since it doesn’t call itself that–there’s no definition offered for what they mean by biggest so I’m going to extrapolate that they mean imaginative books that are going to see wide popularity. They call out Nnedi Okorafor’s newest in the intro and explain that it didn’t make the list since it’s already out but, all the same, I heard the haunting melody of a sad trombone when I clocked the scant BIPOC rep in this list. I will say that Tor continues to dominate in the realm of really interesting SF/F. Today In Books Newsletter Sign up to Today In Books to receive daily news and miscellany from the world of books.

A Reply All Farce Fit for SNL “Dear Boomers,” Tina Fey wrote in the thread at 9:38, with a link to an instructional YouTube video for senior citizens on how to read, reply, and forward emails when using a Gmail account. There truly was no other way to introduce this story about a bunch of boomers replying all to an at first innocuous in-conversation event invite sent by Susan Morrison, the author of the new Lorne Michaels biography. I want to say, “This is why the BCC button was created, people,” but I admit I’ve always been entertained by the train off the tracks energy of reply all fiascos and hardly have I met one with so many actual comedians.Books About ObsessionIn case you hadn’t heard, we run an annual book challenge called the Read Harder Challenge.
