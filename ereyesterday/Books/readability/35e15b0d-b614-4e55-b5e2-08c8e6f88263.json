  "description": "Photojournalist Ethan McGuire takes pictures of those on the fringes of society: tattoo artists, cock fighters, spiritualists, burn victims. His current job has him tagging along with a group of white supremacists staging a rally in the Finger Lakes town of Geneva, New York. Ethan chooses this subject in part because he’s disturbed by the casual racism that permeates the suburbs of Rochester, where his daughters—10-year-old Mary and teenage Kath—live with his ex-wife, Robin. The photo shoot doesn’t go quite as planned—the skinheads are overwhelmed by protestors and, in an attempt to save one of the younger racists from getting beaten with a baseball bat, Ethan winds up striking a protester in the head with his camera. Due in part to this temporary confusion in loyalties, Ethan decides to pursue the skinheads project deeper. “The story isn’t simple because racism isn’t simple, people aren’t simple,” he tells his photo agent. “I haven’t figured out whether these are monsters wearing effective disguises or there’s a bit of a monster inside all of us.” Little does Ethan know, but he hasn’t even met the real monsters yet—the kind who rob banks and commit murders…and sometimes carry badges. McMullin documents Ethan’s journey with photographic precision, as here, where he describes a trip to a gun dealer: “Spread out on the table were the parts of a rifle…It appeared new and the oily metal surfaces were shiny in the clear morning sun. Unlike the clarity of the day, the young people looked a little bleary eyed, but still listened and watched with as much concentration as they could muster.” Though set in 2010, the novel feels particularly timely, and the perpetually zoomed-in Ethan serves as a compelling guide to this extremist subculture. One hopes that McMullin has further adventures planned for his unlikely hero.",

  "text": "NEVER FLINCH by Stephen King ‧ RELEASE DATE: May 27, 2025 Even when King is not at his best, he’s still good. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 44 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Two killers are on the loose. Can they be stopped? In this ambitious mystery, the prolific and popular King tells the story of a serial murderer who pledges, in a note to Buckeye City police, to kill “13 innocents and 1 guilty,” in order, we eventually learn, to avenge the death of a man who was framed and convicted for possession of child pornography and then killed in prison. At the same time, the author weaves in the efforts of another would-be murderer, a member of a violently abortion-opposing church who has been stalking a popular feminist author and women’s rights activist on a publicity tour. To tell these twin tales of murders done and intended, King summons some familiar characters, including private investigator Holly Gibney, whom readers may recall from previous novels. Gibney is enlisted to help Buckeye City police detective Izzy Jaynes try to identify and stop the serial killer, who has been murdering random unlucky citizens with chilling efficiency. She’s also been hired as a bodyguard for author and activist Kate McKay and her young assistant. The author succeeds in grabbing the reader’s interest and holding it throughout this page-turning tale of terror, which reads like a big-screen thriller. The action is well paced, the settings are vividly drawn, and King’s choice to focus on the real and deadly dangers of extremist thought is admirable. But the book is hamstrung by cliched characters, hackneyed dialogue (both spoken and internal), and motives that feel both convoluted and overly simplistic. King shines brightest when he gets to the heart of our darkest fears and desires, but here the dangers seem a bit cerebral. In his warning letter to the police, the serial killer wonders if his cryptic rationale to murder will make sense to others, concluding, “It does to me, and that is enough.” Is it enough? In another writer’s work, it might not be, but in King’s skilled hands, it probably is. Even when King is not at his best, he’s still good.
