These powerful narratives offer new ways to understand identity, resilience, and truth. Prepare to question, reflect, and see the world through a completely different lens. Cherish or Perish: Strengthen Your Intellect: Save The World by Prabha Karan Release Date: June 19, 2025 If Your Intellect Doesn’t Guide Your Mind, Then Who Does? Discover how to strengthen your Intellect, the powerful thought force guiding your thoughts, emotions, and decisions. If you don’t build it, no one else can! Every chapter offers clear, actionable steps to sharpen your intellect, empowering you to think, stay calm under pressure! Buy on Amazon Is Anything All Right? by Frank Lazarus Release Date: June 30, 2025 In his unique and irreverent style, Lazarus covers a wide range of things, people, and businesses that confuse, annoy, and piss him off, including: Ordering a Donut at ‘Dunkin, Why Would Anyone Own a Pet, The Top Ten Reasons for Dating Frank Lazarus, What to Wear to Your Own Funeral, Sitzpinkling, Why Do People Go Fishing, Why Do We Bother Praying, and I Might Have to Kill My Cleaning Woman. Buy on Amazon Proof of Life: Let Go, Let Love, and Stop Looking for Permission to Live Your Life by Jennifer Pastiloff Release Date: July 8, 2025 This is Pastiloff’s account of how she reclaimed her voice and desire by radically changing her life. She did this despite believing that change equaled death ever since her beloved father died when she was eight. (Much to her shock, the change did not equal death.) She shows us it is never too late to begin again, or to let go of stories like: I don’t deserve this; I don’t get to be happy; no one will love me; I’m too old, to name a few. Buy on Amazon Losing Linda Mae by Logan Lee Lamson Release Date: July 5, 2025 In any calendar year, nearly 30 percent of Americans will find themselves caregiving for a family member. However, few published accounts exist that honor and validate the experiences of these individuals. Losing Linda Mae fills that void. Through unflinching, intimate storytelling, this mother and son book about dealing with cancer brings readers within whisper distance of the complexities and emotions that arise while caregiving for a loved one. Buy on Amazon My Journey Through Shame by Dana Stevens Release Date: July 12, 2025 At seventeen, I felt the unmistakable touch of God—and with it, a divine calling that would chart the course of my life. But I never expected this path would lead me into a three-decade battle—not with sin or unbelief, but with shame. Shame not for what I did, but for who I was. Buy on Amazon The Unapologetic Heart by Connor Blake Release Date: July 14, 2025 Andrea Gibson was more than a poet; they were a revolutionary voice, an empathic activist, and a beacon of hope for countless souls. In the wake of their passing, a new generation is discovering the raw honesty and tender strength that characterized their art and life. Buy on Amazon zaida Recommended Posts",
