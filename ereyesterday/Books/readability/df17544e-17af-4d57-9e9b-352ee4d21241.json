  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Beautiful Beast (Bound to the Mafia Book 1)? I was inspired by Beauty and the Beast and other dark romance stories, mainly stories that feature demons or vampires falling in love with women. My book is a mafia romance but I love using those elements to give the book a darker feel even without supernatural things being present in the story. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Beautiful Beast (Bound to the Mafia Book 1), what would they be? The theme song of this book would be “Shades of Cool” by Lana Del Rey. Feeling like you’re chasing this unattainable man is something Anya, the main female character in my book, feels like she’s doing by being in this arranged marriage to Erik, a cold Russian mafia boss. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? My favorite genre is always changing. One day, I love thrillers, the next I love romantasy, the next dark romance, and so on. Since I write mafia romances, I don’t really read them anymore but I used to. That’s why I wanted to write them. What books are on your TBR pile right now? I have so many books on my TBR pile. At the top is a thriller book called Like Mother, Like Daughter by Kimberly Mccreight. I have probably over 50 books on my list that I want to get to. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? My favorite scene was when Anya and Erik meet for the first time on their wedding day. There is something so gothic about it that it just was so much fun for me to write. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I don’t have specific writing habits but what works for me is keeping to my schedule. If I do that, I can write a lot. I also find going to the library is a good way to write when writing at home is too distracting. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? My motto is just keep writing one word at a time. Don’t think about how much more you have to write. I break it up into chunks until I’m finished. That has worked well for me. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? I want readers to just have a fun, sexy time with this book. It is about accepting someone different from you and learning to open your heart when you’re afraid but at the end of the day, this is a steamy mafia romance and I just want people to have a good time with it!
