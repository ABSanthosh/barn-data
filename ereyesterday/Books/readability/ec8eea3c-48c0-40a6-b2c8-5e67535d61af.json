  "text": "23 Jul 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Searching for Home? My husband and I had an amazing adventure—five years of deliberate and delightful homelessness around the globe. There were so many interesting and humorous experiences that I just wanted to share them with others. Plus, Dave took some fantastic photos that I thought people would enjoy seeing. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? My favorite genre is non-fiction, though interestingly, not necessarily travel. I do enjoy reading travel books, especially when they’re more memoir-like, as mine is. Since I love history and science, I’m most drawn to travel books that incorporate facts about geography, geology, history, and culture. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Dinner With King Tut: How Rogue Archaeologists Are Re-Creating the Sights, Sounds, Smells, and Tastes of Lost Civilizations by Sam Kean is written by a science writer whose books are full of fascinating history and humor. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I’m not sure… it might be the time we were invited to join a mystical event with a religious cult in Cuba, or maybe when we got lost in the jungle in Borneo. The chapter I called “Attack of the Wildlife” was a lot of fun to write. Honestly, I don’t think I have a favorite scene or chapter—it’s been a pleasure to record all our experiences, and I hope people enjoy reading about them as much as I enjoyed writing them! Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) Not really. Other than the necessity of having a cup of coffee at my side at all times! Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Mmmm….. sorry, but no, I don’t. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? That they should not be afraid of a leap into the unknown. Buy The Book Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly. zaida Recommended Posts",
