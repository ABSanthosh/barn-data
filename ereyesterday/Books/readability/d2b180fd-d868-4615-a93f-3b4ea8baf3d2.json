  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Lost Lives (Get Lost Saga Book 3)? Science Fiction has us look to the future, but it’s really about the present. I wanted to create a setting that’s both familiar to SF fans and unique, something that can explore certain universal themes or present-day issues. Everything from what it means to be human, to the powerful versus the powerless. But always wrapped up in a fun adventure that isn’t afraid to poke fun at its own weird reality. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Lost Lives (Get Lost Saga Book 3), what would they be? For Moss (Maurice Foote), probably “A Complicated Song” by Weird Al Yankovic, because it perfectly gets across just how things tend to always get worse with him. For Violet Lonsdale, “I think I’m a Clone Now,” also by Weird Al, because of her identity issues. For Hel (Helena Lambinon), “2112” by Rush, because that’s the year her colony ship left Earth, and also conveys the sweeping space opera she now finds herself in. For the main antagonist, Roy Herzog, “The God that Failed” by Metallica, because it reflects the disillusionment he experienced that led to him being who he is. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Science fiction, adventure, and humor, and yep, this series contains all three! What books are on your TBR pile right now? Space Academy Dropouts by C T Phipps (a comedy adventure). Humankind: A Hopeful History by Rutger Bregman (nonfiction, and a positive boost we all need right now), Welcome to the Multiverse (Sorry for the Inconvenience) by Ira Nayman (a zany SF comedy). What scene in your book was your favorite to write? That’s a hard one to nail down, especially without spoilers. But the climax shifts between five different points of view in rotation. But each shift keeps pushing events forward (rather than repeating the same events from a different POV). Making sure the reader always knew which POV they were in was tricky, but very satisfying. The end result makes the climax feel very cinematic. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) Well, I converted my closet into my work office, filled with all my geeky paraphernalia, and I converted an old typewriter into a USB keyboard for me to write my first drafts on. I just like the feel of the keys going clickity-clack. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Be kind. I know it’s really hard right now to do that. Right now many people are terrified, while many others are enjoying schadenfreude, and others still are just drained and can’t look past their own immediate problems. But to all of them, I’d say it’s so important to be kind. That’s all. Just be kind. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Moss is part of that “drained” demographic I mentioned above. He just wants to be left alone, make a few credits, and get on with his life. He doesn’t want to look for trouble and he doesn’t want to get sucked into it, either. But at the end of the day, he won’t look the other way when he sees injustice. So I guess the one thing I want people to remember is this: it’s okay to be grumpy, to be disgruntled, even to be cynical. But you can still be the guy (or gal) who stands up when it counts, and doesn’t back down. Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly.",
