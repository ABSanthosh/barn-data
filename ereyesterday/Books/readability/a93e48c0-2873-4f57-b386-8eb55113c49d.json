  "description": "In a future beset by climate-change strife in the “Aboves” zone, Southern California teenager and math prodigy (and recreational super-hacker) Dorothy “Doro” Campbell had been initiated into a secretive society called Seneca. Operating out of a vast and advanced subterranean complex (with satellite installations around the world), Seneca ostensibly grooms elite youths to become the saviors of the endangered Earth. In reality, however, the place has been compromised by amoral, power-hungry corporate forces with a different agenda. Doro, aided by her biotechnologist boyfriend, Dominic, and a few other trusted allies, has uncovered evidence of nanotechnology surveillance, media lies, and mind control. She has also investigated the mysterious disappearance of her father, Johnny, who had just discovered a solution to heal the atmosphere’s sundered ozone layer. In this installment, Doro emerges from a 54-day coma, a side-effect of a neural attack courtesy of the sinister Flex Corporation. Doro and Dom are mentally wired into an online connection with other humans throughout Seneca. This is a sword that cuts both ways: The duo can virtually travel anywhere and sense conspiracies (such as an ambitious Mars settlement-terraforming scheme meant to extend Seneca’s totalitarian rule to another planet), but at the same time they are vulnerable to nefarious traps and digital fail-safes in the system. With hidden allies emerging from all directions, can the tide be turned? This is very much a gang’s-all-here cast reunion of the various heroes, villains, and in-betweens from throughout Deeb’s series, many proclaiming slogans like “The time has come for us to take back the tools of oppression. Help us reshape the world” in pep-rally proliferation. The “science” aspect of the narrative is fairly indistinguishable from magic, but the author ably depicts the exhilaration of dawning mass-awareness in a shared consciousness and reliably delivers the SF genre’s seemingly mandatory messages of resilience, eco-justice, and girl power as the saga reaches an upbeat conclusion.",

  "text": "VOICE OF THE OCEAN by Kelsey Impicciche ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 22, 2025 After a slow start, an action-packed adventure about embracing vulnerability and trusting yourself. In this debut by YouTuber Impicciche, a young siren princess is faced with a mission she cannot refuse. Celeste’s mother, Queen Halia, has always considered her to be too emotional—like the irrational humans. In order to prove herself, Celeste has spent several cycles, the sirens’ unit of time, training to become a member of the Chorus, a militarized unit that patrols the seas. Before her final test, Celeste comes across an attractive human prince, Raiden, whose father is King Leonidas—her mother’s sworn enemy. She ends up saving Raiden’s life, but when her mother learns of her transgression, she offers Celeste the chance to go on a mission that requires her to become human and avoid being executed for treason. The narrative, which initially is strongly reminiscent of “The Little Mermaid,” has some slower moments and repetitive elements that are offset by witty commentary that helps engage readers. The opening drags, but the pace picks up as the story unfolds. Impicciche does a good job of creating a detailed world of siren customs and traditions. Her characters exhibit emotional depth, conveying what it feels like to be lost and betrayed. Sirens have skin of varying colors, including blue, purple, and green; Celeste’s skin is “soft peach.” Raiden presents white, and there’s racial diversity among other humans. After a slow start, an action-packed adventure about embracing vulnerability and trusting yourself.
