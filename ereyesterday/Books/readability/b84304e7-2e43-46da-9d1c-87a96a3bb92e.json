  "description": "While housesitting for her grandmother, young Willow has been dealing with some of the grosser items on her to-do list, like shoveling manure. She’d rather invite a friend over for a sleepover, but her pal Sam Squirrel (introduced in the series opener) is tied up with school. But before Willow can start cleaning the chicken coop, the birds erupt into chaos with the appearance of a rude queen bee who loves stealing other people’s homes. The only known beekeeper in the Quiet Woods is an allegedly fearsome stink badger. Determined to solve her own problems without calling in Mother Nature, Willow sets out to find the stink badger and oust the queen and her swarm from the coop before it’s too late. Her journey is gently amusing as she discovers strengths (like a gift for songwriting), confronts weaknesses (her practically nonexistent sense of direction), and figures out ways to resolve conflicts. Finally, when everyone else is too afraid, Willow must ignore (literal) warning signs to ask for expert help. Along the way, she makes a misunderstood friend. Though older readers may find the story’s resolution a bit predictable, all will enjoy getting to know the charmingly self-aware Willow as Selfors drops in a few hints about her backstory. Spotlight illustrations showcase adorably anthropomorphized animals. Willow is depicted with paper-white skin and described as having silver hair.",
