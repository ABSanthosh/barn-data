Despite reading more than a hundred books a year, most of the time, I read pretty casually. Usually, I can put down a book and not think about it again until I pick it back up. It’s not that I’m reading bad books, but it’s rare that I get fully immersed in a story or have a big emotional reaction—maybe reading this much has set the bar higher.Every once in a while, though, I’ll encounter a book that reminds me what reading can do. For example, when I read the first few pages of The One Hundred Nights of Hero by Isabel Greenberg and I had to put it down and literally take a lap in my living room before I could calm down enough to keep reading it.Or when I read The Jasmine Throne by Tasha Suri and realized it was making me angry that everyone wasn’t talking about this book at all times.Content for All Access members continues below.
