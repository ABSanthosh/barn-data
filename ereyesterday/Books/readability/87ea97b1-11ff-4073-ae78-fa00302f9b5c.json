  "description": "The Wizard of Oz and its adaptation, The Wiz, are employed as metaphors for the caregiving experience in this self-help book. The author is a registered nurse and tells us that much like landing in Oz, assuming a caregiving role involves “all sorts of new customs, expectations, relationship dynamics, challenges, and personal insecurities to navigate. And it can feel like everyone knows the landscape but you.” The book is meant to evoke the proverbial yellow brick road, leading readers “home” in a sense. Divided into six sections, the book covers how to map a path forward, cultivate self-love and compassion, embrace acceptance, harness the power of intuition, adapt in the face of change, and find joy amid challenges. Green recommends delegating tasks based on one’s strengths and drafting a personal mission statement to create achievable goals. To foster a positive mindset, the author advises treating yourself like a friend and emphasizes the importance of working through grief, anger, trauma, and anxiety. Green offers strategies for overcoming human and circumstantial roadblocks, such as pausing for reflection or connecting with those facing similar challenges. Asking for what you want, like Dorothy did with the wizard, is among Green’s pithy Oz-referencing communication tips. Green also explores the symptoms of resilience fatigue and strategies to overcome it and concludes with encouragement for finding inner joy. This comprehensive book combines anecdotes, reflection exercises, goal-setting prompts, and practical strategies to help readers create a personalized roadmap toward authentic and healthy caregiving. Readers seeking increased self-awareness will appreciate the ample opportunities for written reflection. The book’s design, including charts, section dividers, and shaded text boxes, makes for an engaging reading experience. The Wizard of Oz metaphor is appropriate for the most part but doesn’t strengthen the author’s often generic advice, like taking up shopworn self-help activities like journaling and mindfulness. High-gloss AI-generated images of glamorous people feel jarringly out of sync with the vintage Hollywood aesthetic and a caregiving audience.",

  "text": "I'M GLAD MY MOM DIED by Jennette McCurdy ‧ RELEASE DATE: Aug. 9, 2022 The heartbreaking story of an emotionally battered child delivered with captivating candor and grace. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 26 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller IndieBound Bestseller The former iCarly star reflects on her difficult childhood. In her debut memoir, titled after her 2020 one-woman show, singer and actor McCurdy (b. 1992) reveals the raw details of what she describes as years of emotional abuse at the hands of her demanding, emotionally unstable stage mom, Debra. Born in Los Angeles, the author, along with three older brothers, grew up in a home controlled by her mother. When McCurdy was 3, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. Though she initially survived, the disease’s recurrence would ultimately take her life when the author was 21. McCurdy candidly reconstructs those in-between years, showing how “my mom emotionally, mentally, and physically abused me in ways that will forever impact me.” Insistent on molding her only daughter into “Mommy’s little actress,” Debra shuffled her to auditions beginning at age 6. As she matured and starting booking acting gigs, McCurdy remained “desperate to impress Mom,” while Debra became increasingly obsessive about her daughter’s physical appearance. She tinted her daughter’s eyelashes, whitened her teeth, enforced a tightly monitored regimen of “calorie restriction,” and performed regular genital exams on her as a teenager. Eventually, the author grew understandably resentful and tried to distance herself from her mother. As a young celebrity, however, McCurdy became vulnerable to eating disorders, alcohol addiction, self-loathing, and unstable relationships. Throughout the book, she honestly portrays Debra’s cruel perfectionist personality and abusive behavior patterns, showing a woman who could get enraged by everything from crooked eyeliner to spilled milk. At the same time, McCurdy exhibits compassion for her deeply flawed mother. Late in the book, she shares a crushing secret her father revealed to her as an adult. While McCurdy didn’t emerge from her childhood unscathed, she’s managed to spin her harrowing experience into a sold-out stage act and achieve a form of catharsis that puts her mind, body, and acting career at peace. The heartbreaking story of an emotionally battered child delivered with captivating candor and grace.
