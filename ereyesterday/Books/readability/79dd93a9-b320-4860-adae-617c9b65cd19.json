  "text": "23 Apr 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write L. Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of the Future Volume 41? This is a contest created by L. Ron Hubbard in 1983 to provide a means for aspiring writers and artists to have their works seen and acknowledged. We now have entries from over 175 countries and nearly 1,000 winners from 51 countries. The Writers and Illustrators of the Future Contests are free to enter, open internationally to amateur writers and illustrators of science fiction and fantasy, and judged blind – all the judges see is the story or art and a number assigned to each entry. Winners maintain their rights, receive cash prizes, and are flown to Hollywood for a weeklong workshop and Oscar-style Gala. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of L. Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of the Future Volume 41, what would they be? “Unwritten” by Natasha Bedingfield. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Science Fiction! What books are on your TBR pile right now? “Earthlight” by Dr. Sian Proctor; “The Malice of Moons and Mages” by N.V. Haskell, “The Silversmith’s Puzzle” by Nev March, “Love, Lies and Hocus Pocus” by Lydia Sherrer — These are all upcoming guests on my Writers of the Future Podcast at https://soundcloud.com/writersofthefuture. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? As the publisher, I don’t write the stories, but I am always thrilled to celebrate the new voices each year with publications such as yours. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? “A culture is as rich and capable of surviving as it has imaginative artists. The artist is looked upon to start things. The artist injects the spirit of life into a culture.” — L. Ron Hubbard from Writers of the Future Volume 1 If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Wow! I just discovered my next favorite authors and artists! Buy The Book Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly. zaida Recommended Posts",
