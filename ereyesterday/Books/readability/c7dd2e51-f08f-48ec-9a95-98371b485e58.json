  "description": "Sam is a 30-something poet finally pursuing the college degree she promised herself she would earn, but the experience lacks luster. Her new boyfriend, Steven, a professor from her program, has a research grant to go to Boston; moving there seems like a promising new start and a way to gain clarity about what she wants to do with her life, but Sam keeps getting dragged back into her past. Her alcoholic ex-boyfriend Timothy is still a fixture, as are the memories of a difficult childhood spent living under the eye of her abusive grandmother that keep threatening to surface. In Boston, Sam finds her creative need to write poetry comes second to Steven’s work; she finds solace in new friend Martin Alistair, son of legendary feminist publisher Edith Alistair. Sam reads Edith’s diaries about her publishing house—part of Steven’s research that he seems surprised she is fascinated by—while simultaneously writing poetry. From the novel’s opening line (“Happiness was a shock. So was knowing she belonged”), Parrish writes lyrically, conveying the creativity of her heroine while also displaying her own skill as a published poet. This is particularly evident as Sam works through a recurring motif of her childhood trauma, turning a terrible memory into an affecting poem. Though both Timothy and Steven feature heavily in the story (occasionally, it feels a little unclear as to whether they are meant to present a love triangle for Sam), the most compelling aspect of the narrative is the central character’s journey as she finds her footing and truly addresses her own needs. Readers will find themselves rooting for Sam, a woman in her 30s, as if this is her coming-of-age tale.",

  "text": "THE NIGHTINGALE by Kristin Hannah ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 3, 2015 Still, a respectful and absorbing page-turner. Hannah’s new novel is an homage to the extraordinary courage and endurance of Frenchwomen during World War II. In 1995, an elderly unnamed widow is moving into an Oregon nursing home on the urging of her controlling son, Julien, a surgeon. This trajectory is interrupted when she receives an invitation to return to France to attend a ceremony honoring passeurs: people who aided the escape of others during the war. Cut to spring, 1940: Viann has said goodbye to husband Antoine, who's off to hold the Maginot line against invading Germans. She returns to tending her small farm, Le Jardin, in the Loire Valley, teaching at the local school and coping with daughter Sophie’s adolescent rebellion. Soon, that world is upended: The Germans march into Paris and refugees flee south, overrunning Viann’s land. Her long-estranged younger sister, Isabelle, who has been kicked out of multiple convent schools, is sent to Le Jardin by Julien, their father in Paris, a drunken, decidedly unpaternal Great War veteran. As the depredations increase in the occupied zone—food rationing, systematic looting, and the billeting of a German officer, Capt. Beck, at Le Jardin—Isabelle’s outspokenness is a liability. She joins the Resistance, volunteering for dangerous duty: shepherding downed Allied airmen across the Pyrenees to Spain. Code-named the Nightingale, Isabelle will rescue many before she's captured. Meanwhile, Viann’s journey from passive to active resistance is less dramatic but no less wrenching. Hannah vividly demonstrates how the Nazis, through starvation, intimidation and barbarity both casual and calculated, demoralized the French, engineering a community collapse that enabled the deportations and deaths of more than 70,000 Jews. Hannah’s proven storytelling skills are ideally suited to depicting such cataclysmic events, but her tendency to sentimentalize undermines the gravitas of this tale. Still, a respectful and absorbing page-turner.
