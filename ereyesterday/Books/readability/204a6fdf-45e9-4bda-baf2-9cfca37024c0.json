  "text": "What‚Äôs the story behind the story? What inspired you to write The End: Alpha (Book 1)? The End: Alpha is the first in a series of dystopian/post-apocalyptic future environment set in the year 2113. When Constantine Jedidiah Goodfellow shot up through the senate, people were all-too surprised and delighted to see someone in the prime of life wanting to heal wounds, bring people together, and bring peace, so they elected him President. His aim, however, was to bring the exact opposite. The year is 2113, and Christianity is under siege.¬† A massive virus has torn across the planet and killed off half of the world‚Äôs population and its leaders. Goodfellow, having changed his name to ‚ÄúNero‚Äù in honor of the Roman emperor, has declared himself de facto leader over the remainder of mankind, and commenced the eradication of Christianity. In a small community outside Chicago, Illinois, eighteen year old Sage Maddox is endowed with wisdom and street smarts well beyond his years. Though his entire family has been killed off by ‚ÄúGuardians‚Äù ‚Äì deceptively-named and ruthless killing machines dispatched by Nero ‚Äì he is determined to do his part to bring much-needed justice and restore safety to Christians throughout the world. There‚Äôs just one thing‚Ä¶ Nero is waiting for him. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of The End: Alpha (Book 1), what would they be? I LOVE ‚ÄúFight On Fighter‚Äù by For King \u0026 Country. I think that pertains both to my Dissonance series as well as to The End: Alpha, and will pertain to the subsequent novels in this series as well. What‚Äôs your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Sci-fi, for sure. I do appreciate great fantasy, but I find that everything utterly pales in comparison to J.R.R. Tolkien, and I make some unfair comparisons. He is, after all, the quintessential author of fantasy fiction. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Aliens subnovels by the likes of Tim Lebbon and Christopher Golden, a Star Wars novelization, The Expanse by James SA Corey, and the Maze Runner series. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? Probably the betrayal ‚Äì I can‚Äôt say where it was or who does it, but it‚Äôs EPIC and it will make you pump your fist in the air! Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I like to write at all hours of the day, wherever I am‚Ä¶and when I‚Äôm completely done with a book, I get beef jerky and a soda and candy. Period. No exceptions. üôÇ I‚Äôm a pantser, so it‚Äôs very organic writing, and it follows then that I write organically at any time of the day. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? ‚ÄúYour focus determines your reality‚Äù! I LOVE this quote! It‚Äôs from a movie I like to pretend does not exist (Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace) said by Qui-Gon Jinn to a young Anakin Skywalker. LOVE this quote. So true! If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? There is hope for redemption. ALWAYS. Never lose hope.
