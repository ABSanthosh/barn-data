  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write The Fallen Ones (A Holloway University Novel Book 1)? We’ve been best friends for years and we’d been talking about writing together for a long time so it was bound to happen. A dark standalone was the perfect book idea. There’s something about a masked man that always appeals so we figured three masked men was chef’s kiss. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of The Fallen Ones (A Holloway University Novel Book 1), what would they be? “Chokehold” by Sleep Token. “Blood Sport” by Sleep Token. “Death of Peace of Mind” by Bad Omens. “Monsters” by Ruelle. “Insanely Illegal” by Cage Fight. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? J.A: I enjoy autobiographies, true crime, fantasy, dark romance, and sweet romcoms. K.G.: I personally love reading fantasy books and non-fiction books on metaphysics and physics. What books are on your TBR pile right now? J.A.: Things we never get over by Lucy Score, The Ritual by Shantel Tessier K.G.: Quicksilver by Callie Hart, Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros What scene in your book was your favorite to write? It’s really difficult to choose just one scene. All of the characters had their own stories. We both loved how the spicy scenes helped build the individual relationships each guy had with Lily. J.A. loved the scene with Caleb getting intimate with Lily in the alleyway outside his workplace, and Jace surprising her in the bathroom at a party. K.G. loved the scene with Damien getting intimate with Lily in the car. They were all really fun for us to write. Lily’s a lucky girl. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) J.A.: I write on both my phone and laptop and often switch between the two, and I always need a cup of tea before I start to write. K.G.: I listen to music as I’m writing. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? J.A.: Respect your dark days because without them you wouldn’t know how great happiness feels. The only way to predict the future is to create it. K.G.: Only those with the strength to seize their destiny deserve to have one. Hope for the best, expect the worst. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? One thing to remember is it’s fiction, not real life. And if it is real life, seek help.
