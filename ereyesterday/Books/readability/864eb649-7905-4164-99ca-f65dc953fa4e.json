  "description": "This exploration of the achievements of scientist Frederick Banting doesn’t explain the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes until the glossary and never mentions gestational or other types of diabetes at all. And some readers may be put off by descriptions of how his research involved removing pancreases from healthy dogs, especially given the author’s earlier, insistent references to Banting’s youthful love of farm animals. What does come through clearly, however, is his stubborn persistence (following a late-night Eureka! moment about a new approach) in working with colleagues to find a way to isolate the pancreatic hormone he eventually dubbed “insulin,” as well as the laudable altruism that led him to pass up big bucks and give away the formula with the titular comment. Along with an indignant complaint about the unjustly high cost of insulin today, the author leaves readers with simple descriptions of the nature of Type 1 diabetes and the mechanism of insulin. In the simply drawn illustrations, the small bottles of medication, the green blood sugar indicators floating above the heads of joyful former patients, and even the lab dogs are depicted with smiling faces. Though major figures are white, brown faces mingle with lighter ones in most of the other lab and outdoor group scenes.",

  "text": "JUST LIKE JESSE OWENS by Andrew Young \u0026 Paula Young Shelton ; illustrated by Gordon C. James ‧ RELEASE DATE: Aug. 2, 2022 A pivotal moment in a child’s life, at once stirring and authentically personal. Before growing up to become a major figure in the civil rights movement, a boy finds a role model. Buffing up a childhood tale told by her renowned father, Young Shelton describes how young Andrew saw scary men marching in his New Orleans neighborhood (“It sounded like they were yelling ‘Hi, Hitler!’ ”). In response to his questions, his father took him to see a newsreel of Jesse Owens (“a runner who looked like me”) triumphing in the 1936 Olympics. “Racism is a sickness,” his father tells him. “We’ve got to help folks like that.” How? “Well, you can start by just being the best person you can be,” his father replies. “It’s what you do that counts.” In James’ hazy chalk pastels, Andrew joins racially diverse playmates (including a White child with an Irish accent proudly displaying the nickel he got from his aunt as a bribe to stop playing with “those Colored boys”) in tag and other games, playing catch with his dad, sitting in the midst of a cheering crowd in the local theater’s segregated balcony, and finally visualizing himself pelting down a track alongside his new hero—“head up, back straight, eyes focused,” as a thematically repeated line has it, on the finish line. An afterword by Young Shelton explains that she retold this story, told to her many times growing up, drawing from conversations with Young and from her own research; family photos are also included.
