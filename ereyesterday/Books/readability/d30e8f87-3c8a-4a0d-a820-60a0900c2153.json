  "description": "Emory is an older pachyderm living in a forest. While out for a walk one day, he finds that he can’t remember how to get home. A parrot asks if Emory needs help, and after the elephant admits that he might be lost, the bird says, “I’m happy to help you find your way. Just tell me, where did you come from? And I’ll have you home by the end of the day.” The parrot doesn’t recognize Emory’s description of his home, but offers to bring him to see a wise frog friend. The pair cross a river to reach the amphibian, who leads them to Emory’s herd. The other elephants thank the parrot and frog and invite them to celebrate Emory’s return: “We welcome you as guests and friends. You have been patient and generous, and this tale has come to a joyful end.” It’s not explicitly clear whether Emory has age-related memory loss or a more serious condition, but he’s never shown to be in real danger. This aspect also doesn’t detract from the cheerful, effective message to readers to “lend a helping hand” whenever they can. Letcher’s watercolor-style cartoon illustrations will be a big draw; the stubby-trunked elephants’ faces are especially expressive and endearing.",

  "text": "PEANUT BUTTER \u0026 CUPCAKE by Terry Border ; illustrated by Terry Border ‧ RELEASE DATE: July 29, 2014 Still, preschoolers will likely savor this mouthwatering treatment of a subject that looms large in many early school... The familiar theme of the challenges facing a new kid in town is given an original treatment by photographer Border in this book of photos of three-dimensional objects in a simple modeled landscape. Peanut Butter is represented by a slice of white bread spread with the popular condiment. The other characters in the story—a hamburger with a pair of hot dogs in tow, a bowl of alphabet soup, a meatball jumping a rope of spaghetti, a carton of French fries and a pink cupcake—are represented by skillfully crafted models of these foods, anthropomorphized using simple wire construction. Rejected by each character in turn in his search for playmates, Peanut Butter discovers in the end that Jelly is his true match (not Cupcake, as the title suggests), perhaps because she is the only one who looks like him, being a slice of white bread spread with jelly. The friendly foods end up happily playing soccer together. Some parents may have trouble with the unabashedly happy depiction of carbs and American junk food (no carrots or celery sticks in this landscape), and others may find themselves troubled by the implication that friendship across difference is impossible. Still, preschoolers will likely savor this mouthwatering treatment of a subject that looms large in many early school experiences.
