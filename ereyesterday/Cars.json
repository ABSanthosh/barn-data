    "description": "BMW’s CE 02 is an electric two-wheeler that straddles the line between an electric scooter and a motorcycle. It's aimed at urban riders looking for a more stylish way to get around town and unlike the recently launched CE 04, this one is made in India at TVS’ Hosur plant. We got to spend a short time in Delhi’s traffic with this EV and this is our first impression. A full review will come later. BMW CE 02 design and features The BMW CE 02 breaks from traditional scooter and motorcycle design, offering a minimalistic yet futuristic look. The CE 02 we rode was equipped with the Highline Pack, which included bits like a gold anodised USD fork, teal stickering, tri-coloured seat, heated grips and a smartphone holder. The overall design features minimal bodywork, sharp angles, a single-sided swingarm and fat tyres that give it a unique look. The clean, flat surfaces combined with a simple-looking frame create a distinctive aesthetic that BMW hopes will appeal to younger riders. The CE 02 has a friendly face, with LED elements on the headlight, indicators and DRL creating a unique light signature. Our test bike also came with a unique teal-tinted visor sold as an optional  extra. During our short stint, the CE 02 stood out on our streets and looks like a concept bike. While the rest of the design feels quite cohesive, the front footpegs and their mount do look like a bit of an afterthought. BMW, though, says it's designed this way to accommodate a snow/skateboard. While some may find its playful design too polarising, I found it unique and funky. The CE 02 is equipped with a 3.5-inch TFT screen that may seem small on paper, but it does a pretty good job and has a crisp and clear layout. Additionally, BMW also allows you to mount your phone onto the bike and connect it via BMW’s app, giving you control of features on the app using the switchgear – your smartphone screen becomes an extension of the infotainment. What seemed odd to me was the heated grips, which seemed rather unnecessary in India. I would have preferred the windscreen or comfort seats instead. Speaking of which, with a seat height of 745mm, the CE 02 is quite friendly for shorter riders. However, the standard seat is narrow and will accommodate skinny passengers at best. In the real world, the CE 02 seems better suited for just a rider but a pillion would be a snug fit. As of now, BMW is offering the CE 02 in standard trim and the Highline Package with just one colour option. As part of the Highline Package, BMW will offer a 1.5kW fast charger that will fully charge the CE 02 in under 3.5 hours. BMW CE 02 performance The CE 02 is powered by two 1.96kWh batteries that have a combined capacity of 3.92kWh. The motors have a peak output of 11kW (15hp) and 55Nm. BMW claims the CE 02 is positioned as an electric alternative to a 200cc motorcycle, but its numbers put it more on pace with a sporty 160cc bike. While 15hp may not seem like a lot, the CE 02 picks up pace rather quickly and can effortlessly climb to its 95kph claimed top speed. There are three riding modes: Flow, Surf and Flash. The latter is only available as part of the Highline package and all three modes tweak the throttle response and regen levels. Flow has mild regen, Surf turns off regen entirely whereas Flash puts regen and throttle response on max giving you the most engaging experience. However, all three modes felt quite similar with the difference feeling rather negligible in the real world. BMW also claims that the CE 02 has a range of about 108km, which should make it an effective city commuter. However, we’d need more time with the CE 02 before we can verify those claims. BMW CE 02 ride and handling The CE 02 shines when it comes to ease of handling and urban practicality. Despite weighing a hefty 142kg, it feels rather light and darting through traffic is quite effortless. The thick Michelin City Grip tyres provide great grip and the brakes provide ample stopping power. The lack of rear ABS may seem daunting to newer riders as it’s rather easy to lock up the rear wheel, which may be cause for concern. Another issue I have is the suspension setup, which allows you to feel every imperfection in the road and may not feel as plush as one would come to expect from a thoroughbred city commuter like the CE 02. BMW’s most affordable electric two-wheeler loves to attack corners and it’s not hard to get it to scrap its pegs. BMW says riders can alternate between a more relaxed or a more engaging riding position based on what footpegs they use. While both felt comfortable, I preferred the forward-set position for most part of my journey. BMW CE 02 verdict Priced at Rs 4.50 lakh, it's one of the most expensive electric two-wheelers on sale, second only to its older sibling. However, the CE 02 still remains a niche EV for premium buyers that care more about brand image and futuristic design. While our time with it was short, the CE 02 has made a positive impression with all its credentials. We look forward to bringing you a more detailed review of this electric two-wheeler and testing it over a longer period in the future. Until then, stick around for further updates.",

    "description": "When we rode the TVS Apache RTR 310 in Thailand last year, we had some complaints, which the company has now addressed via its ‘Carecraft’ service camp. Much to my chagrin, we did not experience the updated RTR 310 on dry, well-paved Thai roads. Instead, the setting was Mumbai during the peak of monsoon, which is when the roads start to go the way of the Dodo. To be fair, a bike tackling such roads in torrential rain is one of the best litmus tests there is, so let’s dive in.    Our main complaints last year were excessive vibration, an erratic quickshifter and an uncomfortable climate-controlled seat, and TVS now has fixes for all these issues. In a bid to quell the RTR 310’s buzz, the bike has been given larger bar-end weights and a revised tank mounting. The cooled seat’s padding has been changed to improve comfort. Finally, a revised throttle map and new routing for the quickshifter’s wiring eliminate random cut-offs. 5-inch TFT display is well laid out and has a myriad of customisations. But before we get down to brass tacks, let me refresh your memory about this handsome yellow bike. TVS has pulled out all the stops when it comes to features. Even the base variant comes standard with a TFT display, four riding modes (Track, Sport, Urban and Rain), an automatic LED headlight (which is very bright), traction control, switchable dual-channel ABS and cruise control, too! Bright LED headlight has good throw; adaptive function is standard. Further, TVS’ accessory catalogue brings in a bidirectional quickshifter, climate-controlled seat, fully adjustable suspension, brass-coated chain, and more. The RTR 310 we tested missed out only on adjustable suspension and the brass-coated chain, so it was pretty well-specced.  Switchgear feels tactile, but the left-hand cube is a little busy.   So, have the changes made by TVS ironed out the chinks in the RTR 310’s armour? The short answer is yes (mostly). The vibrations are now better contained, and while the bike still isn’t ultra-smooth, the buzz is no longer a deal-breaker. The one area which still feels vibey is the grey rubber piece on the pillion seat, which gets buzzy at various rpms and sends a tingle up your back. The RTR 310’s quickshifter was already a pretty slick unit, and now it works seamlessly at all rpms. Cooled seat has more padding, but still not comfy for long periods. The one issue that persists is the climate-controlled seat’s comfort. As innovative as it is, in under an hour, you’ll start to feel discomfort due to its stiffness. I respect TVS for trying something ingenious like this, but I have to recommend going with the standard seat. We also encountered a few stray instances of the bike stalling while taking off from a stop with gentle throttle inputs, which can get a little tiresome in big-city traffic. Michelin Road 5 tyres are superb and inspire loads of confidence. Beyond that, the Apache RTR 310 remains an engaging yet reasonably comfortable bike to ride. A special mention must go to the excellent Michelin Road 5 rubber, which inspired loads of confidence in every scenario. The non-adjustable suspension struck a good balance between comfort and sportiness, and you don’t need the adjustable suspension, although it will help you fine-tune the setup to your liking.   The RTR 310 is the only model among the five TVS-BMW products on sale that makes 35.6hp and 28.7Nm of torque, compared to the other models’ 34hp/28Nm. TVS has also dramatically shortened the gearing on the RTR 310 compared to the RR, adding four more teeth to the rear sprocket. Strong performance and better refinement, but engine still buzzy. The result? Punchy acceleration and a 0-100kph time that was narrowly quicker than the 40hp Triumph Speed 400’s. If you find yourself on a long enough stretch of road, you’ll see a speedo-indicated 160kph, maybe more if you’re lighter than me (I weigh 80kg without gear). Suspension strikes a good balance between comfort and sportiness. While Sport and Track modes give you the full juice, Rain and Urban temper down peak output to 27.1hp/27.3Nm, with gentler power delivery and more cautious intervention from the riding aids. The Rain and Urban settings should come in handy for newer riders or if you’re riding in inclement weather. Brakes are progressive and feelsome, have enough power. Thankfully, if you ever have to ride in less-than-ideal conditions, the brakes are strong and feedback-rich. The RTR 310 has one of the shortest stopping distances in this category (the superb Road 5s helping here, too). They have a gentle initial bite, but once you give the lever a firm tug, the bike slows down quickly. What’s pleasantly surprising is that the shorter gearing hasn’t impacted fuel economy much, and you can realistically get 300km on a tankful.   Thanks to the updates, the Apache RTR 310 now has noticeable improvements that make it more appealing. However, the top variant with all the bells and whistles is priced too close to the feisty KTM 390 Duke, so the RTR continues to feel a little out of its depth. That’s exactly why the Apache RTR 310 is one of the few motorcycles where the version we recommend is the base variant. The RTR is an agile handler with enough power to entertain. At Rs 2.50 lakh, the base (but still feature-rich) RTR 310 is now a very strong alternative to the likes of the Triumph Speed 400, KTM 250 Duke and Honda CB300R because you get much stronger performance along with fantastic style and more features at a comparable price.",

    "description": "The new Speed T4 has some significant mechanical changes from the Speed 400 and it's rare to see something so different come out just a year after the birth of a new platform. As it turns out, this was one of the iterations in the development stage of the Bajaj-Triumph 400 platform and that’s why Bajaj was able to bring it out so soon. At its core, this is the same 399cc single cylinder unit, but power has seen a big drop from 40hp to 31hp. There’s also a small 1.5Nm reduction in torque, but it’s still a healthy 36Nm that is now produced 1,500rpm lower at 5,000rpm. These changes have been executed through a new airbox, a smaller throttle body (no ride-by-wire here) and new camshafts. More significantly, crank inertia has increased by a sizeable 31 percent. The idea behind all these changes is to create a more Indian-city-friendly riding experience and the Speed T4 scores well here. Ride it back to back with a Speed 400 and you’ll notice that the T4’s throttle response is smoother and more mellow. The torque now feels more widely spread and easily accessible – you can hold third gear as low as 20kph without complaint. The engine isn’t as rev-happy, and as a result, it’s a motor that doesn’t want to be revved as much as the Speed 400, which means vibrations are even less of an issue here. Within the city, the T4 feels more enjoyable than the Speed 400, but it does sacrifice some of the latter’s outright performance. The T4 doesn’t feel slow by any means and I suspect it will clock a sub-8-second 0-100kph time, but it lacks the same energetic high-rpm acceleration as its bigger brother. On the highway, a 100kph cruise feels fairly relaxed at around 5,500rpm and the bike has enough in reserve to surge up to 120kph. Progress above that is slow and you should see a top speed between 140kph and 150kph on the speedometer. There are quite a few changes with the chassis as well, the most obvious being the move to a telescopic front fork. The front brakes now use an axial caliper with organic brake pads and the T4 gets the same MRF bias ply tyres as the Pulsar NS400Z. Naturally, none of this sounds very appealing, but I found the tyres, brakes and suspension to be more than adequate for the generally calm way this bike enjoys being ridden. Nevertheless, perhaps sticking with the USD fork would have been wise because the new suspension setup makes the T4 easy to spot as the ‘budget option’ and it also makes an already skinny bike look even more so. The taller tires have also raised the seat height from 790mm to 804mm and this is something that folks shorter than 5’7” will notice. Other cost-saving measures can be seen in the move from aluminium to steel for things like the handlebar, foot levers and headlamp mounts. The T4 also misses out on adjustable levers, traction control and engine immobiliser. All this results in a lower price of Rs 2.17 lakh (ex-showroom, India), which is Rs 23,000 less than the 2025 Speed 400. On the one hand, that price highlights how the Speed 400 is still phenomenal value, but on the other, it also brings the T4 right into the space occupied by the popular 350cc Royal Enfields as well as the new Jawa 42FJ. Within a Triumph showroom, the Speed 400 will surely seem more appealing for ‘just’ Rs 23,000 extra. But the new T4 has a rather endearing riding experience to offer that I found more fitting in a bike like this – it will certainly appeal more strongly to the hordes of 350cc RE buyers that Triumph is trying to tempt away. If, like many others, you find yourself a bit underwhelmed by what this bike looks like on paper, give it a test ride. It might just surprise you.

    "title": "Yamaha Aerox Version S review: Subtle updates",

    "description": "At one point, it seemed unlikely that the Yamaha Aerox would come to India – it has the liquid-cooled engine from the R15, which makes it expensive, and a big spine section that makes it impractical. But Yamaha was brave enough to launch it here in 2021, and at that point, we at Autocar India praised it quite highly. But, we also questioned if the Indian market was ready for such a scooter. A few years down the line, it’s safe to say that the Aerox has been a success, and has done even better than Yamaha initially expected, to the point where the Japanese brand has now rolled out an update to try and sweeten the deal, and make it a little more India-friendly. Yamaha Aerox Version S: changes to standard model You now get a top-spec variant called Version S, which comes with a keyless system. The international Aerox has had this feature for a while now – it was removed as a cost-cutting measure when the scooter first came to India, but is now being offered if you’re willing to pay for it. The Aerox was already a fairly convenient scooter – it had a combination keyslot, which you still get on the other variants, and a fuel-filler conveniently placed in front of you. Now, it’s even more convenient – you can open the seat and the fuel filler, lock and unlock the handlebar and operate the scooter, all without the key fob leaving your pocket. New keyless system adds convenience. The other change here is suspension – Yamaha says it has tweaked the suspension to make it a little better suited to our roads. This is important, because one of the biggest drawbacks of the Aerox when we first rode it was its very stiff and unforgiving ride quality. Has this new setup improved things? Possibly. Marginally. In some situations. We’d really have to ride both versions back to back to be sure, because that’s how small the differences are. But is this now suddenly a plush and comfortable scooter? No. The ride still feels rather firm and stiff, and this is not the scooter you would want to be on over poor stretches of road. The final change here is the addition of a traction control system, which is unlikely to come into play often, but still a good safety net to have.  Revised shocks still feel quite firm. Yamaha Aerox Version S: price and verdict   Considering the subtleness of these changes, it’s unsurprising that the essence of the Aerox has remained largely unchanged. At the heart of the experience is a quick and entertaining engine that outclasses anything else in this price range. Backing it up is a capable and rewarding handling package that really allows you to have some fun. It’s still very much an enthusiast’s offering, and isn’t the most practical or comfortable scooter around, especially if you’re on the taller side. But the market has shown that there are enough takers for this flavour of scooter. We still continue to like the Aerox for what it is, and we hope Yamaha and other manufacturers draw encouragement from this.

    "description": "There are many, many similarities between the two motorcycles that we have here today. For example, they both wear very old British badges but are actually thoroughly modern, made-in-India machines. Both produce exactly 40 horsepower from their liquid-cooled single-cylinder engines, and both have a starting price of under Rs 2.4 lakh. Having ridden them intensively for a few days, I can tell you that there’s no simple answer as to which is better because both have many appealing pros as well as a few significant cons. The first impression Starting with the pros, design is a big one on the Triumph, and it has the best attention to detail of any made-in-India motorcycle, including the new-age Royal Enfield seen here. There’s only one downside that becomes apparent when parked next to most other 350-400cc bikes – it doesn’t really have that much presence. The Speed 400 is not a small bike, and even tall riders will fit on it well, but it does look and feel a little too slender. The Enfield has a more quirky design in comparison, which will be more polarising, but there’s no doubt that it has more presence with its fat tyres, Himalayan-style rear panels and wider-looking fuel tank. That last element is ironic given that it actually has a smaller fuel capacity of 11 litres compared to 13 on the Speed. The Guerrilla’s rear with that fat exposed tyre looks nicer than the rather practical rear of the Triumph, but the trade-off is that it flings more road muck onto the rider in wet conditions. At 185kg, the RE is heavier than the Triumph (176kg), but its 780mm tall seat is the lowest in the segment, while the Speed 400’s is just 10mm higher. On the move Both have comfy riding positions, but the Guerrilla’s feels a little more engaged with a wider, higher handlebar and higher-set footpegs. I find the Guerrilla’s position to be nicer, but the Triumph’s seat is more comfortable over longer durations. Both also take different approaches to comfort in their suspension setups. The Guerrilla is noticeably stiffer, but thankfully, it isn’t harsh like the Hunter. It actually deals with bad roads quite well. It always feels firm but never uncomfortable, and it absorbs bumps without pitching you out of the seat. The Speed is softer, and this is nice at slower speeds and on smooth surfaces. However, when compared with the Guerrilla, it quickly  gets bouncy over less-than-ideal surfaces. Guerrilla’s telescopic fork works well. The Guerrilla’s suspension and general chassis setup are designed to be fun on a winding road. Despite carrying nine extra kilos, it feels lighter-steering, more agile and far more enthusiastic about diving into a set of corners. The Speed is very competent, but while it comes across as being able to do it, the Guerrilla was built to enjoy doing it. The same goes for the brakes, with the Triumph’s being strong and reassuring, but the RE’s are better, both in terms of feel and performance. Change of pace The tides turn when it comes to the engine. On paper, both make 40hp and the Enfield – with its 54cc advantage – produces a little more torque at slightly lower revs. In reality, both perform quite differently, and in many ways, the Triumph’s engine is better. For one, it’s more tractable in the city, and you can hold a gear higher than the RE without protest. It also has a lighter clutch and, coupled with its slim proportions, it is the nicer city bike. The Speed is also smoother on the highway, and while the vibrations do build up from 120kph, you’ll start to feel them from 100kph on the Guerrilla. Looks good, but rev counter a bit hard to read. Then there’s the fact that it’s also a little more fuel efficient than the Royal Enfield, both in the city and out on the highway, and it’ll have better highway range thanks to the larger fuel tank. As for actual performance, the tested numbers are almost identical, with the Enfield a little faster in acceleration, while the Triumph had a tiny advantage in roll-on test figures. It was very close, but the Guerrilla was tested in damp conditions, which could make a small difference. Where the Enfield motor claws back some points is in sound and character. The Sherpa 450 engine is the more flawed motor here but also the more engaging one. It produces a nicer intake sound and has a more revvy, fun-to-ride feeling. In fact, its response can be surprisingly eager, especially when you shift from first to second gear and cross the 3,000rpm mark. For the few folks who won’t like this, there’s the option of changing to Eco mode, which significantly dumbs down the performance. What you get Before we wrap up, let’s just talk about features, and once again, there’s a bit of give and take. The Speed 400 gets a simpler analogue-digital display, but you do get the USD fork, traction control and an engine immobiliser. The Enfield gives you a simpler telescopic fork, but you get a centre stand, two engine power modes and the option of the TFT display from the Himalayan. Classy TFT screen on top two Guerrilla variants. As for quality, some Triumph owners have complained about rusty bolts in a few areas and heavy condensation in the indicators – both were visible on our bike. Our bike also sometimes took up to five cranks to start up. The Guerrilla is based on the Himalayan platform, which has its fair share of issues as well, the most infamous being the chassis failure, which Royal Enfield says was due to incorrectly installed aftermarket crash guards. It also has the same fiddly toggle button that has recently completely failed on our long-term Himalayan. Clearly, both manufacturers need to iron out some issues in these brand-new platforms. USD fork adds to the Speed’s visual appeal. At the end of it all, I don’t think there is a clear winner here. It boils down to which plus points are more important to you and which negatives you are more willing to live with. For example, the Triumph is the more grown-up and sophisticated motorcycle here, and it has the more desirable badge on its fuel tank. It also has a smoother engine and is the nicer bike to commute on. The RE counters with a higher fun factor and better suspension comfort, and it looks and feels like a more comprehensive motorcycle. I’d like both bikes to have been better in certain areas, but I find myself slightly inclined towards the Guerrilla. I like my motorcycles to look and feel special, and they have to be special in the way they ride. The Guerrilla ticks what are the most important boxes for me, but that doesn’t have to be the case with you. Also See: RE Guerrilla 450 vs Triumph Speed 400 comparison video",

    "description": "'Latest Recipe’ was the name of the restaurant at the hotel where TVS was kind enough to put us up, which I found quite amusing since we were there to ride the latest recipe for their flagship offering – the Apache RR 310. It’s a recipe that has evolved quite a lot over the years, and the bike has been around for 7 now. It’s received new features, hardware updates, and fancy optional extras, all of which have kept it relevant and refreshed during this time. This latest recipe has once again been refined and improved, specifically to make it better on the racetrack. Here’s how it panned out. TVS Apache RR 310: mechanical changes The boffins at TVS have been hard at work on the engine, bumping up the compression ratio, increasing the airbox volume and throttle body diameter, and lightening the piston – much of this complicated engineering-type stuff has been carried over from the naked RTR 310. What matters, though, is that both power and torque have gone up, from 34hp and 27Nm to 38hp and 29 Nm. And you do feel this extra horsepower, especially at the top end of the rev range, where the engine pulls harder than before. So, on the two long straights here at CoASTT, the new RR climbs through its gearbox smoothly, which should make it entertaining on the road as well. However, this update has also made the engine feel a little more peaky than before – if you’re not in the right gear when exiting a corner and fall out of the powerband, progress will be slow (something that’s also more pronounced by Coastt’s undulating layout). What also helps on the track is the bi-directional quickshifter, which works quite well. Whether it’s climbing up or hammering down the gearbox, it manages quick and positive shifts, meaning you can leave the clutch alone. Of course, on the track, you’re almost always shifting at high revs and full throttle, while on the road, there’s a lot more low RPM, part-throttle shifting. TVS says the quickshifter works from 2300rpm onwards, so we look forward to finding out how it behaves on the road soon. TVS Apache RR 310: new features for 2024 There are a few additional goodies on the RR this year, most of which make it cooler and a little more convenient. Cruise control and adjustable levers have been carried over from the RTR 310, adding to the overall convenience. The first of the two big new talking points is a very neat-looking transparent clutch cover (and it’s standard, no less!).   And as I’m sure you’ve noticed, there are also winglets now. Sure, they look cool, but do they serve a purpose? Well, TVS claims these new winglets generate a maximum downforce of 3kg, likely at or near the motorcycle's top speed. 3kg isn’t a lot, and you’re not doing the top speed very often, so for the most part, the function of these winglets is to make the bike look cooler and generate conversation, both of which they seem to be doing quite well. As before, the RR continues to be offered with optional extra BTO kits, and the bike we rode was fitted with both available options. The Dynamic kit costs Rs 18,000 and brings in adjustable front and rear suspension from KYB, a brass-coated final drive chain, and a TPMS – the latter is new for this year. The Dynamic Pro kit goes further, bringing in a host of electronic rider aids packaged as what TVS calls RT-DSC (Race Tuned Dynamic Stability Control). This includes cornering traction control, ABS, cruise control, and wheelie control. On the suspension and handling front, the RR continues to be a very natural motorcycle, flowing through corners with ease and behaving very predictably. It’s definitely a fun bike to ride here on the track, and it’s great to still have the sticky Michelin Road 5 rubber on offer here. The electronics are a bit more of a mixed bag, though. The cornering ABS seems to be very well-judged and calibrated, because even when braking hard here on the track – sometimes while slightly leaning into a corner – it never interfered. The cornering traction control, though, seems like it could use some work. Usually, you’d want a system like this to intervene just before or as the rear tyre begins to slip under acceleration. But the traction control here seems to simply reduce power output at high lean angles, irrespective of whether the rear tyre is close to slipping or not. As you pick up the bike on the corner exit and the lean angle reduces, it gradually feeds in more and more power. This is very similar to what we experienced on the naked RTR 310 when we first rode it on the track last year, but not quite as pronounced. So, an experienced rider will almost certainly be quicker with the traction control switched off, but it’s a good feature for less experienced riders who may be new to track riding. TVS Apache RR 310: price \u0026 verdict  All these updates mean that prices have gone up, of course. You can still get the base variant in red without a quickshifter at a fairly reasonable price of Rs 2.75 lakh. But if you want the quickshifter, it’s a big jump to Rs 2.92 lakh, which then becomes Rs 2.97 lakh if you want this neat new Bomber Grey colour option. Start throwing in the optional extras and a fully-loaded RR310 will now set you back close to Rs 3.40 lakh, making it more expensive than the more powerful KTM RC 390.   The Apache RR 310 is now more performance-focused than ever before. With additional power and features like the quickshifter, it feels more at home on the track than it ever has, with earlier strengths like the grippy Michelin Road 5 rubber also being carried over. As a sportbike, the updated RR 310 is a good one, and you’ve got a good amount of customisation options on offer too. But this is now a hotly contested segment, with the likes of the Aprilia RS 457 and KTM RC 390 to contend with. How it stacks up against those rivals, and what this updated bike feels like out on our roads, is something we hope to bring to you soon.  Also See: 2024 TVS Apache RR 310 video review",

    "description": "The Mini Cooper was one of the first cars to introduce the concept of an affordable, fun-to-drive small car. As time passed, affordability reduced as the new Mini models climbed up into the premium end. But, of course, the fun element remained. In a similar vein, albeit at the other end of the spectrum, is the Maruti Swift. The first generation Swift was fun, and in keeping with Maruti’s ethos, affordable too. However, since the launch of the fourth-generation Swift, there has been a lot of talk about the smaller three-cylinder engine – lacking in power and grunt – and the price climbing higher, reaching levels of its elder sibling, the Baleno. Yes, the price has climbed higher for sure, but as for performance, it hasn’t been an issue for me at all. I say this after using the new Swift as my daily driver for around a month now.  A full-fledged dead-pedal adds to comfort, especially in stop-go traffic. The shape and size are just right for the city, the seats are soft and comfy, and the engine – well, it’s efficient. And that’s always a higher priority when I’m paying fuel bills. Since I got the Swift, I’ve clocked over 1,000km and the average efficiency has always been above 14kpl. And no, I do not drive it with a light foot. To be fair, on many occasions, I can’t. In peak-hour traffic, the engine is more than adequate, but as soon as a few overtakes are on the cards, it needs to be wrung hard. The linear power delivery just doesn’t cut it, and the only quick fix is downshifting. Speaking of which, I had hoped for an automatic after driving the manual Exter for over three months, but the Swift is yet another manual. I would have sulked if it were any other car, but on the Swift, having a manual gearbox is fun. The clutch is superlight and absolutely effortless, the gears slot in well, and you almost forget about the lack of pep from the engine. The seating position is also bang on, and there is a dedicated dead pedal for added comfort. Rear camera quality is average and worsens in the dark. Guidelines not dynamic. What’s a bit of an annoyance is the auto start/stop, which helps save fuel, but in stop-go traffic, the constant shutting off and on will add to the suffering. Thankfully, it just takes a press of a button to turn it off. The other negative is the camera quality. Given the price at which the new Swift has been launched, you would expect a decent parking camera. However, the resolution is poor on the new Swift, and even basics like dynamic guidelines are missing. In the dark, and while it is raining, you cannot rely too much on it. Speaking of darkness, there is no rear cabin light, which I’m guessing helps save some costs, but it is essential. I end up storing shopping bags or small items in the back seat and in case they roll off or I can’t find them, I have to use the phone flashlight. A lamp at the rear would have helped. With an average efficiency of over 14kpl, there’s no range or financial anxiety. The rest of the car, though, has been perfect in the city. The steering is light enough to allow zipping through narrow streets and parking in tight spaces, especially in and around the crowded suburb of Bandra. The boot is more than adequate for a weekend out of the city, the rear seats get dedicated USB-A and type-C charging ports as well as AC vents. LED lights work well in the dark, the ground clearance is plenty, and there is nothing to complain about the ride comfort from the 15-inch wheels. Honestly, the more I drive it, the more I like it. No cabin light in the rear makes it difficult to look for items in the back at night. As an introduction, it has been very positive, and most apprehensions about the dull engine performance fade away. However, once this anniversary issue closes, I’ve planned a getaway out of town, which will involve a whole lot more overtaking and triple-digit speeds. How the engine fares there is what the next report will be on. Also see: 2024 Maruti Swift road test, review Maruti Swift vs Baleno comparison video Maruti Swift CNG launched at Rs 8.20 lakh",

    "description": "For years, the 3 Series has been the highest selling BMW in the world. And it still is – in some ways – especially if you include the 3 Series estate. However, BMW’s current global bestseller, according to its own metrics, is the X3 SUV; even in its runout year. Thing is, the X3 isn’t really a big seller in India. Easily outsold by the Mercedes GLC, one of Merc’s bestsellers here, BMW will be hoping that this fresh new X3 (G45 as it is known internally), will appeal to a wider section of Indian customers. BMW X3 design, exterior That the new fourth generation X3 looks fresh comes as little surprise – it sees the introduction of a new design language. Almost monolithic in appearance, the new X3 is full of large, clean surfaces and minimal cuts and creases. The focal point of the design is the high cowl and big bonnet – the latter only has a single crease that runs around the edge. Have to say that the manner in which the big grille is incorporated into the design looks good, and it is illuminated with LEDs. Fourth-gen X3 gets BMW's new, swoopier design language. Also new is the grille, which consists of both diagonal and horizontal slats. Alongside it are dagger-shaped headlights with double LED ‘ticks’ that remind you of the ‘Angry Birds’ game. This is supported by wide, well-fleshed-out wheel arches (to help lend a bit of muscle), and no cladding – something BMWs have traditionally had on its SUVs. Around the rear, the stance is even sportier. The base has been made to look wider, the rear windshield is smaller and tucked in and there are no exhaust pipes visible under the diffuser. Also nicely done and evolved are the arrow-like tail-lights. While the X3 is built around the CLAR platform, as all rear-wheel-drive based BMWs are, the engineers have reduced its weight, increased body rigidity and worked on the suspension in a bid to improve the manner in which it tackles corners. They’ve also used braces at the front and rear– on the strut towers and rear suspension mounts – that further improve the location of the suspension points when the SUV is loaded up in corners. The X3 20 driven here (notice no ‘i’ suffix now) also gets four-wheel-drive – xDrive in BMW parlance – and an electronically locking rear differential. The X3 also has a 45mm wider track for a more planted stance, and frequency-selective dampers. No exhaust pipes visible at the rear.   BMW X3 interior, features As with many new BMW SUVs, the new X3 cabin takes a leaf out of the iX and gets a sloping dash, wide curved display, and a very modern, minimalist look. BMW’s designers have avoided making it look very generic, and the new X3 gets a large central stowage area as well as unique doorpads with electrically controlled air volume adjusters (to control the airflow of the side vents). Also quite different is the material the cabin comes with.The meshed fabric on the dash, for example, is quite porous, and while we’ll have to see how well it handles our dusty conditions, it does stand out. You can get vegan or artificial leather inside the entire cabin if you so wish, even on the steering wheel. The large screen is now built around an Android operating system, so features like Google Maps are seamlessly integrated and constantly updated. Apple CarPlay works seamlessly, and BMW's system even allows you to download a multitude of new apps; like any ’droid system would. There’s also a square digital ‘assistant’ on the left of the screen and you can scroll through all sorts of information and features vertically. The assistant helps you with the features inside the cabin, and even plays mini tutorial videos that make using some of the features – like park assist – easy. Front seats are quite comfortable and offer good support. To give the interiors a bit of a lift, there are multiple LED bands that line the front of the cabin and the doors. You can not only change colours as you please but these bands also flash warnings if you open a door and there’s a car approaching. What’s cool is that they also adjust according to the temperature – light up blue when you reduce the temperature and go red when you warm up the cabin. Below the dash, the new X3 gets a large central stowage area, sure to be very popular in the USA. You get an angled wireless charger, twin USB C ports, big cup holders and a band of cool-looking LEDs that surround it. Further back, the gear selector switch sits on a piano black pod that also houses a crystalline iDrive controller, a knurled metal volume adjuster and various shortcut buttons. However, BMW’s shift to ‘My Modes’ instead of comfort and sport buttons, shifts a lot of the selection process to the screen. And this is a pain when on the move. The side vents, with the haptic touch controls and illuminated scale, are fun to use. The only shortcomings are possibly quality levels on the door pads, and ordinary-looking plastics on some areas of the cabin. While the new X3’s cabin is forward-looking and built of quality materials, it doesn’t feel quite as plush or luxurious as the GLC. The rear seat reclines and there's more space here than the outgoing model. Space and comfort are very impressive, though. The driver’s seat is large and very supportive, the seats are very nicely put together, and in addition, the cushioning also seems just right. Despite the wheelbase being almost identical, space and comfort at the rear are better too. A back-to-back comparison showed that the new car has more width, more legroom, and much better thigh support as well. The backrest can also be reclined a few degrees, but this now has to be done from over your shoulder rather than beside your seat. You also get a huge, fixed panoramic sunroof and touch controls for the rear HVAC controls. Also impressive is the large 570-litre boot with space under the floor to keep a space-saver tyre. There’s also a handy parcel tray, hooks for bags and a 12V socket. 570-litre boot is more than enough for most. BMW X3 performance, ride quality  With its 2.0-litre petrol engine and electric motor putting out a combined 208hp, you don’t expect the X3 to accelerate crisply from low- and medium-engine speeds. But this is just what it does – you have the 18hp and 200Nm from the e-motor to thank. And this smooth pull continues well into the midrange, with the engine providing a nice, linear pull. It’s not easy to manage the boost of the turbocharged engine, spike of torque from the electric motor and a set of gears together, but BMW’s familiarity with the 8-speed torque converter gearbox makes this feel more like a ballet and less like a break dance. Stepping off the line is effortless and the gearbox is quick to downshift but flat-out acceleration isn’t strong – the engine gets loud at higher speeds and 0-100kph comes up in a claimed 7.8 seconds. Progress is seamless and smooth and the X3 doesn’t feel its weight (the scale reads 1,930kg). This doesn't feel like a near-2-tonne SUV. The new X3 does feel much more agile and willing to turn into corners. The steering is lighter at low speeds and the new X3 is also much happier to dart into corners, especially in comparison to the model currently on sale in India. With the rear-biased four-wheel-drive system providing plenty of grip and some stellar body control, you can really enjoy a winding road. However, a bit more weight and connect from the steering would have been nice. With not too many poor roads to contend with in Bavaria, it was difficult to judge the ride of the new X3. What few bad patches we encountered were swallowed silently and comfortably, with only a hint of initial stiffness.The ride at speed was also pretty flat and devoid of pitching, but we’ll only get a good idea once we run the X3 on our ‘specially curated’ roads. It darts into corners with much more aplomb than its predecessor.   BMW X3 verdict The new fourth-generation X3 is a big improvement over the SUV currently sold here. The new styling works well, the cabin is more spacious and comfortable, and BMW has also upped its game when it comes to fun features and cabin look and feel. The new X3 also feels more agile and confidence inspiring from behind the wheel – it’s lighter and easier to drive, and the engine and e-motor deliver plenty of smoothness and pep at low and medium speeds. Yes, more power and performance at this price would have been nice, the cabin isn’t quite as plush as Merc’s GLC and some plastics on the inside could have been better built. However, what’s clear is that the fourth-generation X3 is a fresh new take on midsize luxury, one that seems nicely aligned with what Indian luxury SUV buyers are looking for. Headed to a BMW showroom near you early next year? Don’t sign on the dotted line until you have seen and experienced this one. It has some real aces up its sleeve.

    "description": "The fourth-generation Swift is off to a great start, cementing its place in the list of bestsellers. Sure, like most cars today, even the Swift is offered with some discounts for a stronger sales push, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that buyers have taken a liking to this new version. So what has been driving demand? Is it its new petrol engine with tall claims of fuel efficiency; or all the modern niceties it packs in; or simply because it carries forward the Swift’s winning formula? We put it through our exhaustive tests to get an answer.   The fourth-generation Swift is largely an evolution of the outgoing version, with which it shares its ‘Heartect’ platform, albeit with changes to its front stabiliserbar, tweaked rear suspension and some other structural enhancements. Like before, the company focused on lightweighting and efficiency, but the addition of side and curtain airbags, new equipment and some mechanical bits have made this new-gen 20-25kg heavier, with the top variants tipping the scales at 920-925kg. Interestingly, despite being significantly larger in dimension than the first-gen Swift, this new car is still about 90 kilograms lighter. Besides looking distinctive, its LED headlamps perform well in the dark. But compared to its predecessor, it is 15mm longer, 10mm lower and its front track is 5mm narrower; however, its wheelbase, width and rear track are identical. And like its underpinnings, its body shell also appears to be an evolution of the version it replaces. It is an unmistakable ‘Swift’ silhouette, with design elements that are rounder and body lines that are softer and curvier. New L-shaped DRLs, an oval-shaped front grille and a chin finished in a contrasting shade add freshness to its appearance, while its clamshell-like bonnet and a neatly defined body line (that runs the length of the car from the headlamps to the tail-lamps) add to its character. It sits on 185/65 R15 tyres sporting new diamond-cut alloys. The rear door handles have been repositioned from the C-pillar (in the Gen 3) to a more conventional position on the doors (like Gen 1 and 2 cars). The tailgate neatly dips between its stylish, new trapezoidal tail-lamps with C-Shaped LED elements. The inclusion of a full-size underbody engine cover, which, along with smooth body lines, redesigned C-pillars, repositioned rear door handles and a roof spoiler, are said to enhance aerodynamic efficiency. Tyre size is identical to outgoing car; but it gets new alloys.   Like its predecessor, the Swift carries forward an all-black interior colour scheme with silver touches scattered to break the monotone. The design philosophy is similar to the Baleno’s, with a layered dashboard and a free-standing screen taking centre stage. What’s nice is that the fit-finish is pleasing and like the third-gen, it is quite well-built too, so the interior doesn’t feel prone to rattling. That said, the excessive use of hard and scratchy plastics feel rudimentary and reeks of a budget car vibe, and the lack of vibrancy and soft-touch materials don’t help its case either. Dark cabin looks sporty but lacks soft-touch surfaces. It carries forward a flat-bottomed steering, which feels great to hold. The instrument cluster is new – the analogue dials are neat and easy to read, and the needles look premium. However, the outgoing version’s hooded dials with vertical needles and red detailing felt a bit more special. Also new is the coloured MID (multi-information display), which packs useful information, including turn-by-turn navigation while using Google Maps, though it can’t be turned off when using navigation on the center screen. The front seats feel sporty, with chunky side bolstering and ample support, although those with larger body frames will find these a tad snug. True to a Swift, its driving position is very sporty and ergonomics, in general, are excellent. Sculpted front seats feel very sporty and hold you in place nicely. An added advantage of the repositioned rear door handle is that the glass area is now larger, and its new quarter glass enhances the sense of space. Its rear bench is comfortable and supportive, and there’s adequate room for two six-footers to sit one behind another. Also, being wider than its direct rival – the Hyundai Grand i10 Nios – makes it easier to accommodate a third rear passenger. However, no head restraint and a protruding rear air-con console will compromise comfort for the passenger seated in the middle. Larger window makes the rear feel airier; adequately comfy for two adults. As far as practicality is concerned, there are ample storage and cubby areas all across. The 265-litre boot is adequately sized for a car in this segment and there’s the option to fold the rear seats 60:40 to accommodate more cargo. But a high boot lip makes it a bit of a challenge to load or unload heavy luggage. Like its predecessor, the Swift carries forward an all-black interior colour scheme with silver touches scattered to break the monotone. The design philosophy is similar to the Baleno’s, with a layered dashboard and a free-standing screen taking centre stage. What’s nice is that the fit-finish is pleasing and like the third-gen, it is quite well-built too, so the interior doesn’t feel prone to rattling. That said, the excessive use of hard and scratchy plastics feel rudimentary and reeks of a budget car vibe, and the lack of vibrancy and soft-touch materials don’t help its case either. Dials are crisp, clear and look premium; detailed MID with turn-by-turn navigation prompts. It carries forward a flat-bottomed steering, which feels great to hold. The instrument cluster is new – the analogue dials are neat and easy to read, and the needles look premium. However, the outgoing version’s hooded dials with vertical needles and red detailing felt a bit more special. Also new is the coloured MID (multi-information display), which packs useful information, including turn-by-turn navigation while using Google Maps, though it can’t be turned off when using navigation on the center screen. The front seats feel sporty, with chunky side bolstering and ample support, although those with larger body frames will find these a tad snug. True to a Swift, its driving position is very sporty and ergonomics, in general, are excellent. Multiple charging provisions around the cabin, including a wireless phone charging pad. An added advantage of the repositioned rear door handle is that the glass area is now larger, and its new quarter glass enhances the sense of space. Its rear bench is comfortable and supportive, and there’s adequate room for two six-footers to sit one behind another. Also, being wider than its direct rival – the Hyundai Grand i10 Nios – makes it easier to accommodate a third rear passenger. However, no head restraint and a protruding rear air-con console will compromise comfort for the passenger seated in the middle. Finally includes rear air-con vents; there’s a recess to stow a phone; gets charging provisions. As far as practicality is concerned, there are ample storage and cubby areas all across. The 265-litre boot is adequately sized for a car in this segment and there’s the option to fold the rear seats 60:40 to accommodate more cargo. But a high boot lip makes it a bit of a challenge to load or unload heavy luggage. Loading lip is high; cargo space is similar to a Grand i10 Nios.   With the Swift, Suzuki debuts its brand new engine – the Z12E. It is a three-cylinder unit, but its displacement remains identical to the outgoing K-Series four-cylinder unit at 1,197cc. Obviously, its bore and stroke have been revised to 74mm and 92.8mm, respectively, (from the near square 73mm and 71.5mm of the previous unit). For better thermal efficiency, its compression ratio is rather high at 13.0:1 (versus the older unit’s 11:1), and it has an electric water pump that lowers the direct load on the engine. Also included isa high porosity catalyst and a Lambda sensor to keep a check on emissions. Engine is refined by 3-cylinder standards; it’s tuned for drivability. Maruti hasn’t opted for a mild-hybrid system with this engine, which is available in international markets; however, it retains the automatic stop-start system to save fuel and help with emissions targets. The three-cylinder unit comes to life with a bit of a shake. In comparison, the older four-cylinder unit was completely vibration-free. You will feel some tremble at idle, particularly in the front seats. But these vibrations smoothen on the move, and things get better from thereon. The Z12E’s 82hp and 112Nm of torque are modest, and are 8hp and 1Nm lower than the outgoing petrol the Swift, but Maruti has tuned this engine with a clear focus on drivability. Throttle responses feel crisp and it takes off in a reasonably peppy manner. Power delivery is very smooth and till 3,000rpm, there’s more than enough performance to potter around town and even keep up with highway traffic. Hence, a majority of owners will find no reason to complain. Driving enthusiasts, on the other hand, who enjoy spinning the motor harder, will yearn for quicker progress in the mid-range and at higher revs. There’s a mild spike in performance beyond 5,000 revs, but the revs max out at 6,000rpm (300rpm lower than before), which feels restrictive. A full-sized underbody engine cover is a welcome addition. Its gearing is very similar to the outgoing (K12M) – the final drive ratio, and the first three gear ratios are identical, but its fourth and fifth gears are taller than before to keep the revs lower (than before) at cruising speeds to reduce fuel consumption. The 5-speed manual gearbox has been re-engineered with this generation, and the result is that in terms of smoothness as well as shift quality and precision, this unit is the best in the market. Complementing this manual is a new hydraulic clutch, which feels less snappy than before and extremely light to use. We put it through our performance tests and learnt that in terms of outright acceleration, this new Swift has taken a step backward. In manual guise, it sprints to 100kph from a standstill in 13 seconds, which not only makes it over a second slower than the outgoing car but interestingly, it is also slower than the Gen 1 2005 version. However, this new three-cylinder redeems itself in terms of rolling acceleration times, which are similar, and in some cases, even better than all its previous generations, making it the most drivable Swift till date. On the other hand, its clutch-free, 5-speed automated manual transmission or AMT demonstrates how this technology has evolved. At moderate pace, shifts are mostly smooth and the pause between them is minimal. And even though this transmission upshifts to the highest possible gear at the earliest, in the interest of fuel efficiency, it is reactive to accelerator inputs and won’t hesitate to downshift two or three gears, if needed. Further, there’s a tiptronic or manual mode, wherein it will not upshift automatically and give you full control over the transmission; it will downshift automatically if the engine speeds fall too low to prevent the engine from stalling. Auto engine stop-start reduces fuel consumption while idling. However, a sporty hatch like the Swift deserves a better auto gearbox. It’s fine in everyday stop-go traffic, but the engine-gearbox calibration should be smoother. Spirited drivers, in particular, will be left disappointed, as the AMT truly makes the Swift feel underpowered. Under hard acceleration, the pause between the AMT shifts is more pronounced, and from a standstill, it takes nearly 3 seconds more than a manual Swift to hit 100kph. Does the Swift live up to Maruti’s claimed fuel efficiency of 24.8kpl for the manual and 25.75kpl for the AMT? In our city cycle, the manual version achieved 14kpl, while the AMT achieved 12.7kpl. Its stop-start system performed smoothly and turned off the engine while halted, in order to save fuel. On the highway, the manual returned 19kpl, and the AMT managed a similar 19.1kpl. The engine spun at 2,600rpm while cruising at 100kph in top gear, which is 100rpm lower than its predecessor. While these efficiency numbers aren’t close to Maruti’s claimed figures, these are impressive by segment standards. Also, its overall average is higher than the K-Series Swift’s, which for reference, were 12.6kpl/19.3kpl for the manual and 11.4kpl/18.6kpl for the AMT for city/highway cycles, respectively.   The Swift features a larger diameter front stabiliser bar, and with some smaller tweaks, the fourth-gen’s steering feel as well as cornering abilities have been elevated. What’s nice is that its steering is smooth and fluid but also feels reasonably precise, much more than the third-gen’s lifeless unit. It certainly gives you better control while zipping in and out of traffic or driving in a spirited manner on a winding road. Furthermore, its returnability (unaided return to original position after a turn) is very natural. However, it doesn’t steer or handle as precisely as the first-gen. It is comfy at low speeds, but bumps come through at higher speeds. That said, with its wheels stretched to the extreme corners of the car, mechanical grip is impressive and body roll is well in check. It rides on the firmer side, but smoothens bumps and potholes nicely at low speeds. On the flipside, sharp movements do come through quite sharply at highway speeds. At 163mm (unladen), ground clearance is adequate and it deals with the worst our roads have to throw at it. Braking, too, is confidence-inspiring, and in our panic braking tests from 80kph, it performs similarly to the outgoing version. Maruti’s familiar 9-inch touchscreen has been carried over. It is easy to use and responsive to touch. Further, it is equipped with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, which takes the user experience a couple of notches higher. A dedicated bar with shortcut keys makes accessing various menus quite easy. It gets four speakers and two tweeters, and even though the sound is tuned by ARKAMYS, its quality isn’t as good as a similarly priced Tata Altroz. Lastly, it packs in several SIM-based connectivity features, which can be accessed via the Suzuki Connect mobile application.   This new Swift is a practical, well-equipped and fuel-efficient hatch. Its handling is more fun and engaging than its predecessor and thus, the new Swift moves closer to the ethos of the first-generation car. It’s a pity the engine leans more towards efficiency than performance, which is what a car like the Swift deserves. What could be a bigger deterrent, though, is the price of its top variants, which are simply too close to the more premium, comfier and better-equipped Baleno. But don’t write off the new Swift just yet. Its new Z12E petrol engine is very fuel-efficient and owners will particularly appreciate its light controls and overall user-friendliness. The AMT is the nicest by class standards, and the 5-speed manual is among the best gearboxes out there. And true to its character, its aesthetics, both inside and out, are youthful and sporty, easily making it the most charming Maruti hatchback on sale.",

    "description": "The auto industry loves surprises and Mercedes-Benz just delivered a big one. Barely a month after launching the Maybach EQS SUV – a model many assumed would be their last foray into the ultra-high-end EV market – Mercedes dropped another bombshell with the EQS SUV 580 4Matic. No leaks, no teasers, no spy shots – just the sudden debut of what is now the flagship Mercedes electric SUV. But the real shocker wasn’t just the surprise launch, it was the price. At just Rs 1.41 crore, it’s not only a massive Rs 84 lakh cheaper than the Maybach EQS SUV but also just a mere Rs 2 lakh more than the smaller EQE SUV, making the EQS SUV an unexpected value offering in the luxury EV space. How has Mercedes managed to price the EQS SUV so competitively? The answer lies in local assembly. By assembling the EQS SUV 580 in India, Mercedes benefits from significantly lower customs duties, and they’ve passed those savings on to the customers. In contrast, the EQE SUV is an import, so it's subject to steep taxes. This raises a tricky question: what happens to the EQE SUV, which sits a segment below but is priced nearly the same as its larger sibling? Mercedes has been forced to offer discounts to the tune of Rs 25 lakh on the EQE SUV to give it a fighting chance, and it remains to be seen how long Mercedes will offer it here as it's now overshadowed by the EQS SUV that's bigger and better value. Slippery shape, flush door handles contribute to 0.26 drag coefficient. Quite frankly, the EQE SUV could end up as collateral damage in what is a high-stakes EV game for Mercedes-Benz. The German luxury brand has struggled to sell the EQS sedan, which seems like a step too far into the electric world. Mercedes got it wrong with the sedan by going too extreme with the design, which prioritises aerodynamics to a fault. The low slung, radical shape that compromises ground clearance and the all-important rear-seat comfort seems to have alienated traditional Merc buyers. It has also steered some of them to the BMW i7, which offers a more traditional car experience. But can Mercedes lure back sedan customers with its new all-electric luxury SUV line-up? The strategy appears to be a pincer movement, with the ultra-luxurious Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV at the top and the standard EQS SUV below, squeezing the BMW i7 (priced at Rs 1.95 crore) from both ends of the luxury EV spectrum. The Maybach EQS is possibly the most luxurious EV you can buy in India today, but the regular EQS SUV also has enough to pamper the uber rich. It also comes with a three-row, 7-seater configuration just like its ICE counterpart, the GLS. 10-degree rear-axle steering gives this 5.1-metre-long SUV incredible manoeuvrability.   Mercedes EQS SUV exterior, design However, the EQS SUV 580 doesn’t look like the GLS and bears a striking resemblance to the EQE SUV. It’s got the same smooth and rounded shape, and the relatively short clamshell bonnet, which, like in the EQS sedan, can only be opened at a service station. It’s a bit of a dead space as there’s no frunk. One look at the EQS SUV’s silhouette tells you that aerodynamic efficiency was the main priority, one reason why the side mirrors are mounted on the doors. Though the EQS SUV is not as imposing as the GLS, it’s got the requisite road presence thanks to its sheer size. This is a 5.1-metre-long SUV, suitably propped up by 275/45 R21 tyres sitting on multi-spoke 21-inch alloys – anything smaller would have looked lost in this SUV’s gargantuan sides. Another standout feature is the blanked-off grille that's finished in gloss black with small, precision-cut three-pointed stars scattered across the surface. 275/45 tyres and 21-inch alloys suit its massive size. The EQS SUV clearly looks a segment higher than the EQE SUV. The grille is bigger and so are the lights, which now get three LED Daytime Running Light elements instead of two. Also, the EQS SUV gets framed windows instead of the frameless design seen on the EQE SUV. The sides are smooth and uncluttered with flush door handles, which contribute to its incredibly low drag coefficient of 0.26. An illuminated metallic side step, which stretches under the doors catches your eye and serves to highlight the ultra-long 3,210mm wheelbase. Things are more understated around the rear, with a complex LED light design and a chrome bumper insert adding a touch of flair. Mercedes EQS SUV interior, features The EQS SUV’s cabin is a familiar place thanks to the 56-inch Hyperscreen which is a signature feature in high-end EQ models. This vast black glass panel, which stretches from pillar to pillar and houses three separate screens, is still the benchmark for digital displays combing functionality and aesthetics like no other system. As always, the infotainment screen’s high-res graphics are sharp and easy to operate thanks to the large icons that sit on a very logically thought out menu. Whilst there are no buttons for the aircon controls, you get permanent digital controls that sit at the bottom of the screen and are quite easy to operate. A 'hot stone' massage function is among the highlights of the front seats. You sit nice and high in the infinitely adjustable driver’s seat for a bird’s eye view of the road, and if you’re in the mood, you can treat yourself to a ‘hot stone’ massage – one of the seat's myriad functions. The head-up display is absolutely brilliant with virtual, high-resolution images in full colour projected on the windscreen directly in your field of vision. Interior quality, as expected, is top-class and befitting of a luxury Merc. You enter a superbly crafted cabin that is a mix of metal, wood and leather finish, and high-grade plastics. It’s feature packed too. You get connected car tech with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a fabulous 15-speaker Burmester 3D sound system, and a suite of safety kit that includes 9 airbags and Level 2 ADAS. For a car this big, the 360-degree camera is particularly useful. And given the polluted cities we live in, so is the air purifier. So why would you want the massive sunroof that’s standard on the India-spec car? Just because it’s there! There’s lots of storage space, especially in the centre console area which is free with no transmission tunnel intruding the space. The glove box, too, is huge and there are more USB charging ports (all type-C) than it can fit passengers. Infotainment screens are crisp and clear at all times. So all perfect then? Not quite. The touch sensitive or rather insensitive steering-mounted controls are still annoying to operate and are a pet peeve in this latest generation of Mercs. But that may not bother most EQS SUV owners because they'd be spending more time at the rear than behind the wheel. This brings us to the all important back seat, or the middle row in the case of the three-row EQS SUV. Can it deliver the level of comfort a typical Merc owner wants? The seats themselves are pretty comfy with generous cushioning all around, especially in the lower back and under-thigh areas. The large 122kWh battery that sits under the floor doesn’t really intrude into the cabin and push up your feet, so the seating position is spot on. You also get a good view outside through the large windows. And if you’re bored of the view outside, you get a pair of 11.9-inch rear screens that come with noise-cancelling headphones. Rear passengers can control infotainment and seat functions via a detachable 7-inch tablet in the central armrest. Rear-seat experience far better than EQS sedan; backrest reclines 30 degrees. The rear seat reclines by 30 degrees, but we would have liked it if it reclined more. The rear seats get heating and not cooling, which is quite pointless in our climate. Like in the EQS sedan, the EQS SUV doesn’t come with electric side window blinds and Mercedes has given a rather tacky alternative by providing a pair of loose blinds that have to be manually fixed onto the side windows. Compared to the EQS sedan, the EQS SUV has a far more comfortable back seat with no shortage of headroom; travelling three abreast is also made easier by the flat floor. A nice touch, though, is a pair of loose pillows that you get as standard – particularly useful for the occasional middle passenger who has a folded armrest jutting into his back, and hence, would welcome some extra cushioning. But how does the EQS SUV compare with the S-Class? It's short on legroom and can’t quite match the rear-seat comfort of the legendary long-wheelbase sedan. For that level of comfort, you’ll have to save up for the Maybach EQS SUV that has the most luxurious back seat of any EV. Access to the third row is via a button that's conveniently located at the top edge of the middle seat and moves forward electrically. The seat doesn’t tumble forward, so you have to wiggle past the backrest to slide into the back. The third row is best for kids, but you could squeeze in a couple of adults for short trips. The third row is best left for children. Most owners keep the third row folded down to maximise the boot space. You can dramatically increase the luggage-carrying capacity by folding the middle row down, and even this can be done electrically via buttons in the boot. Also impressive is the luggage space with the third row in place, which is good for a couple of overnight bags. Boot space is 880 litres with the third row down and 217 litres with it up.   Mercedes EQS SUV performance, ride, handling Driving out of the cobbled stoned courtyard of the Taj Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad and onto tarmac, the first thing that strikes me is how astonishingly quiet the EQS SUV is. Refinement in the Mercedes EQS SUV is truly world-class, setting it apart from most EVs in the market. The cabin is a haven of tranquility where road, tyre and wind noise are sealed off. There’s no motor whine at all and even the air suspension makes no sound. The air suspension, paired with adaptive dampers, work brilliantly and the EQS SUV glides over bad roads with a suppleness that other electric SUVs would struggle to match. The suspension is calibrated to be on the softer side, so in the softest Comfort mode the big and heavy EQS SUV tends to gently heave up and down on an uneven road. Switching to Sport mode firms things up nicely without making the ride unduly harsh. Even in the stiffest of settings, the suspension nicely rounds of sharp edges and it's only big ruts that thump through. There are no ground clearance issues either, and to play it safe, you’ve got an extra 25mm. Even with the suspension in its firmest setting, ride quality does not become harsh. Belting down the Ring Road in Hyderabad felt rock steady, like nothing could shake it from its intended path. The long wheelbase and low centre of gravity, and the effect of a heavy battery low down in the floor give the EQS SUV unflappable poise. This is truly an incredibly effortless car to drive and you can go on all day without any stress, except when the battery runs out. Speaking of which, you can charge the battery from 10 to 80 percent SOC in 31 minutes on a 200kW charger. Max range is a certified 809km, which should equate to a stress-free 600km in the real world. You can feel the size of the EQS SUV on narrow roads, but this massive SUV is a breeze to handle once you judge the extremities. The rear-axle steering, which turns the rear wheels up to 10 degrees, gives it a shot of agility and you’ll be shocked at how easy it is to manoeuvre and park this behemoth. It doesn’t feel heavy or ponderous in the least, and it's hard to believe that the EQS SUV 580 weighs over 2.8 tonnes! 544hp and 858Nm helps this 2.8-tonne SUV sprint from 0-100kph in a claimed 4.7s. And who would have thought that an SUV this heavy could accelerate to 100kph from rest in 4.7 seconds. That’s as quick, if not faster, than many high-performance combustion SUVs from storied brands. Armed with two permanent synchronous motors (one for each axle) developing a combined 544hp, the EQS SUV has no shortage of power. Floor the accelerator pedal and you’re pinned into your seat by the instant unleashing of 858Nm. You don’t overtake cars but rocket past them. You don’t realise how fast you are going, and the way the EQS SUV swiftly and silently builds up speed is surreal. But, at the end of the day, this is a chauffeur-driven car. Although owners will likely get behind the wheel for some electrifying weekend soirees, for the most part, there will be a chauffeur whose job will be to feed in power gently. So its Comfort mode for him all the way, because the last thing he would want is his boss’ head thrown back into the soft head rest with a sudden burst of acceleration. Mercedes EQS SUV price and verdict The EQS SUV 580 is a better and a much more practical alternative to EQS sedan. It addresses the two main weaknesses of Mercedes’ flagship electric sedan – poor ground clearance and a compromised back seat. The high-riding SUV is happy on any surface, and overall comfort is several notches above the sedan. It’s an easy-to-live with daily driver that's a fantastic highway car for the weekend, and is backed by best-in-class range. And to top it off, at Rs 1.41 crore, it's an absolute bargain. What’s not to like? It’s still not an S-Class and traditional owners may still want something that’s not so futuristic and is still a sedan. Thanks to local assembly, the EQS SUV is priced at a competitive Rs 1.41 crore, ex-showroom.

    "description": "The month of October 2024 has two major festivals, Dushera and Diwali. In order to cash-in on new buyers, Honda is offering attractive discounts and benefits on its entire lineup including the City, Elevate and Amaze. Benefits can be had in the form of cash discounts, accessories, exchange and loyalty bonuses as well as corporate schemes. Let's take a closer look.  Disclaimer: Discounts vary from city to city and are subject to the availability of stock. Please check with your local dealer for the exact amount. Honda Amaze: Rs 1.12 lakh off The Amaze gets discounts of up to Rs 1.12 lakh on the top-spec VX and special Elite edition trims while the mid-spec S trim gets up to Rs 96,000 off. The base E trim gets benefits of up to Rs 86,000. The Amaze’s USP is a spacious cabin and a refined 1.2-litre petrol engine mated to either petrol or CVT automatic. Honda’s entry level sedan will see a full model change in the coming months. It faces stiff competition from the Dzire, which is also due for a generation update in November.  Honda City: Rs 1.14 lakh off The Honda City gets benefits of up to Rs 1.14 lakh which is the same as last month. There are multiple discount slabs on the car depending on variant. Dealer sources say unsold units of the City that don’t get the 3-point seatbelt for the rear center occupant are being sold with considerably higher discounts, depending on the inventory. The City gets a 121hp, 1.5-litre petrol engine paired to either a 6-speed manual or a CVT automatic. Meanwhile, the City hybrid gets discounts of around 75,000, with additional accessories worth Rs 20,000. Honda Elevate: Rs 75,000 off Honda’s Elevate SUV has been a steady seller, but sales are still much lower than segment leaders like the Creta and Grand Vitara. Honda has also introduced the Elevate Apex Edition in order to provide more value to the customer. Standard versions of the SUV are being offered with discounts of around Rs 75,000. We are told there are more benefits being offered at some outlets, depending on the stock. The Elevate comes with the same 121hp, naturally aspirated 1.5-litre petrol engine as the City, mated to either a manual or a CVT. Also See: 20 cars with over Rs 1 lakh discount this festive season",

    "description": "Yamaha has teased the upcoming launch of the all-new R9, a faired version of the existing MT-09 that will share the same engine. Will be the new flagship superport by brand Will likely share the same engine as MT-09 Yamaha R9 details The MT-09 is powered by a 888cc, liquid-cooled, three-cylinder motor that produces a peak output of 119hp at 10,000rpm and 93Nm at 7,000rpm. The upcoming R9 will likely get the same motor, but its state-of-tune and output figures remain to be seen. Currently, the MT-09 is offered in three variants: standard, Y-AMT, and SP. We recently had the opportunity to fly to Japan to ride the MT-09 Y-AMT, along with its other variants. The R9 will also likely get the same 6-speed gearbox as the standard variant. In terms of design, the teaser video showcases the R9 with a headlamp, which shares a style similar to the current Yamaha R7. It will be interesting to see if Yamaha plans to launch a high-spec R9M version, similar to what it did with the R1. While brand has shared its intentions to introduce its premium line-up to India, it remains to be seen if and when it will bring the R9 to India.

    "description": "Kia has launched the all-new fourth-gen Carnival with prices starting from Rs 63.90 lakh (ex-showroom, India). This latest MPV is available in a single fully-loaded Limousine trim that's powered by a sole diesel engine and, at least initially, is only available as a 7-seater. The Korean company has also announced prices for its flagship EV, the EV9, today. New Carnival comes to India as a CBU initially  It gets a 2+2+3 seating configuration Is powered by 193hp, 2.2-litre diesel engine  2024 Kia Carnival price, rivals As the all-new Carnival has been brought to India as a CBU import, its asking price is significantly higher than that of its now-discontinued predecessor. However, Kia plans to locally assemble the MPV at a later date, which should bring its price down substantially. At that point, the Carnival may be seen as a slightly more expensive alternative to the top-spec Toyota Innova Hycross, currently priced at Rs 30.98 lakh, ex-showroom, Delhi. 2024 Kia Carnival interior, exterior highlights As we reported when bookings opened on September 16 for Rs 2 lakh, the model being brought to India is the facelift of the fourth-generation Carnival, which has been on sale in international markets since November last year. It gets a boxier and sharper design compared to its predecessor and features Kia’s ‘Tiger Nose’ grille, flanked by vertically stacked LED headlamps with L-shaped LED DRLs, as well as 18-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels. The L-motif continues at the rear, with the tail-lights being connected by an LED light bar. The Carnival for India gets two exterior colour options – Glacier White Pearl and Fusion Black – and two dual-tone theme interior options – Navy and Misty Gray, and Tuscan and Umber. The cabin gets a 2+2+3 seating layout, with second-row captain seats with heating and ventilation, along with adjustable leg support. 2024 Kia Carnival features The Carnival is available in a single, fully-loaded variant that gets dual 12.3-inch curved displays, a 4-spoke steering wheel, dual electric sunroofs, three-zone climate control, a 11-inch head-up display, a 12-speaker Bose sound system, a 12-way powered driver’s seat and wireless charging pads. The HVAC controls are a mix of haptic touch surfaces and physical dials. The real talking point, however, has to be the powered second-row captain chairs with heating, ventilation and extendable leg support. It also comes with a powered tailgate and powered sliding rear doors. Safety features include 8 airbags, rear disc brakes, ESC, Hill Assist Control, a tyre pressure monitor, front, rear and side parking sensors, 360-degree camera and an ADAS Level 2 suite. The ADAS features include Lane Keep Assist, Lane Departure Warning, Front Collision Warning and Avoidance Assist, High Beam Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control, and more. 2024 Kia Carnival powertrain Like its predecessor, the new Carnival gets a sole 2.2-litre diesel engine. In this model, the unit makes 193hp and 441Nm of peak torque and comes paired with an 8-speed torque converter automatic gearbox that sends power to the front wheels. Kia is also offering three years of free mainenance, warranty and road side assistance with the new Carnival. Kia says it has already amassed 2,796 bookings for the all-new MPV.  Also see: Kia Carens EV spied in India ahead of 2025 launch Kia Sonet sales hit 4.5 lakh mark in four years Kia lines up entry-level, high-end halo EVs",

    "description": "A month ahead of EICMA, Kawasaki has revealed the new Ninja 1100 and Versys 1100 models. Both bikes use a larger motor, but styling is nearly identical to the previous 1000 models.  Power is up on the Versys but lower on the Ninja, compared to 1000 Ninja gets top-spec SE variant for the first time USB-C charger standard on both, design nearly unchanged The big change on both bikes is the new liquid-cooled, 1,099cc, inline-four engine that makes 136hp on the Ninja and 135hp on the Versys, both at 9,000rpm. Compared to the earlier 1000 models, that’s a small 4hp decrease for the Ninja but a massive 15hp gain for the Versys. Both models make 113Nm of torque at 7,000rpm – a marginal 2Nm gain for the Ninja but a substantial 11Nm improvement for the Versys.  There have also been some changes to the gearing, with the 5th and 6th gears made longer for lower engine rpm while cruising. The Versys and Ninja now have the same final drive gearing with 15/42 setups (front/rear sprockets). This makes the final gearing taller on the Versys but shorter on the Ninja.  Both bikes now come with a USB-C charger near the left-hand switch cube. The usual raft of electronic rider aids, like riding modes, traction control, cruise control and dual-channel ABS, is expected to continue onto the 1100s.    For the first time on the Ninja, you get an up-spec SE variant. In typical SE variant fashion, the Ninja gets an Ohlins shock and Brembo M4.32 calipers, brake discs and master cylinder. The Versys gets S, SE and SE LT variants internationally, over and above the standard variant, but India has always gotten the base variant.  It remains to be seen if Kawasaki India brings in the higher-spec variants of the Ninja and Versys to India. Traditionally, higher variants are offered only for the models that come here as CBUs (like the Z H2 and Ninja H2 SX), not the CKD models (like the Z900 and ZX-10R). We shall see if Kawasaki India amends this policy when these bikes launch here sometime in 2025. These bikes have seen a minor price increase in international markets, and we expect a similar move when the Ninja and Versys 1100 launch here.   Also See: 2020 Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX review, test ride BMW F 900 XR Pro vs Kawasaki Versys 1000 comparison",

    "description": "Skoda recently unveiled its newest electric SUV, the Elroq, at Prague in the Czech Republic. The new electric SUV that will sit below the Enyaq previews the new design direction for the brand and the split headlamp setup.  Updates to the existing Skoda line-up to also get new logo Skoda India dealership network will also be updated Interestingly, the Elroq does away with the Skoda arrow logo at the front, rear and the steering boss and instead carries the Skoda lettermark logo. And it's likely that the upcoming Kylaq will have the same treatment.  At the sidelines of the event, in response to a question from Autocar India about the Kylaq carrying the lettermark logo, Oliver Stefani, head of Skoda design, alluded to this, saying, “I cannot say anything about that now, adding, “This is the new design direction for the brand and our new products as well as updates of the existing line-up, when they happen, will all be updated accordingly.”  The new lettermark logo also ushers in a new corporate identity that will be carried across the brand’s communication as well as the entire dealer network. By the time the Kylaq arrives, which is early next year, the entire Skoda dealership network will be updated to the new look.

    "description": "BYD is rumoured to be in talks with Indian conglomerates Reliance Group and Adani to build a local manufacturing portfolio. Rajeev Chauhan, head of Electric Passenger Vehicles (EPV) Business at BYD India told our sister publication Autocar Professional in a recent interaction that \"BYD is keen to start full-scale manufacturing. Until that is finalised, we will continue offering our global products to Indian consumers.\" BYD looking to start local production from 2025 New Creta EV-rivalling SUV and plug-in hybrids also on cards Local manufacturing, however, will not start before 2025. Until then, the company will focus on expanding its product portfolio and building brand awareness. Currently, BYD operates a small assembly base in Tamil Nadu but relies heavily on completely built imports due to homologation challenges. The company was also fined $9 million by the Department of Revenue Intelligence in 2023 after failing to meet the conditions required for lower tax rates on imported car parts. Imports have led to BYD India's volumes being low, with the company selling over 2,300 units in 2023 and 2,000 units until September 2024. Chauhan remains optimistic and expects a 40 percent growth in sales by the year-end with an aim to reach 10,000 units annually within the next two years. BYD also plans to expand its product portfolio and increase its dealership network from 27 to 47 outlets next year, with a focus on entering tier II cities while maintaining a presence in major cities. BYD future model portfolio Having launched the Seal sedan earlier this year, BYD India has strategically added products to its portfolio, including a smaller battery version of the Atto 3 SUV, which has brought down its starting price. The company will introduce the eMax 7, a 7-seater MPV based on the existing E6, later this month. \"We are focusing on tapping into the MPV segment, which has doubled to almost 10 percent of the market in recent years. There is no MPV EV alternative yet, and we aim to capitalise on that. This expanded portfolio should help us grow from 5,000 cars to 10,000 or 15,000 vehicles in the coming years, laying a strong foundation for future growth,\" Chauhan added. BYD India is also planning to introduce a new Creta-EV rivalling SUV that will be positioned under Rs 20 lakh, as well as new plug-in hybrid models. Read more on that here.

    "description": "The next-gen Hyundai Venue has been spotted for the first time in South Korea. This compact SUV will make its global debut sometime next year and has been internally codenamed QU2i, Autocar India can confirm. New Hyundai Venue will be built at Talegaon plant Will get all-new design, more tech and features. Production to start by late 2025 New Hyundai Venue: what do the spy shots reveal? While not much is known about the new Venue’s platform, the spy shots confirm that the top hat will be completely new. Hyundai is likely to retain the boxy look of the current Venue, while incorporating design elements similar to its newer or freshly updated models, such as the Creta and Alcazar. The new Venue will get a split headlamp setup that looks similar to the ones on the currrent Creta. The bumper looks taller, and the grille looks wider with new rectangular design elements. Also, parking sensors and a module for the ADAS suite are visible at the front, which could be standard on higher variants. The side profile isn’t clearly visible in these spy shots, but we can expect a wheelbase similar to the current Venue. Overall length will continue to be under 4 meters due to regulations providing additional benefits for vehicles of this size. Although not much can be seen at the rear, Hyundai seems to have retained an upright tailgate with new horizontal tail-lamps and new LED detailing that will likely be connected via a light bar. Inside, it will have a completely redesigned dashboard, with many components likely to be shared with other Hyundai models, such as the screens, the steering wheel, seats, and some switchgear. Hyundai is also likely to keep the game up with advanced ADAS technology, better quality materials, bigger screens, and additional comfort features. One could expect a panoramic sunroof on offer as well. New Hyundai Venue: powertrain, launch timeline We don’t anticipate major changes to the powertrains; the 1.0-litre turbo petrol, 1.2-litre naturally aspirated petrol, and 1.5-litre diesel engines are expected to continue until new emission norms come into effect sometime in 2027. The prototype seen in these spy shots is likely made at Hyundai's Chennai plant for internal testing and calibration purposes. As we reported earlier, the new Venue will be among the first models to be mass-produced at the brand's new Talegaon plant in Maharashtra, with series production set to begin by late 2025. Hyundai plans to bring another all-new SUV that will sit above the Alcazar, also produced at the Talegon plant. Read more on that here.

    "description": "Skoda has globally unveiled the all-new Elroq electric SUV, debuting the brand’s ‘Modern Solid’ design language. It is Skoda’s first EV in the midsize SUV space that’s positioned between the flagship Enyaq iV and the upcoming Epiq compact EV due in 2025. It has already gone on sale in Europe, and while there's no confirmation on an India launch, Skoda India says it is under consideration. Elroq has an electric range of over 560km It is an electric alternative to the ICE-powered Karoq Could come to India in 2025 Skoda Elroq exterior design The Modern Solid design language was first previewed in the Vision 7S concept in 2022, and the most defining element about the design is what Skoda calls the ‘Tech-Deck Face’. The familiar Skoda butterfly grille is gone, and in its place is a new black panel that spans the width of the face and features four segmented LED daytime running lamp elements at either edge. The main headlamps are positioned on the bumper, and the vertical air vents dropping down the headlamp cluster is a neat design touch. The front bumper also gets thick plastic cladding, a faux silver skid plate, and even features active cooling vents that automatically shut to reduce air resistance. The Elroq’s profile, in typical Skoda fashion, is characterised by clean lines and smooth surfaces, a large glass house and stylish multi-spoke wheels. At the rear, it looks very much like a shrunken Enyaq with similarly-shaped tail-lamps and ‘SKODA’ lettering across the tailgate, and a robust-looking dual-tone bumper. Skoda claims the clean surfaces on the Elroq has helped it achieve a drag co-efficient of just 0.26. The Elroq is also the first model to completely make do without the traditional Skoda logo. Instead, it gets ‘SKODA’ lettering on the bonnet, the tailgate and even on the steering wheel. Skoda Elroq interior and features Inside, again like the Enyaq, it gets a winged design for the dashboard. It even uses the same 13-inch central infotainment screen with the AC vents positioned below. There's a neat stack of physical buttons that serve as shortcuts for features like ADAS, drive modes, climate controls and other functions. Then there’s the aforementioned new steering wheel and a sleek digital instrument cluster just behind it. The centre console is also pretty similar to the Enyaq with a lever for the drive selector, and a couple of cupholders. Being a born EV, there are many smart in-cabin storage compartments offering up to 48-litres of space; the boot capacity is 470 litres. What’s interesting is that the Elroq uses sustainable materials for several interior trims – the upholstery is made from recycled PET bottles, there’s use of nylon sourced from fishing nets and even recycled polyester.   Skoda Elroq platform, powertrain and range The Elroq is underpinned by the Volkswagen Group’s MEB architecture, which is also used by the Audi Q4 and Volkswagen ID 3, among others. Here, it has been stretched to 4.49 metres, making it slightly larger than the ICE-powered Karoq (4.39 metres) but significantly smaller than the Enyaq (4.65 metres). There are three battery and powertrains on offer for now, labelled 50, 60 and 85. The entry-level 50 gets a 52kWh battery pack and a 170hp rear-mounted motor, yielding a claimed range of more than 370km on the WLTP cycle. The 60 version gets a 59kWh battery and 204hp, and has a range of more than 385km. The range-topping 85 variant gets a significantly larger 77kWh battery and 285hp, with more than 560km of range. Skoda claims 0-100kph comes up in 6.6 seconds (85 version) and it has a top-speed of 180kph. The 50 and 60 can both be charged at speeds of up to 145kW, going from 10-80 percent in 25 minutes, and the bigger 85 pack can take 175kW, completing the same recharge in 28 minutes. The 85 variant can also be had in AWD guise with an additional motor on the front axle, although it will be made available only in 2025. Skoda Elroq India launch details As already mentioned, Skoda India is considering bringing the Elroq here, and if launched, it will find itself in the company of the Tata Curvv EV, upcoming Hyundai Creta EV and Maruti eVX, among others. Skoda says it has achieved price parity for the Elroq with the ICE-powered Karoq in Europe, and if localised in India, it could be positioned competitively here as well. Before that, Skoda will be bringing the flagship Enyaq iV as a full import, and is also working on the new Kylaq compact SUV.   Also See: Updated Citroen Aircross SUV launched at Rs 8.49 lakh Hyundai Creta EV interior seen in production form",

    "description": "KTM will return to the famed EICMA motorcycle show for the first time in five years and it is coming in all guns blazing. The Austrian marque has a long range of new models waiting in the wings, and the ones important for the Indian audience are the next-gen 390 Adventure R, 390 Enduro R and the 390 SMC R. The big-bike portfolio is also set to be overhauled and expanded with new models based on the 990 as well as the big-bore 1390 platforms. 390 Adventure, Enduro, SMC R to use new 399cc motor from Duke New 990, 1390 models will also be showcased  KTM's AMT gearbox to break cover KTM’s small-bore off-road-oriented models have been testing for quite a while in India now and we finally have confirmation on what models are coming. This time around, there are three bikes – 390 Adventure R, 390 Enduro R and 390 SMC R. The first is a traditional ADV, the second is a road-legal dualsport with 21/18-inch spoke wheels and the third model will be a supermoto with minimal bodywork, resembling the Enduro. Also See: Production-spec KTM 390 Enduro spotted testing in India These new bikes will use the same 399cc single-cylinder motor from the Gen 3 390 Duke, rated for 46hp and 39Nm. To suit the different intended purpose of the Adventure and Enduro models, Bajaj will likely use different mapping and gearing, but the SMC R’s engine and drivetrain could be largely similar to the Duke.  Also See: 2025 KTM 390 Adventure spotted again, could launch this year Coming to the big bikes, the 990 parallel-twin platform will soon expand with the 990 Duke R and the 990 RC R models. The 990 Duke R will essentially be a souped-up 990 Duke, with higher-specification brakes and suspension, in typical KTM fashion. Meanwhile, the 990 RC R will be KTM’s first foray into the large-capacity sportbike world in nearly a decade. To read more about the KTM 990 RC R, tap here. Then we have the flagship 1390 models – 1390 Super Duke GT, 1390 Super Adventure S, 1390 Super Adventure S EVO and the 1390 Super Adventure R. All these bikes will use the engine from the 1390 Super Duke R as the starting point but the chassis will see revisions to suit each model’s character and intended usage. KTM is set to debut a new 8.8-inch TFT display (one of the largest in the two-wheeler realm) with ‘vastly improved UX and UI’ on all these models. Last but certainly not least, we have KTM’s new AMT gearbox that will break cover at EICMA. Of late, many motorcycle manufacturers have been coming up with their own versions of an automatic gearbox, which eliminates the need to have a physical clutch and gear lever, and KTM is the latest to join the bandwagon. Details of this new gearbox are scarce but we did sample Yamaha’s AMT gearbox on the new MT-09 and you can read all about it here.",

Meanwhile, the Astra Electric hatchback has been discounted by up to £3865, with the Ultimate trim falling to £39,385. The middle-rung Design and GS versions have been reduced by £2850 and £2905 respectively, while Griffin remains priced from £34,995. Similarly, the Corsa Electric’s starting price is unchanged, at £26,895 – making it one of the UK’s cheapest electric cars – but the more costly grades have received big reductions. Design and GS are £3400 and £2850 cheaper respectively, while range-topping Ultimate has been reduced by £4150. The cuts come shortly after Vauxhall announced that the new Frontera SUV would be priced identically in petrol and electric form, from £23,495. In April, it also reduced the starting price of the Mokka Electric by £7115 to £29,495. Vauxhall managing director James Taylor recently told Autocar that “optics” were a key issue in the battle to boost electric car sales. Referring to the public reaction surrounding the top-rung Corsa’s previous price of £38,585, he said: “One of the challenges we have all faced with electric vehicles is that you end up with a comparison between a [74bhp] base-spec car and a [154bhp] long-range [EV].  “It’s a bit like back in the day when you would have Design as the entry to the range and a [sporting] VXR with 150bhp, but you wouldn’t expect those two things to be the same price. “But obviously in the optics of how people compare and contrast, it does make electric look very expensive. And that’s why we launched the Yes special edition [EV at £26,840].” Meanwhile, Ford of Britain managing director Lisa Brankin has called for VAT on electric cars to be halved because “we are not seeing customer demand for EVs”. Brankin added: “We need incentives to drive demand in the consumer market.”",

    "title": "UK fuel prices falling as oil drops in value",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/uk-fuel-prices",
    "description": "Petrol dropped by an average of 6.47p per litre during September, according to the RAC Fuel prices fell by 6.5p last month and are set to continue on a downward trajectory, according to the RAC. Petrol cost 134.79p per litre on average at the end of September, down from 141.26ppl at the start of the month. This means that filling up a car with a 55-litre fuel tank is now £3.56 less expensive than it was at the start of September. Diesel, meanwhile, fell from 146.00ppl to 139.5ppl over the same period, meaning a 55-litre fill-up is now £3.58 cheaper. The RAC attributed the reduction to the drop in the price of a barrel of crude oil, from $78 (£59) at the start of September to $72 (£54) by the end. It added that wholesale prices for petrol and diesel currently stand at 99ppl and 103ppl respectively, indicating that retail prices may fall even further. “With analysts predicting oil may continue to fall on the back of a weakened global economy and Saudi Arabia upping its output to regain lost market share, the immediate future on the UK’s forecourts looks considerably brighter for drivers,” said Simon Williams, the RAC’s head of policy. What determines the price of fuel? The price of petrol and diesel you buy at the pump is largely determined by the wholesale price of Brent crude oil.  However, fluctuations in the price of this can take weeks to filter through to the forecourts. The price of crude oil has gone up nearly $12 per barrel since the start of July 2023 to around $96 in October and now fallen to around $78. The long-term cost of petrol In July 2023, a major report from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that drivers paid on average 6p per litre (ppl) more for fuel in 2022 as supermarkets took advantage of weakened competition and inflated pump prices. CMA chief Sarah Cardell, who said supermarkets were usually the cheapest place to buy fuel and market anchors, said the rising of prices would have had “a greater impact on vulnerable people, particularly those in areas with less choice of fuel stations.” The report found the rise was instigated by Asda  – which was also fined £60,000 for not co-operating fully with the CMA investigation – and Morrisons, the two cheapest fuel sellers, which last year each made the decision to target higher margins.  Asda’s fuel margin target in 2023 was more than three times what it had been for 2019, while Morrisons doubled its margin target in the same period.  Other retailers, including Sainsbury’s and Tesco, didn't respond “in the way you would expect in a competitive market” and “instead raised their prices in line with these changes”, the CMA found. “Taken together, this indicates that competition has weakened and reinforces the need for action,” the report added. Diesel prices were also slow to drop in 2023, partially down to Asda ‘feathering’ its prices (reducing them more slowly as wholesale prices fell) and other firms not responding competitively to that.  The CMA estimated that drivers have paid 13ppl more for diesel from January 2023 to the end of May 2023 than if margins had been at their historic average. “Competition at the pump is not working as well as it should be, and something needs to change swiftly to address this,” said Cardell. As such, the CMA recommended a \"fuel finder scheme\" to give drivers access to live, station-by-station fuel prices on their phones or sat-navs. This would “help revitalise competition in the retail road fuel market.” Cardell added: “We need to reignite competition among fuel retailers. This [scheme] would end the need to drive round and look at the prices displayed on the forecourt and would ideally enable live price data on sat-navs and map apps.” The CMA also recommended bringing in a new monitoring body to “hold [the] industry to account.” On this, the RAC's Williams said: “The fact that drivers appear to have lost out to the tune of nearly £1 billion as a result of increased retailer margins on fuel is nothing short of astounding in a cost of living crisis and confirms what we’ve been saying for many years: that supermarkets haven’t been treating drivers fairly at the pumps. “It’s all about action now, and we very much hope the government follows through with both of the CMA’s recommendations.  “While forcing retailers to publish pump prices is a positive step for drivers, what’s of far more significance is the creation of a fuel-monitor function within government which, we very much hope, actively monitors wholesale prices to ensure forecourts don’t overcharge when the cost they pay to buy fuel drops.  “Without this, we fear drivers will continue to get a raw deal.\"",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-hot-hatches",
    "description": "There are no hitches with our top 10 hot hatches – but which pocket rocket claims the number one spot? Hot hatches are the Goldilocks performance cars – they're fast, mischievously good fun, whole-heartedly practical and some are even quite affordable. What is not to like? The best hot hatches come from a recipe that has been around for decades: take an otherwise ordinary hatchback, up the performance and upgrade its powertrain and chassis technologies.  Some car makers even hand them over to their own in-house performance sub-brands to work their magic. Think Mercedes-AMG, Hyundai N, Toyota's Gazoo Racing and Ford Performance. Hot hatchbacks are equally capable of zipping through city streets or tackling winding roads, offering exhilarating driving experiences without sacrificing everyday usability.  The first hot hatches originated in Germany, France, Italy and Japan. Even South Korea has been getting involved in recent years.  You should make the most of them while you still can. Increasingly strict emissions regulations mean hot hatches are no longer the overtly affordable performance machines they once were.  Although internal combustion still rules the roost, there’s a definite sense that these petrol-engined machines are the last of the breed. One car on our list is actually electric.  But which should you choose? We think the Toyota GR Yaris is the best hot hatch money can buy today, offering stunning cross-country pace, engaging handling and compact proportions.  Read on for our full top ten list of the best hot hatches on sale today. Whether you're after speed, style, or versatility, these cars have it all.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/citroen-unveil-radical-new-concept-car-paris-motor-show",
    "description": "New concept will sit \"in a major segment\" First look at brand’s future will be shown alongside revised C4 hatchback and new C3 Aircross crossover Citroën will provide a first look at its future when it unveils an all-new concept car at the upcoming Paris motor show. The French brand said the show car will sit “in a major segment”, suggesting that it's most likely a B- or C-segment hatchback or SUV – although Citroën has yet to provide further detail.  It added that the facelifted Citroën C4 hatchback and C4 X saloon will be shown alongside the new concept. As previously reported by Autocar, the duo will receive new lighting signatures and more squared-off bumpers, inspired by the Oli concept that was shown two years ago. It’s possible that the unveiling of the facelifted C4 alongside the new concept is no mere coincidence: it's due for replacement around 2026 or 2027, which would also fit the traditional timeline of taking a concept through to production.  Alternatively, it may be a radical model inspired by the Ami quadricycle. Although Citroën hasn't officially hinted at any such plans, CEO Thierry Koskas previously told Autocar that “we are going to extend the Ami line-up and do many changes”. “We will reveal everything in the Paris motor show,” he added. The new Citroën C3 Aircross will also make its public debut at the show. The crossover is based on the same Stellantis Smart Car platform as the new C3 supermini but has been stretched to 4390mm long to fit a small third row of seats. It’s set to become one of the UK’s cheapest seven-seaters when it arrives next year.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/value-brand-leapmotor-not-aiming-steal-vauxhall-citro%C3%ABn-sales",
    "description": "New T03 is Leapmotor's £16k rival to the Dacia Spring Stellantis-backed Chinese firm to \"complement\" its sibling brands with a range of affordable EVs New Stellantis brand Leapmotor International won’t cannibalise sales from Citroën, Fiat, Peugeot and Vauxhall, but rather “present new opportunities for cross-shopping”, its CEO said, despite it having broadly similar brand values. “We consider Leapmotor as complementary to the 14 brands we have in the family, for a number of reasons,” Tianshu Xin said. “Number one, Leapmotor is a pure-EV brand and hailing from China. Number two, it's complementary to what the Stellantis group has [in terms of technology]. Number three, how we position the brand in the family is different. “For customers who are technology-savvy, maybe younger customers who enjoy technology, there are a lot of other functions. It’s like operating a mobile phone: you have so many functions. Different customers have different preferences from that perspective.” Stellantis has invested €1.5 billion (£1.2bn) into the Leapmotor International firm that it has jointly formed with nascent Chinese EV maker Leapmotor, and it’s now leveraging its vast global operations to launch the brand across Europe, Oceania, South-East Asia, India, South America, the Middle East and North Africa, with the expectation that it will increase its sales to 250,000 this year and 500,000 in 2030. “State-of-the-art technologies and the rapid growth that Leapmotor has been able to achieve in the past several years, plus its strong in-house vertical R\u0026D capabilities and quality, are why we chose Leapmotor to build up this strategic alliance,” Xin said. Key among this technology is Leapmotor’s ‘cell-to-chassis’ construction method, which, it claims, improves an EV’s battery layout, leaves more space for passengers and increases torsional rigidity (to the benefit of ride and handling), all while reducing production costs – and which, Xin said, could possibly be synergised with other Stellantis brands in the future. The former PSA executive confirmed that Leapmotor International will launch three more EVs in Europe (including the UK by 2028), after the already-launched Leapmotor T03 city car and C10 family SUV: the B10 compact crossover, which is due to be presented at the Paris motor show, and then what are believed to be an E-segment SUV and a C-segment hatchback. It also “has a plan” for bringing its extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) technology here, Xin told Autocar, citing huge demand from potential customers for an EV with a “1000km [620-mile] range”. An EREV version of the C10 is already on sale in China with a 1.5-litre petrol engine and a 739-mile range on the Chinese test cycle – a powertrain shared with the C11 SUV and C01 saloon. While the C10 is made at a Leapmotor factory in China and therefore in line to be hit with an 21% import tariff into the EU, the much cheaper T03 is built at Stellantis’s factory in Poland, on the former Fiat 500 production line, apparently for a similar price to the Chinese-market version. Xin denied that building the T03 within the EU was purely an insurance policy against any future tariffs, saying: “If you look at our target audience, the customer is very price-sensitive. So by localising production, one of the biggest chunks you save is on transportation costs. \"All the decisions made are not just based on one factor but based on a holistic business case assessment. And the end game is to provide a mobility solution to customers around the globe.”",

    "title": "Peugeot e-408 arrives as Polestar 2 rival with 281-mile range",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/peugeot-e-408-arrives-polestar-2-rival-281-mile-range",
    "description": "New electric version of saloon-cum-crossover will hit UK roads early next year Peugeot has revealed the e-408, an electric variant of its saloon-cum-crossover that will take on the Tesla Model 3 and Polestar 2. Its addition means every car available to order in Peugeot’s UK line-up now offers a choice of petrol, hybrid and electric powertrains. Although closely related to the Peugeot e-308, which uses the same modular EMP2 platform, the larger e-408 adopts a slightly different powertrain, notably drawing power from a larger 58.2kWh (usable) NMC battery pack – unique within the Stellantis group. The bigger battery could be accommodated as engineers “had more room to play with” within the fastback’s longer wheelbase, explained Peugeot product director Jérôme Micheron. The rakish 408's slippery design, which achieves a drag coefficient of 0.28 (on par with the 2 and only just beaten by the class-leading Model 3), helps the EV to achieve a range of 281 miles, with 4.6mpkWh efficiency. The battery can accommodate charging speeds of up to 120kW. Despite the 408 being able to accomodate it, Peugeot isn’t offering the e-408 with the 98kWh battery that has just been launched in the Peugeot e-3008 and Peugeot e-5008, offering up to 422 miles of range. Asked why, Micheron said: \"When we looked at the competition of the e-408, we saw we were the right position when it came to range and efficiency. The average daily C-segment customer drives 45km [28 miles] a day.” The new Peugeot’s Polestar and Tesla rivals are both offered in 'Long Range' forms, with ranges of 408 and 390 miles respectively.  The e-408 is fitted with the same synchronous electric motor as the e-3008, which deploys 207bhp and 245lb ft of torque. Official acceleration figures have yet to be released, but it's expected to outpace the 154bhp e-308’s 9.8sec 0-62mph sprint time. The e-408 is nearly indistinguishable from its ICE siblings, with only the additional 'e' badge at the rear marking it out. This is because “we wanted to protect the design and its attractiveness\", said Micheron. The same is true inside, the e-408 having the same i-Cockpit (small steering wheel and raised 10in instrument panel) as the ICE 408, along with a 10in infotainment screen, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and a separate i-Toggle shortcut touchscreen. The e-408 will make its first public appearance at the Paris motor show later this month. UK orders will be taken from 5 November and deliveries are due begin early next year.  Pricing has yet to be confirmed for the UK, but in Europe it will start at €43,900 (£36,602) in Allure trim and top out at €45,900 (£38,259) in GT trim. Given that the e-408 will top the 408 range, it's expected to start here at above the PHEV's £43,420.",

    "description": "Peugeot's urban sophisticate crossover draws on mild-hybrid petrol engine as an alternative to the electric e-3008 The third-generation Peugeot 3008 feels like telling statement of upwardly mobile intent from its manufacturer, already having impressed us for its style, quality and sophistication - and as a near-£50,000 all-eiectric e-3008 at that. Which bodes well for the rest of this review: because, having already proved that such exotic prices aren't, at least in some ways, out of its reach, we now turn to the more affordable derivatives.The regular combustion-engined versions of this car (which do without the e- prefixes of their zero-emissions siblings) carry the kind of prices you might find easier to stomach of a mid-sized French car. There is a plug-in hybrid due for introduction to the UK market shortly, available from a little over £40,000; and a mild hybrid, which we're dealing with here, that can be secured for less than £35k.The mild hybrid is powered by Peugeot’s familiar three-cylinder, 1.2-litre turbo petrol engine with an electric motor integrated within a six-speed 'e-DSC6' dual-clutch automatic gearbox. It's pretty modestly powerful compared with its rangemates, at 134bhp; but for retail buyers who like the idea of a compact SUV that's well-priced, real-world economical and easy to use, it might have even more appeal than its more hyped and widely electrified equivalents.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/skoda-extends-small-combustion-car-lifespans-ev-slowdown",
    "description": "Electric Octavia estate is pushed back by up to two years as brand refocuses on combustion models Skoda has delayed a crucial new electric car and extended the lifespan of its small combustion-engined models in response to waning demand for EVs across Europe. The Czech brand had previously planned to launch six electric cars over the next two years: the new Elroq and Epiq crossovers, the production version of the Vision 7S concept, a 4.7m-long estate and facelifts for the Enyaq and Enyaq Coupé. However, it has now decided to delay the estate – all but confirmed to inherit the Octavia name – until late 2027 or 2028. Skoda CEO Klaus Zellmer told Autocar: “To be totally honest, with the slowdown of the transformation into battery-electric vehicles, we’re revisiting that [timeline]. “We're checking the sequence of those cars. The cadence now is we’ve had the Enyaq Coupé, the Elroq, the next one is the Epiq, and the next one down the line will be the SUV, the 7S you’ve seen the concept car of. After that – it could be 2027, 2028 – we’re aiming for an Octavia estate.” Meanwhile, the petrol-powered Fabia supermini, Kamiq crossover and Scala hatchback have been given a stay of execution until 2030.  Zellmer said: “Originally, we said that we were going to phase out the Fabia, Kamiq and the Scala by 2027, but we have now green-lighted those cars to stay with us until the end of the decade, because the [EV sales] slowdown is happening as we speak.” According to figures from European car industry body ACEA, electric cars’ share of the region’s new car market (including the European Free Trade Association and the UK) fell from 15.1% between January and August 2023 to 14.0% over the same period this year. “We have always said that we would cater to what consumers want and not what we think is the right method of transport or drivetrain,” Zellmer said. “We always said we're going to try and be as flexible as possible.” Zellmer attributed the shortfall in electric car sales to various factors, including failings in the charging infrastructure, range anxiety, the cost of electricity and the significantly higher price of EVs. Indeed, Skoda marketing boss Martin Jahn conceded that the company is sacrificing its profit margin on the new Elroq to ensure it is priced at a level to attract strong sales – and therefore allow Skoda to meet its CO2 emissions targets for 2025. “I admit that this is not the most profitable car in our line-up, and we just have to work on the costs, especially on the battery costs, to make the electric cars more profitable in the future,” said Jahn.  Zellmer also pointed to the lack of variety in bodystyles as a barrier to growing EV sales. He said: “I’ve always said people always buy cars for the least probable cause they need them for. So they buy a combi [estate] because they were at one point in time at Ikea, they had to put this huge box of a wardrobe in the car, so now they need a combi again.  “[Like] with range anxiety, this is totally emotional – it's not rational. Who exceeds a range of 350 miles on a regular basis? And even if you do, you do one charging stop in between, get the car down to 30%, charge it back to 60%, it takes you 15 or less minutes and off you go. It's not a problem. “It's changing the habits, but people still find it difficult to change their behaviour towards battery-electric vehicles so we need to give people time to be ready for that, and this is why we offer alternatives.”",

    "title": "New 2025 Audi Q5 now on sale from £49,950",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-2025-audi-q5-now-sale-%C2%A349950",
    "description": "Next generation of Audi's best seller will bridge the gap to it going fully electric in 2033 The new, third-gen Audi Q5 will cost almost twice as much as the Mk1 did at launch in 2008, when first examples hit the road next April. Orders have opened for Audi's revamped best-seller, which starts from £49,950 for a 2.0-litre turbo mild-hybrid petrol four that sends 201bhp and 251lb ft through the front wheels, and £51,600 for a diesel with match capacity and power; the original car started at around £27k.  Opt for the V6-powered SQ5, which has swapped diesel for petrol and outputs 362bhp – an increase of 20bhp, and that pushes you into Porsche Macan territory, with prices starting at £74,400. Unlike the new A5 saloon and A5 Avant estate, the third-generation Audi Q5 won’t be offered with a pure combustion engine. Two plug-in hybrids, with 295bhp and 362bhp plus electric-only ranges of around 50 miles, will follow next year.  The SUV, which made up 17% (334,480) of Audi’s total global sales last year, will be used to anchor the brand as it shifts away from combustion engines and into electric cars. Audi’s renewed investment in hybrid powertrains is because the transition to electric cars is taking longer than had initially been expected. It still plans to phase out ICE cars in eight years, though, meaning this Mk3 will be the last non-electric Q5. It has committed to offering a hybrid option in each segment until then. “We recognised early on that plug-in hybrids were a relevant project technology, and now we see that the bridge is longer than we initially thought,” said Audi CEO Gernot Döllner. Premium Platform Combustion (PPC) that underpins the Q5. Its electrical architecture represents a significant upgrade – a complete wiring overhaul and now using five on-board computers – on the old Q5’s MLB Evo platform. That gives Audi more flexibility to offer hybrids with different configurations and opens the door to key future upgrades. It’s understood, for example, that the PPC can support range-extender powertrains yet can also accommodate a V8 engine, hinting at the future of the larger Q7 and the prospect of a new RS model. Audi says the new platform also brings improvements to both ride comfort and handling. The new Q5 is fitted with steel springs and passive dampers as standard, while air suspension is available as an option. As well as the technical overhaul, the Q5 features a noticeably more modern interior. It follows the A5 and the Q6 in adopting Audi’s new ‘Digital Stage’ set-up: a free-standing OLED panel that comprises an 11.9in digital instrument display and a 14.5in infotainment touchscreen. A 10.9in touchscreen for the front passenger is optional. UK pricing has yet to be announced, but the first cars are scheduled to land in showrooms in March. In mainland Europe, the entry-level petrol car is €52,300 (£44,300) and the diesel is €57,100 (£48,400), while the SQ5 is €82,900 (£70,200). New Audi Q5 Sportback imminent A coupé-roofed Sportback version of the new Q5 will arrive shortly after the regular SUV. Prototypes with plug-in hybrid powertrains have now been spotted testing in Germany, suggesting the new engine and body options could arrive at the same time. Expect slightly better fuel economy and improved electric-only range in exchange for reduced boot space and a modest rise in price.",

    "title": "Caterham Project V sports car to be powered by Yamaha",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/caterham-project-v-sports-car-be-powered-yamaha",
    "description": "Caterham Project V is due to enter production in 2026 The first Project V prototype will be driving next year, with an ultra-power-dense Yamaha motor on the rear axle Caterham's new Porsche 718 Cayman rival has edged closer to reality with the announcement that Yamaha will develop its electric powertrain - and the first prototype will be running in less than a year. Caterham has today confirmed that the world's third-biggest motorbike manufacturer will equip the sub-£80k Project V sports coupé with a \"cutting edge e-axle\" and provide \"its technology and expertise in vehicle motion control\".  Just over a year after the Project V concept was revealed at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, Caterham is \"moving to the next phase of its development\", en route to putting a final product in showrooms in the coming years.  Details of its Yamaha powertrain have yet to be confirmed, but the concept was said to have a single motor giving 268bhp to the rear wheels for a sub-4.5sec 0-62mph time.  Yamaha is already developing motors for cars and describes them as \"featuring industry-leading output density\", courtesy of highly efficient conductors and learnings \"garnered through our engine development efforts to date\".  Notably, it has already installed a quartet of its 'Hyper EV' motors producing 268bhp apiece (matching the Project V concept) in Subaru's wild 1058bhp STI E-RA racer, which is targeting a Nürburgring lap time of just 6min 40sec. Yamaha also recently signed up as a technical partner to the new Lola Formula E team, which will make its debut in the 11th season of the electric single-seater championship from December. Caterham CEO Bob Laishley told Autocar that the decision to collaborate on the Project V was as much Yamaha's as it was his own: \"As you can imagine, global companies like Yamaha do not make decisions without detailed discussion and consideration, our discussions with them for Project V have been maturing for quite a while. We are very honoured to be working with them and it is great news for the Caterham brand that we can make this announcement today. \"In terms of why Yamaha as opposed to other options, they have a long-proven record of supporting OEMs with technology and, through their two-wheel business, clearly understand the need for weight optimisation. In the end, the decision was a mutual one from both sides, rather than us specifically choosing them in a traditional supplier selection.\" The Japanese giant has never put a road car into production itself, but in 2015 it revealed a compact sports car concept designed in partnership with Gordon Murray.  Dubbed the Sports Ride, this relatively realistic proposal for a lightweight two-seater was remarkably similar in size, shape and positioning to the Project V – although had it entered production, it would have used a tiny turbocharged petrol engine.  Before that, in the early 1990s, Yamaha also built a small number of fully functioning prototypes of an outlandish V12-engined supercar called the OX99-11, which was designed effectively as a road-going Formula 1 car.  Neither car ever reached showrooms, but no doubt Yamaha can still draw from learnings around their packaging, construction and engineering as it develops the drivetrain for the Project V. Laishley said Caterham's brief for the Project V's development \"remains the same as always: lightweight, simple and fun-to-drive\".  Caterham has also confirmed that Japanese engineering outfit Tokyo R\u0026D will build the first prototype, which is due to be completed by mid-2025, though Laishley suggests the car may not launch as early as 2026, as was originally planned.  \"I don't want to speculate on the final start-of-production [date] but 2026 will be a challenge,\" he told Autocar.   Tokyo R\u0026D has previously been involved with the development of various experimental prototypes, test mules and concepts for Japanese manufacturers. It also produced its own compact two-seat sports car, the Honda-engined Vemac RD200, from 2004 to 2008. Caterham has given no indication that its partnering with two Japanese companies on the Project V programme means the car will be built in Japan. The Japanese-owned British company has previously confirmed that it won't build the Project V alongside the Seven in its Dartford factory and is in talks with a range of potential candidates to build the car on a contract basis. Laishley has told Autocar that there is still \"no decision on the manufacturing location yet\".",

We share all the key details on the inbound EV.  Skoda is kicking off a new era with the unveiling of the Elroq, a bold-looking electric crossover that’s poised to steal sales from some of the market’s best-selling EVs. We detail Skoda’s new electric car. We also share news on JLR’s continuing parts supply woes and how LPG appears to be on the decline as pumps close.  Reviews Maranello has refined the recipe for its V12-powered, front-engined GT flagship, but is the new 12Cilindri a fitting successor to the wild 812 Superfast? Matt Prior finds out. The next-generation Bentley Continental GT Speed has arrived with a new plug-in hybrid powertrain that makes 771bhp and 778lb ft of torque. Steve Cropley takes it for a drive in Switzerland.  Also in the first drives section: the new Subaru Forester, Cupra Terramar, Mazda CX-80 and Leapmotor T03. We also road test the radical new Audi Q6 E-tron SUV (#5696) and the luxurious Mercedes-AMG S-Class saloon (5697).  Features Do you pick the desirable brand-new car or the even more alluring yet risky used one for the same price? It’s a quandary no pub argument has ever resolved but our man James Disdale has the answers Jack Harrison explains why the Petersen Museum in Los Angeles is one of the best automotive attractions for petrolheads.   Opinion Matt Prior dives into the burgeoning world of electric in-wheel motors, and questions how people will refer to Ferrari’s new flagship V12 GT given its quirky name.  Steve Cropley, meanwhile, heads to Switzerland to drive the new Bentley Continental Speed, and visits Lotus’s Piccadilly showroom for the unveiling of the Theory 1 concept.  Used The Fiat 500 has come to the end of the production line 17 years after it was introduced.

They called the 812 ‘Superfast’ because it was meant to be a GT with shades of hyper sports car.The existence today of the SF90 Stradale in the sporting area means that Ferrari has opted to relax its new coupé’s remit. The 12Cilindri is supposed to be a more rounded GT, which I don’t think is a bad thing. Depending on conditions, the 812 could feel hairy.",

    "description": "Range-topping '85' model offers range of up to 360 miles for £38,650 New electric SUV offers Ford Explorer and Kia Niro EV levels of space for Volvo EX30 money Skoda is kicking off a new era with the unveiling of the Elroq, a bold-looking electric crossover that’s poised to steal sales from some of the market’s most popular EVs. Available to order from 18 October, the Elroq undercuts its most prominent rivals – and many smaller alternatives – by a significant margin, with prices starting from £31,500. That’s £5825 cheaper than the Kia Niro EV, £14,375 less than the Ford Explorer and even £450 less than the smaller Smart #1. The Elroq is the first Skoda to adopt the brand’s latest Modern Solid design language. It is most obviously distinguished from older Skodas by the new Tech Deck face, comprising a prominent black bar that spans the width of the front end. It’s fitted with segmented LED daytime-running lights, while the main headlights are on the lower section of the front end. As well as bringing a new look to the Skoda range, the clean surfaces and sloping roofline introduced with Modern Solid also benefit aerodynamics. Working with a series of active elements – including a cooling flap in the front end that automatically shuts to reduce air resistance – they help the Elroq record a drag coefficient of just 0.26. The new crossover is underpinned by the Volkswagen Group’s MEB architecture, which is also used by the Audi Q4, Cupra Born and Volkswagen ID 3, among others. Here it has been stretched to 4.49m long, making the Elroq slightly larger than the combustion-engined Karoq (4.39m long) but significantly smaller than the Enyaq (4.65m). Three powertrains will be offered at launch, labelled 50, 60 and 85. The entry-level 50 gets a 52kWh battery pack and a 168bhp rear-mounted motor, yielding a range of more than 230 miles. The 60 version is boosted to 59kWh and 201bhp, and gives a range of more than 250 miles, while the 85 range-topper gets a significantly larger 77kWh battery and 282bhp, with more than 360 miles per charge. The 50 and 60 can both be charged at up to 145kW, going from 10-80% in 25 minutes, and the bigger 85 pack can take 175kW, completing the same recharge in 28 minutes. Inside, the Elroq takes clear inspiration from the Enyaq. The new model gets the same 13in infotainment touchscreen and physical button bar as its larger sibling, with shortcut buttons for the driver assistance systems, drive modes, climate controls and other functions. It majors on recycled materials: three-quarters of the entry-level Loft interior is upholstered in recycled PET, recovered from items such as drinks bottles. The more expensive Lodge trim is 75% made of Econyl – nylon sourced from fishing nets and waste carpets, which itself can be recycled without wastage – and the rest is recycled polyester.",

    "title": "Fiat 500e production pause extended due to sales slump",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/fiat-500e-production-pause-extended-due-sales-slump",
    "description": "Fiat is developing a new hybrid 500 and an upgraded electric 500 to boost output at Mirafiori \"Deep difficulties\" in European EV market mean the electric city car won't be built for four weeks Stellantis has extended the production pause of the Fiat 500e, due to continued low EV demand. Originally pencilled to last a month to October 13, the pause will now end on November 1. This slump in demand has left the European electric car market \"in deep trouble”, Stellantis told trade unions. The brand previously said the slump in sales is “linked to the deep difficulties experienced in the European [EV] market by all producers”. Fiat parent firm Stellantis said in a statement that the slump in sales is “linked to the deep difficulties experienced in the European [EV] market by all producers”. According to figures from Jato Dynamics, Fiat sold 74,885 examples of the 500 (in both petrol and electric forms) across Europe between January and the end of July, 24% fewer than it had over the same period last year. Meanwhile, EVs’ market share in Europe fell to 13.5%, down from 14.6% in July 2023. “The lack of clarity around the incentives for and future of EVs continues to present a barrier to consumers considering an EV,” Jato analyst Felipe Munoz said. “These factors, alongside the low residual value of EVs, contributed to the decline seen in July.” Slow sales of the 500e – as well as the impending end of sales of the old petrol 500, due to new cybersecurity regulations – have pushed Fiat to develop the new 500 Ibrida. Effectively the 500e retrofitted with a mild-hybrid petrol engine, it will serve as an all-important crutch for the Italian brand as it navigates the slower-than-expected transition to selling solely electric cars. Fiat CEO Olivier François recently told Autocar: “We obviously, like everyone else, thought that the world would go electric faster and the cost of electrification would go down faster. “But we couldn't imagine that Covid would happen, shortage of raw materials would happen [and] the European Society – not all, not the youngest part – would turn their backs on the sustainable solutions. \"But this is the reality. We have to face those realities.” As well as introducing the 500 Ibrida, Fiat is investing some €100 million (£84m) into developing a new battery for the 500e. Stellantis chief Carlos Tavares said this will \"significantly increase range of the 500e while significantly reducing the cost\".",

    "title": "Renault shows first images of reborn 4",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/renault-shows-first-images-reborn-4",
    "description": "Round lights and boxy lines from the 4Ever concept remain on the production car More versatile sibling of the new Renault 5 electric hatchback will be unveiled at the Paris motor show Renault has revealed the first images of the revived 4 ahead of its unveiling at the Paris motor show later this month. The teaser pictures confirm the electric crossover will keep much of the styling cues previewed on the 4Ever Trophy concept in 2022, including its striking light-up oblong grille and three-part tail-lights. The new images also confirm the 4 will be offered with an optional retractable fabric roof, and it will also be the first Renault to feature a backlit front emblem. Nods to its 1961 namesake include a roof-mounted mini spoiler, trapezoidal quarter rear windows, vertical overriders on the bumper and three lines sculpted along the door sills. This 4 follows the smaller and technically identical Renault 5, which was revealed in production guise at the Geneva motor show earlier this year with a design that remained faithful to the 5 concept of 2021. Renault has positioned the 4 as a taller and wider alternative to the 5, in the hopes of capturing a share of the ever-popular compact crossover market. At 4.14 metres long, it's a similar size to the Vauxhall Mokka. Late prototypes spotted testing on public roads (pictured below) show the production 4 also keeps the 4Ever Trophy concept’s boxy dimensions. Notably, the prototypes appear to represent the bookends of the 4 line-up. One is a basic hatchback riding on steel wheels, while the other is a higher-riding crossover fitted with alloys, roof rails and prominent U-shaped body cladding along its flanks. It’s possible that the more aggressive car is a special edition inspired by the 4Ever, which itself drew on the modified 4s that compete in the annual 4L Trophy rally. The 4 will share the Renault Group’s Ampr Small EV platform with the 5. The two EVs are even set to have the same 2.54m wheelbase. It's expected to offer the 5’s three single-motor, front-wheel-drive powertrains with outputs of 94bhp, 121bhp and 148bhp, as well as its 40kWh and 52kWh battery packs.  As previously reported by Autocar, however, the Ampr Small platform’s multi-link rear axle can accommodate a second motor, paving the way for a four-wheel-drive variant of the 4. Vittorio d’Arienzo, chief engineer of the Renault Group’s small EVs, told Autocar that the 4 would also be tuned to have a distinct character from the 5. It will trade a tad more body roll for a more compliant ride, he said, although the “funny French” wheel travel offered by the original 4 won’t be present.  Images of previous prototypes reveal that the 4’s interior will feature the same dual-screen infotainment set-up as the 5, but it’s likely to receive a different dashboard design, taking inspiration from its forebear. Production of the 4 is expected to start next summer at Renault’s ElectriCity hub in northern France, following the start of customer deliveries of the 5.  Thereafter, Renault will work on its next retro revival: the new Twingo, a sub-£17,000 EV due in 2026.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mercedes-amg-readies-game-changing-supercar-replace-sls-ev",
    "description": "New electric supercar is considered a key part of Mercedes-AMG's future Retro-inspired supercar will fly the flag for AMG's battery-powered future Mercedes-AMG is hatching plans for a spectacular electric supercar that will launch the performance brand into the EV age. The new performance halo model was previewed by last year’s retro-inspired Vision One-Eleven concept, and it is described as a “brand-defining successor to the SLS Electric Drive”, the 730bhp quad-motor EV that was launched in 2013 and which cost £333,000. But while that car was limited to just nine examples, the new AMG supercar is planned for significantly higher production numbers when it arrives later this decade. Making its flagship less of an exclusive offering is central to AMG’s evolving electrification strategy. It has already launched powered-up versions of the EQE, EQE SUV, EQS and EQS SUV, with specific motors and battery technology separate from those of their standard siblings. The new electric supercar is considered a key part of Mercedes-AMG’s future, despite CEO Michael Schiebe moving to extend the life of some of AMG’s more profitable combustion-engined models amid slower than expected sales of its EVs. However, Schiebe leaves little doubt about the company’s ultimate trajectory, telling Autocar: “It’s clear that we are going all-electric.” The new supercar will be charged with cementing AMG’s performance credentials as it switches from high-output combustion engines to electric power. Autocar understands it is likely to outpace the 1049bhp Mercedes-AMG One, whose Formula 1-derived, V6/electric hybrid set-up is good for 0-62mph in 2.9sec and 0-186mph in 15.6sec. Despite being tipped for higher production numbers than the SLS Electric Drive, the forthcoming supercar will be priced well above the new £160k AMG GT and is likely to take the brand into exclusive territory, competing with the Porsche Mission X and Alfa Romeo 33 supercars. The production version of the Vision One-Eleven – itself inspired by Mercedes’ experimental C111 supercars from the 1970s – is set to use the AMG.EA architecture, which has been engineered specifically for AMG’s electric models. The platform is modular in its design, with varying lengths, wheelbases and track widths making it suitable for a wide range of models. The upcoming production version of the Vision AMG – a four-door replacement for today’s GT 4-Door Coupé that is due to be revealed next year – will be the first new model to use it. Like that car, the new supercar will use an 800V electric architecture and a new cylindrical-cell lithium-ion battery featuring silicon-anode developments from US battery specialist Sila. Power will come from high-revving axial flux electric motors. To be used first in the electric GT 4-Door, they were originally developed by Yasa, before the British-based company was bought by Mercedes-Benz in 2021. Since then, the motors have been further advanced by a team of engineers from both Yasa and Mercedes-AMG. With a highly compact disc shape that allows them to be packaged in small spaces, they are roughly half the size and half the weight of the conventional synchronous and asynchronous electric motors employed by the AMG-fettled EVs currently on sale. Schiebe sees the axial-flux motor as a defining technical aspect of future electric AMG models, in the same way AMG’s various V8 petrol engines have been over the years. “Customers who came to the brand because of the V8 did not come because they just wanted to have a big engine,” said Schiebe. “They came because they loved the technology that we put into the car. So when it comes to electric driving, I’m pretty sure they will jump into that new technology because it will be the latest and greatest that you can get.” Yasa’s axial-flux electric motors have already featured in the plug-in hybrid systems in the 986bhp Ferrari SF90 Stradale and the 1479bhp-plus Koenigsegg Regera. Yasa officials have revealed that the patented electric motor to be used by AMG offers more than twice the power of Yasa’s existing electric motors on a power-to-weight basis: up to 489bhp and 590lb ft, with a weight of just 24kg. They also revealed that a number of different drivetrain layouts have been developed, including a single- front and twin-motor rear set-up as well as a quad-motor arrangement with two front and two rear units. Depending on the layout, this confirms the next generation of electric AMG models will have a significant increase in power and performance over that of those models on sale today. Production of AMG’s axial-flux motors will take place at Mercedes’ Berlin-Marienfelde plant, starting next year. However, Schiebe said AMG will not abandon its ‘one man, one engine’ philosophy, adding: “This is part of our DNA. We will have something in the future which is comparable to ‘one man, one engine’, and it will not be just a marketing effort.”",

    "title": "Used BMW M5 2005-2010 review",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/m5-2005-2010",
    "description": "This was the last hot 5 Series to be powered by a normally aspirated engine – a manic 500bhp 5.0-litre V10 The E60-generation BMW M5 may well be a car that you buy for the engine and nothing else – and for good reason.The Formula 1-inspired, naturally aspirated 5.0-litre V10 makes an enormous 500bhp at a euphoric 7750rpm – a rev figure that might sound more likely for 1990s Honda Type R screamer than an 1830kg executive saloon (and indeed one that's often seen in black, looking more like a bank manager’s 520d than a supercar-scaring monster). This particular 5 Series isn't a car that you buy because of its ability to get to 62mph in 4.1sec – a frankly ridiculous figure for the time, but because of how it gets there. The intoxicating noise will encourage a heavy right foot and a delve into the iDrive system to find a route with more tunnels. The earliest cars are from 2005, and at £61,750 17 years ago, they came with almost all the bells and whistles possible: 19in alloy wheels (you can get those on a Volkswagen Golf these days...), head-up display and sat-nav, 11 shift modes for the SMG gearbox and even launch control. In 2007, the M5 was facelifted, and the easiest way to tell is by the LED running lights and tail-lights (but beware that some early cars have had them fitted retrospectively).These are probably the ones you want, thanks to the uprated gearbox with upgraded pumps and hardware. Also note that the facelift was released in batches, so there could very well be pre-facelift cars registered late into 2007.Alternatively, the easiest way to tell if the one you’re looking at is a facelifted car could be to look at the boot, as BMW didn't release the E61-generation M5 Touring until 2007. From the factory, the M5 was fitted with what at the time we called “The Gimmick of 2004”. When you initially start it, the ECU reverts to a 400bhp default setting, and to access all 500bhp, you must press a button marked ‘Power’ on the steering wheel.BMW said this was to “help in wet conditions”, but in practice it’s the ultimate show-off function for the delectation of your mates. Or children. Or dog.Because, of course, the M5 Touring has 500 litres of boot space to match its 500bhp and, in this guise, is one of only two such cars ever fitted with a 10-cylinder engine (the C6-generation Audi RS6 Avant is the other). Only 222 right-hand drive M5 Tourings were made over just three years.Sure, there's now a new M5 Touring to make this one seem less exclusive, but if you’re not bowled over by the asking price (likely to be over £100,000), this one can be had from around £30,000.You may need another £30k for repair bills, because the high-revving V10 has plenty of documented issues. But generally speaking, if you avoid buying a car that has been run on a tight budget, you should end up with something more dependable than you might think.Behind the wheel, the M5's balance and accessible performance helped to earn it a five-star Autocar road test verdict, and with the dampers set to soft, it has ample compliance to ride expansion joints pretty well.In line with the supple ride, the cabin exudes 2000s German super-exec in being almost completely bereft of anything overtly sporty.The only clues to the car’s potential are some strategically placed M badges, the shifters for the automated manual seven-speed SMG gearbox, body-hugging sports seats and a speedo that doesn’t stop until 200mph.Running costs are, as you can imagine for a F1-derived V10, astronomically hiigh. A gentle cruise yields around 22mpg, but push it hard and expect the read out to be no higher than 10mpg. The small fuel tank doesn't help matters. But this isn't a car you buy for economy. With regulations, taxation, small-capacity engines and electric motors strangling enthusiasts’ efforts to buy cars of this ilk, now is a perfect time to buy an a used M5, whether it's a saloon or an estate.",

    "title": "China's BYD plans to become \"European manufacturer\" in 2025",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-electric-vehicles/chinas-byd-plans-become-european-manufacturer-2025",
    "description": "Firm's new European advisor tells Autocar impacts from tariffs are \"temporary\" BYD describes the impact of EU tariffs on imported Chinese EVs as “temporary damage” and anticipates it will be the best-positioned Chinese brand in the coming years thanks to local production plans and a flexible powertrain offering. The brand, which has grown rapidly in Europe over the past two years, is due to open a new factory in Hungary by the end of next year, and another in Turkey soon after. These will allow it to build European market cars in Europe and avoid the substantial tariffs imposed on Chinese-manufactured cars by the EU. Speaking at the launch of the Seal U DM-i plug-in hybrid, the first PHEV to join BYD’s European and UK line-up, special European advisor Alfredo Altavilla told Autocar the brand was not happy with the tariffs but said plans were in motion to circumvent them. “This is going to be temporary damage for BYD,” he said. “In less than a year from now we will become officially a European manufacturer. “So if you ask me, are you happy with the tariffs? No, but the damage is going to be more limited for BYD than for other Chinese OEMs in terms of volume ambitions. BYD has been the most cooperative Chinese brand with the European Commission. We get the ‘benefit’ of a lower tariff compared with other Chinese OEMs.” BYD’s cooperation with the European Commission appears to have paid off, at least in the short term. Following the EU’s decision to raise the tariffs earlier this year, the firm currently pays 17.4% on imports on top of the basic 10% duty applied to all other Chinese brands. Geely, owner of Polestar, Volvo and Lotus, meanwhile, is required to stump up an extra 19.9%, while MG parent SAIC’s rate is a whopping 37.6%. BYD will be the first Chinese brand to open its own bespoke production facility in Europe. The move will help cement BYD as a ‘local’ company, a goal outlined to Autocar earlier this year by the company’s president, Stella Li. “Of course, the factories will have a big impact,” said Altavilla. “This is not just for the tariffs.” He added the move will also help BYD move “much faster” to integrate “European needs and European tastes” into the next generation of its cars.",

    "description": "Subaru's Forester enters its sixth generation with this revised model that'll go on UK sale in spring 2025. The Subaru Forester enters its sixth generation next spring with this revised model, mostly picking up where the old one will leave off once current stocks run dry. As we write in October 2024, you can still get into a current Forester, but they won't last forever.Buyers, and there are lots of them who buy Forester upon Forester, like the “safety, durability and capability” of the current car and its predecessors, Subaru says. Those are “rather unsexy” characteristics and owners are “not exactly young”, it admits, but the cars are nothing if not dependable. Of the 1.6 million Subaru has sold in America in the past 10 years, Subaru says 1.5 million are still on the road.This new model, then, aims to deliver the same, but better: a relatively rugged crossover that rivals the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V, while being one of the most dependable and durable cars on sale.",

    "description": "New, more potent V8 hybrid powertrain adds efficiency and performance; new air suspension brings extra poise More than anything, the new Bentley Continental GT Speed represents a bold extension of the Crewe company’s abiding philosophy. For the past 40 years, ever since the high-performing Turbo R single-handedly revived a moribund Bentley marque, the firm has specialised in offering cars that seem far too refined and luxurious for their supercar performance. Or viewed another way, cars that seem too practical for their exalted position in the automotive firmament.These capabilities were especially well expressed in the groundbreaking Continental GT of 2003, a car whose dynamics at the time easily equalled those of far less usable front-engined Astons and Ferraris. They were further emphasised when the third-generation 2019 GT adopted the Volkswagen Group's MSB platform (shared with Porsche), which enabled bigger wheels and brakes, lots of extra technology and a reduced front overhang for even better weight distribution.Now it’s time for the fourth-generation car, officially called Continental GT Speed, to widen this virtuous spectrum even further. Central to the new offering is a brand-new plug-in hybrid powertrain, comprising a new 584bhp 4.0-litre V8 engine and a 187bhp electric motor that’s buried inside the engine’s eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox. The car also gets an even more ideal weight distribution, and a new system of two-mode air springs and dual-valve dampers that bring extra versatility to the three main driving modes (Sport, Comfort and Bentley).",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/alpine-confirms-plans-supercar-%E2%80%93-and-it-expected-be-ev",
    "description": "Hydrogen-powered Alpenglow hypercar concept could give clues to future supercar Car will be developed at new EV R\u0026D base, named Hypertech Alpine French car maker Alpine has confirmed plans to launch a supercar – and it is expected to be an EV. The car is currently being referred to as the Future Alpine Supercar. The brand has not released any further details, except that the car will be developed at a new state-of-the-art research and development centre that will open later this year. This R\u0026D base, named Hypertech Alpine and located at the Viry-Châtillon Formula 1 engine facility to the south of Paris, will focus on work into future EV technologies.  This includes the development of the brand’s sports car batteries to be used by the likes of the upcoming A110 EV, as well as next-generation ultra-high density cells to be used in future solid-state packs. The latter will be tested in “extreme operating conditions for supercar-type applications”, said Alpine. Next-generation and ultra-efficient electric motors will also be developed with Ampere, Renault’s new EV and software arm.  This suggests the new supercar will be electrically powered, and used to showcase Alpine’s future EV tech, rather than a production version of the brand’s Alpenglow concept, which is powered by a hydrogen V6 powertrain. That low-slung, technologically advanced hypercar concept could, however, give clues to the design of the future supercar. Alpine design chief Antony Villain previously told Autocar the concept - an evolution of the Hy4 concept – was created with a production car \"in mind\".  The new hub will also bring the firm’s motorsport divisions  under one roof, including its WEC, Dakar, and F1 teams. Alpine confirmed that this meant engine development for the Alpine F1 team would cease at the site from the end of the 2025 season. The site has built F1 engines since Renault entered the sport in the 1970s. No replacement supplier has yet been announced. \"Creating this Hypertech Alpine centre is key to Alpine's development strategy and, more broadly, to the group's innovation strategy,” said Alpine CEO Philippe Krief. “It is a turning point in the history of the Viry-Châtillon site, which will ensure the continuity of a savoir-faire and the inclusion of its rare skills in the group's ambitious future while strengthening Alpine's position as an 'innovation garage'.  “Its racing DNA remains a cornerstone of the brand. It will continue to fuel an unprecedented industrial and automotive project, thanks particularly to Hypertech Alpine.”",

    "title": "Why Aston Martin has slashed 2024 sales target by 1000 cars",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-car-sales/why-aston-martin-has-slashed-2024-sales-target-1000-cars",
    "description": "Former Bentley boss Adrian Hallmark claimed 7000-car target would have required “near-perfect execution” New Aston Martin CEO Adrian Hallmark has made his first big impact on the company since joining on 1 September by reducing its ambitious sales forecast for 2024 by 1000 units. Aston Martin cited supply chain disruption, weak demand in China and excess stock in dealers for the downgrade. It also said it would no longer be cashflow-positive (a measure of profitability) in the second half of the year, another change in guidance. As recently as 28 July, the British company forecast a dramatic rise in wholesales (sales to dealers) for the second half of 2024, fuelled by a quick ramp-up of production of the new DB12, Vantage, new Vanquish and recently overhauled DBX SUV. The promised “high single-digit-percentage growth” in wholesales this year from the 2023 total of 6620 would have meant sales climbing past 7000 for the first time since 2007 – the only year in which Aston Martin has cleared that hurdle. However, Aston Martin, under the new leadership of former Bentley boss Hallmark, has now lowered that sales forecast to what effectively will be just over 6000 – back to 2021 levels and below last year’s figure of 6620 (the highest for 10 years). Hallmark said the original production and sales plan, formulated before he arrived, would have required “near-perfect execution”.  The previous plan to replace sales lost in the first half due to the model changeover had been criticised as overly ambitious by some industry observers. “The wholesale growth target looks like a major stretch,” opined specialist luxury car business publication SSO Report on the company’s first half results. Aston Martin had struggled to ramp up production of the DB12 last year, due to software integration problems, and is now facing serious supplier issues, according to Hallmark. It previously said it was only building the DB12 in the first half of this year as it cleared the decks for the new models. Aston Martin didn’t single out any supplier, but Hallmark referenced the shortage of automotive-grade aluminium following summer floods in Switzerland that has hit both JLR and Porsche. Aston Martin was also a customer of the now-insolvent Recaro, the seat supplier said. Currently a “double-digit percentage” of cars rolling off Aston Martin’s production lines in St Athan and Gaydon are lacking parts that need to be fitted at a later date, Hallmark told analysts on a call today. “It's not lost production, but we cannot cope with the volumes of rework at any given point in time,” he said. The new CEO said that he had costed the accelerated production schedule for the new models along with the attendant logistics and found it “significant”.   The plan now is to bring the new models up to speed more gradually. “We will ensure that we have a plan which allows us to flow smoothly, work on cost optimisation and on the quality processes to give ourselves a much more balanced business model,\" Hallmark said.  Aston Martin still intends to start production of the new Vanquish in 2024 as planned, however. “We will get good volumes of Vanquish going into the markets before the year end,” Hallmark said. He cautioned, however, not to expect “huge numbers” going to the US - traditionally Aston Martin’s largest market but down 40% in the first half of 2024. The company can expect an easier ride financially in 2025, Hallmark said, given the lack of “huge” model launch costs incurred this year and only “minor” launch activity. “If you normalise the expenses, then the potential is really clear,” he said. He also indicated that Aston Martin’s overall costs were too high. “I've already been looking in depth at the relative cost structures and earning potentials versus other benchmarks,” he said. “Let's just say there's room for growth.” Hallmark's decision to hit the brakes at Aston Martin recalls his early tenure as Bentley CEO in 2018. He immediately killed any idea of a Bentley sports car and reportedly axed development of a Bentley version of the Porsche Taycan and Audi E-tron GT. He also slowed down the rollout of the newest versions of the Continental GT and Flying Spur in order to more effectively adapt their sports-optimised Porsche Panamera platform to a more luxury level. At Aston Martin, Hallmark no longer answers to Volkswagen Group bosses. However, as it's a listed company, any downgrades in guidance are immediately felt in the share price on Monday, which dropped 22%.  Investors have been promised a growth story from majority owner Lawrence Stroll off the back of the model renewal, but global headwinds make it hard to return the loss-making company to consistent profitability.",

    "description": "Is this electric family SUV from a Stellantis-allied Chinese EV brand a no-brainer bargain or a case of 'you get what you pay for'? It might seem odd to you that a new car brand – one that has to define itself in the minds of would-be customers – should start with two products that could hardly be more different. However, it begins to make sense when you realise that as a cheap, small hatchback, the Leapmotor T03 is a type of car for which there is great demand yet decreasing supply; and the Leapmotor C10 is pitched straight at the world’s best-selling car, the Tesla Model Y family SUV. And it will make even more sense when the Stellantis-allied Chinese EV brand finishes fleshing out its range with five cars in five years as it seeks to become a major global player.Despite their similarities, the C10 is considerably cheaper than the Model Y: £36,500 for the Leapmotor and £44,990 for the Tesla. So, is it a no-brainer bargain or a classic case of ‘you get what you pay for’? Read on to find out…",

    "title": "Original or remaster? Electric MGB faces new Cyberster",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/original-or-remaster-electric-mgb-faces-new-cyberster",
    "description": "The Cyberster isn’t the first electric MG sports car – if you include B-derived electromods It's rare to be introduced to a car as the one “we didn’t want to make”. Abingdon-based MG specialist Frontline resisted the idea of an electric restomod for a long time before customer demand reached a level that was simply too hard to resist. Yet the resulting BEE GT feels like the culmination of a life’s vision, its aesthetic, detailing, fit and finish all being sublime and the whole thing exuding a coolness that I’ve never quite come across in a stock MGB. This prototype links a 40kWh battery to a 120bhp electric motor for a junior hot hatch level of performance and up to 140 miles of range in favourable conditions. Frontline now offers a slightly pricier 60kWh long-range model that hikes both the power and range figures past 200 (slicing the 0-62mph time to less than 7.0sec) and raises the charging speed from 7kW to 22kW – useful, as a full refuelling of this standard BEE GT takes around seven hours. The core of the donor B (either roadster or coupé) remains, with new components hooked up to enough of the original structure to avoid reregistration and thus a jarring Q numberplate. It looks every inch the car that went before, right down to its Type 2 charging port tucked neatly behind the old metal filler cap. Much of its electric equipment is stuffed where an engine once lived, but Frontline claims similar weight to its petrol projects and smarter weight distribution of 50:50 front to rear. Around 30kg of its mass is sound-deadening to counteract the hubbub that would usually be drowned out by internal combustion. Most curious of all is what sprouts from the middle of the car: a glistening wooden knob that links you to a five-speed manual gearbox beneath. Slot it into third and you can operate the BEE GT via two pedals and a single speed like it’s any other EV, but you would be missing the point. The taut ceramic clutch isn’t used to pull away or come to a halt, but you do need it during gearchanges. So you select first, release the handbrake and feed in the throttle as the muscle memory in your resting left foot almost spasms. While Frontline claims up to 9000rpm, you’re not relying on a rev counter, rather a power reserve meter. Changing up at what would traditionally be a redline isn’t always easy, but you can still rifle up and down the five ratios via your usual senses.  Your changes need to be fairly deliberate too, especially going down. It doesn’t demand a heel-and-toe blip but would prefer it, with a jerkiness to iron out if you’re willing. And therein lies the magic of this car: there’s something to learn. All too often, the criticism of performance EVs is their feeling of one-dimensionality, how point and squirt they feel. Here there’s a challenge to go chasing. I reckon you would want the quicker version, too. While it’s jolly nice to be in an EV that’s in no hurry to get anywhere, 120bhp just isn’t quite enough power to rouse true mischief in corners or truly test the Quaife limited-slip differential. Still, there’s enough pitch and lean to keep you immersed and you will potter around basking in the novelty of its niche drivetrain. Crucially, the BEE GT involves you. Alongside it, the new MG Cyberster exhibits loads more speed yet no more feel. The interior lives up to being from another century, with its myriad screens – not to mention the number of times I try to grab a handle rather than toggle the central switches of its grandiose butterfly doors. At the initial launch, I preferred the purity of this RWD Trophy to the outrageous performance of the 4WD GT, but it does feel a bit sanitised without the full 503bhp, 3.2sec hit available. That said, the Cyberster proves an EV can have a sense of humour, even if its cloying safety systems often lack one. And this comparison makes its price look a giveaway. But it’s outcharmed by the BEE GT, whose punchier powertrain option should prime it for more than a hushed Sunday pootle. A company once bashful about electromods has made damn sure to do its own one differently.",

So the Terramar has all the latest powertrains and digital tech and is a size bigger to accommodate those growing families. Viewed another, less charitable way, it’s an angry-looking Volkswagen Tiguan. So the question is: is that something the new car market was missing?",

    "description": "Lotus's Theory 1 concept aims to be a supercar rather than an all-out hypercar – with good reason... An interesting theory. Badoom-tsh. The new Lotus concept car’s name, Theory 1, makes itself ripe for plays on words, but there are a few common themes that follow show cars and concepts. Some closely preview an upcoming model, existing to get the public – and employees – used to what could be a radical idea before a new production version arrives. I’m thinking of the Bentley EXP 9 F, which previewed the Bentayga and made onlookers, er, draw a few breaths. You might call these cars ‘show cars’, so named when big motor shows were still very much a part of our lives. Show cars tell us what’s just around the corner. Then there are the more ethereal variants, the true concept cars that exist basically to explore new design languages, have a think about or experiment with the packaging of new technologies or to ponder where the market might one day be going. I think this is what the Theory 1 is. Are you waiting for a car like it? Perhaps not just now, but something on those lines may well be along a few years from now. I love the idea of a central driving position. My experience of them on the road is limited: a few daunting miles in a McLaren F1, some more relaxed ones in a BAC Mono, although that is basically a single-seater, which isn’t quite the same experience. In single-seat race cars or karts, it immediately becomes something you never think about, at least for me. Climbing from a left-hand-drive to a right-hand-drive car for the first time can be odd, because of space to a side you’re not expecting, and the fact that you’re rising into a corner when you expect to be falling. There’s something so pure about being seated in the middle of it all. I also like the fact the Theory 1 is lighter than an Evija. Granted, 1600kg is still not a number with which traditional Lotus cars were familiar, but it’s a step change in the right direction. Ah, yes, the Evija. “We’re doing this to explore the brand, but there’s also going to be a real market need at some point,” said Lotus designer Ben Hall about the Theory 1. But when will that point come? What the new car does manage to achieve is offer a reduced capability over the Evija, to be a supercar rather than a hypercar. I think it needs to be, because I’m not convinced that the market for the electric hypercar is really there. It sounds obvious, but there are many, many times the number of people who can afford a supercar at under a couple of hundred grand than there are those who can spend a million quid on a hypercar. Loads more. The atmosphere is so rarefied at the very top end that even Rimac, originators of the electric hypercar, is struggling to shift all of its Neveras. Now imagine being Pininfarina, or Lotus, with cars of similar ethos but not – and this is odd to say, given the respective badges involved – the experience of Rimac in this area, trying to convince people to spend on a kind of car that they haven’t made before. It is hard going. For Lotus, I understand, it’s not just hard going with the Evija, either. As my colleague James Atwood notes, Lotus lost £332 million in the first half of the year, and there were some high-profile personnel exits in the wake of that. Fewer Eletre SUVs have been sold than Lotus would like and the brave new era under Geely is, for now, stalling. The cars, as far as we’ve tried them, are good, but they appear to be ahead of where the overwhelming market demand currently is, and hefty new tariffs on Chinese-made EVs will prove doubly unhelpful. I’m intruiged by the Theory 1, but it may be better that it’s a concept rather than a show car, because I’m still not convinced the world – at least just yet – is ready for it.",

    "title": "How we're updating the Autocar road test",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/how-were-updating-autocar-road-test",
    "description": "As the our road test forges into its second century, its brief is expanding – and it’s returning to a familiar place Keeping something up to date without significantly changing what it is in the process isn’t an easy brief. Just ask any ageing rock musician, grand hotel proprietor… or car maker. Everything must change, of course, and only products that are relevant and well attuned to their purpose can retain their value. The Autocar road test has changed quite a lot over what we now know to be more than a century, taking in close to 6000 fully instrumented tests. Its content has necessarily morphed and developed as the cars it was conceived to scrutinise have evolved. If it hadn’t, we’d still be fretting over how much physical pedal effort it takes to stop a Porsche 911 GT3 from 70mph, or how much engine oil the latest Volkswagen Golf GTI might consume in a week. As the automotive landscape has changed quite radically over the past 10 years, we’re now making a few more changes to the road test, so that it can continue to provide what we believe to be the best, most relevant and most thorough assessment of a new car anywhere in the world. We were also delighted to find out, as a result of a recent reader survey, that you broadly agree with these sentiments, and rank the road test among the most valuable and successful things that Autocar does. The road test editor thanks you for the vote of confidence (we like it too, btw). So now, apart from everything else, you’ll be getting more road tests. In place of one per issue, more often than not you’ll be getting two from now on – one of six pages in length, the other four. When there’s a test subject enticing, interesting or significant enough to justify it, you’ll get one test of 10 pages instead. Over the course of a typical month, we reckon we’ll be delivering 60-80% more instrumented tests than before. So we’ll be busy – and, to a great extent, busy in the West Midlands. That’s because we’ve returned to an old stomping ground as a basis of operations for the weekly benchmarking of our test cars: the Horiba MIRA proving ground not far east of Birmingham. So, for us, it’s farewell to Millbrook’s Bedfordshire take on an Alpine hill route and high-speed bowl for the foreseeable future, and hello to the different blend of circuits, facilities and possibilities that MIRA affords. It’s farther from Autocar Towers in west London, certainly, but as I may have pointed out once or twice before, the magnificence of the MIRA canteen usually makes it worth the trip all on its own. The move has given us a chance to review the test procedures through which we put test subjects, and to expand a few of them where value can be added. Given that more than half of the newly introduced production cars that we’ve been testing for the past few years have been either fully electric or significantly electrified, the procedures we’ve added and changed are mostly intended to give extra insight into the performance of those cars, but almost all of the existing performance, handling and braking tests we were doing before survive. Electrified cars can be expected to become slower as their drive batteries go flat – quite the opposite of cars with internal combustion engines and fuel tanks – and so, from now on, the Autocar road test will tell you precisely how much slower they get. These cars also tend to deliver energy-efficient motoring in a different way from combustion-engined ones, so we’ve developed a new efficiency test schedule to better reflect their capabilities. Which is to say nothing of what has probably become the most impactful performance characteristic of any electric vehicle in 2024: how long it takes to charge. While other reviews blindly repeat manufacturer claims on this, the Autocar road test will continue to independently and empirically benchmark DC rapid-charging performance, and then deliver a weighted-average kW charging rate result that is a true and useful reflection of a car’s real-world rapid-charging potential. If you’re an EV owner already and simply want to spend less time waiting at cafes and motorway service areas, this might be the most important piece of data that the road test tells you. But it will continue to be only one of a great many, each intended to build up a picture of a new car’s performance, practicality, wider capability and all-round character more complete than any you’ll read elsewhere. Among other things, the road test will also continue to critically assess the integration and tuning of the latest driver assistance systems. It will remain flexible enough to appraise circuit performance and stamina, on cars where that’s appropriate, and off-road capability too, where relevant. It could always do more, of course, and will no doubt keep changing in order to survive another century, so if there are things you’d like the Autocar road test to tell you that, even now, it misses, please write to us with your suggestions. Otherwise, we hope you will continue to enjoy reading them as much as we enjoy making them.  The Tests Acceleration at low chargeAny car that relies on an electric motor and a battery for either a part or all of its propulsion depends on the condition of that battery for its power, so we have added a second benchmark test of a car’s acceleration. With any EV or hybrid vehicle, our primary acceleration test is always performed with the drive battery’s state of charge at a minimum of 90%. For the new second test, that battery is depleted to 10% state of charge. This will give a useful indication of real-world performance for people who tend to drive plug-in hybrids over longer distances once the battery is flat, but also of the robustness and integrity of the powertrain engineering, and effective power management, of any electric car. Braking endurance Thanks to standard anti-lock and electronic stability control systems, as well as brake energy regeneration systems, today’s cars don’t routinely depend on the physical power of their friction brakes like their predecessors did. But they have typically become heavier than those predecessors, while the rise of electrification seems to be tempting some manufacturers to save cost and weight in their physical braking systems. The fallout of all this should be picked up by our new braking endurance test. All test cars will do five full-pedal-pressure brake test stops from an indicated 80mph in quick succession. Thirty seconds of brake cooling running will be undertaken between each one, but that won’t be enough to cover for any car that’s skimping on old-fashioned stopping power, and suffering from gathering fade, or worse, as a result. Fuel efficiency We will continue to produce both track and touring fuel economy test results for every road test: the former simply the result of what the trip computer displays (having been reset before our track benchmarking session), the latter of a roughly 10-mile trip at typical UK motorway speeds around MIRA’s ‘Number 1’ banked high-speed circuit. But because neither our touring nor our test average result shows the potential of electrified cars for efficiency over shorter-range trips, a fourth test schedule is being added that we’re calling ‘everyday’ (think of it as ‘ordinary’ or ‘commuter’, if you prefer). It’s a roughly eight-mile test, a quarter of which is carried out at 20mph, 30mph, 40mph and 50mph respectively, with regular corners, stops and restarts included. Experience so far suggests that EVs can return up to 50% better efficiency on it than on our touring test, and that hybrids also do well, when given a chance to cover distance a little more slowly, and to regenerate energy more often. DC rapid-charge speed Technically this isn’t brand new for our redesigned road test, but it’s increasingly important. When car manufacturers make claims about the DC rapid-charging performance of their latest models, they tend only to refer to peak rapid-charging rate, which can now even exceed 300kW. Although some also include an indicative 10-80% recharge time, few go into more detail about real-world rapid-charge performance. And so, since 2022, the Autocar road test has been scrutinising it. All EVs go through a benchmark rapid-charge test, from below 10% state of charge to above 90%, connected to a rapid charger capable of supplying their peak claimed charging power. Actual charging rate is then recorded as state of charge passes 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90%, and a weighted average result is calculated that more accurately reflects real-world charging speed than any ‘peak’ claim. And everything elseThe rest of our road testing process remains exactly as it was. With the car static, it takes in notation of fitted tyre sizes, and the measurement of as-tested kerb weight, of a few key exterior dimensions, of passenger cabin accommodation levels and of boot space. The way these measurements are taken has developed over time, so rather than measuring maximum and minimum rear leg room, for example, we set the front seat for a typical driver (at mid-height, and exactly a metre from the brake pedal), and then measure what ‘typical’ leg room is left in the back. Our dynamic track tests give us repeatable measures of both in-gear and through-gear acceleration; of both wet- and dry-surface stopping distances; of in-cabin cruising and idling noise levels; and, more subjectively, of both wet- and dry-surface limit handling. Each test car also typically does several hundred miles of on-road test mileage, the impression of which forms the most important component part of our verdict.",

    "description": "F1's 6.1-litre V12 put out 627bhp; hybrid P1 upped the ante with 903bhp \"The next benchmark\" is set to stick with hybrid power and will be revealed on 6 October McLaren has confirmed that the follow-up to the P1 and F1 will be called the W1. The company said the name \"celebrates [its] world championship mindset\", with the new car due to be revealed on 6 October – 50 years since McLaren won its first constructors' title in Formula 1. The W1 comes just over a decade after the P1 arrived as the successor to the 240mph F1.  A video recently published by the company features those two hallowed hypercars and refers to the W1 as \"the next benchmark\". It is anticipated to take advantage of the developments made with electrification since the P1 was launched 12 years ago. McLaren has said on numerous occasions that there would need to be a generational change in technologies to justify a new ‘1’ car. With a pure-electric McLaren supercar understood to still be some years off, this next ‘1’ hypercar is set to stick with a high-output hybrid powertrain that will no doubt comfortably outpace the 903bhp P1. McLaren chief Michael Leiters last year told Autocar that the company was “not sure” on electric supercars yet because of their weight at present. “We don’t want to make a car that is 2000kg and 2000hp – anybody can do that,” said Leiters. “We want to make a car that is comparable to the 750 weight-wise.” Such a car will be possible “maybe at the end of the decade”, he added.",

    "description": "Bold, cleverly configured hatchback-cum-SUV was a trailblazer in 2021 but where does it stand today? When it first appeared in the UK in 2021, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 made a powerful statement for a car maker looking to really capitalise on the competitive advantage in electric cars that it had already spent close to a decade building.From its chiselled styling, to its 1980s retro body proportions, to its eye-catching ‘parametric’ lighting features, this 12/10th-scale hatchback was made to stand out. Several years into its life cycle, it still does.However, while this car has been through incremental changes since that market launch, including the addition of the red-hot drift-enabled Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, the rest of the mid-sized EV market has been seeking to aggressively rein in Hyundai’s established lead when it comes to fully electric family cars.This class is easily the most competitive, with the most genuinely appealing options, so life for the Ioniq 5 isn’t quite as straightforward today as it was when it first arrived.",

    "description": "BMW uses a manual gearbox to bring greater enthusiast appeal to its Z4 roadster It is well known in the industry that car names sound better in Italian. If Maserati’s GT saloon had been called ‘Four-door’, would it have seemed so exotic? If Ferrari’s manettino had instead been called the ‘little switch’, would you have been so keen to twiddle it? And what about the Fiat Type?Someone at BMW must have thought the same could apply to German, because the subject of this week’s road test is the BMW Z4 with Handschalter Pack. Handschalter means manual gearbox (literally ‘hand-shifter’). And so, six years into the third-generation Z4’s life cycle, BMW has given the six-cylinder version of its long-running roadster a six-speed manual transmission for the first time. That makes it one of just three BMWs you can buy so equipped in the UK, alongside the BMW M2 and the 218i Gran Coupé (not for long, in the case of the 218i).Given the plummeting popularity of new cars with a clutch pedal, it’s a rather odd decision, and the odd decisions don’t stop there. In the UK, the only way to get the manual is to option the Handschalter Pack, which locks you into the spec you see here. You better like Frozen (ie matt) Deep Green with Cognac brown leather interior and gloss black trim, because that’s the only spec available for now.The car industry in 2024 is quite a risk-averse one, so we have to applaud a manufacturer for doing something a bit out there. Then again, that alone doesn’t cut it in an Autocar road test. Let’s find out if an enthusiast-focused going-over can revitalise this six-year-old model.",

    "description": "The saloon that saved Jaguar gets one last round of updates – but does it go out with a bang or a whimper? The Jaguar XF was introduced as the car that promised to right the wrongs its company had been suffering from for many years.Soon after, this four-door saloon became one of its core models and went on to save Jaguar from declining sales and financial ruin. Many years and two generations on, it's a car we still like, not least because of its class-leading handling, handsome styling and competitive pricing.This latest version promises to be no different, with subtly rejigged styling over the car it replaces, improved interior quality, a new infotainment system and a simplified range of engines.It was back in 2021 that Jaguar first cut XE and XF prices in rather eye-catching fashion. Since then, it has only slightly increased the price, but a top-of-the-line XF still comes in at nearly £10,000 less than a like-for-like BMW 3 Series, and it's the same story with a full-house Mercedes C-Class (and, don’t forget, this was a car designed to compete with rivals from the class above). Suffice to say, the outlay for this car is about the same as you would pay for a middling electric car.If you're looking for some extra practicality to match the cost savings available, you can also have the Jaguar XF Sportbrake, which we've reviewed separately.Has Jaguar finally got this car’s specification and value positioning right then, just as so many company car buyers have become wedded to the low-emissions electrified powertrains, tech-laden interiors and low benefit-in-kind rates with which it can’t compete? Let's find out.The Jaguar XF saloon line-up at a glanceThere’s no plug-in hybrid model here, but the range has been simplified compared with the pre-facelift line-up, with the option of three engines and four trim levels. There is a 200bhp 2.0-litre four-cylinder Ingenium diesel, which is the most economical and the cheapest engine and the only unit available on the entry-level R-Dynamic S trim.Step up to mid-rung R-Dynamic SE Black and R-Dynamic HSE Black and you can either have the 2.0-litre diesel or a 248bhp 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol in P250 guise. Top-specification P300, meanwhile, comes with a 296bhp version of this 2.0-litre petrol. Neither petrol engine has the mild-hybrid assistance of the D200, though, nor the WLTP combined fuel economy of up to 56.9mpg - and only the P300 adds four-wheel drive. Every engine is mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission.",

    "title": "In the hot seat: we meet Hot Wheels' design boss",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/hot-seat-we-meet-hot-wheels-design-boss",
    "description": "500 million Hot Wheels are made each year... The cars might be miniature but the fun isn't, thanks to a playful attitude Is designing miniature toy cars the best job in the world? “There’s no maybe about it,” says Hot Wheels’ creative chief, Craig Callum. “In the toy design world, we create fun for kids. We’re thinking on a daily basis about what would a kid love, what would make a kid happy and what would develop them. Working with all that in mind is really rewarding. There’s nothing on earth that kids’ laughter isn’t the medicine for.” Callum channels the playful attitude that sparked Hot Wheels into life. Launched in 1968 as the brainchild of Elliot Handler (whose wife Ruth brought Barbie dolls to market), the very first example was a blue custom Chevrolet Camaro, part of the original ‘sweet sixteen’ line-up rich in muscular American flair.  The portfolio is now far more diverse: a typical range contains about 450 cars, around half of them fresh that year, always split between manufacturer-licensed real models and wackier Hot Wheels Originals, which envisage everything from pie-in-the-sky supercars to wheeled toilets. “Still with the proportions of a pick-up truck, though,” grins Callum. So how does a young man from Sandy, Bedfordshire, end up designing toys of the future at Mattel’s Californian headquarters? Callum’s love for cars started aged five during the school run in his mum’s Citroën 2CV: “A bunch of students were hanging out the roof of a 2CV alongside, cheering and laughing when they saw us. I was like: ‘Wow, cars can create this kind of reaction in people.’” He was soon sketching cars of his own. “I’d design wacky hotels on wheels with helicopter pads, things like that. Mum said: ‘You could be a car designer.’ I knew straight away that’s what I wanted to do.” After an automotive design course at Coventry University, Callum worked on full-scale vehicles for several years until a job offer from Lego (a childhood love of his, alongside Matchbox and Hot Wheels) arrived. After nine years there, during which time he introduced the Speed Champions line, Callum moved to the US to work as Hot Wheels’ design manager in late 2022, his eclectic collection of classic cars slowly following him over. He enjoys early access to new sports cars and supercars – an essential privilege when Mattel’s own design process takes 12-18 months and its toys launch in close alignment with the products to which they pay tribute. Piecing together a Hot Wheels car isn’t simply a case of shrinking a real one down to a 1:64-scale mould; the design team must dig deeply into the character of the car they’re making to successfully work its proportions around their stock wheel sizes, all while keeping the end product irresistibly affordable. “Making a perfectly accurate 1:64-scale car for $1 is a big challenge,” affirms Callum. The designers increasingly utilise AI and 3D printing, the latter quickly popping a metal die-cast prototype into their palms, ready for rigorous testing on those iconic orange tracks. “We make sure they’re capable of doing a loop-the-loop so we know they’re all totally capable on track,” says Callum. \"It’s not always tough work, then. “All designers are striving to hold on to that five-year-old’s joy and creativity,” he smiles. “We’re trying to not grow up as much as possible.” Still, the company around him must mature as the push for sustainability amplifies. “I think the most sustainable thing we can do is produce a toy that lasts forever and is handed through generations. \"But we’re naturally looking at materials and their recyclability. Our packaging team is really on that, too. At Matchbox [another Mattel toy car brand], the packaging is already changing, and that’s coming to our suppliers soon.” Callum will be a judge on this year’s Hot Wheels Legends Tour when it rolls into the UK in August, allowing folks with custom cars to compete for theirs to be turned into a toy sold worldwide. “I always love this leg of that tour,” he says, “because I think the UK just gets it. It brings really refined designs.” Callum’s full-size car collection includes an array of hot rods and the 1970s Mini he’s had since passing his test aged 17. Is there a temptation to sneak those into a blister pack? “I’m holding out for as long as possible before I force my cars into the range. Our Legends designs are all much better anyway! I would be doing them an injustice if I compared the work they do on their cars to my own.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/kia-ev4-hatchback-due-2026-ford-explorer-rival",
    "description": "Low nose is a defining attribute of the EV4 Striking EV will be offered as both a hatch and a fastback saloon, crossing segment boundaries Kia is set to launch a Volkswagen ID 3-rivalling hatchback version of the upcoming EV4 alongside the fastback that was shown in concept form last year. A prototype EV4 was recently spotted testing at the Nürburgring Nordschleife, suggesting it is edging closer to its showroom debut. Although heavily disguised, it clearly has a different silhouette from the concept, swapping its sloped tail for a bluff rear end. It does not appear to be an estate, however, given the car's rear overhang is seemingly shorter than that of the concept. The EV4 concept’s styling is intact, with column-shaped lights – a cue ushered in with the EV9 – set on either flank of its low-set nose. The unusually rakish bonnet also remains, aerodynamic performance having been a key part of the EV4’s design brief. The production car will be based on the E-GMP platform used by Kia’s existing electric cars, the EV3, EV6 and EV9, as well as various Hyundais. Given it is positioned at the lower end of that line-up, it is expected to share powertrains with the EV3. That car, positioned as an electric competitor to the Volkswagen Golf, is currently offered solely with a 201bhp motor mounted on its front axle. A four-wheel-drive ‘GT’ model is currently in development, with a 194bhp motor up front and a 101bhp unit on its rear axle. Two batteries are available, with the entry-level 58kWh option yielding 267 miles of range. The more expensive 81kWh pack boosts this to an impressive 372 miles, although these figures are likely to be slightly reduced in the larger EV4. The EV4 is expected to be positioned as an electric alternative to the likes of the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class – shorter than the 4.6m-long EV5 SUV but taking advantage of the packaging opportunities offered by electric cars to rival much larger combustion-engined saloons for interior space. To that end, the production-ready EV4 is set to keep the minimalist interior layout of the concept, with its dashboard hosting a single touchscreen that’s split between instrument and infotainment displays. Like the EV3, it will gain physical buttons for important functions such as the climate and media controls. It will otherwise major on design flair, with angular panels trimmed in soft cloth. Production will begin in Slovakia next year and the first examples are expected to arrive in British showrooms in 2026. Given the EV3 is priced from £32,995, it’s expected to start at around £35,000-£40,000.",

    "description": "Quality team is embedded at every stage of a car's development British firm wants its quality to be better than Ferrari or Lamborghini's in five years' time “Quality must be improved.” That was the message repeated constantly by McLaren CEO Michael Leiters on his arrival in Woking in 2022, and in his first interview with us. It is far from the most exciting topic in the industry yet it’s about as important as it gets: what use is all that thrilling performance if a warning light comes on every five minutes? The person tasked with delivering for Leiters is an ex-German navy commanding officer.  Jochen Schnez started as chief quality officer in April, not straight from the navy but from Mercedes-Benz, where he spent 21 years after leaving the forces and most recently oversaw the Bremen plant. Schnez’s time leading a fast patrol boat taught him plenty about “knowing what consequences your decisions will bring with you”. But at Bremen – where high-volume models like the C-Class roll off the line every 60 seconds and more specialised lower volume AMG cars like the GT and SL in as little as 20 seconds – he also honed an appreciation of what a “quality mindset” can bring. Quality is a word that can mean different things to different people, yet for Schnez it’s simply “meeting or exceeding customer expectations”. It’s not just fit and finish, but all hardware and software working as it should, and cars delivered in the specifications they were ordered in and in full working order. Ask Schnez where McLaren currently is on its quality ‘journey’ and his diplomatic answer, delivered with a smile, is “you can always improve”, yet he has set the goal of McLarens being at their very best by the end of next year and to be “top of the segment, better than Ferrari or Lamborghini” in five years. He is in the process of instilling a ‘quality mindset’ at McLaren and its suppliers - a “marathon, not a sprint” into 2026 that will relentlessly emphasise the need for good quality and include company-wide awards and training. He has also built up a quality team of more than 100 people, many of whom are recent recruits from other top car makers such as Porsche, Ferrari and Mercedes. Schnez’s quality team is embedded throughout the business at every stage of development – not just on the production line but also in design and development teams for both hardware and software. One key tenet is for parts to be “designed for manufacture” so you don’t create “a world of pain” by handing over a part to the factory that cannot be made at scale in a quality, repeatable way. This is part of a ‘quality loop’ that stops faults as far upstream as possible and prevents a quality issue from being handed onto the next stage of development or production. “Passing on zero faults is the ultimate goal,” says Schnez. “The aim is always to produce quality, not to check quality.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mercedes-could-axe-glc-gle-coup%C3%A9-suvs",
    "description": "GLC Coupé (pictured) and GLE Coupé are said to be \"top of the list\" for retirement Duo could be the next to go as the brand reviews the future of its combustion-engined cars Mercedes-Benz is considering retiring the GLC Coupé and larger GLE Coupé from its line-up in a continuation of its model consolidation plans, according to officials from the German car maker. The two combustion-engined coupé-SUVs are said to be at the “top of the list” of existing models facing the chop as Mercedes continues the process of transitioning to a fully electric line-up. The company has already removed the combustion-engined C-Class Coupé and S-Class Coupé along with the CLS and X-Class pick-up from its line-up in recent years. Original plans also called for the axing of the A-Class hatchback and B-Class MPV by the end of 2024. However, they have been given a reprieve until 2026, when they are expected to be retired from the Mercedes line-up for good. A source at Mercedes' headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, acknowledged an earlier report by German business publication Handelsblatt that suggested an announcement on further model consolidation is imminent. However, he wouldn’t be drawn specifically on moves to retire the GLC Coupé and GLE Coupé, saying: “Every current model is under review. It is a continuous process.”  The decision to reduce the number of Mercedes model derivatives comes as the firm invests heavily in the development of new electric models. While the existing second-generation GLC Coupé, codenamed the C254, is in the first year of a planned seven-year model cycle, the recently facelifted GLE Coupé (the C169) was introduced in 2019. Later this year, Mercedes plans to unveil the first in a quartet of models to be based on its new MMA platform, the third-generation CLA saloon. The new four-door model, to be offered in both pure-electric and combustion-engined forms, will be joined in 2025 by successor models to the CLA Shooting Brake, EQA and EQB.",

    "description": "Mazda's new flagship – a seven-seat SUV – arrives to challenge the likes of the Skoda Kodiaq In the world of eccentric Japanese car manufacturers, the maker of this car, the new Mazda CX-80, is perhaps the most unpredictable and wilful.Take the Pathfinder XV-1: a Series 1 Land Rover knock-off, only even more goggle-eyed, especially when painted Kermit green, as many were. In the 1960s, a tiny run of these 4x4s left a dedicated Mazda plant in what was then Burma, having been ordered by various government agencies. The funny thing is that even today some Mazda execs won’t believe the XV-1 really existed unless you show them a physical specimen. With its badges. If the XV-1 was at least functional, the Parkway 26 was the oddball motor show concept that made production. With a glasshouse to rival that of The Shard, the pretty-ish 26 was a three-tonne, 25-seat minibus hauled along by, of all things, a gutless two-rotor Wankel. To make anything like progress, the thing had to be so remorselessly caned that two 70-litre fuel tanks were needed to assuage its thirst. A good-old reciprocating engine of 1000cc was also called for if you wanted to power the air-con. Talk about a vicious cycle. Just 44 were made.       All of which is to say that, for Mazda, developing a big-capacity oil-burner from scratch, then launching it into Europe amid the continent’s prevailing, puritanical anti-diesel sentiment, is a perfectly normal thing to do.Its clever new mild-hybrid 3.3-litre straight six made its debut a year or two ago in the Mazda CX-60. That car was a mid-sized SUV with an interesting interior, quietly engaging handling and conspicuously poor ride quality, in thanks part to an over-damped back axle.We rather liked the longitudinal motor, though. Depending on driveline, it came with either 197bhp and 332lb ft (RWD) or 251bhp and 406lb ft (4WD) – both modest outputs given the displacement, in return for easy drivability and efficiency. It duly delivered both.That car now has a bigger sibling in the form of the CX-80 tested here. It's a seven-seater designed to take on the likes of the Skoda Kodiaq and Hyundai Santa Fe, and has come in for some chassis tweaks, to make it more refined on the move. Has it worked? Time to find out.",

    "title": "The new cars of 2024 worth waiting for",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-cars-2024",
    "description": "From Abarth to Zenvo, welcome to our comprehensive guide to all the new metal arriving in 2024 So far, 2024 has been a great year for new car launches, with several exciting models revealed over the last nine months.  Hold on, though, because the anticipation doesn't stop here. From Abarth to Zenvo, we've listed all of the biggest cars arriving for the remainder of the year. It's not just electric cars. There's a host of exotic arrivals on the way, including new Bentley Continental GT, plus a whole load of more accessible combustioned-engined cars. It will also be a year of evolution for several brands, with Abarth launching a crossover and JLR launching its first battery-electric Range Rover. So secure your seatbelts and read on for our guide to new cars coming in 2024. New cars coming in 2024 Abarth 600e Electric hot-hatch-crossover will be Abarth’s second hot EV. It looks set to adopt the Fiat 500e’s 152bhp motor and will almost definitely gain an array of lurid paint schemes and a stiffened chassis. We expect the 600e to come with a Scorpion Track driving mode, like its smaller sibling. It will likely be good for a 7.0sec 0-62mph time. Everything we know about the Abarth 600e AC Cobra GT Roadster Classic Cobra package gets a radical reinvention thanks to a 654bhp V8 and carbonfibre body. The Cobra GT Roadster is made by AC, its first new model since it appointed Swiss financial backer David Conza as CEO in May 2022. It’s set to start from £285,000 and has a bespoke aluminium spaceframe chassis designed in Italy by Icona Design Group and Cecomp. It’s set to be built in the UK. Everything we know about the AC Cobra GT Roadster Aiways U5 Aiways may well be a brand you’ve not heard of. But the firm has come on leaps and bounds since its introduction in 2017, priding itself on its ‘clean sheet’ approach to car manufacturing. The U5 is a competent if uninspiring family SUV that also has been available elsewhere in Europe for a while. Read our Aiways U5 review Alpine A290 The spirit of Renaultsport has been revived for a rework of the upcoming Renault 5 with extra power, differential-simulating torque vectoring on the front axle, hydraulic bump stops and A110 brakes. Could it be the first truly great electric hot hatch? Everything we know about the Alpine A290 Alpine GTX-Over Renault performance brand taps into the mainstream with a sporting compact SUV based on the electric Mégane’s platform. Don’t expect a jacked-up A110 - it’ll be much more like a Lotus Eletre or Polestar 3. It will likely utilise a second motor on the rear axle, much like Nissan’s range-topping e-4orce Ariya, which is also on the Mégane platform. Everything we know about the Alpine GTX-Over Audi A5 The combustion A4 has been be renamed A5, with Audi re-designating internal-combustion-engined cars with odd numbers. The new A5’s styling is an evolution of the current model, with more angular headlights and a flatter front grille. It will continue to offer petrol, diesel, mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid engines. Everything we know about the new Audi A5 Audi A6 E-tron Whether in saloon or estate form, the A6 has long been at the heart of Audi’s range, so this first electric version is very significant. The BMW i5 rival sits on a new EV platform co-developed by Audi and Porsche and will offer a range of 466 miles at launch. Everything we know about the Audi A6 E-tron Bentley Continental Crewe’s fabled W12 is on the way out, and it’s set to be replaced by a PHEV powertrain. But don’t fret too much: it won’t just be about boosting economy. Expect it to take learnings from the fierce V8 system in Porsche’s Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid – and expect the Conti to retain plenty of British luxury. Read our Bentley Continental prototype review Bugatti Bolide Think the 300mph, 1580bhp quad-turbocharged W16-engined Chiron is a bit tame? This one’s for you, then. The Bolide is what happens when Bugatti makes a track car: a £3.4 million maniac that weighs 1450kg while packing a whopping 1825bhp. Everything we know about the Bugatti Bolide BMW 1 Series BMW's entry-level car gets some significant design changes for 2024, with a lowered, more angular stance and a new face. BMW has also opted to ditch diesel engines and manual gearboxes for this new generation of the hatchback, which is a move that some will not be too pleased with.  BMW M5 Touring The first estate-bodied uber-5 Series since 2010 produces a whopping 717bhp from a V8 plug-in hybrid powertrain, which is also capable of producing up to 738lb ft. At 2.5 tonnes, a heavy beast, but it can still hit 0-62mph in 3.6sec, powering on to a top speed of 189mph. A whopping amount of space is also the order of the day, with 1630 litres or cargo room.  Everything we know about the BMW M5 Touring BMW X3 Internal-combustion X3 grows in size to help differentiate it from the BMW X1. It gains more electrified engines, with a 48-volt mild-hybrid 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol as well as a diesel. 3.0-litre petrol and diesels will also join the setup. The Neue Klasse electric iX3 will follow in 2026. Everything we know about the new BMW X3 Cupra Leon You won't mistake Spain's Golf GTI for a Seat again, as Cupra ushers in a more purposeful look that brings it into line with the newer (and Cupra-only) Born, Formentor and Tavascan. The Leon follows the closely related VW Golf in gaining some extensive tech and mechanical upgrades for 2024, with longer-range PHEVs, quicker infotainment and – praise be – more buttons and switches on the cards. Everything we know about the new Cupra Leon Dacia Bigster Kick-starting the brand's push into the crucial C-segment, the Bigster is a 4.6-metre-long rival to the Ford Kuga and will cost less than £40,000 when it is launched later this year. It will be based on the same CMF platform as its similar-size Renault Group siblings, the Nissan X-Trail and Renault Austral, and is being engineered from the off with an outright focus on affordability. Everything we know about the Dacia Bigster Dacia Duster An early contender for bargain of the year? Dacia's 4x4 has swapped onto a new platform for a promised boost in refinement and capability, and is now available with hybrid power for the first time. Read our Dacia Duster review DS 4 E-Tense Electric version of posh French hatchback will be closely related to the new Peugeot E-3008 with which it shares a platform. That means it should be available with either a 73kWh or 98kWh (the latter giving an impressive 435-mile range) and up to 316bhp in a performance-flavoured range-topper. Ferrari EV Ferrari hasn’t said what form its first EV will take, but it will feature in-house batteries, motors and electronics. The CEO has driven a prototype but would only say: “I like it a lot.” Fiat Grande Panda The Italian cousin of the Citroën ë-C3 will hark back to its 1980 progenitor with retro design and a simple kit offering. Its set-up comprises of a 44kWh battery and a 111bhp single electric motor, returning 199 miles of range. It will also offer combustion-engined powertrains.  Everything we know about the new Fiat Grande Panda Fiat Topolino Turin’s 1950s-flavoured take on the Citroën Ami can be specified without doors, which would be rather more appropriate on Camber Sands than in Camberwell, where you’re more likely to see one. It’s sure to be the ultimate conversation starter. Everything we know about the Fiat Topolino Ford Capri The Blue Oval has resurrected the hallowed Capri name for its second electric crossover based on the Volkswagen Group's MEB platform, serving as a direct rival to the Volvo C40 Recharge and new Peugeot e-3008.  It's actually more like a raised saloon than an SUV-coupé (similar to the Polestar 2), with a raft of bespoke design cues to differentiate it from the larger Explorer. it produces similar power to the Focus ST and has an official range of up to 400 miles.  Everything we know about the Ford Capri Ford E-Transit Custom Don't skip over this one - it could be one of the most important new model launches of 2024. Seriously. The Transit Custom is (quite comfortably) the UK's best-selling vehicle, so the arrival of an all-electric version with up to 236 miles of range is pretty important. Full details are still to come, but it looks likely to get the 68kWh battery from the bigger E-Transit, and could pack up to 265bhp in its most potent form. Everything we know about the Ford E-Transit Custom Jaecoo 7 Chinese car giant Chery is coming to the UK with Omoda (further down this list) and the Jaecoo brand.  The 7 SUV is Hyundai Tucson-sized and will likely come with plug-in hybrid powertrains. A dealer network of 50 sites is being set up, with franchise partners including Listers and Peter Vardy. Everything we know about the Jaecoo 7 Jeep Avenger 4x4 Four-wheel-drive version of Jeep’s baby EV will blend urban manoeuvrability with brand-appropriate ruggedness. Read our Jeep Avenger review Jeep Recon Jeep’s electric Land Rover Defender rival gets 600bhp and a 3.5sec 0-62mph time. The car’s upright stance and square front end are borrowed from the Wrangler, and like that SUV, the doors can be removed. Everything we know about the Jeep Recon Kia EV3 Kia’s push into more affordable EVs will begin with this futuristic Soul successor, due to arrive with a price tag of around £28,500. It will use the E-GMP platform and offer multiple powertrains, including a rapid GT one, and can produce up to 373 miles of range.  Everything we know about the Kia EV3 Koenigsegg Gemera Koenigsegg doesn’t do normal. So its first four-seater can be had with either a camless twin-turbo triple or a twin-turbo V8 engine within a PHEV system to offer either 1381bhp or 2268bhp. Because of course it can. Everything we know about the Koenigsegg Gemera Maserati Grancabrio The Granturismo with its roof lopped off, the Grancabrio is expected to offer the same mix of ICE and electric powertrains, with only a slight penalty to performance. The soft-top is expected to arrive in the second half of 2024, after the coupé. Everything we know about the new Maserati Grancabrio Maserati Grecale Folgore This family SUV will be key to Maserati's assault on the electric car market, as one of six EVs it's launching by 2025. Its performance won't be quite as outrageous as the Granturismo Folgore's but still strong, with more than 500bhp and a 0-62mph time of 4.5sec. Everything we know about the Maserati Grecale Folgore Maserati MC20 Folgore The first electric supersports car. Maserati says it’s committed to retaining the feel of a V6 while giving it whip-crack acceleration, courtesy of an expected 745bhp and 997lb ft of torque. Everything we know about the Maserati MC20 Folgore Maybach EQS SUV Maybach’s first electric car beats rivals Bentley and Rolls-Royce to the punch, as the first properly luxurious zero-emission SUV on the market. It can be had with a spacious four-seat interior, in which rear passengers are treated to reclining and massaging thrones. In spite of all the extra gadgetry – and its weight – performance is improved compared with the current range-topping Mercedes EQS SUV, the 580. Everything we know about the Maybach EQS SUV Mercedes-AMG CLE 63 Hot super saloon, anybody? The new mild hybrid Mercedes-AMG CLE 63 could be the car for you, adding heavily ramped-up performance, a redesigned interior and sporty exterior styling over the standard car. Some 442bhp and 413lb ft of torque is pumped out from AMG’s twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engine, which is backed up by an integrated starter-generator (ISG). You’ll be as fast as almost anything else on the road, with  a 4.2sec sprint from 0-62mph and a top speed limited to 155mph. Mercedes-AMG E63 Yes, yes, the Mercedes-AMG is losing its V8 engine for a straight-six plug-in hybrid. But it’s not all bad - it will gain electric-only driving for improved economy, plus higher power and performance than ever before. Figures are still under wraps, but it’s claimed the brand is targeting more than 700bhp and 884lb ft, which puts many sports and supercars to shame. Everything we know about the Mercedes-AMG E63 Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 Much like its saloon sibling, the Mercedes-AMG C63, the new high-performance GLC loses its twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V8. In its place is a plug-in-hybrid powertrain, pairing a fettled version of the Mercedes-AMG A45’s turbocharged four-pot with a rear-mounted electric motor. The result is a combined output of 671bhp and 752lb ft of torque. That’s enough to send the GLC – all 2.2 tonnes of it – from 0-62mph in just 3.5sec. Everything we know about the Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 Mercedes-AMG S63 Want an AMG-tuned saloon with a V8? Your last remaining option is the S63 – the most powerful S-Class to date. It adds a rear-mounted electric motor and 13.1kWh battery to AMG’s 4.0-litre powerplant, giving combined outputs of 791bhp and 1054lb ft. That’s sufficient to crack the 0-62mph sprint in 3.3sec – half a second quicker than the famed McLaren-Mercedes SLR, which was almost an entire tonne lighter. Everything we know about the new Mercedes-AMG S63 Mini Aceman The indirect successor to the Mini Clubman, the Aceman, is an electric crossover sandwiched between the Cooper and the significantly larger Countryman. It will use a stretched version of the Cooper EV’s Spotlight architecture, with the same mix of powertrains and battery packs. Everything we know about the Mini Aceman Nio EL6 Electric Chinese car majors on practicality, with 668 litres of boot space – more than you’ll find in an Audi Q4 or Ford Mustang Mach-E – and 40/20/40-split rear seats. Four-wheel drive is standard, thanks to a dual-motor set-up outputting a combined 482bhp and 516lb ft. Meanwhile, a 70kWh battery yields a range of around 300 miles between charges. It’s also compatible with Nio’s battery-swap stations, which can remove a pack and replace it with a fully-charged one in fewer than five minutes. Everything we know about the Nio EL6 Nio ET5 The ET5 is a pretty slick premium saloon and a very credible rival to the BMW i4 and Tesla Model 3. Expect it here late in the year, although not until a number of swap stations are ready, so council planning departments may have an oversized influence… Read our Nio ET5 review Nissan Ariya Nismo The Nismo name returns for a high-performance variant of Nissan’s mainstream electric crossover. It gets a more aggressive, track-biased set-up for the four-wheel drive system, plus more than 400bhp in its most powerful specification.  Omoda C5 The Omoda C5 is a direct competitor (and lookalike) of the Aiways U5 found further up this list. The C5 showcases the talents of Chinese giant Chery, which has the scale to cause a stir in the UK. Everything we know about the Omoda C5 Peugeot e-408 The Peugeot E-408 is expected to adopt Stellantis’s favoured combo of a single 154bhp electric motor and 51kWh (usable) battery pack. That should yield a 0-62mph time below 10sec and a range north of 200 miles.   Peugeot e-Rifter Re-styled front end brings small seven-seater into line with Peugeot’s new three-fanged look, ushered in with the new 3008. It also receives an interior upgrade, bringing a larger 10in infotainment touchscreen. Polestar 3 The sporting sibling of the new Volvo EX90 gets a 510bhp dual-motor powertrain and a 111kWh battery, delivering a range of 379 miles between charges. Our review on foreign Tarmac revealed rapid pace, communicative steering and a roomy, nicely finished interior. And a hefty price tag.  Read our Polestar 3 review Polestar 4 The Polestar 4 is a pure-electric take on the Porsche Macan and Polestar’s fourth model. It’s tipped to be the company’s bestselling model and will be built in China and Korea. Intriguingly the Chinese market cars will receive an entirely different operating system. Notably, it will not come with a rear window. Everything we know about the Polestar 4 Range Rover Electric New cars don’t get much more significant than this: JLR has invested heavily in its electric transformation, and while the reinvented Jaguars will steal the limelight, the first electric Range Rover will be crucial to finding sales volume and perhaps helping convert a new group of buyers to EVs. Everything we know about the Range Rover Electric Renault 4 Renault will revive another of its most popular historic models, this time as a small, retro crossover that’s aimed at the city but should be able to cope off road. Expect it to be mechanically similar to the 5 below. But Renault insists the interior will be very different. Everything we know about the Renault 4 Renault Symbioz This brand-new entrant to the French brand’s crossover range will fill the gap between the Captur and Arkana. With styling inspired by the latter, it follows the firm’s latest design language and sits atop the CMF-EV platform, shared with the Nissan Ariya and Renault Mégane E-Tech. Seres 3 Haven't heard of Seres? You're probably not the only one. The 3 will start from £29,995 - making it the cheapest electric SUV on sale. The Qashqai-sized car has a 161bhp front motor, a 54kWh battery and an official range of just over 200 miles. Smart #3 The original Fortwo feels like a distant memory now, as the biggest Smart yet is a Volkswagen ID 5-rivalling EV with five seats and 273 miles of range. It drives well enough, is good value and it’s pretty good looking too. Such a shame that the driver assistance tech is infuriatingly poor. Read our Smart #3 review Subaru Forester The Mk5 Forester stays true to form with a sensible two-box body, symmetrical four-wheel drive and a smattering of new tech inside. Plus a full hybrid version has been confirmed. Toyota Supra 'GRMN' A hotter new variant of the GR Supra is set to arrive in 2024, swapping the BMW Z4’s B58 straight six for the fiery S58 one from the new BMW M2. That should make for a very healthy power bump, while track-focused revisions to the chassis could enable it to bid for sports car supremacy at the Nürburgring. Which would be fitting. Everything we know about the Toyota Supra GRMN Volkswagen ID Buzz LWB Could this be the most useful EV on the market? Volkswagen’s reborn ‘bus’ finally lives up to its billing with seats for seven in long-wheelbase form, also gaining a bigger battery and a more powerful motor. Everything we know about the VW ID Buzz LWB Volvo EX90 Volvo’s priciest car to date is also billed to be its safest and most luxurious. A zero-emission equivalent to the Volvo XC90 SUV, the EX90 comes with a 111kWh battery that provides a (claimed) range of 364 miles in Twin Motor specification, and 360 miles in the Performance model.

Read our Wiesmann Project Thunderball review Xpeng G6 Xpeng promises to be an upmarket proposition, and our first taste of its cars suggests it could be a credible premium alternative. Its first UK car will be – surprise – a mid-size electric SUV, and it’s named after Far East Movement’s 2010 pop song Like a G6… possibly. Everything we know about the Xpeng G6 Zenvo Aurora This Danish hypercar might be one of the most ludicrous to date, packing a 6.6-litre quad-turbocharged V12 and three electric motors, all combining for a total output of 1850bhp.

    "description": "Nascent Chinese electric car brand arrives in Europe with tiny electric city car We’ve lost count of the number of Chinese brands that are coming to the UK, invariably planning to offer us the novelty of electric cars that look like they were styled by AI and named as imaginatively as your average photocopier.The Leapmotor T03 appears to perfectly fit the stereotype – except it has one very important difference to its compatriots.You see, Leapmotors sold outside of China – starting with the T03 baby hatchback tested here and the big C10 family SUV – are actually sold by Leapmotor International, a joint venture owned 49:51 by the nascent Chinese company and Stellantis, the multinational giant that runs 14 brands from France, Italy, Germany, Britain and the US.The benefit of this, Leapmotor International CEO Tianshu Xin told us, is twofold: the brand can bypass the expensive set-up phase by simply adding its range to existing Stellantis showrooms across the nation; and potential customers will be reassured by familiarity and “360deg of support during the entire experience, from the selection of the vehicle to financing solutions and post-sales assistance services”. To say that Leapmotor – which was formed in Hangzhou a mere eight years ago by Zhu Jiangming, an electrical engineer with no prior automotive experience – is being ambitious about its growth abroad would be an understatement.It’s launching in Europe (including the UK), India, South-East Asia, Oceania and South America within the space of a year and expects to sell 250,000 cars this year – almost double its 2023 total – and 500,000 in 2030.It has defined its key brand values as affordability (it claims the T03 is the car that finally gives A- and B-segment buyers access to electric power, although the Dacia Spring will have something to say about that) and cutting-edge technology that takes the hassle out of your daily life.It certainly is one of the cheapest electric cars on sale at a mere £16k: that Leapmotor makes the majority of its parts in-house, hasn’t designed in superfluities and is harnessing Stellantis economies of scale apparently help the price, as does making the car on the old Fiat 500 line in Poland, not in China, and therefore avoiding both shipping costs and a 20% EU import tariff.      View this post on Instagram           A post shared by Autocar (@autocar_official)",

    "description": "Sensing déjà vu? Yes, the 2 is back on our fleet, but now a much different prospect Why we’re running it: A switch from FWD to RWD brings better range, efficiency and drivability – but what about everyday appeal? Month 1 - Month 2 - Month 3 - Month 4 - Specs Life with a Polestar 2: Month 4 Slick EV proves its mettle on yet another long trip - 25 September There’s nothing quite like the trepidation of a ford in the road. Will the journey end in soggy embarrassment and be followed by a large bill and pictures of my car on the local Facebook group showing the idiocy and arrogance of another out-of-towner who bit off more than they could chew? Those thoughts were running through my head as a whopper of a river ford stood between me and the road out of Sidmouth in Devon. A Ford of a different kind answered the question of the water’s depth: a Fiesta casually blasted through the splash, the water hardly any deeper than the sidewalls of its tyres. I followed suit and it was back to the main road. The drive to Devon was the latest road trip of around 500 miles I’ve done in our Polestar 2 this summer. Such journeys don’t feel such a big deal now in a big-range EV like the 2, because such little extra brain power is required to work out when to charge. I set off from home with a full charge, and either one fast charge on the road or a couple of slower charges, while parked up somewhere, covers it. There has been a notable increase in good-quality and reliable public chargers. You can typically spot the bad ones a mile off: they look large and old. Payment for charging is increasingly now contactless and apps showing charger availability and speed have become more reliable and trustworthy than ever. The 2 is a very good road-trip car for up to four people for a couple of nights away, given that the boot is a good size. I’ve done a trip for three and there was plenty of space left, and neither people nor possessions felt crammed in. When it’s just me travelling, my golf clubs can lie flat with plenty of room to spare. Some 30deg C-plus weather this summer did turn the 2 into a bit of a greenhouse. The huge panoramic roof was a significant factor in that, of course, and, as mentioned in a recent report, the seat material isn’t exactly on the breathable side. I don’t really like the stuffiness of air-con, but the heat from both the roof above and the seats below often leaves me with no choice. Yet the hot weather also does wonders for the 2’s efficiency. On one toasty day trip to the continent with the temperature again in the 30s, at times I was seeing five miles per kWh efficiency on the more built-up sections of road. That’s remarkable and would stretch the range to around 400 miles. Carrying passengers is making me more aware of the lumpiness of the 2’s ride, however. Back-to-back bumps can send heads tossing and the jarring can make you wince a bit. Perhaps familiarity makes me notice it less when I’m flying solo, but there are better-riding and more supple electric cars of this size out there, including the BMW i4. But no electric car can match the coolness and kerb appeal of the 2, even after a few years on sale. The unusual Jupiter paint perhaps contributes to that as a conversational starter, but the amount of people who will ask questions about the 2 or turn their heads when the car drives past them for a lingering stare seems only to be increasing. Love it Efficiency  It got even better with the hot weather. Have seen five miles per kWh come up now. Loathe it The panoramic roof is an option that doesn’t pair well with the Weavetech trim on the seats. Mileage: 8222 Back to the top  Keyless entry but plenty of safety measures - 18 September  Many modern cars frustrate with overly complex ways of entering and locking, but the 2’s balance is excellent. There’s a good old-fashioned key fob with lock, unlock and boot release buttons, but keyless entry is still possible with the fob in your hand and a tug on a handle that still sits proud of the body. As for the boot, there’s a button on the tailgate that both closes and locks it. No faffing here. Mileage: 8190 Back to the top  Range anxiety? Absolutely not... - 4 September It’s easy to see how charging falls down the list of key EV stats behind range, battery size and efficiency, but the 2’s rapid peak charging rate of 205kW means it can gain 80 miles in the time it takes me to use the loo and buy a coffee at a service station. I’ve yet to have anything even close to resembling range anxiety in the 2, as its key EV stats would make for a compelling Top Trumps card. Mileage: 8001 Back to the top  Life with a Polestar 2: Month 3 How will 60% more power affect first-class all-rounder’s drive? - 21 August As we and car makers are increasingly finding out with electric cars, less often means more. Some of the first wave of single-motor EVs were packed with ludicrous amounts of instant torque, as manufacturers had shiny new toys to play with in electric motors, the result being otherwise humdrum hatchbacks tugging you towards the nearest ditch. Then there were the early dual-motor EVs, with power and torque figures to shame Ferraris. This turned them only into pseudo-performance cars that could go quickly in a straight line but not much else. The overriding feeling after some time behind the wheel was nausea. We're now largely past the first phase of single-motor EVs being given torque to overwhelm the driven wheels and the driver, car makers having learned that just because it's there, doesn’t mean they have to serve it all up all of the time. A far more useful everyday nippiness has emerged. However, we're still largely in the era of dual-motor EVs marketed as performance options based almost entirely on the headline figures, and our verdict of these models is often the same: go with the single-motor version for a much sweeter driving experience and as much real-world performance as you will ever need. Efficiency will always be better too. The Polestar 2 falls into the less-is-more category, not that the Swedish brand hasn’t tried to position it as a serious performance machine that’s about more than just headline numbers. When the single-motor 2 that I'm running was recently off the road having a parking sensor repaired, I arranged to have a go in a dual-motor 2 with the Performance Pack fitted. This version gets a peak of 469bhp, up from the 295bhp of my version, as well as the thing the 2 is known for: manually adjustable Öhlins performance dampers. This still feels like a remarkable addition to a two-tonne-plus family car built in China, rather than something made by hand for pure pleasure, like an Ariel or a Caterham, and credit to Polestar for valuing mechanical interaction and not just sticking the settings behind another menu in the touchscreen. That said, the dampers aren’t the easiest to adjust, requiring a dealer visit to change them, which neither of which could be done in my week with the car, so I was left with a ride that’s already firm enough made even more so. It’s worth noting that when our Matt Prior ran in a pre-facelift 2 with these dampers, he clicked them back to a more comfortable setting and found the ride to be much more agreeable. Firm ride aside, it's a car with a lot of grip and stability yet not much excitement should blistering acceleration not be your thing. You can feel last night’s dinner, let alone today’s breakfast, sloshing around under hard loads, and any novelty value soon expires. I do like the visual upgrades, which lift an already cool-looking car even further: the 20in wheels look fantastic and the yellow trim flashes, including on the seatbelts, don’t feel gimmicky. Overall, though, it was a case of ‘pleased to have tried it, not sad to see it go’, as I had been craving the better all-round abilities of my usual single-motor car. This 2 increasingly feels like a modern interpretation of the six-cylinder diesels that until recently you would have found in the form of a BMW 330d or 335d, delivering excellent real-world pace, engaging dynamics and high efficiency in a premium package. Love it Hello Handsome No matter the colour, spec or trim, the 2 looks fantastic. Prefacelift cars are ageing well, too. Loathe it Cross-traffic alert It has a habit of false activation, slamming your brakes on when it wrongly thinks you’re going to hit something in reverse. Mileage: 7750 Back to the top  Polestar 2 boasts smart seats - 14 August For the most part, I’m really enjoying the trim on the seats in the 2. Called Weavetech, it’s a tough fabric that feels modern and looks stylish as an alternative to leather. Yet it shares one common trait with that material: an ability to get rather toasty on one’s backside in warmer weather. I’ve always found ventilated (cooled) seats a bit gimmicky, but they would be very welcome here. Mileage: 7445 Life with a Polestar 2: Month 2 Night follows day and our editor takes an electric long-termer to Bruges - 17 July I’d forgive you for not remembering the exact locations of my journeys over the past three years in this section of the magazine, given that there have been more than 10,000 pages of editorial in that time, but this is now the fourth electric car in three years that I’ve taken to Belgium (yes, Bruges again) for a long weekend (no, I’m not on the tourist board, I just like the cobbles, canals and beer, okay?), and your fourth single-page write-up on how an EV tackles that journey awaits. The Polestar 2 follows an Audi Q4 E-tron, a Kia Niro EV and a BMW iX in having made this 500-or-so-mile round trip, and it was the best and most enjoyable one yet, not only because the charging infrastructure has become so much better and more plentiful but also because the car was so much more efficient. In the electric car lexicon, range remains the most important criterion for many, yet it is simply a by-product of efficiency and battery capacity. This 2 has a large, 82kWh battery, yet it's so much more efficient with it than rivals, allowing you to go so much further without having to charge as a result. On firing the car up, it indicates 330 miles of range from a full charge pretty much as standard. In many EVs, you can expect that figure to plummet with any kind of extended motorway running, but not so in the 2. The efficiency is routinely around four miles per kWh, no matter the journey, which translates to a range of 330 miles – a figure I’m very comfortable with. That the indicated range is a reliable and trustworthy figure isn’t a given based on my time in electric cars. Previously, I’ve considered 3mpkWh efficiency in an EV to be the equivalent of around 40mpg in an ICE car using a method no more scientific than real-world experience. On that basis, I would happily call 4mpkWh 50mpg, which gets you to the economy of a good 2.0-litre diesel car. And there’s plenty of room for improvement: Lucid, which makes the most efficient EVs of all, says 8mpkWh is an achievable medium-term goal, which would equate to 100mpg. Maybe my scale will need recalibrating... My earlier EV trips to Bruges followed a similar format: set off with a full charge at home, do a splash and dash at the now-universal Tesla Superchargers at the Folkestone Eurotunnel terminal, top up again at a motorway fast charger on the other side in case I can’t get a charging space overnight in Bruges and then do the same on the way back, regardless of whether an overnight charge was achieved. This time around, I did a splash and dash at Folkestone only and still arrived in Bruges with more than 50% battery remaining. I didn’t hunt too hard for a roadside charger, because you have to pay a premium for the parking compared with a multi-storey and the charging isn’t cheap on top. Instead, the electrons came from parking up in some nearby towns on a day trip to the Belgian coast, so by the time I’d done another splash and dash at the Tesla rapid charger on the Calais side of the tunnel on the way home, I managed to get home with around 30% battery still showing. The on-the-go charging was less than £30 all in, on top of the £20 home charge to begin with. If it was the first time I’d done the journey, I’d have probably been even more cautious and sought out an overnight charge to head home with 100% and with another top-up en route. Yet such is life with EVs: the more you drive them, the more you get to know them, learn their language and spot the good ones from the not-so-good ones.To that end, this 2 is the best motorway electric car that I’ve yet driven. Love it Angel-eyes It was a real boon for manoeuvring within those alloy-endangering Eurotunnel carriages. Where to stick it There’s no flat surface on the rear of the 2 to put your UK sticker for driving abroad. Mileage: 6419 Back to the top  Life with a Polestar 2: Month 1 Polestar impresses for motorway efficiency - 12 June It’s easy to get sucked into talking solely about range when it comes to EVs, but range is the result of the battery size and the car’s efficiency. There are larger batteries than the 2’s 82kWh one (a capacity oddly plastered on the side of the car), but I’ve yet to live with an EV that’s as efficient at motorway speeds. I can see 4.0mpkWh on a good run.  Mileage: 3111 Back to the top Welcoming the Polestar 2 to the fleet - 29 May 2024 Sometimes in this job, we go on drives in cars that we don't end up writing about because we've told you everything you need to know about it already. I had one such drive late last year in a Polestar 2 - a car then recently facelifted and a few weeks earlier subjected to a full Autocar road test. I had some time in it before a flight home following the inaugural Polestar Day in Los Angeles, where the Swedish electric car maker unveiled its future model plans and strategy. What I had thought would be a chance to fill my knowledge bank and to catch up with my road test colleagues turned into one of the most memorable drives that I had all year - and not just for the rather lovely Californian autumn sun and scenery. The 2 was as little as I remembered. Pre-facelift, this 4.6m-long fastback was likeable but not an automatic choice in a market ever expanding with choice. While a creditable first effort, it wasn't outstanding and felt alternative in its positioning and execution. Its mid-life facelift brought with it most of the customary changes, like some updated visuals and extra kit, along with the 'usual' for EVs of more range and improved battery and motor technology. Yet it also brought with it a switch from front-wheel drive to rear-wheel drive - something practically unheard of but which we might yet see more of in the future, as such changes are now very much technically feasible in the electric era. The 2 felt much more substantial as a result, with better rolling refinement, driver engagement and acceleration. The switch to rear-wheel drive had obvious dynamic benefits but was mainly done to boost efficiency at a steady cruise (more mass is over the back axle now, so more torque is being used for forward motion), and the pre-facelift 2's real-world range of 200 or so miles became closer to 270 miles when we road tested it. A 2 is now back with us for an extended stay, and after my memorable first experience, I'm excited and delighted to be running it. We've had a 2 on our fleet before: Matt Prior ran a range-topping Long Range Dual Motor with the Performance Pack, complete with the fancy Öhlins dampers that you need a spanner to adjust. This time, we've got a Long Range Single Motor, which feels like the sweet spot in the range. There's just one model below it, the Standard Range Single Motor, with a 69kWh battery instead of an 82kWh one and a 268bhp motor instead of a 295bhp one. The Dual Motor version remains in the line-up as well, featuring the 82kWh battery. It has 416bhp as standard or 469bhp if you add the Performance Pack, which retains those Ohlins dampers. I am keen to see how that top-rung model has evolved at some point over the next few months and will make sure I pop over to Prior's to borrow his spanner and see what he thinks of the progress made. As is typical with new cars these days, options are grouped into packages. Two are offered - Pilot and Plus - and my test car has both. The former features all the assisted driving technology and costs £2000 on top of the base car's £48,950. The latter costs £4000 and includes quite a few bits, from what's fast proving to be essential on EVs, such as a heat pump, to the added theatre of a panoramic roof and a Harman Kardon premium sound system, to clever features like the lid-in-lid' pop-up bag holder in the boot, which stops things sliding around. The colour of our 2 is as nice as I've seen in the metal on any car for a long time. It's called Jupiter and costs £900. The interior trim looks great and feels good too, and for the record is called Slate Weavetech with Black Ash deco by Polestar. One question that has remained pre- and post-facelift concerns the 2's ride, which is firm. This again was shown in our road test on 20in wheels, but this car has 195, and so far the ride is better than I remember it being. That back-to-back comparison with the range-topper will be revealing for more than one reason, then. One big part of the appeal of the 2 is its range, or more precisely its efficiency. The official range is a remarkable 406 miles, which as ever should be taken with a pinch of salt, yet in early testing I'm routinely passing the magic 300-mile barrier and pushing 330 miles on occasion. This is a car with huge visual appeal inside and out and, my early experiences suggest, increased levels of driver appeal and even better efficiency. I was apprehensive the day the 2 arrived for fear of it not being as good or as memorable in a soggy British spring as it was in a glorious Californian autumn, but it has already put those worries to bed. Second Opinion I thought the updated 2 was great when I first drove it: fast, frugal and pretty cool looking. Then I sat in the back of it and thought it was less great. I’m really interested to see if Mark’s rear-seat passengers find sitting virtually on the rear axle as grating and as nausea-inducing as I did, or if I was just being a typically fussy road tester.

Since then, we’ve been wondering when its sibling, the Husqvarna Vitpilen 801, would drop, and what it would look like. Well, it’s here now—and we are decidedly underwhelmed. The new Vitpilen 801 might have knocked our socks off if Husqvarna had released it before the Svartpilen 801. But they’ve made us wait six months for a look at what is essentially a lightly fettled version of the Svartpilen. And that’s left us very little to sink our teeth into. When Husqvarna first released their neo-reto street bike range six years ago, the differences between the Svart- and Vitpilen variants were far more pronounced. The Svartpilen 401 and 701 were clearly styled after flat track bikes, while the Vitpilen 401 and 701 were committed to café racer style, clip-on handlebars and all.…",

Approaching turn 15, the brakes began overheating, sending his König 500 careening off the track. Fighting for control, Newcombe was determined to stay in the race as he approached Stowe Corner at uncontrollable speed… Five years earlier, Kim Newcombe, a marine engine mechanic with a penchant for boat and dirt bike racing, teamed up with renowned German outboard motor designer and specialist, Dieter König. Newcombe took over the development of a defunct motorcycle project built around a boat engine Dieter had conceived. The heart of the resulting machine was a powerful 500cc four-cylinder, two-stroke boxer engine cradled in a custom frame design.…",

It’s been a rocky road for Alex Mazan, Arseniy Chekar, and Vlad Zaki, but they’re too excited about the future to focus on the past.

Riding on the success of the VF750F, Honda introduced the VF1000F to expand their V-four lineup and offer a sport-touring option for riders craving more power and range. But the VF1000F never quite matched the popularity of the 750, and was outgunned by rivals like the Kawasaki GPz900R Ninja. Still, the VF1000F holds a special place in Honda’s history, since it served as a crucial stepping stone to the legendary VFR series. It’s also hard to look at the old Interceptor now, 40 years on, and not feel a wave of nostalgia for this underappreciated machine.

That’s because it replaced what many consider one of The Motor Co.’s most iconic motorcycles—the Harley-Davidson FXR. Introduced in 1982 as an answer to the sportier bikes coming out of Japan, the FXR quickly became known as a Harley that could carve corners. It was so popular, that Harley brought it back as a limited release in the late 90s, alongside its replacement, the Dyna. Jens vom Brauck isn’t much of a Harley guy, but that hasn’t stopped him from building one of the slickest custom FXRs we’ve seen.

NUEN Moto only burst onto the scene a couple of years ago, but their first made-to-order electric motorcycle, the NUEN N1-S, is ready. And, like everything else we’ve seen from the dynamic Vietnamese brand, it looks sharp as heck. NEUN Moto might be based in Vietnam, but frontman Gia Nguyen founded the company while working as a multi-disciplinary designer in Sweden.

Country of original delivery: Belgium Chassis/VIN: 13309 Mileage: 6,560 km (4,076 miles) Colour: Rosso Original color of delivery: Marrone Metallizzato 106-M-73 Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Ferrari. The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona, represented the epitome of front-mounted V12 Ferraris from 1968 to 1996. Launched in 1968, it marked the only front-mounted V12, 2-seater Ferrari for almost 30 years. The car featured a 4.4L, 352-horsepower V12 Colombo engine (the penultimate model to utilize this engine), clear-lensed headlights, and circular rear lights. This car, born in stunning Marrone Metallizzato paint (on black interior), benefitted from very special treatment from Ferrari, as it was once owned by a relative of Didier Pirroni (Formula 1 driver for Ferrari in the early 80's), who directly commissioned his employer to perform a nut-and-bolt restoration on this Daytona. This resulted in what is arguably one of the earliest known restoration projects undergone by Ferrari. The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona initially featured fixed headlights behind a plexiglass cover (Plexi) for a sleek, streamlined front-end design. However, in 1971, regulatory changes (particularly in the U.S.) required Ferrari to replace these with pop-up headlights to meet new safety standards, as the Plexi setup was deemed less durable. The change created a subtle design shift, with the Plexi version now considered more desirable among collectors due to its rarity and, arguably cleaner, more distinctive look. Continue...",

    "title": "Want to drive a historic race car on the Goodwood track? You can!",
    "link": "",
    "description": "So you’ve been to Goodwood Revival, or lapped up the TV coverage, and of course you’ve loved it. And if you were there in period dress, you’ve truly been part of it already. But how about really living the experience? How about trying a few of the cars on track? Well that’s now possible, with Goodwood offering corporate track experiences in a variety of historic race cars. Participants on one of these new Goodwood Revival Experience days get to try several (typically eight) very different cars, with instructors sat alongside. This seems quite an opportunity, and we were keen to try it out. The days are run by Goodwood’s Ultimate Driving chief instructor David Brise, not only a driver of some repute, but of the same family that gave us Formula 1 star Tony Brise (sadly killed in the same plane crash that ended Graham Hill’s life), and Tony’s father John Brise, multiple World Stock Car Championship winner. David is keen to point out that these are not out-and-out race cars, but in many cases they’re only one step away, and most have a strong race history. ‘We cater for everyone here, for those who’ve never been on a track to experienced racers. Some of the latter might think “I don’t remember a Mk2 understeering that much”, but these cars still provide a fantastic experience that you won’t get anywhere else.’ Crucially, all have full rollcages and harnesses, and all but the Jaguar Mk2 are on race rubber, Avon CR6ZZs. Mostly, the engines have simply been detuned a little for improved longevity and driveability. As much fun as it sounds to be revving a 1960s engine to 8000rpm, that would result in little or no power below 5000rpm, and an engine life of just a few of these corporate days. To further ensure longevity, the engines are fitted with electronic revlimiters, set 1000rpm below the ideal redline for each car. That means that even if someone changes down too soon, which the revlimiter can’t protect against, it’s still unlikely that the mistake will result in mechanical catastrophe. The downside is that most of these engines hit their limiters at a relatively low 5000rpm, but it’s a fair price to pay for the privilege of driving such valuable machinery, and higher gearing is being investigated for some of the cars. There’s a further twist too, that only Goodwood could get away with: breakfast, briefings, tea breaks, lunch and afternoon tea are all interrupted by ‘Viv the spiv’ and the Goodwood road-mending crew, adding a bit of lighthearted period comedy to an occasion that anywhere else would be rather serious. There’s nothing like a few truly terrible jokes or a pair of ‘workmen’ tripping over a tape measure to dispel pre-track nerves. And if that doesn’t work for you, there are also the ever-smiling Glamour Cabs girls… The price for these corporate sessions start at £12,400 for a half day with a group of 12, up to £20,000 for a full day with a group of 20. Understandably pricey, given that every car has its own dedicated instructor, and every car is valuable and requires meticulous maintenance and preparation. So, onto the fleet – or if you want to find out more, see the Goodwood website 1969 Alfa Romeo Giulia 105 Coupé This is the 2-litre version; it’s on race cams and an open diff! explains David. ‘And it sounds lovely!’ He’s not wrong. It sounds sweet even as we sit in the pitlane awaiting the first session. It’s a gorgeous day, the track is dry and the Alfa feels ready and willing, though in typical Italian style it’s a bit of a stretch to the steering wheel even with the seat set slightly too close for leg comfort. A feeling accentuated by being held in tight by the race harness. The gearstick is long, the shift equally so, but the controls are light, and the engine is tractable enough to make a sharp exit onto the circuit a cinch. There’s no-one else on track yet, so straight over to the left side of the track and then into the first corner, Madgwick, with its double apex. Generally it’s best not to bother getting too close to the first apex but concentrate on getting the second apex correct for a fast exit towards Fordwater. My instructor calmly points out braking points, doesn’t cringe when I miss third gear. The change is not just long but a bit rubbery, and it takes some getting used to. And suggests a gentle lift for the usually flat-out Fordwater while the tyres are still cold. Then it’s into St Mary’s, which is so satisfying when tackled correctly, but in this case I’m still battling the gearchange, and down to Lavant for a long smooth turn out onto the Lavant Straight. The Alfa’s steering is light, and although there’s a little bit of play (as is typical of these Alfas) it still feels precise, aided and abetted by wonderfully taut suspension. Down Madgwick straight, a long stretch to persuade the stick into fifth (I heard someone comment later that fifth was ‘virtually between the instructor’s legs!’) and we probably hit 90-100mph before the revlimiter and the rapidly approaching trickiness of Woodcote end the fun. Brake hard, because Woodcote’s double-apex is harder than it looks, a quick squirt up to the chicane, brake hard again, right-left through the chicane, and past the pits for another lap. After a few more laps, confidence is up, I’m finally mastering the gearchange, and my respect for the Alfa has increased significantly. It’s an absolute pleasure to drive on the track, predictable yet exciting, and despite the race cams it pulls cleanly, loudly singing its Latin song. Fantastico! 1969 MGB Roadster ‘People look at this and think “Oh it’s just an MG” but by the end of the day it’s often the car that they all want another go in,’ says David as he shows us round this understated B Roadster, proudly wearing its works-style glassfibre hardtop. This car shows its race credentials not just in a few light battle scars but in the flimsiness of the lightweight doors and plastic windows, and the rorty exhaust note as the engine fires up. As David goes on to confirm, these seemingly basic FIA-spec MGBs are always much-underrated. And yet it’s a model with Le Mans history and current competiveness in all manner of prestigious international historic motorsport. Of all the cars here, it turns out, it’s the MGB that feels the sportiest just to sit in, because you’re seated low in the cockpit, legs stretched out straight ahead. David jokes that the gearshift requires ‘muscle memory’ because the first-second plane is so close to reverse to the left and to third-fourth to the right. And as with any MGB, the minimal movement from side to side contrasts oddly with the relatively long fore-and-aft of the shift. But it snicks in neatly all the same. The B-series engine is tuned enough to rid it of the unwillingness to rev that defines the standard road car. As a consequence it’s not got a lot of torque low down, but the gear ratios are well-spaced enough for that not to be a problem, and third and fourth are fine for all but the chicane, which needs a quick snick down to second gear. In fact, it couldn’t be easier, even when the rear starts to lose grip a little on Madgwick, because the B’s behaviour is so predictable (in a good way). If there’s any downside to it, it’s that the steering is very heavy, which is a typical MGB trait. It’s mostly due to the unusually high castor angles designed into the MGB’s front suspension. And initially it makes it feel as though the steering is completely dead. Until you re-attune to it – and build some forearm muscle. With more time spent in the MGB, it could feasibly become the car I’d be most comfortable in. And perhaps even quickest in, despite the competition. Never under-estimate an MGB. 1965 Lotus Cortina MkI You might be relieved to hear that this isn’t a genuine Lotus Cortina. But a decent replica, built using the conventional rear axle of later MkIs rather than the slightly fragile A-frame system of the first cars. ‘It’s got the 1600 Lotus Twin Cam engine, all the right suspension, all the bits and bobs,’ confirms David, ‘and it’s really stiff, it feels great to drive.’ Do we agree? Certainly first impressions are good, sat in that airy cabin, its thin pillars making for superb visibility. The white-painted dashboard adds to the light, bright feel, and who wouldn’t appreciate those four gauge pods spread across the centre of the fascia? This is an iconic machine, or a damned good replica of one at least. The gearshift is typical rear-wheel-drive Ford. Short, precise, wonderfully mechanical without feeling overly notchy. Slot it into first, thumbs up from the pitlane marshals, and we’re off. Immediately it feels completely natural to drive. All the controls matched in weight, all perfectly placed, and within half a lap this feels like The One. At every turn it does exactly what you’d expect it to do, its stiff suspension keeping everything in line. You know it will bounce a little and slide when pushed hard but there’s never a nasty surprise here. The engine revs freely, sounding wonderful as its twin sidedraughts gobble in air, but the revelation is the steering, which is lighter and more precise than any 1960s steering box has a right to be. Downsides? The gearing. It’s so low, which would work fine if it was running a race engine, capable of revving to 7-8000rpm (and needing a rebuild every few races). But with the limiter knocking back the power at 5000, the four-speed Cortina is best kept in top for much of the circuit. David is considering raising the gearing, though the downside might be to lose some of that sweetness of response. In fact, low gearing is a small price to pay for the chance to experience a Lotus Cortina on track, replica or not. What a superb machine. 1968 Porsche 912 ‘We’ve only just got this one,’ says David. ‘It’s a 912, so has the four-cylinder engine, not the 911’s six-cylinder – a lot of people claim it’s a Beetle engine, but having had this one apart, and seen the parts prices, I can assure you it’s all Porsche!’ Early short-wheelbase 911s are hugely soughtafter for historic racing and rallying, and of course hugely expensive to match. The 912s look identical, and the smaller, lighter four-cylinder engine makes for much better weight distribution and safer handling, at the cost of losing that six-cylinder wail. This one is currently built to quite a basic specification, and I’ll admit it feels tame compared with most of the others. But the chance to drive an early Porsche round a circuit is not to be sniffed at. And the experience is significantly different from the rest. It starts from the driving position. Cab-forward, feet offset to the centre, accelerator pedal hinged from its base, the long gearlever protruding from a near-flat floor. And sporting a dogleg-first shift pattern, meaning that second is where first would normally be, third where second would be, etc. Oh, and the engine fires up with an air-cooled thrum that could only be Porsche. Or Volkswagen… The gearshift movement is long and rubbery, but it’s never a problem to find the right gear. The accelerator action feels heavy and initially a little awkward, but the clutch, brake and steering are delightfully light and feelsome. In fact, that steering could easily be the best here; on track, it feeds back every undulation, every camber change, in a way that only an early Porsche can. We’re making decent progress, circulating the track smoothly and undramatically, with everything working exactly as it should. The handling feels predictable, none of the famous tail-waywardness showing through at these speeds – and in fact, the 912 is far less prone to that – and the grip through corners is tenacious as long as the car is powered through, keeping weight over the rear. The engine feels strong, unburstable, but undramatic, even when revving hard. And it’s this aural effect, along with the sheer competence of the 912, that makes it perhaps the least exciting of all the cars here – but with more time to explore its abilities, I feel that might change. 1968 Mini Cooper MkII And now for something completely different… Though just how different the Mini would feel is astonishing. ‘A Mini Cooper is really the pinnacle of the St Mary’s Trophy,’ says David, ‘and you’ll see them in fantastic David and Goliath battles with Ford Falcons and Mk2 Jaguars. The front tyres do everything, the rears don’t do anything. You could leave them on for 25 years and they wouldn’t wear out.’ This sounds odd in the extreme. Time to find out. Another airy cabin, this one admittedly rather smaller than the Cortina’s, though the speedometer still feels far, far away in the centre of the dash. The steering wheel, famously, is closer to the horizontal than the vertical plane; since (Mini) time began, the position has been compared with that of a London bus. Still, all else is fine, and everything feels perfectly normal as we pull away down the pitlane and buzz onto the circuit, the little A-series – this one bored out to 1310cc – already revving hard. Mindful of David’s advice, I keep steering movements to the minimum to turn into Madgwick, and yet – whoah! – the little car still turns in far more sharply than expecting, seeming to pivot around the engine as if there’s nothing behind it at all. Disconcerting, because I’m behind it… I have to correct the steering to avoid turning into the kerb, which prompts another larger than expected move across the track. Remember when you first tried a driving game console, and watched your virtual car swing from side to side as your thumb/brain struggled to master the required subtlety of movement? Well that’s how this feels. A few corners in, and it becomes clear. There’s no movement in the suspension, just none at all, and the car’s wheelbase is a mere two metres, and so even the tiniest steering input produces a marked change of direction. Back off the power mid-corner and the rear tyres unload and let go, so the technique is to brake lightly, use the tiniest movement of the steering wheel to turn in, then power through the corner. Seasoned Mini racers will set the car sideways on the entry to the corner and half slide, half bounce through, usually nipping past several cars in the process. However you do it, you can’t fail to have fun. That A-series engine may be basic but it keeps revving away as you tear round the circuit, breathless and giddy from the mix of excitement and hilarity of the Mini driving experience. If you’ve never driven a race-spec Mini on a track before, add it to your bucket list now. Right now. 1960 Jaguar Mk2 3.4 From the sublime… to the Mk2, which it would be tempting to say is as far from the Mini as it’s possible to get, except that the huge Ford Falcon looms large in the distance. Still, the Mk2 provides a remarkable contrast with the Mini, particularly with its opulent interior still intact. ‘It’s the oldest car here,’ says David. ‘In the 1960s, these cars turned up to circuits still with all the leather and walnut. By the mid-1960s, the racers had realised how much was to be gained by losing weight, and they started stripping them out. ‘This Mk2 is really heavy, and you’ll notice that the steering feels a little vague, but the engine is like a little Swiss watch.’ Turns out, he’s almost doing the Mk2 an injustice. It’s another of those cars, like the Lotus Cortina, that feels perfectly natural to drive – it’s just in the Mk2, it has to be driven into the corners at lower speeds… What’s most apparent, though, is how smooth everything about the Mk2 feels. The way it rides, the quality of the controls, the seamless revving of that wonderful engine, and even the steering. The Mk2 has had little more than the rollcage fitment in terms of track preparation, and yet it sails around the circuit as if it were made for it. Boy does it need some steering input though, especially after the twitchy Mini. The weight of the Mk2 and comparatively soft suspension pushes it into inevitable understeer, and in the tighter turns it’s a challenge to twirl the steering wheel enough to persuade the car through. The Vredestein tyres (this is the only car not on the grippier Avons, in deference to its wire wheels) squeal in protest but it makes it every time, and just hunkers down again out of the corner to power along the straights on its long-legged gearing. No top speed frustrations with this one. So, different from the rest but good fun regardless. And every time I think of it, I’m reminded of that remarkable engine, so wonderfully, effortlessly smooth. 1964 Ford Falcon Well if the Jaguar was ridiculous after the sublime Mini, how about a 5-litre Yank Tank? David explains that ‘it’s set up like a race car except one thing – it came with an automatic gearbox on a Hurst [aftermarket] shifter, and we’ve left it in.’ He also mentions that ‘the brakes feels like pressing concrete’ and ‘if it starts to slide, it takes a lot to get it back!’. Hmm… Ever used a Hurst shifter? It’s a wonderful thing. Despite the length of the shifter in the Falcon, each gear selects with a short, precise movement, clicking into place, so it would be perfectly feasible to shift between first, second and third. But today, why not make it a bit easier… from Park to Reverse (click) to Neutral (click) and into Drive (click). The V8’s idle drops slightly, the transmission strains to be let off the leash. We’re waved onto the track, and the big Falcon picks up immediately, shifting quickly into second as it powers towards Madgwick. A shove on the brakes (and they really do need a big shove) and a tentative turn into the corner, ready for a rolling, rollicking experience. But no, the Falcon turns in more precisely, and with way less roll than any car weighing one and a half tonnes should ever achieve. In fact, that huge expanse of near-flat bonnet stretching out ahead remains, well, near-flat through the corners, only showing any significant lean through the chicane. Of course, the weight is always apparent, never more so than at Lavant, when an earlier turn-in is needed than for the smaller saloons, and even then the Falcon pushes wide, threatening to run over the kerbing until it powers out the other side, its 302cu-in V8 thundering as it revs out in second gear. And the auto ‘box? Remarkable really. David says that a lot of customers find it a relief to be able to concentrate on the track. And on steering the car, rather than worrying about gears, and it’s very easy to see their point. All you need to remember is that the three-speed Borg-Warner won’t shift up if your foot is flat on the accelerator due to the kickdown function (just lift momentarily and it will quickly change up a gear). Sure it would be more fun with a manual, but if hustling a car the size of a small house around a tight English circuit isn’t fun, I’m not sure what is. 1965 BMW 1800 TI/SA There was just one disappointment of the day, and that was that we didn’t get to drive the BMW. Fear not, this was only because our day was cut short for the interviews. And photoshoot necessary to bring you this very feature, so you’ll get more time. All the same, it’s worth knowing about this car, because it’s a bit special. In the mid-1960s. BMW built homologation specials for touring car racing based around the 1800TI, called the 1800 TI/SA. It had 20bhp extra, thanks to twin Weber carburettors, larger inlet valves, hot camshaft and a higher compression ratio. It was also fitted with a five-speed ZF gearbox in place of the standard car’s four-speeder, uprated suspension and brakes. And a sportier interior. In the hands of Hubert Hahne and Rauno Aaltonen in particular, the TI/SA achieved notable successes. This car isn’t a genuine SA but a replica, good enough to have FIA papers. And accurate right down to having the interior painted a different colour (red) from the exterior, just as the works cars were. ‘When it came to us it was fitted with a full race engine,’ says David. ‘It would rev up to 8500 but there was nothing below 4500. We’ve had to detune it to make it more suitable for our purposes, but it’s still really exciting to drive – and so noisy!’ The Goodwood Revival Experience Wistfully watching the BMW circulate the track as time ticked by, it was clear that it was making swift progress. And all who drove it said how well it performed, though even with the correct dogleg-first ZF gearbox. The low overall gearing meant that it was hitting the revlimiter on the Lavant Straight. If you’re lucky enough to sample the Goodwood Revival Experience. Be sure not to overlook the apparently humble BMW. It may well surprise you.

    "title": "A restored and remastered Mini by David Brown Automotive",
    "link": "",
    "description": "You can't overstate the importance of the Mini to a certain generation of British drivers. Most often, there was a Mini in the family. It was the car you learned to drive in. Then another – likely more battered – example would have been your first car. That emotional thread runs through your automotive psychology like the stitching in a pair of jeans. Car of the 20th Century: Mini A Mini is ordinary. For the owner of this car, Will Yearsley – and for me come to that – it's the most ordinary vehicle of our youth. Except of course it isn't. It's anything but ordinary. The Mini got itself voted, in more than one authoritative poll, the “Car of the 20th Century”.   With justification. Because of the Coopers, the Monte Carlo Rally wins, and its ability to beat much more powerful cars in track racing. Because of its place in London's swinging ’60s scene. And also for the vastly significant engineering innovations that make it a piece of packaging genius, and – now as then – a particular kind of joy to drive.  So Yearsley has acquired some Minis. Not a barn full of quasi-random examples, but a perfectly curated capsule collection.   It starts with a ‘proper’ 1969 1275cc Cooper S, in almond green with an old english white roof. That was the heyday of the ADO15 Mini's four-decade production span. During the 1980s the Mini frankly became a bit of a laughing stock as a new car: full-featured modern superminis had displaced it in the general public's eyes.  It got a new lease of life during the 1990s as Rover, Mini's owner, saw its potential as a left-field curio and moved it out of the mainstream market. John Cooper returned to add some sparkle. So Yearsley also has one of those, one that actually once belonged to the Cooper family.  He's also got the maddest of the BMW Minis, a John Cooper Works GP3, the wide-arched one with 306HP and a 164mph top speed. But then he wanted a Mini that was truly his own. So he commissioned his fourth, a Mini Remastered by David Brown Automotive. These are ground-up restomods, building an original identity into an entirely new car. (Oh, the name… David Brown is a British industrialist but no relation to David Brown, the late British Industrialist who once owned Aston Martin.)  Yearsley's is registered and chassis-plated as a 1989 Sprite, one of Rover's more feeble limited editions. Its origin is wholly irrelevant to our story, except that the 1989 identity allows it to swerve some bothersome new-car legislative constraints. That time-slipping has also enabled DBA to sell several of its Remastered cars to the Americas. Continue...",

    "title": "Ferrari 330 P4 Chassis 0856: the whereabouts of Miss Universe 1967",
    "link": "",
    "description": "1967: it was the summer of love. And a busy time for the Ferrari 330 P4, arguably the sexiest race car ever designed. The world of motorsport is filled with legendary vehicles, but few can match the allure and mystique of the 1967 Ferrari 330 P4. And more specifically chassis 0856, the only one (among the three built) that never got any damage or modification. In short, the current chassis 0856 is pretty much the same that it was in 1967. One Sexy Beast \"One Sexy Beast\", as we claimed when we created our film about chassis 0856, a few years ago at Circuit Mont-Tremblant in Canada. Revered as one of the greatest racing cars ever built, this specific P4 not only represents a pinnacle of engineering excellence but also carries a rich history that includes an array of noteworthy owners. Its story is a testament to Ferrari's ingenuity, competitive spirit, and timeless appeal. But what has happened to this specific unit? In this feature story, we are trying to keep up with Miss Universe 1967. [embed]https://youtu.be/awArTC8iQ3Q?si=XEFCOD6_X6OvFw9j[/embed] Origins of the Ferrari 330 P4 But first, some context. The mid-1960s marked a period of intense rivalry in the world of endurance racing. Ferrari, with its illustrious history and competitive edge, was locked in a fierce battle with Ford, whose GT40 had been making significant strides on the racing circuit. To reclaim its dominance, Ferrari developed the 330 P4, a car designed to be the ultimate racing machine. This vehicle would become one of the most iconic sports prototypes ever created. A Design Masterpiece The Ferrari 330 P4 was an evolution of the 330 P3, with substantial improvements aimed at enhancing performance, handling, and aerodynamics. The body was designed by Pininfarina, featuring an elegant yet aggressive profile. With its sleek lines, low-slung stance, and distinctively wide rear, the P4 exuded an aura of speed even when standing still. Underneath its stunning exterior, the 330 P4 housed a 4.0-liter V12 engine. This engine was a marvel of engineering, producing around 450 horsepower. It incorporated advanced features such as a double overhead camshaft (DOHC), Lucas fuel injection, and a 12:1 compression ratio. Paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, this powertrain enabled the P4 to achieve blistering speeds and impressive agility on the track. Cutting-Edge Aerodynamics and Engineering The chassis of the 330 P4 was crafted from tubular steel, with fiberglass body panels providing a lightweight yet robust frame. The car's suspension system featured independent suspension with wishbones and coil springs, ensuring optimal handling and responsiveness. Ventilated disc brakes offered superior stopping power, a crucial factor in the demanding world of endurance racing. Aerodynamics played a pivotal role in the P4's design. Every curve and contour was meticulously shaped to minimize drag and maximize downforce. The car's streamlined nose, curved windshield, and strategically placed air intakes contributed to its exceptional aerodynamic efficiency, allowing it to glide through the air with minimal resistance. The Glory of Chassis 0856 Among the three Ferrari 330 P4s produced (plus the P3 converted to P4 specs), chassis 0856 is the most celebrated, having played a crucial role in Ferrari's racing triumphs during the 1967 season. Like we mentioned above, its current condition is pristine and to its original specifications. The 1967 season was a critical year for Ferrari. The team aimed to reclaim their status as the undisputed leaders in endurance racing, and the 330 P4 was at the forefront of this mission. Chassis 0856 was a key player in this endeavor, contributing significantly to Ferrari's success. Continue...",

    "description": "Auto racing is Angelica Fuentes’s passion. At sixteen, she became a Mexican champion. Now she is racing the toughest road race in the world, La Carrera Panamericana. She and Gabriel Perez have won this race before. Now, they are trying to win it again. However, racing 2,000 miles in seven days is tough, with their 1954 Studebaker Commander.

All these conspire to make the Carrera Panamericana seven-day endurance event wild and grueling. The Carrera Panamericana is a Mexican motorsport challenge like no other. It remains the most challenging open road race in the world. Drivers from across the globe come to race through Mexico’s rugged mountains and beautiful cites. Fans throughout Mexico line the roadways to watch the cars go by, and people around the world follow every stage online. Furthermore, the 15-18 hour days take their toll as drive teams and mechanics work around the clock to prep and repair their cars so they are ready for the next day. Between 1950 and 1954, the Carrera Panamericana was known as one of the most dangerous and deadly of the open road races popular in the era. It was created to publicize the new 2,200-mile north-south Mexican segment of the Pan-American Highway. The Mexican government funded the race as a way of attracting attention to the new business opportunities afforded by the new highway. During this time, 25 people were killed, including drivers and spectators. As a result, the race was cancelled after the 1954 race. Continue...",

    "description": "What does the collector car community need more than anything else? Young technicians, of course. There is a severe lack of youths finding themselves in automotive restoration positions. Without the hands needed to repair, maintain, and preserve classic vehicles, car culture has a real employment crisis on its hands. Yet paradoxically, there are more than enough young. And passionate car enthusiasts considering a career with classic cars. So, what’s the problem? Why aren’t these young people ending up in exciting car careers? Unfortunately, overcoming the hurdles required in order to make it as a budding technician is extremely challenging. Not to mention leaving no practical means to enter the trade. This is where the Piston Foundation enters the chat. [avatar user=\"Piston Foundation\" size=\"120\" align=\"left\"  link=\"https://pistonfoundation.org\" target=\"_blank\"][/avatar] Visit the Piston Foundation website The solution The Piston Foundation was founded in 2021 to solve the workforce shortage plaguing the collector car community. We’re creating a career pathway that will support aspiring technicians from the classroom to the car shop floor. Here’s how we aim to do it: The Piston Scholarship provides financial aid to those enrolled in a 2- to 4-year auto tech or restoration program. Technical education is expensive and those tuition costs can pose a real barrier to entry into the world of cars. Students who apply and are accepted for a scholarship may receive up to $5,000 to help fund their automotive education. To date, we’ve granted scholarships to 33 promising students and are looking forward to announcing our 2024 class of scholars later this summer. The Piston Academy Apprenticeship takes hands-on training to the next level by taking qualified restoration graduates and placing them in a full-time job at a Piston-partnered shop. Even graduates from the best restoration programs won’t have gained all the necessary hands-on experience to land a full-time, billable job. As such, the biggest barrier new apprentices face is the disparity between what they can be paid in an entry level role and the cost of living needed to reside in their city of work. The Piston Academy’s apprenticeship program provides a training grant so apprentices can gain the necessary work experience and shops can afford to invest in a new wave of talent. The apprenticeship is currently in a trial stage with a widespread model potentially slated for 2025. [embed]https://youtu.be/XLJkpbIr0Go?si=jc1HHLmiUpk8Vgrz[/embed] How does the Piston Foundation measure the success and impact of its programs and initiatives? Asking the question to Piston Foundation President and COO Jeff Mason: \"The Piston career initiative supports aspiring technicians with both education and job networking. This way, they can learn the skills that earn them a job in the collector car industry. We measure our success by the number of scholarship applications we receive, the number of returning Piston Scholars,  the school-year completion rate of our scholars, and the number of graduated Piston scholars working in the industry. Since our career program began in 2022, Piston has awarded 53 scholarships totaling $197,500 to auto restoration students at schools in Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Ohio, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, and our applicants have come from 37 states. In 2024, Piston received its highest number of scholarship applications yet, indicating a strong interest in these careers. Nine of this year’s 20 scholars have earned an award more than once, with one three-time recipient. The completion rate of Piston Scholars since 2022 is 98% and all nine of our scholars who have graduated from their school programs are now working in the industry. The Piston career initiative is making the impact our donors want to see by creating a pipeline of talent who will help the car community continue to thrive.\" Continue...",

    "title": "Jaguar XJR-15 LM: The most radical supercar you've never heard of",
    "link": "",
    "description": "The Jaguar XJR-15 LM was a marvel of engineering that embodies the spirit of Jaguar's racing heritage. Its exclusivity, performance capabilities, and unique design made it a legendary vehicle among automotive aficionados and a true icon of its era. But it was (and still is) so rare than it's almost impossible to find documentation or even photos about this supercar. To tell the story of the Jaguar XJR-15 LM, we need to travel back to the 1980s, a decade when car design was radically taking off. While Japan was innovating with sports car, or in the US which was perfecting boring economy cars, let's focus in on Great Britain. Where the story starts: the 80s and Le Mans The 1980s Le Mans races were a full-on war. Porsche was dominating with the 1985, 1986, and 1987 Le Mans wins under their belt. But slowly, under the surface, you could see Porsche slipping, desperate to stay at the top. In ‘85, Porsche finished first through fifth, all winners running the legendary 962C. Just two short years later, at the 1987 Le Mans, Porsche had lost two spots out of the top five to Cougar and their C20, and Jaguar with their XJR-8. The pivotal moment came in the 1988 race. Jaguar stunned everyone by snatching first place from the infamous king Porsche, with their XJR-9 LM. Tom Walkinshaw racing (TWR) was the team that ran Jaguar’s cars in motorsport, and the road cars under the Jaguar Sport brand, a joint venture between TWR and Jaguar. They were the ones running the XJR-9 LM and so, with the newly gained fame from toppling the Germans from their throne, TWR set out to create a supercar that the XJ220 dreamed of being. Here comes the XJR-15 This led to the development of the XJR-15. The story goes that wealthy enthusiasts approached TWR wanting a road legal XJR-9, which certainly wasn’t a thing. So TWR reused the old engine the XJ220 was supposed to use, a 6.0 liter V12, and stuffed it into the chassis that the XJR-9 used, creating a 490 HP beast. They brought Peter Stevens on board to help design the outside of this raging beast, the same Peter Stevens who designed the holy McLaren F1 later on, and he was given a blank slate to use his magic on. [embed]https://youtu.be/FKbVQEBuemQ?si=02ilW7cRaxQs3QqY[/embed] Well, that's the XJR-15, albeit heavily summarized. Interestingly, it came with a communication system with headsets and a microphone which both the driver and passenger wear to communicate, as that massive screaming V12 behind you isn't the conducive to small talk. Now, let's talk XJR-15 LM. Information regarding this car is scarce online, which is personally makes it so interesting. This is, I feel, the most complete record of the car on the internet, creating a definitive guide. Continue...",

    "title": "GT40 Panamericano, the film: A team challenges tradition to race a Le Mans car in Mexico’s famous road race",
    "link": "",
    "description": "Karlo Flores left México when he was sixteen. He came back to race La Carrera Panamericana, the world’s toughest road race. This time, he and his team are challenging tradition. And racing something no one has ever seen at La Carrera, the world-famous Le Mans car, the GT40. It’s a big risk, but if the car survives and the fans like it, it will all be worth it. A they made a film about the whole adventure in Mexico: GT40 Panamericano We are launching our new series \"Classic Racing\" with this first film produced by our partners at Driving La Carrera. This is the first segment of many more to come in this series. And what better way to start that the a legendary car, the Ford GT40, at a legendary event, La Carrera Panamericana. The Classic Racing series is dedicated to the beauty of race vehicles of all ages, and the emotional connection we this still have with them. Only one condition: regardless of their age, those cars and bikes still have to race, no excuse! [embed]https://youtu.be/pJqRXpAmtm0?si=zq5lL7gr03OlOIuw[/embed] The History Of La Carrera Panamericana Twisting roads, uneven surfaces, natural hazards, vertical drop offs, lack of sleep. All these conspire to make the Carrera Panamericana seven-day endurance event wild and grueling. The Carrera Panamericana is a Mexican motorsport challenge like no other. It remains the most challenging open road race in the world. Drivers from across the globe come to race through Mexico’s rugged mountains and beautiful cites.

During this time, 25 people were killed, including drivers and spectators. As a result, the race was cancelled after the 1954 race. La Carrera Panamericana Revival The Carrera Panamericana was revived in 1988 with increased safety requirements. Mandated equipment and clothing rivals that used in Formula One and Indy. Today it is run as a stage race, similar to the original, but with a combination of “speed” stages and “transit” stages. Speed stages are timed, closed-road races that require entrants to get from point A to point B in the shortest amount of time. This requires driving flat out along winding mountain roads that pass through small villages, along cliffs, and through wooded sections of forest. There is a reason the roll-cages used are thicker than in other races - the 500-foot drop offs have something to do with it. Transit stages are run as a time-speed distance (TSD) rally, with driver and navigator attempting to finish a stage at a specific time. The combination of scoring in both types of stages determines the overall winner. More reading about La Carrera Panamericana No Race On Earth Is Like La Carrera Panamericana Continue...",

    "title": "Top 10 Motorsport Films",
    "link": "",
    "description": "Motorsport films captivate audiences by combining high-speed action with dramatic storytelling, offering a thrilling glimpse into the world of racing. Classics like \"Le Mans\" (1971) with Steve McQueen, and \"Grand Prix\" (1966), deliver realistic portrayals of legendary races and drivers. Hits like \"Rush\" (2013) highlight intense rivalries and historical battles in motorsport. Motorsport films such as \"Senna\" (2010) provide an intimate look at the lives of iconic racers. While motorsport films like \"Days of Thunder\" (1990) emphasize the excitement and danger of racing culture. Together, these motorsport films celebrate the passion, competition, and human stories that define the thrilling world of motorsport. 10. Days of Thunder Days of Thunder may have assembled the old band back together. But even with the director, producers and leading man Tom Cruise carrying over, Top Gun did not seamlessly transfer to terre ferme. But in its favour, the NASCAR adrenaline hit is an easy-to-watch Hollywood thriller. It’s by no measure a masterclass in subtlety as young and raw talent Cole Trickle tries to make it on America’s ovals. But with that said, the cast ensemble is impressive and the movie’s pacing spot on. As an appreciation of the USA’s biggest motorsport, it’s a far better production that Talladega Nights. PetroFact: The film lent its name to the short-lived Days of Thunder ASCAR series that raced around Rockingham Motor Speedway in the mid-2000s. 9. McLaren Opening onto the McLaren M8D Can-Am racer and listening to its rumbling Chevrolet V8 is a lesson in how to engage an audience. With plenty of footage and audio to celebrate the life and legacy of company founder Bruce McLaren, the film tracks humble origins through to F1 and Can-Am success. Former mechanics of the company are drafted in to explain what made the man so great and why they had such undivided loyalty to him. The recreation of some scenes is jarring at times but to say this is nitpicking is testament to how good the film is. PetroFact: Footage is used from the classic American Western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. 8. Truth in 24 (I and II) In the same year Death Race was released, Jason Statham was back to narrate 2008’s Truth in 24. Another attempt as honing in on what makes the 24 Hours of Le Mans so special. The movie follows Audi Sport in its attempt to take the spoils of glory for a fifth consecutive year despite the threat of newly established rival Team Peugeot. Director Keith Crossrow is open that he was not a racing fan when he took on the role. And it shows, but all for the better as it appeases audiences regardless of their interests. PetroFact: Statham was an Audi brand ambassador following the release of Transporter 3 in which he pilots an A8. 7. 1 1 celebrates F1’s safety crusade. You watch the opening laps of the 1996 Australian Grand Prix as Martin Brundle’s Jordan is launched into the air before coming to a rest upside down. Able to clamber out of the wreckage and run back to the pit-lane. He hops in the spare car to take the race restart. From there, audiences are taken back in time and guided through the landmark fatalities and safety step changes that helped make 200mph crashes survivable. It’s a perfectly judged tone but what makes the film stand out are the interviews. Bernie Ecclestone, Max Mosley and Sid Watkins all star. PetroFact: 1 is narrated by Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender 6. Ford v Ferrari Ford v Ferrari (2019) is a riveting biographical drama that chronicles the intense rivalry between Ford Motor Company and Ferrari, culminating in the historic 1966 Le Mans race. Directed by James Mangold, the film stars Matt Damon as visionary automotive designer Carroll Shelby and Christian Bale as fearless driver Ken Miles, capturing their collaboration to create a revolutionary race car, the Ford GT40. The movie excels in its dynamic portrayal of high-speed racing and the personal struggles of its protagonists, though some critics argue it simplifies complex historical events for dramatic effect. Overall, Ford v Ferrari delivers a thrilling and heartfelt exploration of friendship, innovation, and the pursuit of excellence in the face of corporate and personal adversity. PetroFact: To authentically recreate the high-speed action of the Le Mans race, the production team used a mix of practical effects and CGI. However, the actors often found themselves in real cars, racing at significant speeds on the tracks. 5. Ferrari For us, Michael Mann's Ferrari is an instant classic. Released at the end of 2023, this biographical drama delves into the tumultuous life of Enzo Ferrari, during the pivotal summer of 1957. Starring Adam Driver as Enzo Ferrari, Penélope Cruz as Laura Ferrari, and Shailene Woodley as Lina Lardi, the film explores Ferrari's personal and professional challenges, including his strained marriage, financial struggles, and the high-stakes world of auto racing. The narrative is set against the backdrop of the Mille Miglia, that becomes a symbol of both Ferrari's ambition and the tragic consequences of his relentless pursuit of success. Mann's direction captures the high-octane energy and the nuanced emotional landscapes of the characters. Critics have praised the performances, particularly Driver's portrayal of Ferrari, for capturing the complexity of a man driven by passion and haunted by loss. \"Ferrari\" offers a visually stunning and compelling glimpse into the world of racing and the man behind the brand, making it a must-watch for car enthusiasts and fans of historical dramas. The only problem we had with the film is that it was too short - we wanted more! PetroFact: During the filming of \"Ferrari\", Michael Mann sought authenticity and realism, especially in the depiction of the famous Mille Miglia race scenes. To achieve this, Mann shot everything in Italy and collaborated with Ferrari enthusiasts and owners who owned vintage Ferraris from the era depicted in the film.

Senna It’s thanks to Senna that many motorsport films have followed in its wake in recent times. Capturing the ill-fated career of one of motorsport’s greatest icons reignited the hunger for delving into racing’s past. It’s not perfect, however. The need to cast a villain in every film results in a scathing and misleading portrayal of Senna’s closest rival Alain Prost. And to those not well-versed in Senna’s driving talents, perhaps the politics he faced outweighs the screen time given to him driving on the limit. Nevertheless, it’s worthy of its place on this list and was received with huge critical and commercial success. PetroFact: The film raked in £375,000 on its opening weekend, a UK box office record for a documentary. 3. Rush Retelling the story of the inimitable 1976 Formula 1 season, Rush follows the championship rivalry between McLaren’s James Hunt and Ferrari driver Niki Lauda. The story of a flawed playboy versus Lauda’s recovery from a near-fatal crash at the Nürburgring and of taking title glory down to the wire was always going to make for a great script. Directed by Ron Howard, of Happy Days and Apollo 13 fame, it’s aimed squarely at the motorsport apathetic. It’s exciting and visually stimulating but takes Hollywood-style liberties in recounting the past. Perhaps it’s not a purist’s favourite, but Rush is undeniably entertaining. PetroFact: Many of the cars featured were prepared and driven by historic racing specialist Hall and Hall. It’s based in the small town of Bourne, home to 1962 F1 constructors champions BRM. 2. Le Mans He may have relinquished a starring role in Grand Prix due to conflicts with the crew, but five years later Steve McQueen starred in the motorsport film he had always wanted to make. There’s a certain pleasure to be derived in knowing that the main star was a true motoring enthusiast. And that shows throughout the movie as Le Mans captures the scale, emotions and danger of the world’s greatest race. McQueen is as close to perfect in the role as is his co-starring Porsche 917. But like many on this list, it’s definitely a harder sell to mainstream cinema-goers. PetroFact: All the Ferraris featured had to be privately sourced as the marque wouldn’t lend its cars to the film depicting a Porsche victory. 1. Grand Prix It’s far too long and is interspersed with a contrived love story, but nevertheless, Grand Prix is a class act. Its main asset is that it’s the cars and circuits that star, not the actors. Although it was released in 1966, the film still feels remarkably fresh and that’s mostly down to the stunning picture quality and visceral engine notes. There’s fun to be had spotting the cameo appearances from various 1960s grand prix drivers, and there’s plenty of time to get it right with a near three-hour running time. PetroFact: Steve McQueen withdrew his interest from the lead role, which ended up going to James Garner, his next door neighbour. Continue...",

    "title": "Is the new Ferrari Purosangue a future classic?",
    "link": "",
    "description": "Photos by Michael Shelford Foresight would be a wonderful talent, wouldn’t it? A decent dollop of precognizance could keep us from danger, lead to some smart investments and win the odd lottery. But sadly, none of us can see into the future – although some may contest that (which is a different discussion for a different magazine.) The classic car market has flourished over the years particularly now as the petrol-headed world is changing, making cars that you wouldn’t expect to be rare to to become rare. Anything with a V8 for instance, or lack of a turbo. Or generally anything that uses petrol (diesel too at some point). So how does one have oneself an automotive premonition? Can we judge a future classic when we see one or do we need to give it some perspective? When we saw What’s Eating Gilbert Grape? did we know DiCaprio would become one of the worlds’ greats? or did we know on first listening that Hallelujah would cement Leonard Cohen in the world’s consciousness forever? Ferrari Purosangue in the Tuscan countryside: why not I had an opportunity to try and weigh up this debate when I found myself touring the stunning Tuscan countryside in Ferrari’s latest range-bending model – the Purosangue. Thoroughbred by name but is it also by nature? There’s a little gentle controversy around the model as the brand are fully committed to saying that it isn’t an SUV. I’m here to see that, if it isn’t, then what is it? Continue...",

It moved upmarket (shedding the two-year DeVille association) and joined the exclusive Fleetwood assembly line with the Sixty Special and Seventy-Five models. And part of its new upper-crust lifestyle meant a reduction in chrome trappings in addition to its refreshed corporate appearance.",
