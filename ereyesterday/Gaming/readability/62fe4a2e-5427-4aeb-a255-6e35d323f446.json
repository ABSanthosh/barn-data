  "text": "SummaryThe Lonesome Guild is a vibrant and heartfelt action RPG that explores the power of togetherness in a world struggling with loneliness.Tiny Bull Studios is an indie games studio passionate about experimenting with game design and storytelling.The Lonesome Guild is planned to launch in Fall 2025 for Xbox Series X|S. At Tiny Bull Studios, we wanted to create a game that reflects the deep human need for connection, which emphasizes the power of friendship and collaboration in overcoming adversity. While combat and exploration are key elements of The Lonesome Guild, the game places relationships at the heart of its experience. Making a game about friendship and connection is very important to us. The Lonesome Guild was conceived in 2020, which was a period of isolation for a lot of us. It highlighted how much loneliness can affect mental health, relationships, and even self-identity. We saw an opportunity to create a game that doesn’t just entertain but inspires people to reflect on the importance of reaching out, supporting others, and ultimately finding strength in companionship. We believe that what truly sets our game apart from other ARPGs is its unique relationship system, which directly impacts gameplay. Instead of characters being mechanically interchangeable, the bond between them shapes their abilities, interactions, and progression – so you won’t just assemble your party for their skills, but you’ll nurture them and unlock new powers and quests based on their emotional growth.   Designing an ARPG with these relationship elements has been an adventure and a challenge for us. The team had to create a meaningful connection between the character progression, their narrative arc, and dialogue. Our biggest challenge was permeating the design with the idea that the actions taken by the player help improve the bond between this budding group of friends, all of which share a common goal but have different and Indvidual dreams and needs. This togetherness feature transpires not only in the narration, but also in the exploration and combat; the most impactful abilities can only be used if two or more party members are co-operating. Collaboration is key especially in the real-time challenging battles that await players. Together, they can share buffs or perform unique abilities that can turn the tide of battle. We hope the system incentivizes players to play with every character! Each of them has their own skill tree which players can progress through by growing closer to them through dialogue choices, exploration, and side quests. We’re already so excited for people to explore the vibrant world of Etere and we can’t wait to see not only the bonds between the characters, but between players and our ragtag bunch of friends too. With our 6 diverse characters each representing a different type of loneliness, we’re curious to see how each of their stories will resonate with players. Loneliness is something we all experience, and as our character Ghost, we want players to feel that we are stronger together! You’ll be able to play The Lonesome Guild on Xbox Series X|S in Fall 2025. We can’t wait to share more details about the world of Etere and its colorful characters!",
