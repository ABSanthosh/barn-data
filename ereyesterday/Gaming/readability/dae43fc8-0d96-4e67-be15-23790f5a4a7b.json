  "text": "Welcome to the new year!  Remember last year when I said things were going to be bad in 2024?  Probably not, but I have the link here. In hindsight, I didn’t really allow for how much of that would spill into 2025.  Also, a year ago I really meant being constantly bombarded by all the election nonsense.  I kind of thought the country would make a better choice after that.  I thought it would be temporary nonsense.  But no, we have chosen chaos.  We have chosen a game show reality TV government because… well, we’re dumb… or willfully ignorant… or masters of self-deception. I mean sure, some out there clearly thought sowing the wind sounded really cool and supported sowing in an unabashed, full throated way, pouring billions of dollars into the “pro-sow” candidates.  And now we will spend our time reaping the whirlwind thanks in part to them.  But the result was mostly due to people being incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions.  So shall it be, the people have spoken. The Year is 2025 So here we are on the first day of 2025 and… do I really want to do predictions?  On the one hand, there is a bit of a tradition to maintain at this point.  I mean, look at this record: 2008 – Predictions (silly, mostly wrong) 2009 – Predictions (mostly silly, mostly wrong) 2010 – Predictions (lots of bullet points, mostly wrong) 2011 – Demands (mostly unmet) 2012 – Questions (mostly unanswered) 2013 – Goals (mostly unfulfilled) 2014 – Predictions (serious, mostly wrong again) 2015 – Predictions (serious, mostly wrong as usual) 2016 – Predictions (serious-ish, mostly wrong) 2017 – Predictions (more wrong than usual) 2018 – Predictions (serious and maybe less wrong than usual) 2019 – Predictions (scandalous and mostly wrong) 2020 – Predictions (2020 made me so very wrong) 2021 – Questions (mostly bad answers) 2022 – Predictions (serious and slightly more accurate than usual) 2023 – Questions (That were mostly predictions and surprisingly on point) 2024 – Predictions (Actually, not that bad compared to some years) That is a 17 year streak and I am not about to break that because the world is going to shit… or at least more so than usual. On the other hand, you can see that I don’t have to do predictions every year.  I mean, if you dig into those years when it is something like “Questions,” they really could be seen as predictions.  But they are also different in tone and a bit liberating because you don’t have to focus on a goal, just a possible topic. Predictions for 2025 feel like they will just get too dark too quickly given my current mood.  Likewise, even questions for the new year ran pretty dark when I started sorting some out in my head. So this year I am going to do wishes.  Video game wishes.  Let’s keep this manageable.  You can wish for world peace on your own time.  I am going to list out video game things I want to happen, things I hope will happen, things that might make things better, all in an unsubtle attempt to try and mine some optimism.  We shall see. This is something of a turn around as I usually have to state clearly that just because I predict something doesn’t mean I want it to happen.  Now I get to run with things I actually want to happen. I will state up front I won’t be wishing for anything bad to happen.  No bad mojo.  I will also endeavor to not be completely sarcastic or passive aggressive in my wishes…. but you know that is going to slip, right?  Look, I am influenced by the world around me… and have you seen this place lately?  So cut me some slack.  There might be a barb or two in there, but I want my intentions to be clear and in the right place. And if my wishes don’t come true… well, that isn’t on ME now is it?  I guess.  Better wait until we see what I wish for.  But I am going to be leaning heavily on the cosmos and the goodness of people to make this stuff come true. What I have I got then?  What am I wishing for? 1 – An End to Video Game Industry Consolidation and Mass Layoffs Why start small, right?  If you got wishes, throw them at a big problem.  Unfortunately that lamp I was rubbing the other day… I hope that was a lamp… didn’t promise me anything.  And an “end” might be too big of an ask.  I would consider the wish fulfilled if we could at least see the industry cycle into a hiring phase and maybe hold of with the acquisition slash and burn to make the line go up a tiny fraction this week.  I think I am already off to a bad start with a wish where I won’t be able measure.  I guess I’ll just listen to video game devs and see what they’re complaining about. 2 – News about the next EverQuest title Just don’t call it EverQuest Next!  Man, was that a dumb name.  I am pretty sure that was my stance back whenever… but if it wasn’t, let me say that the name has not grown on me in the mean time. Okay, EG7/Daybreak threw the idea out there of a new EverQuest title back in late 2023… and I know some of us would like to hear a bit more about it.  There was a hint about it being in the ideation phase, but naught else.  And while it was on track for 2028 maybe, I am keen to hear if the ideas for it are still rooted in the whole hardcore, be like Elden Ring thing that Ji Ham was espousing back in 2023.  A bit of hope or a nugget to hang on to, but more than just some concept art.  Lord knows how that screwed us back in the day. 3 – Happy Annual Expansions at Daybreak Easy one here, a gimme for the universe.  Just do the usual Q4 expansions for EQ, EQII, LOTRO, and whatever.  Does Palia get an annual update now too?  I don’t know.  But just carry on. 4 – LOTRO to do Something to Improve Large Monitor Access Look, I don’t need full 4K support.  That was always a pipe dream anyway.  SSG is fully committed to simply maintaining the status quo and adding a bit of content to the game.  The idea, for example, that it was ever going to be ported to consoles was absurd on its face, something I called out when that first came up.  EG7 has since said they would rather spend the money on developing a new game… though Daybreak has been pretty shy on actually producing a “new” game so far. That said, there are probably half a dozen things of small to medium-ish effort that SSG could do that would make the game more viable on large screens.  They could, as an example, get somebody to redo their bitmap skill icons as SVGs so they will not look like ass when you make the the hotbar bigger. (Also an opportunity to make them distinguishable rather than a bunch of red or green blobs with nonsensical iconography, which is something people were calling out back in 2007.) They could make scaling stick for the whole UI, as it reverts to defaults in an annoying number of places between sessions.  And they could work on text and dialogs to make them readable on a 4K monitor… with a universal sizing setting maybe?  I find it extremely annoying to have to tinker with every aspect of the UI and then have half of it revert when I log off. So just fix that shit.  Put in the effort. Haha, I know.  I fully expect this wish to go completely unfulfilled, this is me hoping against hope, but there it is. 5 – Commit to or Let Go Of H1Z1 I know I said no negatives, and I am trying not to go there, but EG7/Daybreak has been living in this delusion for quite a while now where they boost H1Z1 as one of their most important first party franchises at every opportunity while, at the same time, they spend no time or effort on actually doing anything with it.  It has basically sat in limbo for since Nantworks gave up and handed the game back to Daybreak, unable to make anything good out of it. And I know they have talked about a new H1Z1 title.  That was supposed to be in pre-production in the first half of 2024, which means we should have heard some new by now… and we haven’t.  Things don’t always go to plan and that roadmap was pretty squishy, but still… figure it out by the end of 2025; commit or stop pretending it is a thing. 6 – Blizzard to not Mess Up WoW Housing Blizz got a big bounce in hope by announcing that housing was coming to World of Warcraft.  The thing they said they would not do, the thing they half-assed as garrisons it what looked like an attempt to prove their point that housing takes people out of the world, the thing that would probably up the long term subscriber retention rate by 5-10% if done right… yeah, do it… and do it right! What does “right” mean?  I don’t know.  I have a bunch of vague ideas and examples from other titles of things I felt worked and things that I felt did not.  But Blizz and its ability to read the room is not something people have come to count on. We won’t actually GET housing in 2025.  We know that from the roadmap.  But they should be able to give us a substantial view into what they are planning.  So that view plus “doesn’t obviously suck” is the bar here. 7 – WoW Classic Progression to Pick Up the Pace I feel that nearly a year of Cataclysm Classic has proven the point that classic progression servers can advance too slowly, and that isn’t going to get any better with some of the coming expansions.  Find the right pacing Blizz.  Also, this reminds me again that I had better consider how to check to see if my wishes have come true.  Do wishes need to be SMART?  I might not know if this one was granted in 2025. 8 – Blizz to use all that talent and all those resources to make something new They have the money, they have the staff, they can surely find some new idea out in the industry to steal and re-work.  They can’t have lost all their skill in that, can they?  What non-Blizz titles do Blizz devs play now?  Not all Clash of Clans I hope.  That’s it though, isn’t it?  They all just play phone games because they’re mostly in their 20s.  Well, I can still wish I guess. 9 – Valheim to Exit Early Access I suppose removing the “early access” label from Valheim won’t change anything really.  The dirty secret is that early access is your launch and you don’t get another one when you exit.  There won’t be a huge spike in sales or a bunch of new press coverage or any magical change to the game when that hits.  It will just be “done.” But sometimes “done” is enough.  If they deliver the Northlands and wrap up the quest line so that you can finish the game, then that will be good.  They could, if they wanted, go all Hello Games and continue to improve it over time, or it could just immediately go into maintenance mode, as so many early access transition titles do, as the team goes off to work on something else.  Either way, completion is a nice thing.  Maybe it will get some Steam achievements.  That might make me go back and play it one more time. Overall though, I have gotten more than my money’s worth out of Valheim.  I am done, it can be done. 10 – Light No Fire to go Early Access This is what started my whole survival co-op frenzy this past year.  The mention of Hello Games making this stirred me up. I mean, I really want Light No Fire to launch fully formed because, after the evolution of No Man’s Sky into the game it is today, I want their co-op survival title and their take on the genre… even if it will inevitably be controller-centric.  I can deal. But I will take a solid early access and go along for the ride.  How much different would the No Man’s Sky journey have been if it had been early access for the first two years?  Maybe no different… but maybe it would have set expectations that things were going to continue to evolve. 11 – No Man’s Sky to just keep on keeping on While we’re talking about Hello Games, NMS is just a great example of a company committing to a title and just making it better and better over time.  They got robbed on the Labor of Love category in the Steam Awards.  Only NMS and Stardew Valley really met the criteria of the award. 12 – Dune Awakening to have Learned from Conan Exiles On my list for 2025 is Dune: Awakening.  I liked a lot about Conan Exiles, and my hope is that Funcom will have learned from that… I mean, CE has been out more than six years at this point.  I hope that journey has informed them and allowed them to do something cool with the Dune universe.  Going to be an interesting one to judge whether the wish was granted or not. 13 – GoG.com to Continue Thriving I am not one to care much about the monthly free games from Amazon Prime… like I don’t have enough unplayed games in my Steam library already… but when they offer up a code for GoG.com I grab it wholly on the assumption that GoG gets some payment for it and as the old game underdog I want them to succeed and thrive in a way I can only describe as completely opposite to my feelings for the Epic Game Store. (I will not wish bad things on the EGS in this post, but in my heart I might… mostly because Tim Sweeney is a bad person in the way that most US CEOs are bad people.) 14 – CCP to Finally Do What they Know They Need to do to Fix the New Eden Economy Passive aggressive much?  Actually, that assumes they know what they need to do and, given they have spent three years not doing anything of the sort.  So maybe I cannot really argue that this assumption is grounded in any sort of reality.  But still, these are wishes, so may the universe magic that knowledge into CCP Rattati’s fore brain and force him to look away from EVE Vanguard for long enough to tell somebody to implement it. 15 – CCP to Succeed at Something Besides EVE Online Look, I am not happy with some of their choices.  The blockchain game, EVE Frontier, can (and most likely will) die in a fire.  I also do not share the CCP management dream of making a first person shooter, lacking faith in their ability to make something both interesting and unique enough to attract an audience outside of the relatively small New Eden user base.  I am also not at all keen on them putting the biggest fan of said shooter in charge of the spaceship game.  And EVE Galaxy Conquest… whatever. But, it is in the best interest of those of us who still play their one successful title that something else land and become a success, if only to stabilize the company and make Hilmar less keen to steal resources from the game I play to fund his blockchain fantasies.  So if something else could succeed that would be great… and no monkey’s paw where the mobile game makes some money so they abandon EVE Online.  In fact, let me just make a “no damn monkey’s paw” side rule right here. 16 – CCP to Make a Co-op Space Survival Title These are popular, CCP has some of the ground work done.  They have more than 20 years of spaceships and nearly 15 years of FPS work in the bag now, maybe take a different tack and make something more manageable that could find a niche and grow?  Just a thought.  I’d play that… if it was any good at all. 17 – CCP to make the New Eden Strategy Game I Want Hey, wishes are free so while I’m here I might as well throw out the idea one more time about a space 4x strategy title set in New Eden where you can play as the main empires or as a null sec leader or even one of the pirate factions as scenarios that takes a strategic view of war and conquest in the New Ede star cluster.  I don’t care how.  License it to Paradox or something.  Just do it.  I know, the EVE Online IP isn’t at all popular so nobody would actually play it, but just tack a receptive strategy game audience on to the wish and call it done.  We have all the wishes baby! 18 – Andrew Groen to get Empires of EVE vol. III Done It is out there.  He has announced he is working on the third and final volume of his history of null sec and New Eden.  We’re going to hear about World War Bee and the great Siege of 1DQ1-A and Vily’s vendetta and eventually the downfall of The Mittani, which will probably be what brings the story to a close.  And… well… I am eager to read it.  I know it takes time, but that doesn’t mean I can be as patient as I need to be. 19 – Some Actual War in New Eden Andrew Groen could be tempted into a volume 4 if, you know, we did something interesting.  I know, war depends heavily on CCP fixing the economy so alliances are willing to put trillions of ISK on the line.  Also, we need something to fight over and CCP’s scarcity plan has backfired completely in that regard.  I don’t know.  Maybe Gobbins will go on the forums and say “there are no goons” or something.  Send Vily back for a rematch.  Have Brisc and Merk defect to Fraternity.  Let The Initiative start some shit now that they have no blues.  Something. 20 – Some Solid Guild Wars 3 News I know, what we heard was a slip, an accident, but that makes it all the more interesting to find out what is really going on.  I am also interested to hear what a dozen years of GW2 has taught the ANet team and how an third title might differ from the second. 21 – Enshrouded to Keep on their Roll The end of the year game for us was Enshrouded and Keen Games has done a great job with it so for.  I’ll even give them a pass the missing in-game chat.  Turns out I can live without it is the rest of the game is this good.  And a co-op survival builder doesn’t *need* a done state, but it still feels like we should be progressing towards a final boss to cleanse the world or something.  So get us going there, keep expanding, and maybe not so many jumping puzzles. 22 – Keep Extending Stars Reach Playable Worlds still feels like they are a couple years away from Stars Reach being a real, live service game.  The big break through was homesteads and 4 hour play tests this year.  But there was a lot promised in the design pillars that has yet to see the light of day.  Personally, I am waiting for space ships and space travel.  So that is my wish I guess, at least get us to space travel in a test galaxy. 23 – Pokemon Go to level 60 I may regret this wish.  Also, I don’t want this until the end of 2025 so I have some time left to get to 50.  Niantic pretty much has to do this at some point.  There is only so much horizontal progress they can try to pile on.  Anyway, I would consider this fulfilled if they even announced a plan for a level cap increase in 2025.  There are a lot of hardcore fans who have been at level 50 for a long time now. 24 – That Pokemon Black \u0026 White Remake It is the next on the list of old Pokemon titles that have not been remade.  It might get me to put my Switch Lite back on the charger and play with it now and then.  I wasn’t keen on it as a title when it launched, but when I went back and played it on the 3DS one last time to complete all the pre-Switch titles, I found it had quite a bit to recommend it. 25 – Hope for the Hermit Kingdom Unchained I would like to see Unchained Entertainment… once City State Entertainment, but there was a name change due to unstated reasons… shit or get off the pot when it comes to Camelot Unchained.  Mark Jacobs and his team have been running a propaganda mill about how wonderful things are and how much progress there has been for a decade now, to the point that I don’t think comparisons with the North Korean Central News Agency are unjust. Of course, I also want to know what horrible stain Marc Andreesen and his tainted, string laden cash has left on the company and the game.  There was a promise of some sort of access in late 2025… but there was also a promise of access in 2014, so lies on top of lies seems to be the norm.  So, you know, do something already?  That is positive, right? 26 – Civilization VII to Not Be a Bloated Train Wreck There is a long standing tradition in the Civ series of shipping something that really requires the next generation of computers to run.  Also bugs, crashes, and a game that really doesn’t settle down until we’ve been sold at least one post-launch expansion pack.  I’d like a new Civ game… almost as much as I would like Civ II to be brought up to date… but I have also been there since the dawn of the original… roll that ancient magic quote about being there when they were written… and it has always been a bit of a nightmare on launch.  So here is hoping that Sid’s likely final launch for the series is smoother than tradition seems to dictate. 27 – Grand Theft Auto VI Launch Look, it felt bad to see GTA V fall off of the Platinum tier on the Best of Steam 2024.  I mean, Silver tier?  Sure, not bad for an 11 year old game, but that probably also means we need a new version.  I might not play it, but I feel like I need a couple more gimme wishes in here or my seasonal depression will really ramp up about 12 months from now. 28 – Fantastic Pixel Castle Early Access Reveal Then there is Greg “Ghostcrawler” Street and his company Fantastic Pixel Castle, which has been working on an MMO for a couple years now, though this might be my first time mentioning it here on the blog.  They have some ideas for a new game, which includes private zones for you and your friends and public zones where you can come into conflict with others and a bunch of things, some of which is being play tested now.  It is probably as far along as Stars Reach, maybe further, so it won’t launch in 2025 or even go early access in 2025, but if they had a target date for public access to the game along with a lot more information, I’d consider this wish fulfilled. 29 – Wild Card Indie Success Wish Some little indie studio that I have not heard of at the time of this writing will have a big break-out success and live the indie dev dream for a while.  For measuring this I will look at the indie bracket nominations of The Game Awards for 2025 and will consider this granted if at least one of the nominated studios was completely unknown to me and yet I recognize the game nominates and has some headlines about its amazing success or something.  Work with me on this.  I am just going to let this ride until we get to the decision point in December.  Why run my wishes any different than my projects at work? 30 – Half-Life 3 Announced for Real Why the hell not?  They’re just wishes! Bonus Wishes All wishes are a bonus, that is why they are wishes, right?  But in the event that I come up with some additional wish I want to add in, it will be injected here with a time stamp and the cosmos will not be graded down should the wish not be granted.  The cosmos will, however, get full credit if the wish is granted. Wish Scoring Dare I score wishes?  Like I said, if they don’t come true that is on the cosmos and not me.  I am just the wisher, it is up to the wishee to see that wishes come to pass.  Is the cosmos going to get pissed if I try to score it?  We shall see! That said, some of this still has to play out like predictions.  The cosmos will earn 10 points for each wish fulfilled, with partial credit available.  Since I am not the one being scored I will tend to be inclined to give the cosmos credit for getting part way there if, say, Civ VII launches as a train wreck but is fixed before summer ends.  Just an example. Also, I mentioned SMART above, which stands for “Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and Time Related,” and you could certainly call me out for some of my wishes not hitting all five.  But when it comes to time, if wishes are not fulfilled by December 15, 2025, they will be considered unfulfilled for the purposes of scoring.  That is the drop dead date… though if, say, GTA VI launches on December 16th, because it is a Tuesday, then the cosmos will get full credit even if Rockstar will get some dubious looks for such a late in the year launch. The cosmos has 300 points on the table it can earn.  We’ll be back in about a year to see how it does for 2025.  Off we go.  There are consequences to be borne and whirlwinds to be reaped. So that is what I have.  What are your happy, positive, maybe slightly passive-aggressive video game wishes for 2025?  Did I miss something important? Meanwhile, others have placed stakes in the ground with their own predictions.  Here are a few I picked up: Massively OP – Our MMO predictions for 2025 TNG – My Predictions for 2025 Reddit – Ceema’s EVE Online Null Sec 2025 Predictions UGK – Ubergeek Kelly’s 2025 Predictions",

streak and I am not about to break that because the world is going to shit… or at least more so than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, you can see that I don’t have to do predictions every year.  I mean, if you dig into those years when it is something like “Questions,” they really could be seen as predictions.  But they are also different in tone and a bit liberating because you don’t have to focus on a goal, just a possible topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePredictions for 2025 feel like they will just get too dark too quickly given my current mood.  Likewise, even questions for the new year ran pretty dark when I started sorting some out in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo this year I am going to do wishes.  Video game wishes.  Let’s keep this manageable.  You can wish for world peace on your own time.  I am going to list out video game things I want to happen, things I hope will happen, things that might make things better, all in an unsubtle attempt to try and mine some optimism.  We shall see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is something of a turn around as I usually have to state clearly that just because I predict something doesn’t mean I want it to happen.  Now I get to run with things I actually want to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will state up front I won’t be wishing for anything bad to happen.  No bad mojo.  I will also endeavor to not be completely sarcastic or passive aggressive in my wishes…. but you know that is going to slip, right?  Look, I am influenced by the world around me… and have you seen this place lately?  So cut me some slack.  There might be a barb or two in there, but I want my intentions to be clear and in the right place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if my wishes don’t come true… well, that isn’t on ME now is it?  I guess.  Better wait until we see what I wish for.  But I am going to be leaning heavily on the cosmos and the goodness of people to make this stuff come true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I have I got then?  What am I wishing for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1 – An End to Video Game Industry Consolidation and Mass Layoffs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy start small, right?  If you got wishes, throw them at a big problem.  Unfortunately that lamp I was rubbing the other day… I hope that was a lamp… didn’t promise me anything.  And an “end” might be too big of an ask.  I would consider the wish fulfilled if we could at least see the industry cycle into a hiring phase and maybe hold of with the acquisition slash and burn to make the line go up a tiny fraction this week.  I think I am already off to a bad start with a wish where I won’t be able measure.  I guess I’ll just listen to video game devs and see what they’re complaining about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2 – News about the next EverQuest title\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust don’t call it \u003cem\u003eEverQuest Next!\u003c/em\u003e  Man, was that a dumb name.  I am pretty sure that was my stance back whenever… but if it wasn’t, let me say that the name has not grown on me in the mean time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, EG7/Daybreak threw the idea out there of a new \u003cem\u003eEverQuest\u003c/em\u003e title \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/09/21/enad-global-7-and-vague-promises-of-a-new-everquest-title-maybe-in-2028/\"\u003eback in late 2023\u003c/a\u003e… and I know some of us would like to hear a bit more about it.  There was a hint about it being in the ideation phase, but naught else.  And while it was on track for 2028 maybe, I am keen to hear if the ideas for it are still rooted in the whole \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/10/02/everquest-elden-ring-and-what-does-hardcore-even-mean/\"\u003ehardcore, be like \u003cem\u003eElden Ring\u003c/em\u003e thing\u003c/a\u003e that Ji Ham was espousing back in 2023.  A bit of hope or a nugget to hang on to, but more than just some concept art.  Lord knows how that screwed us back in the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3 – Happy Annual Expansions at Daybreak\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasy one here, a gimme for the universe.  Just do the usual Q4 expansions for \u003cem\u003eEQ, EQII, LOTRO,\u003c/em\u003e and whatever.  Does \u003cem\u003ePalia\u003c/em\u003e get an annual update now too?  I don’t know.  But just carry on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4 – LOTRO to do Something to Improve Large Monitor Access\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook, I don’t need full 4K support.  That was always a pipe dream anyway.  SSG is fully committed to simply maintaining the status quo and adding a bit of content to the game.  The idea, for example, that it was ever going to be ported to consoles was absurd on its face, something I called out when that first came up.  EG7 has since said they \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/09/27/no-remaster-for-lord-of-the-rings-online/\"\u003ewould rather spend the money on developing a new game\u003c/a\u003e… though Daybreak has been pretty shy on actually producing a “new” game so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, there are probably half a dozen things of small to medium-ish effort that SSG could do that would make the game more viable on large screens.  They could, as an example, get somebody to redo their bitmap skill icons as SVGs so they will not look like ass when you make the the hotbar bigger. (Also an opportunity to make them distinguishable rather than a bunch of red or green blobs with \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2009/01/29/iconic-distraction/\"\u003enonsensical iconography\u003c/a\u003e, which is something people were calling out back in 2007.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could make scaling stick for the whole UI, as it reverts to defaults in an annoying number of places between sessions.  And they could work on text and dialogs to make them readable on a 4K monitor… with a universal sizing setting maybe?  I find it extremely annoying to have to tinker with every aspect of the UI and then have half of it revert when I log off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo just fix that shit.  Put in the effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaha, I know.  I fully expect this wish to go completely unfulfilled, this is me hoping against hope, but there it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5 – Commit to or Let Go Of H1Z1\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I said no negatives, and I am trying not to go there, but EG7/Daybreak has been living in this delusion for quite a while now where they boost \u003cem\u003eH1Z1\u003c/em\u003e as one of their most important first party franchises at every opportunity while, at the same time, they spend no time or effort on actually doing anything with it.  It has basically sat in limbo for since \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/04/06/nantworks-hands-h1z1-back-to-daybreak-after-failing-to-revive-the-game/\"\u003eNantworks gave up and handed the game back to Daybreak\u003c/a\u003e, unable to make anything good out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I know they have \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2023/09/24/the-plan-for-the-return-of-h1z1/\"\u003etalked about a new \u003cem\u003eH1Z1\u003c/em\u003e title\u003c/a\u003e.  That was supposed to be in pre-production in the first half of 2024, which means we should have heard some new by now… and we haven’t.  Things don’t always go to plan and that roadmap was pretty squishy, but still… figure it out by the end of 2025; commit or stop pretending it is a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6 – Blizzard to not Mess Up WoW Housing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlizz got a big bounce in hope by announcing that housing was coming to \u003cem\u003eWorld of Warcraft\u003c/em\u003e.  The thing they said they would not do, the thing they half-assed as garrisons it what looked like an attempt to prove their point that housing takes people out of the world, the thing that would probably up the long term subscriber retention rate by 5-10% if done right… yeah, do it… and do it right!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat does “right” mean?  I don’t know.  I have a bunch of vague ideas and examples from other titles of things I felt worked and things that I felt did not.  But Blizz and its ability to read the room is not something people have come to count on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe won’t actually GET housing in 2025.  We know that \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2024/11/19/after-20-years-blizzard-says-housing-is-coming-to-world-of-warcraft/\"\u003efrom the roadmap\u003c/a\u003e.  But they should be able to give us a substantial view into what they are planning.  So that view plus “doesn’t obviously suck” is the bar here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7 – WoW Classic Progression to Pick Up the Pace\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel that nearly a year of \u003cem\u003eCataclysm Classic\u003c/em\u003e has proven the point that classic progression servers can advance too slowly, and that isn’t going to get any better with some of the coming expansions.  Find the right pacing Blizz.  Also, this reminds me again that I had better consider how to check to see if my wishes have come true.  Do wishes need to be \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria\"\u003eSMART\u003c/a\u003e?  I might not know if this one was granted in 2025.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e8 – Blizz to use all that talent and all those resources to make something new\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey have the money, they have the staff, they can surely find some new idea out in the industry to steal and re-work.  They can’t have lost all their skill in that, can they?  What non-Blizz titles do Blizz devs play now?  Not all \u003cem\u003eClash of Clans\u003c/em\u003e I hope.  That’s it though, isn’t it?  They all just play phone games because they’re mostly in their 20s.  Well, I can still wish I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9 – Valheim to Exit Early Access\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose removing the “early access” label from \u003cem\u003eValheim\u003c/em\u003e won’t change anything really.  The dirty secret is that early access is your launch and you don’t get another one when you exit.  There won’t be a huge spike in sales or a bunch of new press coverage or any magical change to the game when that hits.  It will just be “done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut sometimes “done” is enough.  If they deliver the Northlands and wrap up the quest line so that you can finish the game, then that will be good.  They could, if they wanted, go all Hello Games and continue to improve it over time, or it could just immediately go into maintenance mode, as so many early access transition titles do, as the team goes off to work on something else.  Either way, completion is a nice thing.  Maybe it will get some Steam achievements.  That might make me go back and play it one more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall though, I have gotten more than my money’s worth out of \u003cem\u003eValheim\u003c/em\u003e.  I am done, it can be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10 – Light No Fire to go Early Access\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what started my whole survival co-op frenzy this past year.  The mention of Hello Games making this stirred me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, I really want \u003cem\u003eLight No Fire\u003c/em\u003e to launch fully formed because, after the evolution of \u003cem\u003eNo Man’s Sky\u003c/em\u003e into the game it is today, I want their co-op survival title and their take on the genre… even if it will inevitably be controller-centric.  I can deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I will take a solid early access and go along for the ride.  How much different would the \u003cem\u003eNo Man’s Sky\u003c/em\u003e journey have been if it had been early access for the first two years?  Maybe no different… but maybe it would have set expectations that things were going to continue to evolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e11 – No Man’s Sky to just keep on keeping on\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we’re talking about Hello Games, \u003cem\u003eNMS\u003c/em\u003e is just a great example of a company committing to a title and just making it better and better over time.  They got robbed on the Labor of Love category in the Steam Awards.  Only \u003cem\u003eNMS\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eStardew Valley\u003c/em\u003e really met the criteria of the award.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e12 – Dune Awakening

Exiles\u003c/em\u003e, and my hope is that Funcom will have learned from that… I mean, \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCE\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e has been out more than six years at this point.  I hope that journey has informed them and allowed them to do something cool with the \u003cem\u003eDune\u003c/em\u003e universe.  Going to be an interesting one to judge whether the wish was granted or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e13 – GoG.com to Continue Thriving\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not one to care much about the monthly free games from Amazon Prime… like I don’t have enough unplayed games in my Steam library already… but when they offer up a code for GoG.com I grab it wholly on the assumption that GoG gets some payment for it and as the old game underdog I want them to succeed and thrive in a way I can only describe as completely opposite to my feelings for the Epic Game Store. (I will not wish bad things on the EGS in this post, but in my heart I might… mostly because Tim Sweeney is a bad person in the way that most US CEOs are bad people.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e14 – CCP to Finally Do What they Know They Need to do to Fix the New Eden Economy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassive aggressive much?  Actually, that assumes they know what they need to do and, given they have spent three years not doing anything of the sort.  So maybe I cannot really argue that this assumption is grounded in any sort of reality.  But still, these are wishes, so may the universe magic that knowledge into CCP Rattati’s fore brain and force him to look away from \u003cem\u003eEVE Vanguard\u003c/em\u003e for long enough to tell somebody to implement it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e15 – CCP to Succeed at Something Besides EVE Online\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook, I am not happy with some of their choices.  The blockchain game, \u003cem\u003eEVE Frontier\u003c/em\u003e, can (and most likely will) die in a fire.  I also do not share the CCP management dream of making a first person shooter, lacking faith in their ability to make something both interesting and unique enough to attract an audience outside of the relatively small New Eden user base.  I am also not at all keen on them putting the biggest fan of said shooter in charge of the spaceship game.  And \u003cem\u003eEVE Galaxy Conquest\u003c/em\u003e… whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, it is in the best interest of those of us who still play their one successful title that something else land and become a success, if only to stabilize the company and make Hilmar less keen to steal resources from the game I play to fund his blockchain fantasies.  So if something else could succeed that would be great… and no monkey’s paw where the mobile game makes some money so they abandon \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e.  In fact, let me just make a “no damn monkey’s paw” side rule right here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e16 – CCP to Make a Co-op Space Survival Title\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are popular, CCP has some of the ground work done.  They have more than 20 years of spaceships and nearly 15 years of FPS work in the bag now, maybe take a different tack and make something more manageable that could find a niche and grow?  Just a thought.  I’d play that… if it was any good at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e17 – CCP to make the New Eden Strategy Game I Want\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, wishes are free so while I’m here I might as well \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2016/03/30/bb73-new-eden-diplomacy/\"\u003ethrow out the idea one more time\u003c/a\u003e about a space 4x strategy title set in New Eden where you can play as the main empires or as a null sec leader or even one of the pirate factions as scenarios that takes a strategic view of war and conquest in the New Ede star cluster.  I don’t care how.  License it to Paradox or something.  Just do it.  I know, the \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e IP isn’t at all popular so nobody would actually play it, but just tack a receptive strategy game audience on to the wish and call it done.  We have all the wishes baby!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e18 – Andrew Groen to get Empires of EVE vol. III Done\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is out there.  He has announced he is working on the third and final volume of his history of null sec and New Eden.  We’re going to hear about World War Bee and the great Siege of 1DQ1-A and Vily’s vendetta and eventually the downfall of The Mittani, which will probably be what brings the story to a close.  And… well… I am eager to read it.  I know it takes time, but that doesn’t mean I can be as patient as I need to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e19 – Some Actual War in New Eden\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrew Groen could be tempted into a volume 4 if, you know, we did something interesting.  I know, war depends heavily on CCP fixing the economy so alliances are willing to put trillions of ISK on the line.  Also, we need something to fight over and CCP’s scarcity plan has backfired completely in that regard.  I don’t know.  Maybe Gobbins will go on the forums and say “there are no goons” or something.  Send Vily back for a rematch.  Have Brisc and Merk defect to Fraternity.  Let The Initiative start some shit now that they have no blues.  Something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e20 – Some Solid Guild Wars 3 News\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know, what we heard was a slip, an accident, but that makes it all the more interesting to find out what is really going on.  I am also interested to hear what a dozen years of \u003cem\u003eGW2\u003c/em\u003e has taught the ANet team and how an third title might differ from the second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e21 – Enshrouded to Keep on their Roll\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe end of the year game for us was \u003cem\u003eEnshrouded\u003c/em\u003e and Keen Games has done a great job with it so for.  I’ll even give them a pass the missing in-game chat.  Turns out I can live without it is the rest of the game is this good.  And a co-op survival builder doesn’t *need* a done state, but it still feels like we should be progressing towards a final boss to cleanse the world or something.  So get us going there, keep expanding, and maybe not so many jumping puzzles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e22 – Keep Extending Stars Reach\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlayable Worlds still feels like they are a couple years away from \u003cem\u003eStars Reach\u003c/em\u003e being a real, live service game.  The big break through was homesteads and 4 hour play tests this year.  But there was a lot promised in the design pillars that has yet to see the light of day.  Personally, I am waiting for space ships and space travel.  So that is my wish I guess, at least get us to space travel in a test galaxy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e23 – Pokemon Go to level 60\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI may regret this wish.  Also, I don’t want this until the end of 2025 so I have some time left to get to 50.  Niantic pretty much has to do this at some point.  There is only so much horizontal progress they can try to pile on.  Anyway, I would consider this fulfilled if they even announced a plan for a level cap increase in 2025.  There are a lot of hardcore fans who have been at level 50 for a long time now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e24 – That Pokemon Black \u0026amp; White Remake\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the next on the list of old \u003cem\u003ePokemon\u003c/em\u003e titles that have not been remade.  It might get me to put my Switch Lite back on the charger and play with it now and then.  I wasn’t keen on it as a title when it launched, but when I went back and played it on the 3DS one last time to complete all the pre-Switch titles, I found it had quite a bit to recommend it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e25 – Hope for the Hermit Kingdom Unchained\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would like to see Unchained Entertainment… once City State Entertainment, but there was a name change due to unstated reasons… shit or get off the pot when it comes to \u003cem\u003eCamelot Unchained\u003c/em\u003e.  Mark Jacobs and his team have been running a propaganda mill about how wonderful things are and how much progress there has been for a decade now, to the point that I don’t think comparisons with the North Korean Central News Agency are unjust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, I also want to know what horrible stain Marc Andreesen and his tainted, string laden cash has left on the company and the game.  There was \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2024/03/03/camelot-unchained-threatens-early-access-in-2025-with-crypto-happy-backers/\"\u003ea promise of some sort of access in late 2025\u003c/a\u003e… but there was also a promise of access in 2014, so lies on top of lies seems to be the norm.  So, you know, do something already?  That is positive, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e26 – Civilization VII to Not Be a Bloated Train Wreck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a long standing tradition in the \u003cem\u003eCiv\u003c/em\u003e series of shipping something that really requires the next generation of computers to run.  Also bugs, crashes, and a game that really doesn’t settle down until we’ve been sold at least one post-launch expansion pack.  I’d like a new \u003cem\u003eCiv\u003c/em\u003e game… almost as much as I would like \u003cem\u003eCiv II\u003c/em\u003e to be brought up to date… but I have also been there since the dawn of the original… roll that ancient magic quote about being there when they were written… and it has always been a bit of a nightmare on launch.  So here is hoping that Sid’s likely final launch for the series is smoother than tradition seems to dictate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e27 – Grand Theft Auto VI Launch\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook, it felt bad to see \u003cem\u003eGTA V\u003c/em\u003e fall off of the Platinum tier on the \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/sale/BestOf2024?tab=1\"\u003eBest of Steam 2024\u003c/a\u003e.  I mean, Silver tier?  Sure, not bad for an 11 year old game, but that probably also means we need a new version.  I might not play it, but I feel like I need a couple more gimme wishes in here or my seasonal depression will really ramp up about 12 months from now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e28 – Fantastic Pixel Castle Early Access Reveal\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there is Greg “Ghostcrawler” Street and his company \u003ca href=\"https://fantasticpixelcastle.com/\"\u003eFantastic Pixel Castle\u003c/a\u003e, which has been working on an MMO for a couple years now, though this might be my first time mentioning it here on the blog.  They have some ideas for a new game, which includes private zones for you and your friends and public zones where you can come into conflict with others and a bunch of things, some of which is being play tested now.  It is probably as far along as Stars Reach, maybe further, so it won’t launch in 2025 or even go early access in 2025, but if they had a target date for public access to the game along with a lot more information, I’d consider this wish fulfilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e29 – Wild Card Indie Success Wish\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome little indie studio that I have not heard of at the time of this writing will have a big break-out success and live the indie dev dream for a while.  For measuring this I will look at the indie bracket nominations of The Game Awards for 2025 and will consider this granted if at least one of the nominated studios was completely unknown to me and yet I recognize the game nominates and has some headlines about its amazing success or something.  Work with me on this.  I am just going to let this ride until we get to the decision point in December.  Why run my wishes any different than my projects at work?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e30 – Half-Life 3 Announced for Real\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy the hell not?  They’re just

come up with some additional wish I want to add in, it will be injected here with a time stamp and the cosmos will not be graded down should the wish not be granted.  The cosmos will, however, get full credit if the wish is granted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWish Scoring\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDare I score wishes?  Like I said, if they don’t come true that is on the cosmos and not me.  I am just the wisher, it is up to the wishee to see that wishes come to pass.  Is the cosmos going to get pissed if I try to score it?  We shall see!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, some of this still has to play out like predictions.  The cosmos will earn 10 points for each wish fulfilled, with partial credit available.  Since I am not the one being scored I will tend to be inclined to give the cosmos credit for getting part way there if, say, \u003cem\u003eCiv VII\u003c/em\u003e launches as a train wreck but is fixed before summer ends.  Just an example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, I mentioned SMART above, which stands for “Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and Time Related,” and you could certainly call me out for some of my wishes not hitting all five.  But when it comes to time, if wishes are not fulfilled by December 15, 2025, they will be considered unfulfilled for the purposes of scoring.  That is the drop dead date… though if, say, GTA VI launches on December 16th, because it is a Tuesday, then the cosmos will get full credit even if Rockstar will get some dubious looks for such a late in the year launch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cosmos has 300 points on the table it can earn.  We’ll be back in about a year to see how it does for 2025.  Off we go.  There are consequences to be borne and whirlwinds to be reaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that is what I have.  What are your happy, positive, maybe slightly passive-aggressive video game wishes for 2025?  Did I miss something important?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, others have placed stakes in the ground with their own predictions.  Here are a few I picked
