This major collaboration with the legendary Japanese franchise gives you a chance to engage with and earn Gundam themed operators, weapons, and rewards through many parts of the new season.  Get ready to duel it out with your own Gundam themed mech in the 4v4 Gundam Team Deathmatch, earn free rewards in the Gundam in-game event, and then unlock Gundam-themed Operator Skins, Weapon Blueprints, and more through two Series Armories store offers.

Keep an eye out for themed events and easy ways to snag new rewards while playing this mode.  Bonus Gundam Animations: After completing a game of Gundam Team Deathmatch, players can watch Gundam themed operator animations outside the match.
