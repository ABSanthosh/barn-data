  "text": "Rejoice PlayStation players, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is almost here. In fact, we’re so close to launch that starting today, if you’ve pre-ordered the game – you can begin pre-loading to make sure you’re ready for day one. Ahead of launch, we wanted to go a little deeper today into MP and Zombies to make sure there are no details you’re missing.  Let’s break down some key components around what to expect. The multiplayer experience From new maps and modes to new weapons and equipment, Black Ops 6 gameplay will be an experience unlike any other. There will be the core 6v6 modes you’ve come to know and love from Call of Duty, plus an all-new core 6v6 mode, Kill Order, where you must eliminate the enemy High Value Target (HVT) while protecting your own. In addition to these, jump into 2v2 Gunfight, as well as Face Off Alts of several of the 6v6 modes. Finally, looking for a challenge where your matches only have a limited HUD, friendly fire is enabled, and your health is lowered significantly? Then, prepare for Hardcore, scheduled for launch on certain playlists. We will have 16 brand-new maps at launch split into two main categories: twelve brand-new Core 6v6 maps and four brand-new, compact-sized Strike maps designed to be played in either 6v6 or 2v2 configurations. We know you got to see several of the maps in the Beta, such as Scud, Rewind, Skyline, Babylon, and Derelict, but you can expect to find incredible action-packed moments on maps you have yet to experience.  There’s Lowtown, a dockside neighborhood with a boat house, fishing shed, lattices to climb, and a canal to swim in. There’s also Vault, a large, lush playspace set within a desert landscape adorned with monuments, sculptures, a central palace, and even an opulent atrium. And this just scratches the surface, there are many more maps to explore from October 25 and on, not to mention the bevy of maps coming in post-launch seasons.  There are over 20 Black Ops 6 Operators to choose from at launch, with some allied to the Rogue Black Ops Faction, and others allied to Crimson One. To give you a little background on these operators. Rogue Black Ops is on the run and being hunted by their former employers. This team seeks to uncover the truth regarding the infiltration of the CIA and expose the conspiracy. As they no longer have state backing, much of their equipment is either improvised, supplied by contacts from other intelligence services, purchased from criminals, or supplied on the promise of IOUs.  They know who’s hunting them and refer to them as “Crimson One.” Crimson One represents the CIA operation initiated to hunt down the Rogue squad. The team is officially sanctioned by the CIA and has access to all intel and tools to complete the job. By now, you should have heard plenty about the brand-new Omnimovement system coming to Black Ops 6, the most fluid boots-on-the-ground Call of Duty movement system to date. Omnimovement will go across all game modes, but make sure to utilize it in Multiplayer to live out those spy-thriller action-hero moments you’ve always dreamed of. Weapons \u0026 equipment When it comes to the weapons you’ll be using in Multiplayer, it all starts where you choose your loadouts: the Weapons Menu, which has been streamlined in Black Ops 6 for an approachable, intuitive experience as you level up your weapons over time. Black Ops 6 is set to bring an exceptional arsenal of weaponry and equipment to the game – including returning favorites from the Black Ops universe and weapons all new to the franchise. The primary and secondary weapons slots are going to be your bread-and-butter, but for the first time you have a dedicated third slot to equip a melee weapon, so that knife or bat is always an option when things get heated in close-quarters combat.  Finally, Perks and Wildcard slots in your loadouts will change the way you play, so make sure you’re thinking strategically as you make your choices. Then, tactical and lethal equipment, as well as Field Upgrades and Scorestreaks will round out your arsenal with an array of choices unlocking as you level up and progress, with some new options such as the exciting War Cry Field Upgrade that rallies your team, improves nearby teammates’ movement and health regen speed for a short time. Get ready to gear up! Zombies  Round-Based Zombies is back in a massive way, with Treyarch delivering the goods across gameplay, narrative, and maps in Black Ops 6 Zombies. Check out the previous PlayStation Blog post for the full details of Round-Based Zombies, but there are a few key things we wanted to remind you of. There’s a dedicated crew that are the heart of the story for Black Ops 6 Zombies, which continues the Dark Aether storyline that started in Black Ops Cold War. While you can jump into Zombies with any MP operator you’d like, the characters of Weaver, Grey, Carver, and Maya make up the Terminus team, drive the narrative forward, and are the gateway to the most robust experience you can have with this mode. Then there are the maps, which are basically characters unto themselves. There will be two Round-Based maps at launch, Terminus and Liberty Falls, with additional maps coming in the post-launch seasons. We also went into details on these maps in a previous Blog post, so check that out for more details, but know there will be no shortage of unique and harrowing environments as you and your squad battle into higher and higher rounds. Finally, the zombie-fighting tools at your disposal will be robust as ever with the return of Perk-a-Colas, Field Upgrades, Wonder Weapons, GobbleGums, Ammo Mods, and the introduction of Augments, which allow you to customize your Perks, Ammo Mods, and Field Upgrades. One more thing! For the first time in Call of Duty Zombies history, if you’re playing Zombies solo you can elect to save your solo match at any time and return to it later, provided you’re at full health, aren’t downed, dead, or actively engaged in an exfil. (A relief for many, to be sure). Progression \u0026 prestige  Black Ops 6 marks the anticipated return of a more traditional Prestige system, back in Call of Duty and bigger than ever. Players who reach and complete Max level 55 can choose to Prestige and restart their Leveling over again (while losing some already unlocked items), but this time with the chance to earn exclusive rewards along the way – – we know it’ll be worth the effort. But Prestige isn’t the only Progression system that’s gotten a major upgrade this year.  The Treyarch team has set out to build the most rewarding Progression and Challenge systems ever delivered in a Call of Duty game in Black Ops 6 and there’s a ton of unlockable content packed into the game on Day one.  Earn XP from by performing well, playing the Objective, earning Medals, and completing challenges, like Calling Card challenges and Reticle challenges.  Additionally, brand new for Black Ops 6, every Weapon, Equipment, Field Upgrade, and Scorestreak in your loadout has a set of MP and Zombies Master Badges to progress through as you master each piece of Gear. Those are some of the high-level details you can expect for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Don’t forget to pre-order and pre-load starting today so you can hop right in on October 25 and experience it for yourself.",
