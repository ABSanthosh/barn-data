  "text": "The best iPad for most people.Ahead of Valentine's Day, Amazon has just dropped the price of the latest model 10th gen Apple iPad to $279 shipped. Currently all colors including Blue, Silver, Pink, and Yellow are discounted. Although this price is about $20 higher than what we saw during Black Friday, This is the best price we've seen so far this year for the 10th gen iPad, and a really great Valentine's Day gift idea.Apple iPad 10.9\" 10th Gen for $279For most people, the iPad (not the Air, Mini, or Pro) is the best model to get because it offers nearly all the benefits of the iOS operating system and snappy performance at an affordable price. This model has significant improvements over its predecessor. For starters, it boasts a larger 10.9\" screen without adding to the overall dimensions thanks to a slimmer bezel. It also has a faster A14 Bionic chip, which is a 20% increase in CPU performance and a 10% increase in GPU performance over the A13. It's now compatible with the Magic Folio keyboard so you can convert it into a mini laptop for better workflow (making it one of the best iPads for students). Other practical upgrades include the transition to a universal USB Type-C port, a better camera, and an updated Wi-Fi 6 protocol.The model on sale right now is equipped with 64GB of internal storage and Wi-Fi (not LTE) connectivity. All color options (Silver, Blue, Pink, and Yellow) are discounted and should ship out before Valentine's Day, which lands on February 14. Go with the base model; choosing one with more storage or cellular connectivity will cost you a lot more.Looking for more iPad resources?If you're not sure which iPad is best for you, we have an iPad guide which details which iPad is ideal for which use case.
