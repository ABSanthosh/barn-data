She’s spent roughly 1,000 hours (each) exploring Baldur’s Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077, and will happily talk your ear off about either title. When she’s not writing, she can usually be found binging YouTube videos about obscure Japanese horror games from the early 2000s, praying in vain for a sequel to ABZÛ, or whining about The Sims.In the days following the Switch 2’s launch, players have discovered a trio of delightful GameCube Easter eggs included in the Switch 2’s Nintendo Classics GameCube catalog, which can only be accessed if you have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership.The Easter eggs in question all cause the Switch to replicate the GameCube’s original tinkly (and oft-memed) startup animation, along with a pair of alternative startup sequences that were included with the GameCube. It’s a nice nod to the nostalgia of the GameCube era, which is being revived by Switch 2’s exclusive Nintendo Switch Online game offerings. At launch, Switch 2 owners with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership can play The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soulcalibur 2, and F-Zero GX. More are expected to come.Here’s how to access the three Switch 2 GameCube Easter eggs yourself, if you want to dazzle your friends and family who fondly recall early aughts Nintendo gaming:Original sound Easter eggEnsure you have an active Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. This will give you access to the Nintendo Classics GameCube game catalog.Select the catalog and quickly hold the left joystick in any direction. This will cause the classic GameCube console startup animation and sound to play.“Squeaky” sound Easter eggOnce again, select the Nintendo Classics GameCube catalog.This time, hold the left joystick in any direction and quickly press the R button (right bumper) once. You can also press Z instead of R if you’re using the official Switch GameCube controller.This will cause the same animation to play, this time with a different sound effect, similar to that of a squeaky dog toy. The sound clip ends with a child giggling.Hard mode: drum sound Easter eggTo witness this Easter egg in all its glory, you’ll need four players (or at least four controllers). Player 1 will need to select the Nintendo Classics GameCube catalog, but all four players must then press R (or Z) at once.The classic GameCube animation will play, this time with a drum-like sound that ends with a bell ringing.The Switch 2 may be Nintendo’s main focus at the moment, but it’s clear the gaming giant still has a soft spot for its previous consoles as well — especially the beloved GameCube.",
