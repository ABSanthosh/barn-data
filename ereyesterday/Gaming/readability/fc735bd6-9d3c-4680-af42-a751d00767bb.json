Total Annihilation – Commander’s Pack at GoG.com Total Annihilation (TA) is one of those titles that is too strange to live and too good to die.  Widely praised as being unique when launched, it had its share of flaws, not the least of which was being complex, at least in terms of units, not strictly well balanced between the two factions (ARM vs CORE… in which ARM is better by most measures), and lacking in much of the way of story. I mean sure, there IS a campaign with a story in there somewhere, but compared to its contemporaries like Warcraft, Command \u0026  Conquer,  and Age of Empires, the story is pretty thin,  The CORE, AI enhanced cyber beings… Ray Kurzweil’s singularity happens in this timeline I guess… have been fighting the bio-humanist ARM for thousands of years, have pretty much wrecked the galaxy, and now remnants of the two sides remain locked in their eternal struggle on various moons and planet… now go fight in a campaign that is a series of discreet objectives on different planets in different terrain, from desolate low gravity moons, to wrecked cityscapes and pock marked terrain, to the all metal CORE worlds… though why they live in an all metal environment or find that enjoyable isn’t explained. The interesting bits about TA are the way it handles what one would now consider the tropes of the RTS genre. Resources are simple, you need metal and power.  Metal is mined from the ground… so metal planets are pretty easy on that front… harvested from the terrain or wrecked units, or as you advance up the tech tree, created from the application of a lot of power. Power starts off being generated by solar, wind, thermal, or tidal action… how environmentally friendly… and progresses to better versions of those as well as fusion generators. Both metal and power are just available to all construction units, so if you have a lot of parallel building going on, the drain is high and you might outrun your supply and end up with all construction stalled.  That supply also runs unit production factories, so you have to get out in front of that if you don’t want to find yourself suddenly in a panic build to defend yourself and unable to get units out fast enough. Then there are the units.  There is no supply system that limits your unit count, save for a hard cap set for the match.  You start with one unit, the Commander, who is very powerful but slow and limited.  It can one-shot any unit and builds things very quickly, but only has some very basic things it can build.  Killing the Commander is the default victory condition for skirmish mode against other players. The commander can build factories to produce units which can, in turn, produce construction units that can build advanced factories that can build the best units in the game, including advanced construction vehicles that can build very powerful structures, like the fusion reactor, the auto targeting unit, long range radar, and the Big Bertha, a long range fixed artillery piece that can dominate a section of the map.  Big Bertha + long range radar + auto targeting unit + the fusion reactors = serious wrecking potential as the gun will seek out any target in range. Units are vehicle, aircraft, naval units, and kbots, which are basically mechs that have much better terrain crossing capabilities than vehicles, which each having good attack units as well as units to counter the other types. And all of this takes place on 3D worlds where you can hide behind terrain so that Big Bertha ranging out to hit you can be thwarted if you’re in the lee of a hill or some structure. Anyway, it is/was/remains pretty cool and by about this point you’re probably going “Cool story bro, but why are you banging on about this now nearly 28 year old PC game in a genre that people stopped caring about at least a decade back?” Mostly because I tend to forget about the game and am then startled when I am reminded that it still exists and is available for purchase and download because it still works.  This time around, at the end of the holiday sales, I spotted it over at GoG.com where it was listed for just 99 cents.  What a deal! Granted, not the BEST deal on TA I’ve seen or bought into, that honor belongs to a Steam Winter sale back in 2015, but still good price for the game. Best Deal Evah! This probably marks the fourth or fifth copy of the game I have purchased in the last 28 years.  Somewhere I have a couple of versions on CD, the expansions, then the digital versions from GoG.com, Steam, and apparently Stardock back in 2010, which puts it up there with maybe Diablo II and Dark Side of the Moon when it comes to works I’ve purchased repeatedly as formats and media evolved. The game itself… well, I’m not even sure who owns it really.  It’s past has been complicated.  At one point whatever company was trying to reanimate the dead body of Atari once again owned it, and even slapped the Atari logo on the splash screen in a bit of sacrilege. Total Annihilation marred by Atari However, somewhere along the line that version of Atari fell apart, as they inevitably do, and I guess Wargaming.net, the makers of World of Tanks and World of Warships, picked it up and it is available on Steam and GoG.com still… so good.  The Atari logo was cleaned off the splash screen at some point… though so was the “Windowed Game Mode” option as well.  It looks different.  Stardock had probably worked on a launcher for it, then that went away when Wargaming.net ended up with the game. Total Annihilation back again I bought it, installed it, and launched it… and it ran.  Not only did it run, it ran full screen on the big 3440×1440 monitor.  That was cool, a sign of somebody implementing resolution options that worked going forward, the way Civ II works on my big screen as well despite being from 1996. The downside was, of course, that everything was very tiny.  I had to go in and make a half scale resolution just to make things big enough for me to see reasonably, which involved me going into the nVidia tool and creating a new resolution for the monitor.  That gets read by the system and the game just believes whatever the OS tells it when it comes to available resolutions. Making 1720 x 720 a thing! I compare this against some other games of a slightly later era that locked themselves into the default resolutions of the day and which either simply cannot scale up… Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri was one of those… which gets really bent due to the screen not being either 4:3 or 16:9.  As I recall SMAC had a fixed max resolution of 1280×1024, which was big for the 90s but kinda tiny for today. So I got that up and running and even went out and found some of the classic user made map packs that used to make the rounds back in the day.  All in all it was easier to get running that it was back when I had the base game CD and the two expansion CDs and the follow on patches and the patch that increased the max number of units and the maps and all that… all of which was made extra difficult as Cavedog, the original developer, went out of business a game later. Finding the map pack in that ancient .ufo file format brought back some memories of assembling an up to date install.  Now it all comes in one installer. And I got in some good matches on old maps I remembered.  The problem is that the AI… or the computer controlled players, because we have clearly been throwing the term “AI” around way too loosely for 30+ years now… isn’t very good.  On a non-metal planet it tends to starve itself of resources and on a metal planet it becomes chaotic to deal with as it just throws waves of units at you and you end up having to build nukes to hit the Commander. I seem to recall that there were upgraded computer opponent algorithms back in the day.  I might need to look into that. But it has been an interesting dive back into a game that feels pretty rudimentary by today’s UI standards.  However, nobody has ever really captured the essence of the game, and there have been attempts to do so.  Supreme Commander, Supreme Commander 2, Planetary Annihilation, Spring Engine, and a few others have tried, but they have never quite gotten there for me.  The devs always wanted to both capture some of the original while moving beyond and making something new… which is understandable… but which also never left me satisfied. However, I can still play the original.",

inevitably do, and I guess Wargaming.net, the makers of \u003cem\u003eWorld of Tanks\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eWorld of Warships,\u003c/em\u003e picked it up and it is available on Steam and GoG.com still… so good.  The Atari logo was cleaned off the splash screen at some point… though so was the “Windowed Game Mode” option as well.  It looks different.  Stardock had probably worked on a launcher for it, then that went away when Wargaming.net ended up with the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_131872\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

launched it… and it ran.  Not only did it run, it ran full screen on the big 3440×1440 monitor.  That was cool, a sign of somebody implementing resolution options that worked going forward, the way \u003cem\u003eCiv II\u003c/em\u003e works on my big screen as well despite being from 1996.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe downside was, of course, that everything was very tiny.  I had to go in and make a half scale resolution just to make things big enough for me to see reasonably, which involved me going into the nVidia tool and creating a new resolution for the monitor.  That gets read by the system and the game just believes whatever the OS tells it when it comes to available resolutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\"

compare this against some other games of a slightly later era that locked themselves into the default resolutions of the day and which either simply cannot scale up… \u003cem\u003eSid Meier’s Alpha Centauri\u003c/em\u003e was one of those… which gets really bent due to the screen not being either 4:3 or 16:9.  As I recall SMAC had a fixed max resolution of 1280×1024, which was big for the 90s but kinda tiny for today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I got that up and running and even went out and found some of the classic user made map packs that used to make the rounds back in the day.  All in all it was easier to get running that it was back when I had the base game CD and the two expansion CDs and the follow on patches and the patch that increased the max number of units and the maps and all that… all of which was made extra difficult as Cavedog, the original developer, went out of business a game later. Finding the map pack in that ancient .ufo file format brought back some memories of assembling an up to date install.  Now it all comes in one installer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I got in some good matches on old maps I remembered.  The problem is that the AI… or the computer controlled players, because we have clearly been throwing the term “AI” around way too loosely for 30+ years now… isn’t very good.  On a non-metal planet it tends to starve itself of resources and on a metal planet it becomes chaotic to deal with as it just throws waves of units at you and you end up having to build nukes to hit the Commander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI seem to recall that there were upgraded computer opponent algorithms back in the day.  I might need to look into that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it has been an interesting dive back into a game that feels pretty rudimentary by today’s UI standards.  However, nobody has ever really captured the essence of the game, and there have been attempts to do so.  \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Commander_(video_game)\"\u003eSupreme Commander\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Commander_2\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSupreme Commander 2\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_Annihilation\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlanetary Annihilation\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Engine\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSpring Engine\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and a few others have tried, but they have never quite gotten there for me.  The devs always wanted to both capture some of the original while moving beyond and making something new… which is understandable… but which also never left me satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I can still play the original.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
