  "text": "Sure, CCP hasn’t really finished up June’s Equinox expansion… I mean, they gave up trying to adjust it, set a deadline, and walked away without anybody getting a real sense of the rejuvenation of null sec they were boasting about at the start of the experience. I guess the fact that we’re moving is some sort of localized rejuvenation, though it is more of a reaction to CCP having made smaller stretches of null sec space less viable, so now the player empires need to claim even more. But time flies like an arrow (and, as my mother used to say, fruit flies like a banana) and suddenly the space reserved for the winter New Eden expansion loomed, so yesterday we got the announcement of the Revenant expansion. Revenant… is that Leo? This should not be confused with the Sansha’s Nation pirate faction supercarrier, alleged to be modeled on Sansha Kuvakei favorite sex toy, also named the Revenant. Revenant under attack Once an rare and extremely valuable super capital, it was kind of a big deal when one died.  That screen shot is from an event back in 2015 when the then CFC blew one up just for fun.  There is a whole story about it here… because of course I wrote about it. And then, in late 2016, we lost one on our own cyno beacon… I think that was a Jay Amazingness alt… that was alleged to be valued at 600 billion ISK.  Later, at the height of the Rorqual mining plague supercarriers were available in the 20 billion ISK range… fully fit! That was back when Pandemic Legion was a force to be reckoned with… as opposed to the second tier refuge Jay sought when he betrayed us. Anyway, that is all irrelevant to the expansion, save for the fact that I wondered why I already had a tag for the word “Revenant.”  I won’t bother making a new “Revenant Expansion” tag.  Let them fight.  But it does feel like a name that will get buried by other usage on the internet.  Didn’t Destiny 2 recently launch an expansion named Revenant?  And then there was that movie, right? So what is Revenant bringing to us? New Ships and Weapons From the announcement: The Deathless has unveiled powerful new instruments of war – the Tholos destroyer and Cenotaph battlecruiser. Designed for bold, close-range combat, these ships will be the first to employ unique SCARAB breacher pods for sustained damage over time. This new technology will allow capsuleers to damage and disrupt enemy vessels from within, adding powerful new stratagems to warfare in New Eden. These Minmatar-Caldari hybrid ships are perfect for pilots who relish high-risk, high-reward gameplay, whether in solo operations or fleet warfare. Armed with covert ops cloaking devices and a bonus to stasis webifier resistance, they can slip into enemy ranks undetected and unleash devastating damage, rewarding skilled capsuleers who make the most of their hit-and-run capabilities. Designed for brawling, they are powerful weapons that will provide a tactical edge in the ongoing war. Hmmm… Minmatar-Calamari… also, a covop op battlecruiser?  I mean, we have black ops battleships, but they can’t fit a covops cloak, which allows you to warp while cloaked. So, that is cool… new ships are always cool… but also, in the current New Eden meta where “kitey bullshit” is the preferred approach to things, peeps are going to have to learn to tackle I guess. Mercenary Dens From the announcement: Revenant also introduces mercenary dens – deployable structures that produce encrypted infomorphs by harnessing workforce. These infomorphs are highly sought after by the Deathless and can be exchanged for new and valuable rewards. Shortly after the launch of Revenant, mercenary dens will start generating activities called Tactical Operations, and engaging with (or ignoring) these activities will influence the production of encrypted infomorphs and impact a skyhook’s workforce output. Furthermore, mercenary dens are vulnerable, and hostile pilots can potentially disrupt operations, further influencing workforce output and encrypted infomorph generation. This introduces new resources, activity, and potential for conflict in nullsec. I am going to need more details on this before I snark I guess. Still Trying to Make Corporation Projects a Thing I won’t quote this in full because… details needed.  But I will quote this bit: The new Ship Insurance project type will offer a streamlined way to automate ship replacement programs, providing a seamless and guaranteed compensation system based on the loss value. This project type will be added in an update shortly following the expansion launch and will support expanded project parameters. I bring that one in because that was supposed to be part of the Equinox expansion back in June and… well, I did suggest that the winter expansion would involve no small amount of fixing Equinox, so there we are.  This will just be round 2 of trying to automate SRP.  Until it can respond to players with “rigs not fit” or post derisive threads about bad SRP requests I don’t think it will ever fully replace the current, human operated programs. Corp SKINs via SKINR and other SKINR Stuff One of the least impressive aspects of Equinox was the SKINR, which gave us an awkward UI, a pile of expensive skills, and a market place so over taxed initially that it drove people away… well, this is another thing CCP is going to try and fix with another pass. One of the things people wanted was a way to be able to share SKINs with friends, alts, and corp mates.  So they are going to try to get that going with Revenant. A dedicated section in the Paragon Hub for corporation and alliance SKINs simplifies the process for members to locate and showcase their organization’s colors. Stand out on the battlefield with a coordinated fleet appearance that strengthens team spirit and enhances collective endeavors in New Eden. Also, there will be new patterns, new abilities in the designer, and an expensive new skill to buy and train to try and lower the prohibitive costs of the whole SKINR thing. We’ll see how expensive or awkward this ends up. Buy your AIR Goals with EverMarks Apparently the AIR Daily Tasks still aren’t easy enough, so CCP is going to let you buy your way into them with the pile of useless EverMarks you’ve probably collected since those were introduced.  I have over a quarter million of them… and I haven’t just been sitting on them, I have purchased alliance logos for a number of hulls, which is all you can do with EverMarks as a player… and they are almost all from CCP handouts and AIR rewards. I think I did the “fetch me a hull for some EverMarks” quest two or three times and decided they were dumb and vowed never to do them again. So you will be able to pay EverMarks to earn EverMarks! Also, they are also promising that the login rewards that come with the launch of Revenant will include… yes, more EverMarks!  CCP will make EverMarks a thing even if they have to keep giving them out on a regular basis. What I’d like to hear is maybe some change up in the AIR rewards?  Is that asking too much? Please Clap for EVE Vanguard At the end of the announcement there is a whole section about EVE Vanguard, CCP’s latest attempt at making a first person shooter, in case you have rightfully forgotten all about that.  CCP is still vacillating between “this it totally just part of EVE Online, fighting on planets, and is in your EVE launcher” and “this is going to be a stand-alone title on Steam.”  Either way, they want you to know that they are still working on it and would you please pay some attention and log in and try it. They had the good sense not to toss EVE Frontier into the announcement at least.  Given Teaser Trailer There is also a teaser for the expansion, which proves once again that the art team remains on top of their game. On the other hand, the narrative team… I can’t tell if this is a Ghostbusters reference or a Joseph Conrad reference. My Reactions How does this make me feel? New ships!  Always exciting… and always game breaking until CCP realizes their mistake and nerfs them into the meta. Deployables for… I don’t know.  As I said, need more details. Fixing Exquinox stuff.  I mean, I called it, and they have to do it, but that doesn’t mean I need to be happy that “fixing the last expansion” is a feature of the next expansion.

I think I did the “fetch me a hull for some EverMarks” quest two or three times and decided they were dumb and vowed never to do them again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you will be able to pay EverMarks to earn EverMarks!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, they are also promising that the login rewards that come with the launch of Revenant will include… yes, more EverMarks!  CCP will make EverMarks a thing even if they have to keep giving them out on a regular basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I’d like to hear is maybe some change up in the AIR rewards?  Is that asking too much?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePlease Clap for EVE Vanguard\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the announcement there is a whole section about \u003cem\u003eEVE Vanguard\u003c/em\u003e, CCP’s latest attempt at making a first person shooter, in case you have rightfully forgotten all about that.  CCP is still vacillating between “this it totally just part of \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e, fighting on planets, and is in your \u003cem\u003eEVE\u003c/em\u003e launcher” and “this is going to be a stand-alone title on Steam.”  Either way, they want you to know that they are still working on it and would you please pay some attention and log in and try it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had the good sense not to toss \u003cem\u003eEVE Frontier\u003c/em\u003e into the announcement at least.  Given\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTeaser Trailer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also a teaser for the expansion, which proves once again that the art team remains on top of their game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"Revenant | Expansion Teaser Trailer\" width=\"625\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5jhfjwJ0jw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, the narrative team… I can’t tell if this is a \u003cem\u003eGhostbusters\u003c/em\u003e reference or a Joseph Conrad reference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMy Reactions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow does this make me feel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew ships!  Always exciting… and always game breaking until CCP realizes their mistake and nerfs them into the meta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeployables for… I don’t know.  As I said, need more details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFixing \u003cem\u003eExquinox\u003c/em\u003e stuff.  I mean, I called it, and they have to do it, but that doesn’t mean I need to be happy that “fixing the last expansion” is a feature of the next expansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCCP – \u003ca href=\"https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/revenant-is-coming-on-12-november\"\u003eRevenant is Coming on 12 November\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReddit – \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1g0kzc9/eve_revenant_expansion_announcement_nov_12/\"\u003eEve: Revenant expansion Announcement ( Nov 12\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMassively OP – \u003ca href=\"https://massivelyop.com/2024/10/10/eve-online-reveals-revenant-expansion-eve-frontier-wraps-up-fourth-test-eve-vanguard-plans-biggest-update-yet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eEVE Online reveals Revenant expansion\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
