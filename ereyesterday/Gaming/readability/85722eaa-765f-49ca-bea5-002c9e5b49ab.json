  "text": "Fires spread through LA County.Production on some of Hollywood's biggest shows, including the next season of Fallout, have come to a screeching halt after several major fires broke out across Los Angeles county.Variety reports that filming permits across fire-stricken areas have been withdrawn, which means that the re-start of production for Fallout Season 2 has been potponed, though just until Friday. NBCUnviersal says that production Hacks, Loot, Ted, Suits: LA, and Happy's Place have been suspendended as well.Elsewhere, CBS has halted production on NCIS, NCIS: Origins, and After Midnight, while Disney has paused Doctor Odyssey, Grey's Anatomy, and Jimmy Kimmel Live. Lastly, Warner Bros. studio in Burbank was closed, affecting Abbot Elementary among other shows.Amazon will be looking to get Fallout up and running soon as the first season was a surprise hit for the streamer, and maybe even for fans who were not provided with a lot of details about the show before it premiered.Produced by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy of Westworld fame, Fallout tells an original story in the post-apocalyptic RPG series following three characters: Vault Dweller Lucy MacLean, Brotherhood of Steel squire Maximus, and Cooper Howard, a ghoul who survived The War that destroys America.Fallout recorded 65 million viewers in the first 16 days, becoming the second most-watched show on Prime Video behind The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. The show kicked off a renewed interest in a new Fallout game, though Bethesda themselves are committed on a new Elder Scrolls game first.Check out IGN's full review of the first season and we'll hope that production can resume quickly for these shows.Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.In This Article",
