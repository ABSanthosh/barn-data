Konami has revealed a Silent Hill Transmission--the name it gives to its virtual showcases centered on the series--is coming this Thursday, March 13 at 3 PM PT / 6 PM ET. The video will focus on Silent Hill f, the next mainline game in the series.Silent Hill f was revealed in 2022, but we've not seen it since that day.

Based on the wording of Konami's tweet, it doesn't seem like any other games will be mentioned during the showcase.Silent Hill f's flowery imagery is memorable, and soon it may be placed in a clearer context.Last we'd heard, the oddly named Silent Hill f was in development from Neobards, a studio with experience supporting Resident Evil games, including the remakes for Resident Evil 2 and 3, as well as Resident Evil 7 and its multiplayer mode, ReVerse. The game's story will be penned by famed Japanese writer Ryukishi07, the author of the acclaimed When They Cry visual novel series.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
