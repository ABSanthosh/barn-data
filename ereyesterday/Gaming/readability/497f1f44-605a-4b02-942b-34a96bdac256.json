Right now you can get a base configuration paired with the latest Intel Core Ultra 7 processor for just $1,699.99 with free June delivery. This CPU/GPU duo can comfortably handle even the latest and most demanding games like Black Myth Wukong, Clair Obscur, or Kingdom Come: Deliverance in 4K resolution.Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC for $1,699.99Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 7 265F RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 7 265F RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)This system is equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265F processor, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB graphics card, 16GB of DDR5-5600MHz RAM, and a 1TB M.2 SSD. Note that this is a customizable configuration so you can upgrade the CPU and GPU or increase your memory or storage capacity. I would recommend upgrading the stock air cooling to 240mm all-in-one liquid cooling for the CPU for only $50 extra.The Core Ultra 7 265F is part of Intel's newest Arrow Lake-S lineup released earlier this year and boasts a max turbo frequency of 5.3GHz with 20 cores and a 36MB L2 cache. This is an excellent all-around CPU for gaming, multi-tasking, and general workstation performance. In terms of gaming specifically, you won't see any improvement in performance upgrading to a Core Ultra 9. The entire system is powered by a generous 1,000W 80Plus Platinum rated power supply.The RTX 5070 Ti is an excellent card for up to 4K gaming. In fact, of the Blackwell cards, this is the most affordable 4K graphics card that I'd recommend; the RTX 5070 isn't quite up to snuff and an RTX 5080 gaming PC costs at least $750 more. Compared to the previous generation cards, it's roughly comparable to an RTX 4080 Super but with the added benefit of DLSS 4 and multi-frame generation.Check out more of the best Alienware dealsCheck out our Best Alienware Deals article with all of Dell's currently ongoing deals on gaming laptops and desktop PCs.
