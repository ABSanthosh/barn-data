Obviously, I have opinions on this.  But I am also in the null sec alliance most likely to adapt successfully to whatever CCP throws at us. In the Equinox reality there are three resources constraining null sec entities now, power, workforce, and reagents. Equinox Null Sec Resources The fact that these resources are a hard set aspect of your space means that some space is, once again, better than other space… and some of it is not worthwhile at all, save to hold and exploit for these resources. And the Skyhook is at the center of this, the replacement for the customs office and the extractor of planetary resources. The Skyhook in Equinox And that means, in the reality of Equinox, that Skyhooks are the next battleground to mess with your rivals.  But the meta for that, the most effective method, the way to best deprive your foes of the resources a Skyhook provides… that has yet to be determined.  But top men are working on it.  Top men. Or so I am told.  I know very little on that front frankly.  At one point I think I had memorized all the mechanics around attacking a POS, but since Upwell structures became the norm I have been content to just join fleets and shoot whatever the FC says.  As the meme I used earlier this week said, it is a peaceful life, not worrying about all that.  Deride me as a main fleet F1 monkey, but I just want to join and up shoot things until they explode. Mostly.  Then Asher puts something in the Reaver’s channel about a special op and when something like that comes up I am ready to do something different. This time the ask was a character we were willing to let sit entombed… logged out in hostile space… in a black ops battleship while we experimented with shooting Skyhooks in PanFam territory. Count me in.  I had a character logged out like that for nine months this year, just sitting out there waiting for the call to log in to drop on capitals running CRABs in Malpais and TKE.  He still had his Redeemer in a low sec NPC station not far from PanFam space. The announcement said we would be leaving from UALX and headed out to Insmother.  So I got my covert cyno alt out… still subscribed from my black ops side adventure during the great Tenerifis migration… and flew out to a point where I could cyno the black ops towards our intended field of operation. And then there was a change in the fits announced, so when we left from UALX I grab Wilhelm, filled a blockade runner with supplies, including fuel and the required module updates, and flew out to the area of operation as well. Landing out in hostile space I will say this… the conduit jump feature for black ops battleships is now one of my favorite aspects of the game.  That allows you to jump to a cyno with your blops and bring along additional covert ops capable ships.  Since I had the blops and two such ships… both of which could either light a cyno or get carried along with a conduit jump… I was able to move my little fleet around pretty handily… and had a supply wagon along to boot. On the flip side of that mobility bonus, I did end up with three characters logged out in hostile space for over a week.  Not the worst thing in the world… I didn’t have anything else going on really… but it was also to support ships and a combat ship.  So when we went off to hit a Skyhook, my blops went off to shoot while my other two safed up somewhere or just stayed logged out. Hitting a Skyhook early in the op We invested quite a bit of time setting timers… like other Upwell structures, you don’t get to blow them up in one go… to see if the locals would respond or show up to defend when the timers hit.  I missed the first round of timers because they landed on Thanksgiving Day and we had a house full of people. We did not do anything on the reagents front… you can steal from the reagents store if the window is timed right and you knock down the shields. This silo is secure for now However, even if we had been there at the right time, we didn’t have much free cargo space for loot.  I suppose my blockade runner could have carried some off, but the option never came up. The idea is, of course, to blow up or disable Skyhooks so that they are no longer feeding resources into the supply system of the locals, thus disrupting their ability to do things like run Ansiblex jump bridges. As I understand it, we blew a few up.  But I was not around for any of the kills.  I am on zero Skyhook kill mails so far. When I was able to get back on again we had been moving around. The fleet in motion I had missed a location change and ended up jumping my little convoy up to The Spire, where we were going to poke NCDot in their home space to see how they would react. They did indeed react.  They popped in with a considerable fleet while we were trying to burn down one of their Skyhooks in a key system with an Ansiblex… which is also how they showed up as quickly as they did.  We pulled drones and Asher conduit jumped us out to a nearby system where we logged out. There was also an unfortunate drop on a hostile dread that turned out to be a trap.  We lost a few blops on that one, though I managed to ECM burst my way out of tackle and safe up before getting back to my alts. We spent about two weeks out in hostile space doing this and trying various things to see what might work and what needed further development. Not that I could tell, one way or the other.  I am willing to run off into hostiles space and live off the land, but that doesn’t mean I know what is going on. Eventually though a ping went out to announce we were headed back home.  Some of the ships diverted back to the low sec staging system from which we had been operating for a while.  I decided to bring all my ships back to UALX for the time being.  That Redeemer left out of Jita back in October of 2023 and had been out in the field for most of the time since then.  It felt like a time to regroup and figure out which character ought to be doing what. So a few of us headed back to Tenerifis… though we stopped to shoot a Skyhook on the way out.  That is one way to wait out your jump timer. In a reminder of how close we are now to PanFam, it was just three conduit jumps before we were tethered up in an Imperium system, and one more jump put us back in UALX. Tethered to a friendly structure Now those who were running the experiment, measuring our effectiveness and watching our foes, will go back to the drawing board and come up with something new to try.  I hope I’ll be there for whatever comes next. Also, I can add to the log of Reavers ops something for our eleventh year. Related Skyhook info: EVE Uni Wiki – Orbital Skyhooks CCP – Orbital Skyhook CCP – Equinox Update: Enhanced Skyhooks",

were going to poke NCDot in their home space to see how they would react.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey did indeed react.  They popped in with a considerable fleet while we were trying to burn down one of their Skyhooks in a key system with an Ansiblex… which is also how they showed up as quickly as they did.  We pulled drones and Asher conduit jumped us out to a nearby system where we logged out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was also an unfortunate drop on a hostile dread that turned out to be a trap.  We lost a few blops on that one, though I managed to ECM burst my way out of tackle and safe up before getting back to my alts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe spent about two weeks out in hostile space doing this and trying various things to see what might work and what needed further development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that I could tell, one way or the other.  I am willing to run off into hostiles space and live off the land, but that doesn’t mean I know what is going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually though a ping went out to announce we were headed back home.  Some of the ships diverted back to the low sec staging system from which we had been operating for a while.  I decided to bring all my ships back to UALX for the time being.  That Redeemer left out of Jita back in October of 2023 and had been out in the field for most of the time since then.  It felt like a time to regroup and figure out which character ought to be doing what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo a few of us headed back to Tenerifis… though we stopped to shoot a Skyhook on the way out.  That is one way to wait out your jump timer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a reminder of how close we are now to PanFam, it was just three conduit jumps before we were tethered up in an Imperium system, and one more jump put us back in UALX.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_125699\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca
