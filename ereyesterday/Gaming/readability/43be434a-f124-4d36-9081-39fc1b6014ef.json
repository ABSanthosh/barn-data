Amazon is currently offering a 27\" KTC gaming monitor for only $92.99 shipped after you clip a $40 off coupon on the product page and apply another $7 off coupon code: \"05DMKTC38\". This item has over 1,800 reviews on Amazon with an average 4.4/5 star score and a respectable Fakespot \"B\" rating. It has plenty of gaming features you wouldn't expect at this price point.27\" KTC QHD 100Hz G-Sync IPS Gaming Monitor for $92.9927\" KTC 2560x1440 (QHD) 100Hz G-Sync IPS Gaming MonitorThe KTC H27T13 is a 27\" monitor with a 2560x1440 resolution, which averages out to a sharp 109ppi pixel density. It's equipped with a pre-calibrated IPS panel with good color reproduction and wide viewing angles. It's decently fast with a refresh rate up to 100Hz and G-Sync compatibility. KTC includes a 3 year warranty.If you're considering this monitor, chances are you're pairing it with a budget gaming PC setup. You probably don't need an expensive monitor with a 4K resolution that will overly tax your PC or 240Hz refresh rate that will be hard to achieve. G-Sync technology, however, is especially useful for these budget builds, since your fps is more likely to fluctuate than higher-end builds and adaptive sync helps provide a smoother and tear-free experience. This is a good monitor to pair with something like an RTX 4060, 4070, 5070, or the new Radeon RX 9070 GPU.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
