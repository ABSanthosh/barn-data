This sale is set to act as a competitor to Amazon Prime Day, which begins this week as well. If you're looking to save on the latest electronics, Black Friday in July is a sale you'll want to check out. Shop the Best Buy Black Friday in July SaleRight now, there are deals live across video games, accessories, laptops, Apple products, appliances, cell phones, headphones, and more. The best deals we've seen so far mostly fall under video games, with $20 off some major Nintendo Switch games now available. One of our favorites is Splatoon 3 for $39.99, especially considering the game just received a Nintendo Switch 2 patch. There's also over $200 in savings on the Lenovo Legion Go S. This handheld PC packs in the Ryzen Z2 Go, 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, 1TB of PCIe Gen4 SSD storage, and room for expansion with a 1TB microSD card slot. That's not to mention the 8\" screen equipped with VRR, a 120Hz refresh rate, a 500 nit peak brightness, and more. Finally, a four pack of AirTags is sitting at a new all-time low sale price. These are incredibly helpful for finding your wallet, purse, bag, or even pet! This deal puts each AirTag at $17, which is significantly lower than the $29.99 asking price for a single unit normally.Should You Wait for Prime Day Tomorrow?While the Best Buy Black Friday in July sale has some great offers, the longest Prime Day ever is set to begin tomorrow, July 8. If you are looking to save the most money this year, waiting for Prime Day to see what deals are available is likely your best option. This sale from Best Buy is set to be live for the rest of the week, so you can always come back and shop if you don't find something better at Amazon. It's expected that we will see some significant discounts on both video games and technology this year, among numerous other products.Originally posted: Jul 8, 2025 12:30 am",
