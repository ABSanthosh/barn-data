There's already a discount on these memory cards, but if you buy two 1.5TB SanDisk Ultra microSDs directly from SanDisk today, you'll get an extra 20% off at checkout. That drops the price to just £74.45/$90 per card (2 for £148.90, or $179.98) which is wild considering these were going for a whole lot more during Amazon's Spring Sale a couple of weeks back.

  "text": "Buy two and save big on handheld-ready storage. SanDisk has one of the best offers going right now if you're looking for a massive storage upgrade on your handheld gaming device. There's already a discount on these memory cards, but if you buy two 1.5TB SanDisk Ultra microSDs directly from SanDisk today, you'll get an extra 20% off at checkout. That drops the price to just £74.45/$90 per card (2 for £148.90, or $179.98) which is wild considering these were going for a whole lot more during Amazon's Spring Sale a couple of weeks back. In my opinion, this is one of the best bang-for-buck upgrades you can make if you're running anything from a Steam Deck to a ROG Ally or the original Nintendo Switch. These cards don’t just offer capacity, they’re actually reliable for day-to-day use. A1-rated with read speeds up to 150MB/s, they can load games, apps, and emulators fast enough that you won’t be left wondering if your handheld just gave up. Steam Deck users? This is your dream scenario. The internal SSD is nice, but it fills up fast. Toss one of these cards in and suddenly you've got space for dozens of AAA games, a hefty emu setup, or both. I've run games straight off A1-rated microSDs on my Deck with no real performance hang-ups, and if you're playing indies or emulated titles, it feels just as smooth as internal storage. Not only that, but the SanDisk Ultra ranks high on RPS' best Steam Deck microSD card roundup. The same goes for the ROG Ally, Ally X, and Lenovo Legion Go. These Windows handhelds are designed for convenience, not constant storage upgrades. So unless you're keen on cloning SSDs every few months, this deal is a low-effort, high-reward solution. You won't get NVMe-level speeds, but you will get the flexibility to install anything you want, when you want. For console gamers, OG Nintendo Switch handles also these cards like a champ. It doesn't need bleeding-edge storage to run smooth, and 1.5TB gives you enough room to stop micromanaging your library. I've seen people load entire retro collections on cards like this with space to spare for the latest Zelda. If you're still swapping out a 256GB card every few weeks, I think it's time to upgrade.",
