  "text": "Amazon is having its longest Prime Day in 2025.Amazon has officially revealed the dates for Prime Day 2025, and it's the first time Prime Day will be longer than two days. Running from July 8-11, it's the longest Prime Day since the sales event began 10 years ago. With tariffs on the horizon and prices on the rise, many shoppers (including myself) will be looking forward to this to find some of the best deals of the year. With a longer sales event, we can likely expect more deals this year – right?Well, not necessarily. Amazon had its longest-ever Memorial Day sale earlier this year by starting it a full week before Memorial Day weekend, but the deals didn't really get any better just because shoppers had more time to browse them. While I don't know for sure that the same will be true for Prime Day this year, I can't help but think the extra two days won't actually have any sort of impact on how many good deals there are.Still, having extra time to shop a sale that takes place in the middle of the work week is definitely a welcome change. There might also be a few other benefits to having those extra days that we can potentially look forward to.A Longer Prime Day Could Mean More Lightning DealsThe one major benefit of having more Prime Days is that it opens up the door to more lightning deals, which are already where you'll find the best overall discounts during sales events like these. The downsides are that they can be fairly inconsistent, sell out quickly, or simply expire. Some lightning deals are time-based, meaning they only last for a specific window before they disappear. Others are set up with a limited number of products available at that discount before the deal is removed.Having two extra days could potentially mean more or lightning deals, but it also means more slots for Amazon to fill with discounts on things nobody will really care about. You'll just need to consistently check Amazon's deals page to see what new flash sales Amazon has dropped each day, which is understandably a chore. Though there's no guarantee you'll find something good just because it's being marketed as a Prime Day deal. Amazon already has new lightning deals every day, regardless of whether a sale is happening or not.Most of the best deals drop early, thoughIt's worth noting that outside of lightning deals, the best overall Prime Day deals on Amazon tend to drop either before or on the first day of the event. These are things like discounts on Amazon devices, Amazon subscription services, TVs, and video games that aren't on any sort of timer or limit. So having more time to decide if you should buy some AirPods or get yourself an Audible subscription is great, but it doesn't change the discount at all.A Longer Amazon Sale Could Mean More Competing SalesAnother potential benefit of a longer Prime Day is an extension of a recent trend. With Amazon's sale taking place in July every year since 2015, other major retailers have started kicking off competing Amazon Prime Day sales of their own. Major retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy have consistently offered some sort of \"Prime Day\" counter-sale sale over the last few years and 2025 shouldn't be any different.With Amazon extending its sale, other retailers will be forced to compete with the online retailer in the same time frame. This will hopefully mean that retailers outside of Amazon will have different deals or lower prices on some items during July, but that's not necessarily guaranteed. Amazon tends to match whatever prices other retailers have at any given time anyway, so price drops anywhere online tend to benefit Amazon shoppers regardless of where they came from. These types of discounts also tend to be available for those without a Prime membership as well.Will Amazon Prime Day 2025 Be Worth Shopping?Although a longer Amazon Prime Day may not be a reason to rejoice, I do think it is still going to be one of the best times of the year to shop. Tariffs on imports that were threatened then paused are supposed to resume in early August, which means prices are only going to go up this year if those go into full effect. Prime Day has consistently been a good time to find deals, and I expect 2025 will be largely the same. Even if prices aren't incredible, there's no guarantee that they are going to be any better during Black Friday this year. With that in mind, I'd definitely recommend shopping Amazon's sale this year.There also aren't that many other big sales events on the horizon after Prime Day. There will be some Labor Day sales and October Prime Day, but other than those smaller events Black Friday is the next time you'll be able to save money on most things.Originally posted: Jun 17, 2025 10:35 pm",
