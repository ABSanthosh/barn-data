  "text": "It has been a long week for Lord of the Rings Online and its 64-bit server project as things have not gone to plan… even if things have gone exactly as many of us suspected they would. The name reservation thing on Monday went about par for the course… which is to say that if you incentivize your entire population to try and converge onto four servers, two in the US and two in the EU, the competition for even names is going to be fierce. The new US servers, still closed when this post goes live I did not get my top three choices on either US server… but I did what everybody else did, which was grab the next three names on both. Then came the time for transfers… which was the name reservation issue on steroids… at least when the transfer button was available.  It has not been available very often since Tuesday.  I wasn’t really sure who I would want to transfer in any case.  I have several generations of characters scattered across a number of servers.  Who even would be worth the effort?  So not having the transfer button available has spared me the indecision.  If I go back it will probably be best to start over fresh again in any case. I am sure that there is some fundamental architectural issue, some bad decision made by Turbine two decades back, that has forced Standing Stone Games to engage in this monumentally flawed plan, where everybody is incentivized to transfer to one of these four servers, that led to this impossible situation for them.  And they haven’t even gotten to the dead servers, the servers shut down with characters still on them.  That part of the circus as been postponed until some future date. I mean, other titles have managed to avoid this sort of thing.  In the past EverQuest II has just picked up and transferred whole servers en masse to consolidate.  And both EverQuest and EverQuest II implemented 64-bit servers without forcing players to become digital refugees in search of a better home.  But SSG was unable to do that… and seem both a bit bitter and surprised that people have behaved in exactly the way they encouraged them to. And “better” is no doubt part of why people are so keen, as the current LOTRO servers have been plagued with a host of issues over the last few years.  These new 64-bit servers offer a promise of maybe things being better.  Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to play lag free! I guess I have to admire the audacious optimism of the plan, where they even promised free server transfers to people who went to one 64-bit server then later decided they wanted to go to a different one.  The 64-bit transfer channel on the LOTRO Discord server has been lit. Today is… or is planned to be… the culmination of all of this half-baked transfer fever… I never did see the transfer button active this week… the true test to see if the promised land of 64-bit is all it has been built up to be.  If nothing else, it will be a stress test. We shall see what the day brings.  The planned opening is later this morning.  Usually companies don’t do this sort of thing on a Friday unless they plan to work all weekend… but I think at this point we can just accept as fact that the planning hasn’t been stellar across the board. Update: The servers went live and people can log in.  I logged in for a bit with a new character, then immediately turned off world chat because people are awful. However, despite rumors that transfers have been turned on now and then, the process apparently gets swamped every time SSG does this, so you have to be exactly at the right place at the right time for it to happen.
