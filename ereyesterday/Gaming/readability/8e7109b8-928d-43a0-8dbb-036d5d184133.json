  "text": "Bloomin' heck, that looks like quite the challenge Image credit: Adglobe/ Live Wire It's not even been two months since the release of Ender Magnolia: Bloom In The Mist, and co-developers Adglobe and Live Wire are already back with a pretty solid update. The major addition is a New Game+ mode, which allows you to start the \"evil-purging adventure anew, this time armed with gear and relics from previous playthroughs”, and face “harrowing hordes of smarter, stronger enemies with new attack patterns.\" If you've never even heard of the game before, here's a quick rundown: Ender Magnolia sees you playing as Lilac, an \"Attuner\" whose goal is to save the Homunculi. Working with them, you search for your lost memories, as you accrue a whole bunch of different unique abilities that you can net from turning bosses into your allies. It's cool stuff! And looked well worth jumping into even before this latest update. ENDER MAGNOLIA: Bloom in the Mist Final Trailer Watch on YouTube New Game+ aside, Ender Magnolia: Bloom In The Mist's 1.1.0 update adds the ability to rechallenge bosses you've already taken down, with the press release explaining that \"allies become enemies once again as Lilac gains the ability to revisit momentous battles of the past.\" You can replay these battles at rest points to gain additional Fragments for unlocking collectibles. There's also a new Boss Rush mode, for people who enjoy those battles but can't be bothered with all the intervening metroidvania, with time-based completion bonuses for speedrunners. The update is available right now.",
