  "description": "Ranked Play has arrived in Black Ops 6's multiplayer, bringing a competitive ladder that closely follows the official rules, maps, and game modes used by the Call of Duty League (CDL), meaning this mode restricts many of the game's perks, weapons, and attachments. Here we explain everything you need to know about accessing and playing Ranked Play, as well as guide you in building some of the best ranked loadouts available.We also have guides for recommended Black Ops 6 weapon builds to use in Warzone and standard multiplayer loadouts for Season 1. How to access Ranked Played in Black Ops 6Ranked Play is unlocked differently than in previous years. In Black Ops 6, you must first earn at least 50 wins in multiplayer. This requirement was previously explained by Treyarch as being included to ensure that players are experienced with multiplayer, and it gives the Ricochet anti-cheat team a historical match history to examine before an account enters Ranked Play. How Ranked Play works in Black Ops 6Just like in recent years, Ranked Play features 4v4 gameplay of Hardpoint, Control, and Search and Destroy. Friendly-fire is enabled in these modes. The featured map pool for the Call of Duty League in Black Ops 6 includes Protocol, Vault, Rewind, Skyline, and Red Card.There are eight ranks to climb in Black Ops 6 Ranked Play, and everyone begins the season at 0 SR (Skill Rating). The ranking system progresses as follows:Bronze – Starting RankSilver – 900 SRGold – 2,100 SRPlatinum – 3,600 SRDiamond – 5,400 SRCrimson – 7,500 SRIridescent – 10,000 SRTop 250 – 10,000+ SRYou'll level up through these ranks as you play and earn a higher SR, and a portion of your SR is deducted with each loss. How much SR you earn will depend on various factors, which include the distance from your projected rank, individual and team performance in each match, and the margin of each match win.Treyarch does reveal that team performance has a bigger impact on SR gained or lost in higher ranks, so that all winning playstyles are more consistently rewarded. Ranked Play RewardsRanked Play rewards are available to earn, and this includes both career and seasonal rewards. Rewards are cosmetics such as operator skins, calling cards, weapon charms, and more. The Ranked Play skins can be previewed in the image above. Best Ranked Play weapons to level up and useCurrently, pro players only use the GPR 91 and AMES 85 assault rifles. They have banned the Model L, XM4, and Krig C with gentleman's agreements, but these assault rifles are solid options that are still available at this time with the launch of Ranked Play.The Jackal PDW is the submachine gun used by pro players, but there are a few other options in Ranked Play.Snipers are restricted for Hardpoint and Control game modes, but the LW3A1 Frostline and LR 7.62 snipers are unbanned for Search and Destroy. However, you can only snipe with the base version of these sniper rifles, as all attachments have been deemed too powerful and banned by the pros.The full list of restrictions for Black Ops 6 Ranked Play can be found below, as well as specific weapon builds to use. Best Ranked Play loadout for assault riflesTaking all of the attachment bans into consideration, the recommended options here are best suited for all assault rifles currently available to use. These attachments will help reduce recoil, as well as boost the gun's damage and range.Recommended AR attachments:Optic: Kepler MicroflexMuzzle: Ported CompensatorBarrel: Reinforced BarrelUnderbarrel: Vertical ForegripRear Grip: Commando Grip Best Ranked Play Jackal PDW loadoutThe Jackal PDW is a powerful submachine gun used by CDL players. The suggested attachments are used by many of the pros, and these will help boost the damage and range of the Jackal PDW, as well as provide you with better mobility.Recommended Jackal PDW attachments:Muzzle: CompensatorBarrel: Reinforced BarrelUnderbarrel: Vertical ForegripRear Grip: Ergonomic GripStock: Balanced Stock Best Ranked Play PP-919 loadoutCurrently, the PP-919 isn't a favorite in the pro circuit, but it is available in Ranked Play.

Ninja is the best first perk for Search and Destroy, while you'll want to equip Flak Jacket for the respawn modes. Flashbangs are the best tactical equipment available, however, you can make a smoke class to use for search and Destroy. It's best to tailor and label at least one class towards Search and Destroy.
