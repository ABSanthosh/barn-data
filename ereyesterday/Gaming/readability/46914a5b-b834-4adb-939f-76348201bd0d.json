Finally a game perfect for mobile. Fun, fresh and exciting gameplay. Although some might argue that it’s a mixture of genres. But either way, it has that Supercell charm, polish and slickness. Still early days but there’s huge potential here. For casual and seasoned gamers. I think this might be the next keeper. But let’s play a bit more and see. Loving it so far. I’ve been playing since it soft launched and enjoyed it, I am honestly more excited for Mo.co though I keep looking out for new info on that and hoping it gets softlaunched. Anyway I like this game overall and win or loose I don’t find it stressful or annoying but I dislike that it’s 3 hours to earn a chest ticket as I only play for chests so one game every 3 hours sucks a bit. It does get a bit repetitive after a while but I’m sure they will keep adding things to keep it fresh like with Brawl Stars. I also thought they could have done more with the plaza but again maybe in time? Also the season pass seems pricey to me and not tempting at all for the rewards that you get especially since Megas are a one time use for each one you get. That’s from someone that will buy one if it feels like good value, I use to get them all while I played Brawl Stars. I think this game is meant to be played not religiously but more on the side. Unlike most live service games nowadays. That way it won’t feel repetitive and will be rewarding. I am okay with that. I don’t want my mobile games to take an hour to have maybe 15mins of enjoyment out of it. I don’t wanna comment on the monetisation as I’ve hardly played it. But it all comes down to the longevity of the game for me. I only consider getting battle passes AFTER I have spent a substantial amount of time with the game and feel that it’ll only add to the experience. Which nowadays, tbh, hardly any game does. adin and ste86uk like this. Boy..didn’t expect to play this for an hour or so. Kinda feels casual enough where I’m not getting slaughtered. I like mix and matching different units. I have a mix of games where I dominate and games where I’m barely surviving. It does feel repetitive depending on the unlocks. I’ll play on and off until I get bored. Edit: Played a few more rounds right now and kinda getting bored. It's pretty causal at the moment for me..but there's not much variety between games and don't feel like grinding the characters. I'll try not to delete/reinstall it...again... But feels like its nearing the end for me. Staff Member Patreon Bronze I hope the devil ravages the development team behind this game dry to their deaths! Never ever have I played a more forced video game that works against you! And the more you invest, the worse they treat you! This specific branch of Supercell is known for doing anything for money, these people would sacrifice their families for some cash, and they would gladly take your time and energy just to mess with you. I hope they die from cancer, but I can not believe they made it so using doublers forces you into fake matches against bots, and that on high winstreaks the game does everything it can to make you lose, I'm a God Tier player (because I player since day one), but even I can not defeat a 'single hit' bots who come destroy and take your gems. It's even worse how you are supposed to have this squad that moves together, but they couldn't be bothered respecting their own rules, so when you are chased by a God Tier Bot (made for you to lose) your squad would just run around, getting stuck around map for other players to take down. Everything is made to screw with you, and thus I hope someone gets to screw with them. May death find it's way to these people. So do you like the game or not ? And you created an account just to post this. Ouch I kinda like the passion, though. My guess is there's love for the game but a tiny little bit of hate towards devs. No matter how much you dislike a game or its monetization, calling for the “deaths” of the devs is never warranted. Honestly I don’t know how this game got launched so quickly, it’s easily the supercell game I stopped playing the quickest. Played during softlaunch and loved it and then quit not long after launch. I have no desire to go back to it at all. It’s just too simple and random. The fact that they made it random, using every method that can boost your dopamine, with characters from their best games is all done on purpose, and it's fun to some extend. Having flashy tittles, each game being sweaty and having so many things to upgrade. It keeps you on your toes and it helps the gambling itch a lot. But making a system that makes you lose on purpose? That is not just scummy, but evil. People used to mention it on their Subreddit but they keep removing these posts. That's why I made another one here. And obviously, calling death upon some aristocrats from Sweden who make millions on children's tears is absolutely uncalled for, it still does manage to display my affection towards the developers. Using 'doublers' which give you more resources on the next win results in a match you can not win because the developers don't want you to use their free gift. It's such a contrast compared to Brawl (Brawl Stars only lacks Ranked system). And in normal matches, it's 10 of you in the match, you are on you 12 streak (not even that high) and suddenly you are surrounded, all 10 teams are around you instead of this vast map, not even grinding but coming after you. Turns out, it's not real players, but bots. Made for you to lose. Share This Page",

It\u0026#39;s even worse how you are supposed to have this squad that moves together, but they couldn\u0026#39;t be bothered respecting their own rules, so when you are chased by a God Tier Bot (made for you to lose) your squad would just run around, getting stuck around map for other players to take down. Everything is made to screw with you, and thus I hope someone gets to screw with them. May death find it\u0026#39;s way to these people.\n\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/article\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli id=\"post-4307278\" data-author=\"psj3809\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"http://data-vocabulary.org/Person\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/squad-busters-by-supercell.432375/members/psj3809.75898/\" data-avatarhtml=\"true\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/squad-busters-by-supercell.432375/styles/toucharcade/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png\" width=\"96\" height=\"96\" alt=\"psj3809\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003carticle\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nSo do you like the game or not ?\u003cp\u003e\n\nAnd you created an account just to post this.

Having flashy tittles, each game being sweaty and having so many things to upgrade. It keeps you on your toes and it helps the gambling itch a lot.\u003cp\u003e\n\nBut making a system that makes you lose on purpose? That is not just scummy, but evil. People used to mention it on their Subreddit but they keep removing these posts. That\u0026#39;s why I made another one here.

It\u0026#39;s such a contrast compared to Brawl (Brawl Stars only lacks Ranked system). And in normal matches, it\u0026#39;s 10 of you in the match, you are on you 12 streak (not even that high) and suddenly you are surrounded, all 10 teams are around you instead of this vast map, not even grinding but coming after you. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nTurns out, it\u0026#39;s not real players, but bots.\u003cbr/\u003e\nMade for you to lose.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/article\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003c/form\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eShare This Page\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",
