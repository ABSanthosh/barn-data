  "text": "But no news of US start date just yet. Image credit: Eurogamer/Nintendo Canadian Switch 2 pre-orders - which were originally set to go live on 9th April before Nintendo announced a last-minute delay - will reportedly now begin next week. Nintendo slammed on the brakes last Tuesday, just a day before Canadian Switch 2 pre-orders were set to begin, saying it was making the move \"in order to align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the US\". That followed the company's unprecedented decision to indefinitely delay Switch 2 pre-orders in the US while the company looked to \"assess the potential impact\" of US president Donald Trump sweeping trade tariffs. Now, though, Billbill-kun - who has a strong track-record when it comes to retail leaks - says Canadian Switch 2 pre-orders will begin soon. \"From what I can see through some Canadian retailers,\" they wrote on social media, \"Nintendo Switch 2 console \u0026 bundle pre-orders should start from 23rd April, 2025. Date subject to change. Can't confirm if it's the same for US.\" Nintendo Switch 2 Hands-On Preview: Mario Kart World Impressions \u0026 More! Eurogamer's Switch 2 hands-on preview.Watch on YouTube Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser previously admitted the US administration's trade tariffs - which had heavily impacted some of the company's key manufacturing locations around the world - were a \"challenge\" and \"something we're going to have to address.\" And despite a temporary pause on some tariffs since then, the situation has remained uncertain amid confusing messaging around potential electronics exceptions. One prominent analytics firm has said it expects Nintendo to stick with its previously announced $450 launch price for Switch 2 in the US despite the tariffs, but believes their effect could lead to a 20 percent price increase for the console over the next two years. And it's not just Nintendo. Earlier this month, US trade group the Entertainment Software Association said the tariffs will \"have a real and detrimental impact\" on the video games industry as a whole.",
