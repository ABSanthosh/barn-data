  "text": "Standing Stone’s vague “Reply hazy, ask again later” responses around what will become of the old 32-bit LOTRO game worlds over the last few months have now resolved into “we’re closing them down, get out while you can!”  Thanks SSG!  Glad we can trust you won’t mislead us! Lord of the Rings Online Seriously, as of today the original 64-bit transfer FAQ contains this tasty tidbit of information: At this time we do not intend to close our 32-bit game worlds. Eventually, we would like players to experience the game on our 64-bit game worlds, but as long as the populations of our 32-bit game worlds remain healthy we intend to keep these worlds open. I guess the loophole is “remain healthy,” a parameter they did not deign to define, so it could mean anything.  Still, I would be very surprised if at least a couple of those old servers didn’t still have a significant population that declined to move. (Original FAQ archived here in case they memory hole that frequently asked question.) But that has been decided.  The course forward is now clear. If you have been sitting on the sidelines on one of the old servers watching the fun and trouble of players trying to get their characters, kinships, and housing moved and accounted for on the new 64-bit worlds and thinking you’re not going to get caught up in that mess… well, it is your turn in the mess!  Even though SSG hasn’t solved its transfer problems, it has decided to push ahead and force everybody onto the new 64-bit worlds. Go!  Now!  Go! Go! Go! You have about two and a half months to find a new home before your characters enter the limbo of the Dark Worlds zone… which is even worse than the friend zone.  In the friend zone you can still watch TV. The following 32-bit game worlds will close after 23:59 EDT on Sunday, August 31, 2025: Arkenstone Belegaer Brandywine Crickhollow Evernight Gladden Gwaihir Landroval Laurelin Sirannon Treebeard After August 31s, these eleven servers will become the new dark worlds, following in the tradition of the 2015 server closures.  You will no longer be able to log into them so, even if you decide later to transfer your characters… whenever SSG decides to make that available after they go dark… you won’t be able to tell anything about them save for the character names. Character creation on these 32-bit worlds will be disabled as of July 30, 2025.  I am not sure why they will allow it to go that far after this announcement.  But I am not sure why they are in a sudden hurry to rid themselves of the 32-bit worlds given the string of problems the transfers to 64-bit worlds have seen and how overly optimistic their assessments at the beginning of the year ended up being. This all feels very much like a “we’ve learned nothing from our past experience” situation, which, I will admit, is entirely on brand for Turbine-cum-WB-cum-SSG entity over the last 30+ years.  I suppose I should be happy that this isn’t just a Silicon Valley problem, but still. I have nine characters still sitting on 32-bit servers and four character slots left on Glamdring, so now I need to go do some deleting to make room.  I’ve likely played the nine… the nine, why is that number suddenly feel significant… on those still live servers more recently than the ones I rescued earlier this month from the 2015 dark servers.  Something else to sort out. Also, tucked away at the end of the announcement about this is a notice that they are going to turn off the old, archived forums.  That means they get to dump a lot of old criticism.  You know they’re trying to hide something when they tack it on to an unrelated announcement.  Oh by the way… Anyway, there are links with more reading material about the situation below.
