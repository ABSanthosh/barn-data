  "description": "Earlier this week, the ongoing saga of Destiny 2 reached a new turning point with the release of Revenant Act 3. But the conclusion of that chapter means that players are getting new weapons and other improvements going forward.Bungie has shared the details about Destiny 2's latest updates, including a pair of legendary weapons. The first is called Red Tape, and it's a stasis scout rifle; while the second is a stasis rocket launcher named Heretic's Fervor. You can see both weapons in action in the new trailer below, as well as a glimpse of the new exotic mission, Kell's Fall. Completing Kell's Fall will give players access to yet another weapon: A powerful exotic shotgun called Slayer’s Fang. Players can also replay Kell's Fall to upgrade Slayer's Fang with up to four catalysts. Starting with the next episode debut, Heresy, on February 4, Destiny 2 will also increase the caps for Strange Coins to 199, while Osirian Ciphers and Nightfall Ciphers will be bumped from 10 to 30. Bungie has also invited players to begin voting for next fall's Festival of the Lost Armor. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Bungie has also invited players to begin voting for next fall's Festival of the Lost Armor. Earlier this month, the original Destiny got a holiday-themed update, which surprised players since the focus has been on Destiny 2 for years. Late last year, players also discovered an exploit that gave them the Dawning Event Card Upgrade for free. Bungie was pretty cool about that and allowed players to keep the upgrade even though it ordinarily costs $10. There are currently no available deals GameSpot may get a commission from retail offers.
