Whether he’ll arrive solo or alongside the live-service game’s promised offline mode remains to be seen.Suggested ReadingThe Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Marvel's Spider-Man 2OffEnglishSuggested ReadingThe news arrived on Friday by way of a short social media post teasing the December 10 date for season 4 to go live along with art for Deathstroke, who will be the fourth post-launch character added to Suicide Squad’s roster since it came out back in January. Unlike some of those earlier additions, however, fans are actually excited about the sword-wielding assassin’s reveal, at least for now.“Now that is an awesome Deathstroke design!” wrote one player on the game’s subreddit. “The heavy battle-damage across the suit and armor plates adds so much depth to the lethal super-soldier visage.” Another joked, “Of all the characters they could have added, Condiment King, Slipknot who can climb anything, Kite Woman, Harley Quinn’s former roommate from college, Dr. Penelope Young’s rotted corpse, why did they choose a popular character like Deathstroke?”Suicide Squad’s end-game has been evolving ever since the conclusion of its main campaign left players frustrated and disappointed. A seasonal storytelling structure setting up events that would seemingly see the Justice League eventually brought back into the picture has brought us the Joker, Mrs. Freeze (a gender-swap of the icy villain), and Deadshot’s daughter Lawless. Despite some big updates, new loot, and the expanding roster’s unique traversal and combat abilities, the lack of great missions or interesting boss fights has made the post-launch roadmap a bumpy one. Suicide Squad was recently available for just $5 on Steam, but the always-online third-person shooter still seems destined for the eventual live-service graveyard. Rocksteady Studios has committed to the game’s first year of promised content, but it’s unclear if it has a future beyond that as the development team faces cuts and work prototyping new single-player projects. One thing that would keep Suicide Squad secure for its existing fanbase is an offline mode. Rocksteady previously said it was aiming to add this in an update sometime in 2024, but that was prior to the rocky release. A spokesperson for Warner Bros. didn’t respond to a request for comment when Kotaku recently inquired if an offline mode was still on track for this year. Players are hopeful that, despite radio silence on the feature for months, the fact that it’s still promised on Suicide Squad’s website means it’s still coming, eventually. Update 12/9/2024 3:33 p.m. ET: Rocksteady confirmed in its write-up of season 4 that Deathstroke will indeed be arriving alongside the game’s long-awaited offline mode. The offline mode will require players to download a new update on December 10 and will only work with a new in-game profile which can be created by copying their existing progress over. There’s a more thorough explainer on how the mode works over on WB’s website. Rocksteady also confirmed season 4 episode 8, which arrives on January 14, will be the game’s final content update. .",
