Vin Diesel said he’s bringing the franchise back to LA, the movie will return to street racing car culture, and he’s reuniting Dom (Vin Diesel’s character) and Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker's character).Vin Diesel and Paul Walker in 2001's The Fast And The Furious. Photo by Universal/Getty Images.Vin Diesel’s comments tally with those he made in 2023, when he teased a goodbye for the late Paul Walker's character, Brian O'Conner. Paul Walker, who died in 2013 aged 40, was best known for his role as Brian O'Conner in the Fast \u0026 Furious franchise, having starred in 2001’s The Fast and the Furious and, most recently, in 2023’s Fast X via archive footage.The question now is, how will Dom and Brian reunite for Fast X: Part 2? Walker had already shot scenes for Furious 7 when he died in a car accident, and many fans have said they believe the franchise has already given the late actor an appropriate send off.Vin Diesel's comments about returning to street racing and car culture for this franchise finale are of course a response to just how outlandish the series has become. Early movies were grounded in illegal street racing, but recent entries are more all-out action movies, something more like G.I. Joe than racing cars. There’s also the question of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson’s potential involvement in the film. In January, Vin Diesel walked back a dig he made at Johnson while presenting an award at the 2025 Golden Globes. Diesel posted an older photo of him and Johnson on Instagram alongside the caption \"All love... Always,\" after Diesel poked fun at the infamous feud between the pair by saying, \"Hey, Dwayne,\" during his award presentation and enjoying the audience's laughter.Despite starring alongside each other in Fast 5, Furious 6, and Fast and Furious 7, with Diesel playing Dominic Toretto and Johnson playing Luke Hobbs, a spat arose between the two and was made public when Johnson called Diesel a \"chicken s**t\" and \"candy-ass\" co-star.Diesel told Men's Health this was because of the \"tough love\" he gave Johnson, \"to assist in getting that performance where it needed to be.\"Johnson posted on X/Twitter in 2023 that he and Diesel \"put all the past behind us,\" and will \"lead with brotherhood and resolve.\" They \"always take care of the franchise, characters, and fans that we love,\" he said.Photo by Universal/Getty Images.Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
