  "text": "Hey Xbox Insiders, the holidays are in full swing around here and we couldn’t wait to give you a present. Let’s unwrap it together! Last month, we announced Game Pass Ultimate members can now stream select games they own through TVs and browser on supported devices like smartphones, PCs, and tablets, in all 28 countries where Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) is available. We also said players would be able to stream on Xbox consoles starting next year. Starting today, Xbox Insiders in the Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha rings can preview this feature on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles. Stream Your Own Game on Your Xbox Console Xbox Insiders who are also Game Pass Ultimate members can now stream select games they own beyond the Game Pass catalog on their consoles in the 28 supported countries where Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) is available. You can see the full list of games here. With the “Stream your own game” feature on Xbox consoles, you can stream select games you own on your Xbox console without needing to install them. This allows you to play games through streaming, saving you time and hard drive space, and offers access to your games with Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta). To start streaming from your Xbox console, go to My games \u0026 apps \u003e Full library \u003e Owned Games. If you own a cloud playable game, you’ll see a cloud badge on the game. You can also use filters to find games quickly. Choose Filter \u003e Ready to play \u003e Cloud gaming. To start playing, select the game and then choose Play with Cloud Gaming. Support for launching directly from the Store app and streaming in the Xbox app on Windows PC will be coming in the future.
