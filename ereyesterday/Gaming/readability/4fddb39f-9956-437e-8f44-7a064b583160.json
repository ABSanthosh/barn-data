  "text": "Completely Stretchy gives you a blue, stretchy, sticky body to use to help oddball folks and explore a ridiculous, playful world. The Elektro factory could probably use some better health and safety standards, as, after a lousy day there, you find yourself a bit longer and more adhesive than usual. Also, the zappy little Elektros have kinda escaped containment as well. Thankfully, your workplace incident has given you some handy powers instead of a permanent injury, and you can use these sticky limbs to pick people up who’ve fallen down, grab distant items to help folks out, and swing yourself around town at high speeds. If you’ve ever messed around with one of those long, stretchy rubber hands, then imagine all of the fun you’ve had with one of those, but on a city-sized scale. ALSO, you don’t have to worry about getting all gummed up with lint and becoming useless after fifteen minutes. With your sticky hand, you can fling it toward the ground in front of you to pull yourself around faster. You can also grab nearby buildings and swing around like a certain arachnid super hero. While I’ve always enjoyed grappling-hook mechanics, embracing the silliness of a rubber sticky hand in a lighthearted world makes this mechanic even more enjoyable. Completely Stretchy sees you meeting a ton of playful, googly-eyed creatures with their own absurd terms for certain things. They, along with the cartoonish locales, give this game a goofy sensation that makes every element that much more enjoyable. Picking up quests and helping these creatures out just feels good, and I find myself looking forward to whatever they’ll say next. So, combining that with great sticky arm grappling and grabbing makes for an experience that kept me smiling. Completely Stretchy is available now on Steam.
