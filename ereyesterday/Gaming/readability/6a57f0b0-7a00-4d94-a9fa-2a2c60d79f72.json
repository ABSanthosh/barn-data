  "text": "Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero has the biggest roster in the 3D arena-fighting franchise’s history, but some players still want more. Specifically, more costumes, accessories, and other ways to customize their iconic DBZ fighters’ looks, including with shirts and jackets that pull from deep cuts within the long-running anime’s history. Suggested ReadingThe Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied HistoryOffEnglishSuggested ReadingOne of the most requested outfits is Goku’s pre-Cell Games track jacket that he wears in his off time leading up to the tournament. Another is Piccolo’s yellow “Postboy” shirt he wears in the Trunks Saga filler episode in which he and Goku try to get their driver’s licenses. The streetwear fits aren’t just fan favorites, they also showcase more casual sides of the characters and express a range of personality outside the standard battle outfits.The Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero subreddit has had fans frequently scratching their heads at why a game that’s bursting with fan service in other areas is missing these key costumes. Some are worried that it simply means Bandai Namco is planning to dole out each new style over months and years through a relentless drip-feed of microtransaction add-ons as it’s done with Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2. Sparking Zero seems destined to be the ultimate DBZ sim, but no DBZ sim is complete without more robust dress-up options. Enter modders who are at least bringing some of these costume changes to the PC version of the game. A Piccolo Postboy outfit was added to the GameBanana mod repository yesterday. There’s also a mod for Vegeta’s pink “Badman” button-up at NexusMods. Of course, there are plenty of other outfits still missing, like Goku and Vegeta’s “SAB” winter jackets from the Dragon Ball Super: Broly movie and Gohan’s Kai outfit from the Buu Saga. I can forgive some of these missing from the game at launch, but too many of the best alternate costumes seem MIA at the moment. I’m not above paying for them all if they get rolled out later. It would have felt more satisfying if they were all late-game unlockables, though.",
