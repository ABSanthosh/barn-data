  "description": "Blue Prince from Dogubomb and Raw Fury has emerged as the highest-rated game of 2025 thus far on GameSpot sister site Metacritic.In Blue Prince, players explore a manor with shifting rooms. In practice, players must navigate this manor, solving the puzzles within each room before deciding which one to go into next. It has a roguelike structure, so the rooms within the manor reset each day and can slowly be upgraded over time depending on the player's actions. You might not have heard of Blue Prince before because it's an indie first-person puzzle game. That said, critics love its experimental structure and are heaping it with praise. \"Blue Prince is one of the most memorable video game experiences I have ever had,\" GameSpot's Steve Watts wrote in a glowing review. \"It is at once accessible and impenetrable, frustrating and euphoric.

It dethroned Split Fiction, which currently has an aggregate score of 91. Monster Hunter Wilds, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and The Roottrees are Dead round out Metacritic's top five best-reviewed games of the year so far. That's some impressive company Blue Prince finds itself in, and suggests it will be this year's indie darling, just like Balatro was last year.Blue Prince isn't out yet, and if you're a Game Pass subscriber, you won't even have to pay for it when it launches. It will be released on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on April 10, and it will be available as part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate catalog.
