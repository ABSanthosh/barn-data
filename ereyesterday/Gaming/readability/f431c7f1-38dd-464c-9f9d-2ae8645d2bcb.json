  "text": "Just a Die provides you with a unique weapon for every side of your dicey hero, letting you roll to fight against board game enemies. A die has many sides and each can be used in a different way. In this game, you fight your way through randomly generated floors filled with parts of various board games. However, your die does have a trick up its sleeve. Each side can have a different weapon attached to it, allowing you to roll yourself when the ammo is out on that side or when you need to dash so you can make use of the new weapon on the next side. This game may look very colorful and playful, but it does pack a challenge. The rooms themselves are full of different board game pieces, all with their own weapons who are ready to attack you. To prepare for the onslaught, you are able to use different weapons and attach them to specific sides. These weapons can combo together, creating strong sides of your die, but you will still need to roll to that side so that you can use it. There are a lot of different combinations that can be created with your die to better match your playstyle. You aren’t going to likely be able to make all of the sides the same (and why would you?), so there are a lot of differences in the sides that you might end up landing on. Also, you can often get new passive effect cards to add at the end of your round to alter how your weapons work. There are some stats at the bottom of each weapon slot to better help you understand how you are changing these with cards, and cards can be swapped about whenever you want, which is good. Just a Die feels very fast and frantic, but fun! I got to play a short demo at the European Game Showcase where the developer spoke all about their inspirations and guided me through changing my die. Just a Die is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
