Amazon has remained the most popular sale, however, so I decided to do some digging into what discounts are actually worth shopping right now and what you can probably hold off on buying. With Prime Day on the horizon, I've been on the hunt for only the absolutely best prices possible and have handpicked some deals I think are worth a look.The full Amazon Memorial Day sale includes a lot of discounts, but not everything that is currently discounted is that good of a deal. If you're trying to save as much money as possible, I'd recommend looking at the price history of that item on Amazon to make sure it is actually a good value. I've gone ahead and done that already for all of the deals listed below to save you some time.Amazon Memorial Day Sale - The Best Deals TodayLike I mentioned above, all of the deals I've listed here are at the lowest prices we've ever seen on Amazon. I took advantage of the CamelCamelCamel website to check the current prices against historical pricing on Amazon to make sure I'm only recommending actually good deals. The first major sale I recommend here is the 65-inch LG C4 OLED TV that's on sale. This is one of the overall best TVs you can buy right now and it very recently dropped to this new low price for the sale. The latest iPad model is also down to its lowest-ever price again after getting temporarily marked up. It's only been out for a few months, so any discount at all is noteworthy.Outside of the more expensive tech purchases, there are also some pretty decent Memorial Day video game deals within this sale. The one I've highlighted here is Kingdom Come: Deliverance II which only just came out this year and is already in the running for best game of 2025. A $20 discount may not seem like much, but it's a great price for a relatively new game that has already sold pretty well at full price. For more physical media, we've also found a few decent 4K movie deals not featured here as well as a new low on the Throne of Glass books.Finally, there are some noteworthy grill deals I couldn't help but include. Memorial Day sales are one of the best times of the year to save money on a grill and I've been looking to buy a new one myself. There's the standard Charbroil grill that comes in at a relatively reasonable price point that I'd recommend for anyone just looking for a decent backyard grill. Then there's the more impressive Traeger electric smoker grill that is great if you're looking to really get into cooking meats this summer. Both grills are currently at their lowest-ever prices on Amazon today.Should You Wait for Amazon Prime Day to Shop?Amazon Memorial Day SaleThe Amazon Memorial Day sale is tempting for anyone looking to save money right now, but it definitely isn't the biggest Amazon sale of the year. The retailer just recently confirmed that Prime Day will be taking place in July once again this year, and we expect that there will be much better discounts for that sale than there are now. So the question is: Should you shop now or wait for Prime Day 2025 or any of the other biggest upcoming sales?Unfortunately, it's hard to have an accurate read on what prices will be like even two months from now. The CEO of Amazon admitted last month that some prices may rise due to tariffs, but only on some products. It's unclear if that will still be the case in July and for what products specifically, but it's definitely something to consider right now if you're looking to save as much money as possible in 2025.It's also worth noting that Amazon Prime Day is really only available to Amazon Prime members, whereas the Memorial Day sales are open to all. If you don't plan on having a Prime Membership in July, now is still a good time to find deals.More Memorial Day Sales Live NowIf you're planning on doing some shopping outside of Amazon, there are plenty of other sales to choose from. I'd recommend checking out the Best Buy sale if you're looking for tech deals specifically, but they also have some great savings on appliances. There's also the Wayfair Memorial Day sale going on now that has an overwhelming amount of furniture discounts. Here are some of the biggest sales to check out right now:Originally posted: May 21, 2025 10:15 pm",
