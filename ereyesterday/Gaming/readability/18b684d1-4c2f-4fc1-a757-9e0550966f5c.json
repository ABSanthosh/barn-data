With a quick glance over my shoulder at our dear friend Sir Eugene Optimisation, I dare to describe it as a bit like Bloodborne, if Bloodborne had been made by a tiny independent developer.

Which is a fair observation, I think, though I would also say the doll’s lipless, one-eyed grimace reminds me of Mouthwashing. How’s that, Eugene – three for three? Anyway, here’s a trailer. WITHERING REALMS - Official Gameplay Reveal Watch on YouTube As the title suggests, the key change here from Withering Rooms is that you’re no longer confined to a single house and grounds. Instead, you’ll get to “explore the mysterious town of Penwyll and the sprawling graveyards, tombs, caves and rotting estates that surround it”, with combat now unfolding on a full 3D plane. The year is 1926, but not as you may recall it if you happen to be 100 years old. In Withering Realms, the first World War was interrupted by an occult event which has caused the dead to walk and spirits to roam. It’s also given certain people the ability to cast spells. The ghost girl is Clover, who died during the above occult event. She’s able to interact with the world only through the doll, which can thankfully be outfitted with a range of bludgeoning, carving or shooting implements, including a “pivoting greatsword” and a “chain rock”. The doll aside, Clover has an ally in “daring freelance investigator” Althea - one of the few other characters who can see her. I still need to finish Withering Rooms but this looks like more of what I enjoyed about that game. There are some involved-sounding overworld mechanics: you can “expand the world map by defeating massive perimeter guardians”, and return to areas at night “to encounter new, horrifying creatures and secrets”.
