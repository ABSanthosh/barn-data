  "text": "Hi everyone, I’m Julius Fondem, Community Manager here at Remedy Entertainment. Today I’m very excited, jazzed even, to talk to you about a brand-new feature in our upcoming game FBC: Firebreak – Altered Augments. If you’re not familiar with FBC: Firebreak, it’s a cooperative first-person shooter for three players set within a mysterious federal agency under assault by extradimensional forces, in the iconic Control universe. Battle through hordes of otherworldly monsters with up to two friends, customize your gear and level up as you fight back against this ever-growing threat.  This being our first multiplayer, we’re very excited to bring it to you, the community, and to that end, we’ve designed FBC: Firebreak to be as easy as possible to get into. This is a game best played together with your friends, having a great time laughing while chaotic and wacky things happen! This isn’t a new hobby that you need to log onto every day for rewards. None of that FOMO stuff here. Just get together with your friends over the weekend for a good time. As a Firebreaker, you are a badass combat engineer who descends deep into The Oldest House to solve paranatural crises, and to achieve this, you are given an assortment of normal and, well, not so normal tools by The Federal Bureau of Control. These come in the form of three bespoke Crisis Kits, each containing a unique Tool like the Crank-Operated Fluidic Ejector, an improvised device like the BOOMbox, and an Altered Augment. Altered Augments are Altered Items that the Federal Bureau of Control has contained and harnessed for approved use by the Firebreak Initiative. So basically, the Federal Bureau of Control is in deep trouble and decided to make weapons out of paranatural objects they barely understand and gave them to their brave first responders. Surely, nothing can go wrong. Each Altered Augment possesses unique abilities and is the pinnacle of each Crisis Kit’s repertoire. Let me introduce you to our Altered Augments! The Garden Gnome (AI9) is a regular looking garden gnome that is all but normal. You can attach the Garden Gnome to the Electro-Kinetic Charge Impactor which allows you to fire it towards your enemies. Once it lands, it will summon a lightning storm around it, damaging and stunning all creatures in its area and draining all energy from surrounding batteries. However, be careful! The Garden Gnome walks around and doesn’t discern friend from foe. Unless you want to play a teeny tiny prank on your crewmates. In that case, no need to be careful. The Piggy Bank (AI16) attaches to the end of the Wrench, and when you swing your Wrench around, it deals massive damage in a large arc in front of you and shatters, releasing a paranatural coin tornado that damages all creatures in it, but don’t worry, the Piggy Bank reassembles itself back together after the tornado makes its way back to you! Just be sure to not hit your friends with the tornado as getting hit by a multitude of coins in the face is considered rude in some cultures. The Teapot (AI44) attaches to the top of the Crank-Operated Fluidic Ejector (COFE) giving it the ability to shoot boiling water at enemies. When the Teapot is attached to the COFE, the tool deals the burning condition and cannot overheat. Do note that this also means that the COFE now damages teammates and cannot clear any other conditions from them except the cold condition. Lastly, the Teapot does not actually come with any real tea. Sorry, tea lovers. We’ve been hard at work on FBC: Firebreak with our 50-person strong development team and can’t wait to show you more of the game and get it in your hands! FBC: Firebreak is slated for release in Summer 2025 for PlayStation 5, with day one availability for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium members, and we’ve got plenty more to share with you before then.  Trending Stories",
