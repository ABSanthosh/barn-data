The film earned $63.5 million worldwide over its second weekend.And while Cap is clearly the biggest release of 2025 so far at theaters, it was hoped that its inevitable second weekend drop would be softer, given the lack of rival blockbusters in the near future. Senior Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian told Variety: “This is the new normal for Marvel movies. There’s still no denying these movies have appeal. But a second weekend drop of 68% reflects less audience enthusiasm than you’d expect from Marvel.”Deadline, meanwhile, suggested Captain America: Brave New World will end up with about $450 million from the global box office.Captain America: Brave New World launched amid poor reviews. IGN’s Captain America: Brave New World review returned a 5/10. We said: “Captain America: Brave New World feels neither brave, nor all that new, falling short of strong performances from Anthony Mackie, Harrison Ford, and Carl Lumbly.”Marvel Studios and parent company Disney will be hoping Captain America: Brave New World rebounds with enough staying power to reverse a negative trend for Marvel Cinematic Universe movies (apart from last year’s hugely successful Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine), and build momentum going into Thunderbolts* in May, and The Fantastic Four: First Steps in July.Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
