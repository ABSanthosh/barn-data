Fanfest Wrap Up CCP – The Future of EVE: Where Legends Begin EVE Fanfest 2025 has come and gone and had its series of announcements.  I gave my review from the cheap seats on Twitch.  But CCP has put together a summary post with the relevant videos and links just to make sure you can find it all an appreciate their work. Fanfest – Legion – And the FPS Formerly Known as Legion While those are the three items in the top of the post, it does in fact delve into many related Fanfest topics and is probably a better review of the event that I could put together.  So there it is. The Legion Expansion is Coming CCP – Legion in Focus Likewise, with the expansion coming up in less that two weeks… Legion goes live on May 27th… CCP is warming up the base, getting us ready for the big day. EVE Online Legion As with the Fanfest summary, CCP has both the bullet points hand at the top of their post and then details, images, and videos further down the page.  The high level items are: Freelance Jobs help corporations grow while giving new capsuleers meaningful ways to connect and contribute. Two powerful new ships enter the battlefield New sovereignty upgrades enable deeper customization Corporation palettes allow more creative control and corp branding Massive ship and module balance pass refreshes fleet combat and logistics Visual updates to ships and map bring style and function together I am still interested to see how the corporation freelance jobs work out.  As always, I suspect that the law of unintended consequences will visit CCP once more as players are let loose with a new tool. Pearl Abyss Q1 2025 Numbers TNG – Pearl Abyss Q1 2025 Earnings Call Massively OP – Pearl Abyss Q1 2025: Black Desert Mobile’s Chinese endeavor is over Earnings numbers for CCP’s parent company Pearl Abyss dropped earlier this week and, to cut to the chase, the company once again was operating in the red, spending more money than they took in. Pearly Abyss has begun to hide any information about how individual IPs are doing… though they only have the two, Black Desert and EVE Online… the company did throw their Icelandic siblings under the bus, pinning the loss in part on CCP developing two new titles.  Of course, them flubbing Black Desert Mobile in China didn’t help. The End of Neocom II App As I have often said, EVE Online thrives in part due to the web of third party apps and web sites that have helped make the game comprehensible and accessible to mere mortals over the last 22 years.  But nothing lasts forever.  I have bemoaned the decay of the New Eden ecosystem in the past, and now it seems the Neocom II app is on that list. The Tech II version of Neocom CCP has made some change to the APIs and the Neocom II app has stopped being able to connect and update my information. Something on the back end change and now all I get is this in the app. Response could not be decoded When I try to re-add characters it gives me the following error: error:invalid_scope error_description:The requested scopes either don’t exist or are not valid for this client And so it seems to be finished. I used the original version of the app for a number of years, then the updated version, which was in response to past changes to the game’s interfaces.  All told it has been my go to app to keep an eye on my characters on my iPad for over a decade. Given that CCP couldn’t even keep their own mobile app up and running, it is probably surprising that Neocom II lasted as long as it did.  The author of the app was from Belarus and, last I heard, hadn’t been seen since the crackdown after the anti-Lukashenko protests after the president fraudulently declared himself the winner in the 2020 presidential elections. So it goes. I’d trade the utility of the app to know the author was okay.  But life rarely offers trades like that.",

response to past changes to the game’s interfaces.  All told it has been my go to app to keep an eye on my characters on my iPad for over a decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that CCP \u003ca

surprising that \u003cem\u003eNeocom II\u003c/em\u003e lasted as long as it did.  The author of the app was from Belarus and, last I heard, hadn’t been seen since the crackdown after the
