  "text": "Giant Squid’s upcoming title, Sword of the Sea, is a well-crafted union of all the titles the studio and Game Director Matt Nava have worked on. The aquatic wonder of Abzû, The Pathless’s sense of adventure, and Journey’s beautiful desert world. Sword of the Sea weaves those influences together so skillfully that it feels like this atmospheric surfing adventure was the goal all along.  I got a chance to go hands-on with Sword of the Sea and talk with Giant Squid about the new game, coming day one to PlayStation Plus Game Catalog on August 19. Surfing across the sands and sea The game begins as the player awakens as The Wraith, a vessel waiting to be filled, who is given the task of bringing the oceans back to the world. Appearing to be the last being left alive to get the job done, you receive a mystical surfboard and hit the dunes.  The starting area is a vast playground where you can get accustomed to the board, perform tricks, and learn how to interact with the world. As you zoom across the desert, you come across different nodes known as Ocean Seeds that allow you to cleanse the land and restore parts of the ocean and marine life.  Beyond pleasing aesthetics, water and sea life directly impact gameplay. The Wraith is significantly faster on water, leading to greater speed for bigger jumps and more tricks. Some sea life create new paths, like buoyant jellyfish that make great jump pads and long strands of climbable seaweed. Watching the landscape terraform was a highlight, as was searching for all the land’s secrets.  “Sword of the Sea is really all about the spiritual magic of surfing,” Nava explains. “ It’s inspired by my own experiences snowboarding, skateboarding, and surfing throughout my life. When you think of these extreme sports, the first thing that comes to mind is probably the high speed and the danger. But there’s more to it than just an adrenaline rush. When you are surfing on waves in the ocean, you are literally on the boundary between our world and the world beneath the waves, a world beyond our understanding.”  Golden triangles known as Tetra populate the world, acting as currency you can trade to mysterious vendors to learn more tricks, acquire skills, and open new paths. Want to see it all? You’ll have to detour off the main path to see and afford it all. Different vendors, triangles, and Trick Attack arenas are hidden throughout the world.  Show off your tricks and feel the terrain Pulling off stylish moves in Sword of the Sea is straightforward. When surfing, once you jump you can press X again to perform a variety of double jump tricks. Once you acquire advanced tricks from the vendor, you hold L1 and press Triangle, Square, Circle, or X to do special grabs, flips, and spins. They score more points, and combining grabs and flips in different ways create new tricks. While the timing is a little trickier, you can give yourself a much-needed jump boost and score high-point combos when performed just right.  Sword of the Sea constantly keeps score of the tricks you pull and how advanced they are. Hidden Trick Attack arenas let you put those skills to good use. What does racking up a high Trick Score lead to? Yet another mystery we’ll have to wait to uncover. Though the game takes place in the desert, there are plenty of different objects to grind on besides sea and sand. I came across ruins, ceramic tile roofs, and helpful aquatic life. The team at Giant Squid takes full advantage of the DualSense controller haptics to ensure every surface feels and sounds distinct. As I surfed along rooftops, I could hear the melodic tones of tiles underneath and the tingle in my fingers. The sand offers a coarse sensation, and you feel and hear the rushing water as you speed through on the makeshift highways parts of the ocean create. “The haptic feedback of the DualSense controller reacts to each surface differently so you can feel it when you cross from one to the next,” says Nava.  “Combined with special sound effects that play from the controller, it gives a very realistic sense of touching the surfaces you see in the game. We are very excited by the extra layer of detail the haptics adds to the experience of surfing in Sword of the Sea.” You’re free to explore in any given direction, and hard-to-reach places usually reward you with something appropriate for the time and skill it takes to reach them. However, as you explore, you will discover murals and other environmental elements that keep the story ever-present. A tale of loss and destruction, and trying to find out how you fit into it all is an intriguing thread to follow. Especially since at the end of my session, it was clear that a mysterious character was following me. It appeared to be another wraith, but whoever the pursuer was didn’t give vibes of good intentions.  It’s easy to compare Sword of the Sea to its predecessors, but the game truly feels like an evolution of everything the Giant Squid team has worked on to this point. The game’s sights, sounds, and feel connected me with the land, and I can’t wait to hop on the board again and see what’s really out there.  “Our games have a really recognizable and unique art style, and tell atmospheric stories with their bold color and music,” says Nava. “We start with a feeling, an experience, and a message that we want the player to feel. Really, all our games are all about movement, and how it can connect you with nature and the world in different ways. Sword of the Sea builds on the ideas in all our previous games to create something that is both very Giant Squid and an exciting new adventure.” Looking to reel in more Sword of the Sea details?

A tale of loss and destruction, and trying to find out how you fit into it all is an intriguing thread to follow. Especially since at the end of my session, it was clear that a mysterious character was following me. It appeared to be another wraith, but whoever the pursuer was didn’t give vibes of good intentions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cvideo data-src=\"https://stream.mux.com/99xiWXvC1zTvzvyU2oNRIaubBVZDSqlJkH7AEjMB01Pc/capped-1080p.mp4?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiI5OXhpV1h2QzF6VHZ6dnlVMm9OUklhdWJCVlpEU3FsSmtIN0FFak1CMDFQYyIsImF1ZCI6InYiLCJleHAiOjE3NDkyMTU4MTAsImtpZCI6IjRMNXlPY2pyVjFOVXFWemNVdkpCbjF3VG00ZVRHRzlNaDAyMDFZazVqdTlOQSJ9.UuHo2eapX8cK0jY_DSe-Ch32-kKZldIrKsal5FyjSa3FAMUpjn-W6afSZ86nLvAUxScdkNhAXT5vXrguB-DO31aTmy8obic8KerL0Kj7TZAK6aNwlRXvO6FLz0MJXA5oB4l8aM0Rag8TBLxKrKHNqI1I60C1AslRE_rwCqCAQTdO1-56TP48SlrhV12EY2gmgDBSo4JtcHuc4YFlssYWLP4Mtn19aHLvaS3jPfp8Vipp9xfKW7ESyn5APx86Jd-hDhd5a28VaBNxuOHi270RRLcIV1oMX4VfOiW1H7qpNwzFNL4AJ1Tu1Tw-Ki8EAy_E2Z7vg9ySD9cUzWFwXexd8w\" preload=\"metadata\" autoplay=\"\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\"\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s easy to compare Sword of the Sea to its predecessors, but the game truly feels like an evolution of everything the Giant Squid team has worked on to this point. The game’s sights, sounds, and feel connected me with the land, and I can’t wait to hop on the board again and see what’s really out there. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Our games have a really recognizable and unique art style, and tell atmospheric stories with their bold color and music,” says Nava. “We start with a feeling, an experience, and a message that we want the player to feel. Really, all our games are all about movement, and how it can connect you with nature and the world in different ways. Sword of the Sea builds on the ideas in all our previous games to create something that is both very Giant Squid and an exciting new adventure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLooking to reel in more Sword of the Sea details? \u003ca href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/#:~:text=Sword%20of%20the%20Sea%20launches%20August%2019%20on%20PS5%20as%20part%20of%20PlayStation%20Plus%20Game%20Catalog\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://blog.playstation.com/#:~:text=Sword%20of%20the%20Sea%20launches%20August%2019%20on%20PS5%20as%20part%20of%20PlayStation%20Plus%20Game%20Catalog\"\u003eCheck out the latest trailer and more details from State of Play.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003chr/\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMore from June’s State of Play\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003c/article\u003e\u003csection\u003e\n\t\u003ch2\u003eTrending Stories\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\n\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
