  "text": "As part of its latest free update. Image credit: Eurogamer/FuturLab Thoughts might be turning toward PowerWash Simulator 2 - and developer FuturLab has now shared a fresh look at its recently announced hose-'em-up sequel - but the original also just got another free update, letting hardened sprayers unload their nozzle somewhere new. Starting with PowerWash Simulator 2, FuturLab's latest trailer provides a whistlestop tour of the sequel's new features, which include a fruity truck, a new furnishable HQ, split-screen co-op, and more. It doesn't say much we didn't already know, admittedly, but once you've watched the trailer you can always delve a little deeper into the sequel elsewhere on Eurogamer. But if you're looking for something new to hose in the more immediate term, there's The Muckingham Files 5. This latest free update for the original PowerWash Simulator introduces Muckingham's Dessert Parlour, where players will be assisting Gemma Smetana by bringing the building's sugar-blasted interior back to a gleaming sheen. PowerWash Simulator | The Muckingham Files 5 Release Trailer The Muckingham Files 5 release trailer.Watch on YouTube \"You'll be tasked with tackling this sticky mess of cake, ice cream, and jam,\" FuturLab explains, \"to transform this local hangout to its former treat filled glory.\" PowerWash Simulator's free The Muckingham Files 5 update - which follows on from February's paid Wallace \u0026 Gromit DLC - is available now on all platforms. And despite the looming presence of PowerWash Simulator 2, which is currently set to arrive later this year, FuturLab still isn't done with the original. According to the studio's 2025 PowerWash Simulator 1 roadmap, two free updates are due this year, meaning we're one down and one to go.",
