Mini Cat Town is a non-profit adoption safe haven for kittens in the Santa Rosa Plaza, which is about 45 minutes north of where I live in Marin County. Cats roam freely in a big room and interact with cat lovers and potential adopters. To visit with the kitties, you pay a small fee to enter, and then you get 30 minutes to hang out and play. How I managed to leave without adopting a kitty or two or five or 10 is honestly a mystery to me, LOL! I was immediately drawn to a handsome orange tabby boy named Teddy! Just look at his face. He’s a super meow-dal, for sure. He was very sweet, fun and outgoing, and when I picked him up he immediately melted into my arms, just like Tabs used to do.

It sorta felt that way, but then I remembered my constant state of feeling overwhelmed with the current kids in my life (human and fur children), and I came back to reality. But then I also thought, “What’s one more cat when you have a house full of animals already?” Hahaha! It’s really very hard not to bring all the sweet babies home. Anyway, there are multiple Mini Cat Town locations all across the Bay Area. I highly recommend a visit to one if you ever get the chance.
