  "text": "December 13 marked a big day for aspiring oil tycoons who also happen to be Xbox gamers. That day, Turmoil, the unique simulation game focused on pumping up oil at the turn of the 20th century, arrived on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and the Microsoft Store. So, we’ve put together five hot tips to get your oil empire off to a running start! 1. Seek and ye shall find! Once you’ve arrived on your first oil field, the first thing you’ll need to do is locate the underground wells filled with that bubbling crude. Your first – and best – method is by deploying dowsers. They’ll scour the field for a while, then once they’ve found a well will attract your attention with a whistle. Note that these dowsers will discover wells approximately in order of depth, so you won’t have to drill too deep for the ones they find first. Later on, you’ll also be able to enlist specially trained moles to dig for oil or use advanced scanners to uncover specific patches of the subsurface terrain. Even so, the trusty dowser will always remain the cornerstone of your oil-hunting escapades. 2. Slick drilling Then, the time has come to set up your rig and start drilling. Every foot of your pipeline costs money, so the shorter a line you can draw between rig and well, the better. On the other hand, rigs are expensive too, so if you can lead those pipes from one rig to multiple wells, that would also be swell. It’s all about building the most efficient and cost-effective pipeline network, to extract as much oil as possible before your land lease expires. But watch out: there is such a thing as doing too well! Pumping up oil faster than your horse-drawn wagons can haul it away will lead to spillage… which is not only a waste of perfectly good black gold but will incur a hefty fine too. 3. The price is right… or left? Of course, Turmoil isn’t just about getting oil above ground. It’s also about selling it… for maximum profit! Those crude-filled wagons can be sent to one of two competing oil companies, the very aptly named Left, Inc. and Right, Inc. Keep an eye on their fluctuating prices and sell wisely to maximize profits. Sometimes, the market can be pretty dire on both sides. That’s where silos come in handy: be sure to store your precious product until prices are back on the rise. 4. Grease your gears Let’s be honest, you didn’t get into the oil game to make a modest profit every year. In Turmoil, the key to coming out on top is to keep upgrading your operation to increase efficiency and profitability. Luckily, the charming frontier town you return to after each drilling expedition, offers plenty of opportunities to do exactly that. You can invest in faster horses, bigger wagons, wider pipes and much, much more. But do get your priorities straight! Branching pipelines, deeper dowsing and the aforementioned silos should be at the top of your list… while gambling in the saloon is something you should only do once you’ve got money to spare. 5. Land of Opportunity Your first patch of land is assigned to you. After that, you choose on which plot to stake your claim… and some of them are much richer in oil than others. Know that once you’ve found a juicy spot, the fields adjacent to it are also likely to be fruitful soil. But be warned that your rivals are aware of this… and you must be prepared to outbid all of them all to lease the most promising land. Eventually, you’ll move on to new areas which introduce even more ways to strike it rich. Parcels containing natural gas, for example, have the potential to be very lucrative indeed. And the Xbox and Microsoft Store version of Turmoil includes the DLC The Heat Is On DLC, with a fresh map that introduces fields with liquid hot magma, further ramping up the challenge… and the temperature. So, there you have it! These strategic pointers provide everything you need to jumpstart your drilling dynasty, when Turmoil launches this week on Xbox and the Microsoft Store. With over a million players already hooked on its addictive gameplay, it’s your turn now to conquer the world of oil. Join the ranks of dedicated Texas Tea enthusiasts and, if you’ll allow us to mix our beverage-based metaphors, come drink our milkshake! Turmoil offers players a visually charming, tongue-in-cheek take on the simulation genre inspired by the 19th century oil rush in North America. Get a taste of the rush and rivalry of the time as you earn your way to become a successful oil entrepreneur. As you make money digging up and selling oil, the town will grow along with you. Lease land at the town auction and search for oil. Build a rig, create an efficient pipe network and bring up the oil to store it in silos. Sell the oil at the best times to maximize profits. Then buy essential upgrades in town to cope with rock, gas and ice. Acquire more town shares than your competitors in a bid to become the new mayor. * A campaign where you build your rags-to-riches oil baron career and beat your rivals. * Dozens of upgrades and new tools to improve your oil mining operations. * Meet the town’s characters in the saloon and make shady business deals. * Play single game mode to get one of literally millions of procedurally generated levels and earn as much as you can in one year. * Lease land at the town auction and search for oil using a dowser, mole or scanner. * Maximize your profits by using natural gas to boost the oil price. * Outbid your competitors at the stock auction. Turmoil – The Heat Is On is a brand new campaign with tons of oil to dig up and convert into cash! It is designed to make you feel right at home, but at the same time offer lots of new mechanics and fun features. Here's what you can expect! * A new town (and mayor!) and a new oil-rich map divided into three areas. * In each area, new drilling mechanics are introduced, powered by a new underground substance: magma. * You'll see familiar faces like Edward and Fred and William. They brought their goods with them in train wagons, so you can instantly stock up on all your favorite drilling gear. * There are also new people, like Philip, who runs a shady card game in the saloon. * Jack is a new character that runs a magma tools operation from his shed. He likes chicken. * Anthony is also back from last time. Instead of dealing in diamonds, he has his own store where you can sell and buy all sorts of underground treasures. * The new mayor is not quite like the old one. His tips are free, and he uses a different auction system. But shares still cost money! * There's a cat walking around the village! He doesn't do a whole lot, but what can you expect from these creatures? * And last but not least: a couple of brand new music tracks!",
