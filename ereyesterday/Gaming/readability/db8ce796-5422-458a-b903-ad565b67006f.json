  "text": "One of Doctor Who’s most memorable Christmas specials.\"Joy to the World\" premieres Wednesday, December 25 on Disney+.2024’s Doctor Who Christmas Special, \"Joy to the World,\" masterfully blends the show’s signature whimsy with heartfelt storytelling, delivering a cozy, deeply human tale about the transformative power of friendship. Anchored by a lively yet thoughtful time-bending adventure, and featuring Nicola Coughlan’s charming turn as guest companion Joy, the special leans into its festive cheesiness so earnestly that it feels equally magical and moving.Steven Moffat’s excellent script is central to the episode’s success. Returning after his standout season 1 episode, “Boom”, former showrunner Moffat showcases his mastery of dialogue, balancing sharp wit with poignant sincerity. The story begins at a breakneck pace, throwing viewers straight into high-energy chaos within the Time Hotel, a futuristic holiday destination offering access to all of human history on Christmas Day. The concept is quintessentially Doctor Who: wildly imaginative and fun, yet deeply tied to human curiosity. From its dazzling blend of futuristic opulence and festive warmth to its eccentric clientele, the Time Hotel feels like the perfect quirky setting, tailor-made for the series. Moreover, it’s great finally having a somewhat solo adventure with Ncuti Gatwa’s 15th Doctor. While season 1 touched on the Doctor’s struggles with his vulnerability, \"Joy to the World\" fully unpacks these layers, offering a rare glimpse into the Time Lord’s emotional complexity. Gatwa’s performance is once again a standout, capturing the loneliness and self-reflection of a Time Lord who rarely slows down to process their emotions. It’s hard not to notice how emotional and tear-jerky Gatwa’s Doctor can get, even at the strangest times, but in this episode, it feels entirely warranted. One of my favorite moments is when he stops mid-adventure to berate himself, quite literally in the most timey-wimey way possible. “Joy to the World” starts in a hurry, but it’s the more personal moments between The Doctor and the supporting cast that truly resonated with me. Each wholesome scene imbues the episode with an intimacy that consistently surpasses the typical holiday fare. While I enjoyed the rebooted introductory season of Doctor Who on Disney+, it was relentlessly fast-paced throughout, leaving little time to breathe or settle into things. There were just nine episodes – two of which are Doctor-lite outings with minimal screen time for Gatwa – so it’s a delight to finally get some time just to hang out with my favorite alien.Doctor Who \"Joy to the World\" GalleryIt’s not a 100% solo adventure for The Doctor, however, as the companion for a day, Joy (Nicola Coughlan) also features prominently throughout. The warmth and relatable energy Coughlan previously brought to Bridgerton and Derry Girls fits so comfortably into a Christmas special, with her journey and The Doctor’s mirroring the episode’s themes of connection and rediscovery. (She provides a perfect foil for the Doctor’s introspection.) Interactions between The Doctor and the side characters like Joy are especially touching, reminding us that despite its sci-fi core, Doctor Who is at its best when it grounds the chaos of adventures in time and space in a sense of humanity. Fully embracing its sentimental side, “Joy to the World” blends much-needed character work with a dash of festive magic, standing as one of the show’s best holiday episodes. While Moffat’s tendency to botch convoluted endings has been a serious bugbear of mine in the past, “Joy to the World” sees him at the top of his game. The ending, while still undeniably cheesy, fits the spirit of a Christmas special perfectly. It’s delightfully heartwarming – the kind of conclusion that leaves you smiling, even if you roll your eyes a little along the way.VerdictAmid the inventive premise of a Time Hotel, “Joy To The World” delightfully shifts gears to explore the Doctor’s human side. It’s a welcome change of pace to the series’ usual high-octane thrills, and Ncuti Gatwa’s 15th Doctor captivates with a performance that balances playful charm and emotional depth. Steven Moffat’s sharp, heartfelt script elevates everything, blending Christmas cheer with a cozy character-driven story, and this Christmas special stands out as one of the best ever.In This ArticleDoctor Who Christmas Special Reviewamazing“Joy to the World” weaves together festive magic with plenty of touching character moments, making this one of Doctor Who’s most memorable Christmas specials.",
