  "text": "Take Back Boomtopia Blow It Up is a physics-based destruction game by Brain Seal Ltd. that blends the explosive fun of Angry Birds with a robust physics engine for a thrilling puzzle experience. Set in “Boomtopia”, a land where destruction meets strategy, your mission is to rescue your bomb friends from mischievous oppressors. With seven unique bombs—each with its own strengths, weaknesses, and special abilities—you’ll need to think strategically to clear over 70 challenging levels. To help you make every explosion count, this guide covers each of your bomb buddies in detail, along with essential tips and tricks. Master their destructive potential, unleash chaos, and take back Boomtopia! Launching 101: Mastering your Launch Each level presents a unique challenge, and finding the right weak points in the structures is key to causing maximum destruction. Using your launchpad, your objective is to eliminate all enemies, explode the gifts, and ideally finish with an extra shot remaining—earning you the prestigious gold trophy. If you run out of shots but still manage to explode all gifts, you’ll receive a silver trophy. Simply clearing the level will net you a bronze. To maximize your impact, carefully aim using the launchpad and activate each bomb’s special ability mid-air at the perfect moment. Since every bomb has its own unique power, let’s break them down one by one: Dashy (Dash Bomb) Dashy is the starting bomb in Blow It Up, known for its versatility. When activated mid-air, it propels in a straight line based on the direction of its velocity at the time of activation. Dashy is great for reaching tough enemies, cleaning up leftovers, or targeting weak points in structures. However, its explosion is one of the weakest in the game, making it less effective in levels with many enemies or dense structures. Use Dashy strategically for its speed and precision, but be mindful of its limited power. Diggy (Drill Bomb) Diggy is a bomb that drops straight down when activated, making it perfect for targeting areas directly below. It’s great for situations where you need to thread the needle—hitting specific targets or enemies on lower levels with precision. While it only has a single explosion, it can cause significant damage in the area of impact. Use Diggy when you need a focused, direct hit, but keep in mind it’s usually not suited for taking out multiple targets at once. Gunny (Gun Bomb) When activated, Gunny fires its two handguns one by one, each shot causing a small explosion upon impact. This makes it perfect for breaking through structures, particularly when targets are aligned in a straight path or when you need to destabilize the foundation of a building. The shots weaken structures and create openings, allowing for precise, strategic destruction—especially when focusing on key points to bring the structure down. Jetty (Airplane Bomb) Jetty takes to the skies when activated, flying horizontally and dropping small bombs along its path before eventually falling down. This makes Jetty excellent for targeting multiple enemies or structures arranged horizontally. Its ability to cover a wide area with each drop makes it a versatile, all-around bomb, perfect for dealing with scattered targets or clearing large sections of a level. Blasty (Remote Bomb) Blasty is a remote bomb that explodes immediately upon activation. Its precise detonation makes it perfect for close-range targets, reaching hard-to-access areas (where other bombs would trigger too soon), or even pushing objects when needed. Blasty’s controlled explosion allows for strategic, creative plays in tricky situations. Chainy \u0026 Linky (Chain Bomb) Chainy \u0026 Linky are two bombs connected by a chain. When activated, they break free and move on their own, each following its own path until they reach their target. This unique dynamic allows for creative strategies, as their separate movement can hit multiple targets or cause destruction in different areas of the level. Puffy (Fat Bomb) Puffy is a bomb with a more limited range but a powerful punch. When activated, it releases shrapnel that carries the same momentum as the original bomb, causing the pieces to explode independently. This makes Puffy great for creating large explosions in tight spaces, taking out close-range targets, and cleaning up any remaining enemies or obstacles. Its unique blast pattern allows for focused, impactful destruction. Mix, Match, Boom With all these bombs at your disposal, the key to success is finding the right one for each level’s challenge. Whether you’re looking for precision, wide-ranging destruction, or something in between, there’s a bomb to match your playstyle and the situation at hand. The more you experiment, the better you’ll understand how each bomb’s unique abilities can be used to create the perfect explosion. So, go ahead, blow stuff up, and unleash chaos in Boomtopia! After all, who doesn’t love a good explosion? Blow it up is available now on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One.
