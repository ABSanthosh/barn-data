  "text": "Image credit: Warner Bros. Pictures Following yesterday's cheeky teaser trailer, the Mortal Kombat 2 movie's ready for its full reveal, with two-and-a-half minutes of silliness, a little bit of splatter, and plenty of Johnny Cage. A follow-up to 2021's mildly diverting live-action Mortal Kombat movie was announced all the way back in January 2021, with Jeremy Slater - head writer on Disney+'s Moon Knight series - confirmed to be handling the script. Simon McQuoid remains on directing duties after helming the first movie, and the intervening years have brought various bits of casting news. Top of the list, of course, is The Boys star Karl Urban, who's stepping into the high-kicking boots of series icon Johnny Cage. This time around, it's Cage who's sucked through a portal and into the world of Mortal Kombat (Lewis Tan's Cole Young, who had a similar experience in the first movie is back too), and there's plenty of Cage in today's Mortal Kombat 2 reveal trailer. Mortal Kombat 2 - Official Red Band Trailer (2025) Karl Urban, Hiroyuki Sanada Mortal Kombat 2 - Red Band trailer.Watch on YouTube It's utterly daft stuff, leaning firmly into the pulpy ridiculousness of it all, even if the included Fatalities - which were rather underrepresented in the movie - aren't perhaps as outlandish as you might hope for. Still, who can resist a classic bit of surprise bifurcation, eh? Mortal Kombat 2 also stars the likes of Jessica McNamee as Sonya Blade, Adeline Rudolph as Kitana, Ludi Lin as Liu Kang, Mehcad Brooks as Jackson \"Jax\" Briggs, CJ Bloomfield as Baraka, Tati Gabrielle as Jade, Chin Han as Shang Tsung, Hiroyuki Sanada as Hanzo Hasashi/Scorpion, and Max Huang as Kung Lao. And if all that appeals, it's out in cinemas on 24th October. Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't overly keen on the first Mortal Kombat film, saying, \"There's just enough low-rent entertainment to prevent [it] from being a complete disaster\" in his review. So fingers crossed for the sequel.",
