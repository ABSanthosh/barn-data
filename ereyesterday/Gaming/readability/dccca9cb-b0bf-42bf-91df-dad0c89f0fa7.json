  "text": "Camper Van: Make it Home sees you making this tiny place your own by figuring out where you can put all of your stuff inside a van. In this game, there seems to be some story about graduating school, burning all of your old exams, and then making your camper van your own home. When it comes to putting everything in it’s proper place, though, it’s often easier done in a video game than in real life. This game starts you off with an empty place after you have played the intro cutscene. Here, you will need to unpack a bunch of objects from various categories along the right hand of the screen. When selecting a category, you won’t know what item you will be placing (or its size) until you have to put it down. As you place items, the circle fills up, indicating you don’t have many items left. When packing my new home, I found that there was just so much stuff. Not enough space for everything, either! Moving around the van, finding different areas so that you can store more items, and just placing stuff in places that they fit and may not belong became the name of the game. I even put a bunch of items outside the house, as they really didn’t fit. You can open up different drawers and places, which feel like they are meant to hold specific items, but even with that extra space, it felt like there was far more than I needed in my van. I got the chance to play the demo of Camper Van: Make it Home at the Bilbao Independent Games Conference, where I found the game to look fantastic, but leaned on the overwhelming side of unpacking instead of feeling cozy. I am hoping that this is more balanced in the final game and it ends up hitting the cozy notes that the graphic design feels destined for! Camper Van: Make it Home is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can download a demo (and add it to your Wishlist) on Steam.
