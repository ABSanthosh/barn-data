  "text": "SummaryX-Out Resurfaced comes out February 20, 2025.Digital pre-orders are currently available.Remake of the classic C64 shoot’em up. Some people say old legends never die. We fully agree with them, as we’re willing to give a helping hand to those that wish to rise again. X-Out Resurfaced is a full-blown, high-definition remake of the old Commodore 64 classic X-Out. Featuring gorgeous visuals and a reworked control scheme, this new version is the perfect way to experience this incredible shoot’em up in all its glory. The game starts with a unique loadout screen, revolutionary for its time, allowing you to choose your craft, weaponry and option types, before submersing yourself in frantic, underwater shmup action. The challenge will be tough and the enemies numerous, but Captain Granger and his faithful craft Trilobite are definitely up to the task. He is after all the last line of defense against the alien horrors that are trying to invade Earth through the ocean depths. These cosmic horrors sound like they might be too much for you to handle alone? Nothing to worry about, as X-Out Resurfaced features a brand new two-player mode. Sharing the underwater terror is caring after all. Last but not least, the banger of a soundtrack got a complete makeover by the original composer himself, the great Chris Huelsbeck. Worth a good listen or two if you’re an enjoyer of fantastic retro tunes. X-Out Resurfaced is still currently available for pre-order, with a full release on February 20, 2025. We’re counting on you captain. Good luck! X-Out: Resurfaced You thought they’d come from space? Wrong! It’s up to you alone to stop an alien invasion from the depths of the ocean in this legendary, home computer era shoot ‘em up, dredged up and faithfully rebuilt for modern platforms – X-Out: Resurfaced! Resurfaced: In 1990, the year of X-Out’s initial release on Amiga, it stood out as a breath of fresh seaside air in the stale shoot 'em-up space. It didn’t take place in “space” as so many games of its genre did (and still do) but instead went for a dive through underwater worlds. But what really pushed it further than its side-scrolling competitors was its shop system, allowing players to mix and match from a wide variety of ships, weapons, and other accessories to build their fleet. This made every playthrough (attempt) feel different and unique. In 2024 the highly challenging underwater shoot ‘em up from the game development legends at Rainbow Arts is finally returning. ININ and Ziggurat have collaborated to bring you a faithful remake completely rebuilt from the ground up and greatly improved. Redrawn: The impressive sprite work of yesteryear has not only been remade into even more impressive modern high-resolution sprites but also greatly expanded upon with particle and lighting effects. 8 varied stages, the enemies, the bosses, the ships, the projectiles—everything shines in a brand-new light! Remixed: Apart from the visual journey of each playthrough, you’ll embark on a musical one as well: epic synth soundscapes that drive you forward by the magnificent Chris Hülsbeck. In addition to him remastering his original works, we have created three entirely new tracks as well. Remembered: And it's not just Chris Hülsbeck who has returned for this remake: Ogan Kandemiroglu, the brother and co-artist of Celal Kandemiroglu who created the original iconic key art of X-Out, took on that task for the remake as a tribute. Re-equipped: The shop system is back and thoroughly improved as well: new preconfigured load-outs allow you to jump straight into the action, added item descriptions help new cadets configure and build their fleet, and we've FINALLY marked the available slots for your weaponry. Reinforced: Should you still feel overwhelmed by X-Out’s challenge, then maybe it’s time for a co-captain. Enlist a friend and face the terrors from the ocean deep together in the local 2-player co-op mode! Reversed: If you think you’ve seen everything there is to the game already, then prepare to have your bearing changed and your gyro twisted in the Mirror Mode with its reverse-scrolling levels! Recapped: • Experience a fresh but faithful take on a real shoot-’em-up classic! • Get dazzled by the new and beautiful sprite work mixed with shiny particle and lighting effects! • Take a journey through new and old synth soundscapes courtesy of composer legend Chris Hülsbeck! • Choose one of three load-outs or build your own fleet in the improved shop system! • Grab a trusty ally and face the depths together in a 2-player couch co-op dive! • Get your world flipped, turned upside down in the Mirror Mode! • Too challenging? Don't fret we got some cheats for you to breeze through the game with ease!",
