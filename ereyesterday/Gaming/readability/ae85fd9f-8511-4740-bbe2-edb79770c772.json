Asher pinged out the following to the coalition then followed it up with a post to Reddit. Ladies and Goontelmen, Saturday will be the day we send off the Innominate Palace to Valhalla. For many of you it was the home we fought with determination to defend. It’s also named after a beloved friend who we lost. In that vein we have decided the only possible way to give the old girl a Viking Funeral is send her off with rifters. So, this Saturday we will form up at 18:00. The timer comes out 18:49. And we will invite all of Eve. Anyone who wants to join, be it our most bosom friend or most hated enemy is welcome to come and help blow it up… if, they are in a Rifter. We will have guards there who will be happy to destroy any ship on grid, but they have one weakness, they cannot see Rifters. So tell your corp mates, tell your friends. Tell whoever. Goonswarm is will be providing 1500 Rifters to anyone who needs them. You’re welcome to bring your own. I will see you there! Everyone is welcome to come in a Rifter and be part of the killmail. Please note we don’t control the area around it so travel at your own peril. Hope to see you there! That will be the end of the Keepstar which was our home from late 2016 until the big move to Tenerifis late last year.  It was our bastion, the planned last line of defense during World War Bee, and perhaps the longest serving home for the alliance. The view from 1DQ1-A back in 2020 As such, likely also holds a treasure trove of ships and modules and other items stored away and left behind or forgotten.  There is a non-zero chance that something bad or crazy or unexpected will happen when the station explodes and the server goes to process all of the stuff being sent to asset safety. Whatever happens, it will be an event, especially with anybody who shows up in a Rifter being given a free pass to shoot the station.  Don’t count on getting on the kill mail, because the server will likely throw up before it can generate one, but it will be chaos on grid with people shooting it and each other and tidi probably going to 10% and beyond and whatever else. I am bummed I will miss it, but I have a conflicting RL commitment. So check it out if you can, 18:00 UTC on Saturday for the form up, with the timer coming out at 18:49 UTC, which is when the shooting will begin. Post some screen shots to r/eve so I can see what happened.",
