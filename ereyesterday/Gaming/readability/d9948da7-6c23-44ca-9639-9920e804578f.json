Each of the discounted iPhones is certified through the Amazon Renewed Premium program.

According to Amazon, each item has been professionally inspected, tested, and cleaned by professionals, and there are \"no visible cosmetic imperfections\" when the item is held at arm's length. The only real loss here is the box, as Amazon will instead ship these iPhones out in generic packaging. Products are also eligible for a replacement or refund within 90 days. Note that these deals are only available to Amazon Prime members, so you'll need an active subscription to get the lowest price. Join Amazon Prime The upshot of choosing one of the refurbished models listed below is that they're all unlocked, meaning you can use them with your current service provider or take them with you if you decide to switch to a different company in the future.
