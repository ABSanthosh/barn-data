Sitting down with Geoff Keighley, Morhaime unveiled Wildgate, a brand-new crew-based PvP shooter set in the far reaches of space, alongside official release dates for Sunderfolk and Lynked: Banner of the Spark—and much more. Commit Space Crimes in Wildgate, Unveiled Today We were thrilled to debut Wildgate with not one, but two full-length trailers, showcasing the high-stakes action of this spacefaring PvP shooter from Moonshot Games. In Wildgate, four-player crews must navigate a vast, procedurally generated map, outmaneuvering rival ships, claiming valuable loot, and upgrading their vessels to survive the dangers of deep space. Wildgate is set to launch later this year on Xbox Series X|S, and players eager to test their skills and explore the Reach early can sign up for the playtest happening next month at playwildgate.com. Sunderfolk Launch Date Revealed We’re excited to confirm that Sunderfolk, our innovative couch co-op tactical RPG, launches on April 23!

With up to four players controlling the action using a free app on their smartphone or tablet, Sunderfolk makes it easy for adventurers of all experience levels to jump in and play. Developed by Secret Door, Sunderfolk will be available on Xbox Series X|S.

Battle solo or in co-op, wield an arsenal of customizable weapons, and personalize your home and hero with deep customization options. Whether you’re rebuilding or battling, every spark counts—will you light the way?
