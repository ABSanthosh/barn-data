  "description": "Earlier this week, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 had an update that teased the return of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. In a skate park map called The Grind, there is a banner with the THPS logo and the date \"03.04.25.\" Now, the official site for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater has a countdown clock to March 4, 2025, which may mean an announcement is imminent.The very first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game was released by Activision in September 1999. Although the 25th anniversary has come and gone, Hawk revealed last year that he has been in contact with Activision about doing something to celebrate that quarter century milestone. Hawk later confirmed that the long-running franchise will continue.If there's news coming soon regarding the future of THPS, there are two likely options. The first is another remake like 2020's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, which helped revitalize interest in the games. There have been some predictions that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 could follow. However, a more enticing prospect would be a brand-new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The last fully original game in the series to hit consoles was 2015's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5. Additionally, there was a previous report that the next Tony Hawk game could arrive as soon as this summer. Given the timing of the announcement, that seems very plausible.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
