  "text": "60% off the entire saga.The paperback box set of the core five Witcher books is on sale at Amazon, which has a surprising amount of book deals ahead of its Prime Day sales. You can pick up the full collection for $35.40, which is 61% off the original list price of $89.99. The collection doesn't include the two prequel short stories, The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny, or the standalone prequel Season of Storms, but you can pick those up individually or in their own box set. These all share the same red spine design as the main box set, so displaying them on a shelf won't drive you insane as it would for me if they didn't match. Get the Entire Witcher Series on SaleThe Witcher centers around Geralt of Rivia, a monster-killing, bounty-hunting Witcher with magic powers and a penchant for toxic relationships. Throughout the saga you'll meet a colorful cast of characters like Princess Cirilla, who Geralt is tied to in a twist of destiny, Dandelion, Geralt's close friend and wandering bard, and Yennefer of Vengerberg, a sorceress and subject of Geralt's aforementioned complicated love life. If you're new to the Witcher series, the reading order can be a bit complicated with jumping timelines, the prequel, and the short story collections. Here's a quick TL; DR on how to read the Witcher books in order:The Last Wish (short stories)Sword of Destiny (short stories)Season of Storms (you can also read this last)Blood of ElvesThe Time of ContemptBaptism of FireThe Towers of SwallowsThe Lady of the LakeI'd highly recommend these books to anyone who enjoys CD Projekt Red's loose adaptation of them in the form of The Witcher games. As we wait (probably quite a long time) for The Witcher 4, what better opportunity is there to dive into the original lore? When Will The Witcher Return on Netflix? Aside from the games, The Witcher books have also been adapted by Netflix... relatively faithfully. Henry Cavill played the titular character for seasons 1-3, with Liam Hemsworth replacing him for season 4 onward. The new season is likely arriving in the second half of 2025. In our review of season 3, volume 2, we said \"[it] closes out its most compromised season yet by once again losing Henry Cavill in the clunky, plot-heavy shuffle\", and gave it a five overall.Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.
