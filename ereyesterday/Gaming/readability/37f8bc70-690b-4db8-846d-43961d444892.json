There are countless \"adults welcome\" LEGO sets that are perfect for offices, game rooms, or to mount on your walls. Sure, most of these sets are nerd-adjacent, from Star Wars display models to an enormous Lord of the Rings Rivendell set, but they are a testament to just how much the toy brand has changed over the years. Some of the biggest upcoming LEGO sets are 18+ builds specifically targeted at adult collectors this year. And If you're both an avid reader and huge LEGO fan like me, the three new themed book nooks in early June are abolutely worth checking out. These book nooks are an entirely new type of LEGO set made to fit perfectly on your shelf and live amongst your book collection.Every LEGO Book Nook Releasing in June 2025All three of these LEGO book nooks are available for preorder now and release on June 1, 2025. They're all riddled with detail and Easter eggs from their respective series and are modular; there's the folded in book nook style and the \"unfolded\" view. The unfolded mode offers a great display of famous scenes like the Harry and Ron finding Platform 9 3/4 or Gandalf facing off against the Balrog. The modularity makes these sets not only serve their purpose as book nooks well but also as standalone LEGO display pieces for your shelves or coffee tables. LEGO Lord of the Rings Book NookLEGO Lord of the Rings Book NookThe Lord of the Rings LEGO Book Nook includes a super detailed Gandalf minifigure with his sword and staff and a buildable, fully posable Balrog figure. It recreates the iconic scene on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm in the Fellowship of the Ring, with a plaque stating \"you shall not pass!\" front and center. It's 1,201 pieces and is sure to be a fun build, especially if you have the movie playing in the background!As a book nook, this set would also go great alongside a collection of Lord of the Rings books.LEGO Sherlock Holmes Book NookLEGO Sherlock Holmes Book NookThe LEGO Sherlock Holmes Book Nook is the biggest of the trio, coming it at 1,359 pieces, and definitely has the most Easter eggs — fitting for our favorite detective. When folded in nook form, the outer cover has the iconic silhouette of Sherlock and his magnifying glass from the actual Arthur Conan Doyle books. This set also comes with five detailed minifigures: Sherlock, Dr. Watson, Moriarty, Irene Adler, and seemingly a member of the Baker Street Irregulars. When unfolded, it's a detailed recreation of 221B Baker Street in London where Sherlock lives.LEGO Hogwarts Express Book NookLEGO Hogwarts Express Book NookThe LEGO Harry Potter Hogwarts Express Book Nook should be familiar to longtime LEGO fans, since the iconic red train has seen many iterations over the years. Of the three, I'd prefer to have this unfolded as it seemlessly splits the scene between King's Cross station in London and the magical Platfrom 9 3/4. It looks a bit silly folded in book nook mode in my opinion, but it still works. At 832 pieces, it's the smallest of the three, but included are Harry Potter and Ron Weasley minifigures along with their trolleys, Hedwig, and Scabbers. If you're looking for a set of bookends for your Harry Potter book collection, this is a great gift idea for any Harry Potter fan.What Is Amazon's Preorder Price Guarantee?If you've never actually preordered anything from Amazon before, it's worth noting that if you purchase this LEGO set at Amazon, it includes a preorder price guarantee. According to Amazon's own help page, this means that if the price decreases between now and when the item ships, you'll pay the lowest price.This is one of the reasons Amazon is overall one of the best places to buy LEGO sets before they actually release. Although most popular LEGO sets won't receive discounts before their release date, it's generally nice having a guarantee you could potentially get one even if you lock in your preorder now..Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.
