Hello soon-to-be Hot Rod Champion! Hot Rod Mayhem has drifted onto Xbox Series X|S \u0026 Xbox One! Jump in starting today as toy-sized racers on huge tracks.Enjoy Hot Rod Mayhem with two distinct modes. Race mode, where you can play solo, grab a friend or play with CPU rivals in a more casual race setting, or get competitive and rise to the top in Championship mode. In this mode, you’ll face classic races on circuits to earn points to win championships, unlock new races, trials, tracks and outfits. With three difficulty settings to customize your play style, ten unlockable tracks and an arsenal of powerups at your disposal, things can and will get delightfully chaotic! Now, before you customize your Hot Rod Champion and hit that gas pedal to the floor, I want to make sure you’re ready to become a champion.  Choose your Hot Rod Wisely Each vehicle has different strengths. Choose and customize your car with colors and designs, but also keep in mind its stats. Weight, Speed, Handling and Boost will all play important roles on the tacks. Understand the strengths and choose which car suits your driving style to get the most out of your races. Get Familiar with the Tracks Get to know the tracks so you can anticipate what’s going to happen. Hot Rod Mayhem‘s lively circuits are full of surprises, living creatures and elements that will drive mayhem all over the race. Be sure to learn soon how those creatures and stray objects behave to have a winning card on your deck! Drift Like the Trophy Depends on it! (It Does) Master the drift. Make the art of the drift and do it as much as possible everywhere! Practice doing snaking or even drifting mid-air, anytime you can. Drifting will not only give you a quick edge but also fill the turbo bar, which will give you extra speed all around.  Turbo Turbo Turbo! Don’t fall asleep, go fast by using turbo energy and increase the fill on your turbo bar while drifting. The faster you go, the quicker your turbo bar will reload, giving you more speed. This applies to all the game elements that grant you turbo energy when colliding with them. Find these soon! The Power of Power-ups While many other kart games have power-ups, the key in Hot Rod Mayhem is to use them strategically. Hold onto your power-ups until you are sure it’s the best time for it. Crystal Marble will roll over the competition, but be aware of rolling over yourself when it bounces. Hot Missile makes a beeline for first place, but try not to shoot it when you’re in the lead. These are just a few examples of the tactical powerups that you can make use of, so be sure to make smart use of the power-ups! Hot Rod Mayhem is a big project for our studio, Casual Brothers, which has been making games for more than ten years, mostly working for other publishers. We are very happy to have the chance to publish something on our own this time. Our team worked hard to bring joy to players all over the world.
