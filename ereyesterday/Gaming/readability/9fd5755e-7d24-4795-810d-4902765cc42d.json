From the main story campaign to side bosses to an endless endgame, you're certainly getting your money's worth by participating in early access. Some players could find hundreds of hours of gameplay in Path of Exile 2 just through the game's initial content.However, if you're trying to gauge exactly how much time you have to spend in Path of Exile 2 before \"beating it,\" that's another story. Below, you can find how long it takes to beat Path of Exile 2, how long it takes to reach the endgame, and a full quest list so you can track your progress.How long to beat Path of Exile 2Since Path of Exile 2 is an ARPG, you can never truly \"beat it.\" Most ARPGs follow a similar structure of progressing through a main campaign that's followed by the endgame. The endgame is what you make of it and you could spend however much time you want with a given character participating in endgame content.With that in mind, beating Path of Exile 2 can be defined as simply reaching the endgame and getting past all the campaign acts. In early access, there are three acts you need to progress through before reaching the endgame. This number of acts will eventually be doubled to six in the full release of the game.Act 2 features a completely new zone and quests.However, just beating the three acts doesn't get you to the endgame. Instead, you need to first beat the three acts on standard difficulty, which gets you to level 45. Then, you're required to beat Acts 1-3 again on Cruel difficulty to finally reach the endgame. Doing all of this should result in your character being around level 65.Your first time beating the three acts should take 25 or so hours in Path of Exile 2. Then, you'll need another 15-20 hours to get past the acts again on Cruel difficulty. This puts the time to reach the endgame anywhere from 40-50 hours per character.If you want to play as another class in Path of Exile 2, you'll have to repeat the same process over again. This means another 40-50 hours to reach the endgame with that character.Once you reach the endgame in Path of Exile 2, the world is your oyster. You have the freedom to spend any additional amount of time with any character as you progress through endgame content. The maximum level cap in Path of Exile 2 early access is level 100, though, so it might not be worth it to try and go past that level just yet.Path of Exile 2 full quest listOne of the best ways to track your progress during the main story is by checking what quest you're on. If you know the names and order of the quests in each act, you can accurately gauge how far away you are from the next act.A full quest list for Act 1.Below, you'll find the full three-act main quest list in Path of Exile 2:Act 1Reaching Clearfell Mercy for the MillerSecrets in the DarkThe Mysterious ShadeSorrow Among StonesThe Trail of CorruptionThe Mad Wolf of OghamAct 2Earning PassageThe Trail of CorruptionA Theft of IvoryThe City of Seven WatersA Crown of StoneAct 3Legacy of the VaalThe Vaal JungleMysteries of the VaalThere are more quests in Act 3, but that's all players have seen up to this point.
