  "text": "Samsung's newest SSD - the Samsung 990 Evo Plus 2TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive - is on sale today. Right now you can get it for $129.99, which is actually lower than what I saw during Black Friday. It's currently $40 cheaper than the Samsung 990 Pro and most (if not all) gamers won't notice the difference in performance.Samsung 990 Evo Plus 2TB PS5 SSD for $129.99Samsung 990 Evo Plus 2TB PCIe Gen 4x4 M.2 SSDThe Samsung 990 Evo Plus is an excellent drive for both your gaming PC and your PlayStation 5 console. It exceeds Sony's minimim speed recommendation for the PS5, boasting sequential speeds of up to 7,250 read and 6,300MB/s write. This is a much faster drive than the 990 Evo non-Pro but not quite as fast as the 990 Pro. The main difference between this drive and the more expensive 990 Pro is that this is a DRAM-less drive. For PS5 performance, it makes no difference. For gaming PCs, the 990 Evo Plus supports HMB (host memory buffer), which makes up for the lack of DRAM by using an inconsequential amount of RAM from your system memory. Gamers will not notice any difference between the two.The Samsung 990 Evo Plus does not have a preinstalled heatsink. However, the 990 Evo Plus SSD is a newer single-sided SSD design that is power efficient and doesn't generate as much heat as SSDs from before. That means you probably don't need to use a heatsink and it should still work perfectly fine in a PS5 console without any thermal throttling. That said, you certainly could for peace of mind and I wouldn't see any disadvantage to that aside from spending an extra $7.More SSDs for PS5Looking for more options?
