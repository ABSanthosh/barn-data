  "text": "Amidst claims of extremist activities due to Ukraine support. Image credit: Wargaming Top executives behind World of Tanks have been accused of extremist actitivites by Russian authorities over their support of Ukraine, Russian state media has reported. The owner of World of Tanks maker Wargaming and the boss of the game's separate Russian operator Lesta Games stand to have their stake in their respective companies seized by the Russian government as a result. Development on World of Tanks, as well as its various spin-offs, was split in two following Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It was at this time that Wargaming publicly stated it had pulled out of Russia, with its offices in Minsk, Moscow and St Petersburg continuing on separately under the Lesta Games banner. Now, two World of Tanks develerops (and two versions of each game) exist - though the Russian government does not appear to be making a distinction between them. Indeed, Russian news agency RIA.ru, which is owned by the Russian state, reports that the country's prosecutor general wants to seize the shares held by Lesta owner Malik Khatazhaev, as well as those of Wargaming owner Viktor Kisly. Evidence for this action appears to be Wargaming's subsequent support for Ukraine, including an in-game campaign designed to raise funds for ambulances. This campaign was nothing to do with Lesta Games, but is being used as evidence the lucrative company does not support Russia's \"special operation\" in order to potentially seize its funds. \"The company operates in full compliance with the legislation of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, so we have no reason to have any concerns or conceal information,\" a message posted to Telegram from Lesta Games stated, as reported by Russian news website RBC. \"We have not violated anything and we have nothing to fear.\" Eurogamer has contacted Wargaming for comment.",
