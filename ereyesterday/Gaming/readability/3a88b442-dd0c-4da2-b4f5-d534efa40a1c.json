  "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle stars the iconic archaeologist. Naturally, as you delve deeper into all sorts of creepy places, you're bound to encounter some puzzles. One, in particular, is actually based on Jesus Christ's Crucifixion. Here's our guide on how to solve the Five Sacred Wounds puzzle in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.How to solve the Five Sacred Wounds puzzle in Indiana Jones and the Great CircleThe Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Five Sacred Wounds puzzle is an important objective that's part of the Stolen Cat Mummy main quest. It takes place in Vatican City, right after you examine the strange inscriptions with the help of Father Antonio. The Tower of Pope Nicholas VIndy learns that he has to head to the Tower of Pope Nicholas V, which is in the eastern portion of the city. Make sure you're tracking the quest so you can reach the location without hassles.Once inside the building, pour wine in the basin in front of the altar. Then, interact with the bas-relief and rotate it to the left, which shows the angel skewering the demon from above. This will reveal a hidden stairway to the underground section. Take photos of the murals and statuesAt the bottom of this area, you'll see the Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Five Sacred Wounds puzzle. We suggest using the camera to take photos of all the murals and statues. This nets you additional Adventure Points. Here are the ones that are in the area:Three murals in the main chamber, including the puzzle wall in the center. The one on the left has a stone bust, so pick it up and drop it off somewhere.Two murals are in the chamber to your left. You have to destroy the weakened wall to reveal a small room that has the Longinus statue.The room at the right-hand side of the main chamber also has another mural. Pour wine and check the Roman numeralsYour goal now is to pour wine into each basin in front of the murals/statues. Once the basin has been drained, you're going to notice that Roman numerals have appeared:Christ with a chalice at his right side (hand): IIChrist with bread at his left side (hand): IIChrist standing and there's a glowing glyph to your left (foot): IIIChrist sitting and there's a glowing glyph to your right (foot): IVLonginus statue (side/torso): III Move the latches based on the Five Sacred WoundsAs mentioned earlier, the Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Five Sacred Wounds puzzle is based on the Crucifixion. However, the solution itself isn't based on the correct order in any prayer, stigmata phenomenon, or religious iconography. Rather, it's just based on the Roman numerals that you've seen in the basins.All you need to do is move the latches in the central wall where Christ is crucified depending on the wounds/body parts and the Roman numerals. Look directly at the puzzle wall itself and use the solution below for each latch:Hand (upper-left): IIHand (upper-right): IITorso/spear: IIIFoot (lower-left): IIIFoot (lower-right): IVThat does it for our guide on how to solve the Five Sacred Wounds puzzle in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. If you do it right, the wall will move, revealing a hidden passageway. This leads you to the underground crypt, which has even more mysteries and secrets.",
