But for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 players, it's only going to take three months before they discover the fate of Titus.

Additionally, that episode was directed by Secret Level executive producer Dave Wilson, who has a long history with Warhammer 40,000. Wilson worked on one of the first Warhammer animated sequences for the opening of Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War in 2004.\"Returning to this universe feels like coming home, and it's been a deeply personal homecoming,\" Standen told Warhammer Community. \"Being part of something as vast and beloved as Warhammer is both a privilege and a responsibility. These worlds, these characters--they don't belong to me or to anyone else out here in LA who borrows them for an ephemeral moment. They belong to the teams in the creative dens and factory floors in Nottingham, who share what they build with a passionate fanbase that has kept this universe thriving for four decades. All I hope is that we've made them and you proud.\"Continue Reading at GameSpot",
