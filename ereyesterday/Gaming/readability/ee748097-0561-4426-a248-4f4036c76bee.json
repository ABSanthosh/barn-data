  "text": "Time Flies is all about completing little tasks before you die (but life is short if you are a common house fly). When it comes to the end of your life, it might be coming quicker than expected; especially, if you are a house fly. This game allows you to live out the life of a house fly who is looking to complete a bucket list of different goals right before you die. To make things more interesting, at the start of the game, you can pick which country you are from which will determine the life of your fly as they have different life expectancies. Once you have determined the life you will live, you enter the game as a very tiny fly. Most of the time, you are flying around as a dot on the screen, but you can find areas within the game that zoom in, giving you more to see. This is one of those games where each time you play, you will learn more and spend more time trying to achieve the list. The first few times I played Time Flies at Day of the Devs, I was moving from room to room and quickly discovered that you can add more time to your life by changing the time on the clock in the room. This encouraged me to find more puzzles, though there are a few dangers that can cause your life to end quickly regardless of the time you have. The visuals themselves are very simplistic and straightfoward, giving you a lot to look for and achieve. It feels satisfying to discover a way to cross something off of your bucket list, with some tasks being very easy to understand and others being more challenging with various plays on words. Time Flies is short but interesting in it’s own way. At the end of the event, we could also see all of the little dead flies before us scattered around the level, which was interesting! Time Flies is currently in development, but in the meantime you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
