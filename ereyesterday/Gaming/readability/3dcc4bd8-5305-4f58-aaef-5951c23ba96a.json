  "text": "Image by the Escapist That's not a block, THIS is a block. | Published: May 10, 2025 01:45 pm The new Hirakumi Style in Volleyball Legends is a powerful, defense-focused style inspired by Hirugami Sachirō from Haikyuu. Known for its unmatched blocking ability, it’s perfect for players who enjoy saving points and controlling the game from the front line. If defense is your strength, this style is worth unlocking using the steps in this Hirakumi Style guide. Just like all other Styles and Abilities in Volleyball Legends, the Hirakumi Style is unlocked through the gacha system. To get started, tap on the Style icon located at the bottom of the main screen. This will take you to the area where you can roll for Styles. You can choose between using Lucky Spins or Default Spins to try your luck at getting the Hirakumi Style. Hirakumi is a Godly-tier Style, which means it’s quite rare. If you use Default Spins, the chance of getting it is only 0.5%. That’s why it’s a good idea to use Lucky Spins instead, as they give you a better chance: around 5%. Before you start spinning with Lucky Spins, make sure you select Hirakumi under the Godly Tier. This helps the system focus your rolls toward that specific Style. That’s some vertical leap, huh. Here’s a clear breakdown of the Hirakumi Style in Volleyball Legends, along with what makes it stand out: Hirakumi stands out in Volleyball Legends as the only character with a maximum Block stat. This makes him incredibly effective at shutting down attacks from any other character in the game. His blocking ability allows him to stop even the strongest spikes completely when timed correctly. While his movement speed is quite low compared to others, he makes up for it with his strong defensive presence. If you’re the kind of player who prefers to control the pace of the match through solid defense and precise timing, Hirakumi is a great choice. Players who stay near the net and focus on reading the opponent’s moves will get the most out of his role, using it to deliver game-changing blocks. And here are the Stats: Block – 100% Bump – 20% Dive – 30% Jump -100% Serve – 90% Set – 50% Speed – 10% Spike – 40% That is all for my Hirakumi Style guide.
