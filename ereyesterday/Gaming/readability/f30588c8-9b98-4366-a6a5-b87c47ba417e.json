  "description": "There was a 22-year gap between the first Jumanji, and its 2017 sequel, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. So a seven-year gap between the third film, 2019's Jumanji: The Next Level, and the fourth movie isn't that bad by comparison. Now, Sony has set the date for the next Jumanji... which it's listing as \"Jumanji 3\"for now.Jumanji 3 will hit theaters on December 11, 2026. It's more than likely that the film's final title will forgo the 3 altogether, just as The Next Level was released without a 2 in its name. And while there are no other films listed as opening that weekend, Sony has chosen a date that's only a week before Dune Messiah and an untitled Star Wars movie. Given the lack of Star Wars movies in the last five years, it won't be shocking if that untitled Star Wars film is pushed to another date. But if Dune Messiah sticks around, there could be a franchise battle in late December 2026.According to Deadline, Jake Kasdan will return as the director, with Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson set to produce the sequel alongside Kasdan, Hiram Garcia, and Matt Tolmach. Johnson is reportedly also set to reprise his role Dr. Xander Bravestone. Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan are said to be in negotiations to return as well.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan are said to be in negotiations to return as well.While the first Jumanji dealt with a magic board game, Welcome to the Jungle updated the premise by swapping Jumanji's in-universe board game to a console-style video game. Johnson's Bravestone was just an avatar for his human player, as were Hart's Franklin \"Mouse\" Finbar, Black's Professor Sheldon Oberon, and Gillan's Ruby Roundhouse. Potentially, that means all-new characters could be trapped in the game unless some of the other cast members from The Next Level also return. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?
