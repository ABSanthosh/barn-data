  "text": "Factions, gear customisation options, and battle royale info has also leaked. Image credit: EA Footage of the next Battlefield game is once again popping up online, this time of its single-player campaign. Despite requiring participants to sign an NDA before they can get involved, playtest players continue to find a way to share all manner of things, from clips of gameplay to factions, gear customisation options, and details of its battle royale. This leak of the single-player campaign seems to be one of the biggest yet, including locations of where players can expect to travel in the solo campaign, and the environments you can explore when you get there. Introducing Battlefield Labs | Battlefield Studios Introducing Battlefield Labs | Battlefield Studios.Watch on YouTube Some of this information appears to have been datamined from the latest Battlefield Lab build. There's plenty of unfinished images and assets, leading some fans to assert the game \"looks like AI slop\" or \"fugly\" despite numerous statements from EA and the development teams that this is a work-in-progress with placeholder details that will be replaced when the game releases in full. Here's a short clip from the Battlefield 6 singleplayer campaign in the latest BF Labs update.This work-in-progress footage shows the explosive finale of a mission to destroy a dam in Tajikistan. pic.twitter.com/n9ikBpUrmQ— temporyal (@temporyal) June 19, 2025 The same thing happened with the first phase of its Battlefield Labs initiative. Despite branding the playtest as the \"most ambitious community testing program in franchise history\" and requiring participants to sign an NDA, plenty of gameplay footage popped up in various corners of the internet. EA was not happy, eventually hitting back at a grumpy reddit thread about an unsupported claim about skill-based matchmaking with \"Okay, enough\". Pretty much all we officially know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will bring back traditional classes and more focused maps after the unpopular changes made in Battlefield 2042. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar. Whilst we don't yet have a release name or date, EA confirmed it expects the series' latest instalment to arrive before April next year. We also recently learned Battlefield 2042 is getting a Mass Effect bundle, as a series exec confirmed there's still a big Battlefield (2025) reveal set to come this summer.",
