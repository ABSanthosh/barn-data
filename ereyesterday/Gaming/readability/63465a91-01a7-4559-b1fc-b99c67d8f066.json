  "text": "I have written about the EVE Online Monthly Economic Report since some point in 2017.  The relevant tag will bring up the full list of posts, one or so a month for many months now.  I have written about it in part because I have found it interesting and informative… but also to highlight how much data about the game CCP gives us relative to other MMORPGs. I do not know any other game that goes this far.  It really is amazing. EVE Online nerds harder That said, it does start to get old at times.  I have, over the years, changed up what I have been reporting on.  For the last two or so years I have been focused on destruction, that seeming to be something that didn’t get as much scrutiny as mining volume or ISK faucets.  It also felt like something that might be a predictor of game health.  The more things blowing up in space, the better the game is likely doing, or such was my hypothesis. For those few who come here for that every month, let me get some destruction numbers out of the way, though if you are less interested in destruction, there is additional coverage in the usual places: CCP – January 2025 Monthly Economic Report CCP – January 2025 MER Forum Thread Reddit – January 2025 MER Thread TNG – January 2025 Activity In EVE Online TNG – A Look At The January 2025 Active ISK Delta YouTube – January 2025 MER Analysis with CSM Oz Overall Summary In January CCP’s numbers indicated that 514,511 hulls, structures, and capsules were destroyed. That was up from the 479,812 reported in December, but down from 531,081 in November, the year’s peak. With more things exploding over a similar 31 day period, the average explosions per day rose to 16,597.  That is still shy of the November peak of 17,702 per day, but up from the 15,477 that December registered. That doesn’t looks so bad.  In fact, that is the strongest January rate of loss this decade. January 2025 – Average Losses per day by month – 2020 to current So things are great!  Maybe. On the ISK front, CCP’s estimate was that 46.86 trillion ISK in value was destroyed, pretty much in line with the 46.77 trillion ISK reported in December, so the average value per lost declined to 91 million ISK from the 97.48 million per loss in December. So the kills went up, but the cost per kill went down. Well, that makes sense when I tell you that about 20% of the recorded kills in New Eden in January were shuttles and corvettes.   42% of those shuttles and 40% of those corvettes were in Uitra, the center of AIR Career Program skill point farming. Another 25% of the destruction count were capsules. If I remove shuttles and corvettes and capsules, which make up 45% of losses, January saw 285,231 hulls explode.  That is more than the 271,781 that December saw, but it less than the 299,913 losses in January of 2024.  It is also more than the 262,499 from January 2023, but those are all kind of in the zone together. Which, given the chart above, where 2025 appears to be starting off ahead of past years, does tend to show how polluted the numbers become due to CCP allowing, even incentivizing, shuttle and corvette destruction. Garbage in, garbage out. So that is all I really have to say about destruction this month… and maybe every month going forward. Future Coverage? I think my two years of looking at destruction is at and end.  If nothing else, my hypothesis seems somewhat proven, that destruction does seem to track with the number of players in the game.  But having looked at the data since January 2020 the pattern seemed to have been established, then broken by AIR Career Program farming. I know in advance of the MER being released that Uitra will have the highest kill count of any system, that it will account for about a third or more of all shuttles destroyed, and that those shuttles, plus corvettes, plus whatever in Uitra and a few lesser training agent systems will distort the count of hulls. Oh, and the count that CCP provides is always different than what zKillboard reports and what DOTLAN shows, the latter generally double what CCP reports. Meanwhile, the ISK value of kills are often comically wrong.  CCP estimates using in-game market transactions, which means they are very good at heavily used ships, like Ishtars, but anything really pricey, like an alliance tournament ship, is often valued by their fitted modules alone.  This is bad enough that CCP itself ignores the MER values, reporting out numbers that have no relationship to the data they give us. The number from The Pulse And that is not the only way in which CCP tends to discount data in the MER.  There is a history of them publishing the MER data and having players point out what the data indicates, only to wave it away with a claim that they are looking at different numbers. They never indicate what numbers they might be using, but the implication is clear; the MER is not worth their time to evaluate.  And if they don’t think it has value, who am I to argue? And, maybe they have a point.  I mean, the mineral price index reached an all time high in January of 2025, well above the economic strangulation era, and the response is a shrug. January 2025 – Mineral Price Index over all time The primary producer index line, which is weighed down by other things, is getting dragged up and even the ship and module price index is climbing. Jan 2025 – The Ship and Module price index since 2018 So does it matter?  Does it not matter?  Are miners all rich now?  If so why are they complaining so much over in r/eve? My own response was this meme, which will probably my primary contribution to Reddit for 2025. We will see in February I guess… I will admit that some of this is coming from a sense of malaise I have about EVE Online right now.  Null sec is back to being static… which, of course, people are complaining about.  The big January 1st resets did not cause the empires to suddenly erupt in destructive wars. But there has to be a will to fight for that to change.  The Imperium spent the summer conquering multiple regions in the southeast of null sec, but the people holding it, which included PanFam and Winter Co, were not interested in fighting.  Didn’t want that space or those structures anyway. Meanwhile, after structure shoots and move ops to shift all of GSF over three regions, a lot of what is happening is just getting everything setup again. The Great Migration Graphic That takes time and you can’t do that and prosecute a war.  Meanwhile, our erstwhile foes seem in no hurry get stuck into us, having opted to let almost all of this happen without interference.  I see more intel about The Initiative in our space than PanFam. So there is the usual post-op decline in activity after a big event for us. And, finally, there is the general sense of CCP’s view of the game these days.  That hit a bit of a low point with the tepid 2025 roadmap and its presentation by the “chair men of the bored,” two of whom showed not an ounce of enthusiasm for the game and clearly wanted to be doing something else. The EVE Online 2025 Roadmap Nothing says a company is on the job than doing a copypasta last year’s roadmap and presenting it as new. (That is not entirely true as the 2024 roadmap was dominated by EVE Vanguard, a clear message about what was important.) But at least part of the dev team seems to be back on the job talking about the game in a not completely self-congratulatory way, with a real dev blog server performance.  We like those! I am somewhat amused by the fact that they felt they needed to change the name of the dev blog after it was posted… you can see the original title in the URL, and I got the reference but maybe others did not… but that was something to chew on at least. But that doesn’t change the MER, so here we are at the end of a big moody post about being disappointed with some tangential things and not having much reason to log into the game of late.  Things are not exploding, unless you’re in Uitra I suppose. There is a distinct possibility that the MER will be relegated to a mention in a monthly Friday Bullet Points post unless I figure out a new angle.  The destruction view feels worn out.  We’ll see.",

than doing a copypasta last year’s roadmap and presenting it as new. (That is not entirely true as \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2024/01/20/eve-online-eyes-null-sec-space-for-2024-updates-but-eve-vanguard-is-the-most-important-thing-really/\"\u003ethe 2024 roadmap\u003c/a\u003e was dominated by \u003cem\u003eEVE Vanguard\u003c/em\u003e, a clear message about what was important.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at least part of the dev team seems to be back on the job talking about the game in a not completely self-congratulatory way, with a \u003ca href=\"https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/paint-your-ship-red-and-make-it-faster\"\u003ereal dev blog server performance\u003c/a\u003e.  We like those!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am somewhat amused by the fact that they felt they needed to change the name of the dev blog after it was posted… you can see the original title in the URL, and I got the reference but maybe others did not… but that was something to chew on at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that doesn’t change the MER, so here we are at the end of a big moody post about being disappointed with some tangential things and not having much reason to log into the game of late.  Things are not exploding, unless you’re in Uitra I suppose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a distinct possibility that the MER will be relegated to a mention in a monthly Friday Bullet Points post unless I figure out a new angle.  The destruction view feels worn out.  We’ll see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
