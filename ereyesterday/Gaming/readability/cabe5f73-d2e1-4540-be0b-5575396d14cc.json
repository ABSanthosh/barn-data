As their trainer, you need to understand the racer you’re preparing well so you don’t waste turns and can help them achieve their goals.In this Umamusume: Pretty Derby guide, you will find an explanation of each stat, what the best ones are, and how to raise them.Table of ContentsWhat do stats do in Umamusume: Pretty Derby?What are the best stats in Umamusume Pretty Derby?How to increase stats in Umamusume Pretty DerbyWhat do stats do in Umamusume: Pretty Derby?Image: Cygames via PolygonBefore them being horse girls racing for a chance to shine on the stage, the uma are athletes and their capabilities and abilities are represented by five stats: Speed, Stamina, Power, Guts, and Wits. Characters in the game come with different base stat values and the idea is to increase the ones that will make an uma’s strengths shine while also compensating for their weaknesses. Here’s how each of these stats affects the performance of a girl during a race.SpeedAmong the five stats, Speed is the most important and the reason is pretty simple. The higher the speed, the faster the uma. By having higher Speed, you increase the chances of your horse girl running faster than their competitors. There are, however, other aspects of a race that may impact your uma’s performance regardless of their Speed.StaminaThe energy each girl has to spend during a race is represented by the Stamina stat. It affects a racer’s endurance, which is how long a character can maintain their velocity while following the predetermined strategy. Put an uma with low Stamina to run a long-distance race in the front and she won’t make it. The exact number you should have on Stamina depends on other factors, like a character’s style and skills. However, in general, any uma will need Stamina even to run short-distance races. PowerPower is the stat that affects an uma’s acceleration and their capacity to position well during a race. Part of being a racer involves learning when to run faster or to shift from one place to another to overtake an adversary. Although Power might seem more connected to Speed than other stats, it doesn’t seem like one compensates for the other. In our experience, you should treat them separately.Image: Cygames via PolygonGutsGuts is a confusing stat as its purpose isn’t as straightforward as the other stats. To put things simply, Guts allows you to pull out extra stamina from your character for the last spurt of the race. If your uma runs out of stamina during the race, Guts will determine if you continue at your pace or fall behind the pack. However, if you have enough stamina from stats and skills, Guts’ importance significantly drops. That being said, Guts is more important for long distance races as you’ll need more stamina and the race is often decided in the last spurt.WitThe Wit value determines the chances of a skill activating during a race and the character’s knowledge about racing. While Wit doesn’t affect the physical capabilities, you want decent Wit so you can take advantage of all the powerful skills in the game. A secondary effect that Wit has reduces the chances of an uma being afflicted with the “rushed” status, which makes them spend too much energy and forget about any strategy. What are the best stats in Umamusume Pretty Derby?Image: Cygames via PolygonIf you’re wondering what the best stats to focus on your energy and turns during a career, I can only say that it depends. Umamusume: Pretty Derby progression system involves not only the base stats of each uma but also their styles, legacies, and support cards. For example, based on the style of an uma, you might have to focus more on Stamina than Power, but you may use a Support card to compensate for the stats you won’t train for. But as a rule of thumb, your horse girls should always have Speed as their highest stat. Stamina and Power are also useful, so you will want to spend some training sessions on them. You can aim for the numbers presented by Reddit user Kojima Hayata who makes some solid suggestions of attributes to focus on. How to increase stats in Umamusume Pretty DerbyImage: Cygames via PolygonWhen it comes to increasing an Uma’s stats, you can only do it during a career. This mode allows you to pump the girl’s numbers by training them, using Support cards, and inheriting stat bonuses from Veteran characters.It’s possible to receive even more stats bonuses depending on the mood of your character. The mood system works as a multiplier and there are five moods: Great, Good, Normal, Bad, and Awful.Great — 1.2x multiplierGood — 1.1x multiplierNormal — Normal rateBad — 0.9x multiplierAwful — 0.8x multiplierYou want your Uma to be in the “Great” mood since it increases training results by 20% and boosts attributes while running by 4%.",
