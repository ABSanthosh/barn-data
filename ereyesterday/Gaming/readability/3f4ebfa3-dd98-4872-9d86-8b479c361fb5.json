Earlier this week, modder extraordinaire Yui released the Dark Souls Remastered seamless co-op mod, which, if you can believe it, allows you to play through the game in online co-op with minimal interruptions. Yui shared a look at the mod in action in a video on her YouTube channel, and it certainly looks like it's doing what it says on the tin. One thing she did note is that this is an \"early release\" of the mod, meaning there might be a few bugs along the way, though there shouldn't be too many, and asked to let her know if you do encounter any. Dark Souls Remastered Seamless Co-op: Release Watch on YouTube Speaking to Polygon she also explained that this one was apparently easier to make than her Elden Ring co-op mod, though there was a particular challenge in how old Dark Souls is. One big thing Yui had to work hard on was making it so that parts of the game wouldn't unload if someone got too far away from the host. In any case, the mod is apparently in good working order, so it still seems like the best way to play if you aren't a fan of how Souls games' co-op generally works. It's a cool mod because you can play with up to five other people too, and progression will save in your copy of the game even if you're not the host. Unlike the base game, regular enemies scale in strength depending on how many people you're playing with, so there'll be a bit more of a challenge too. Definitely seems like a good way to kill some time ahead of Elden Ring Nightreign's release next month.",
