  "text": "PCs, laptops, monitors, and more on sale. Image credit: Dell / Alienware We’ve covered the Dell Black Friday in July deals a few times in recent days, and they’re still coming. In fact, there are now so many offers that we’ve got a whole list of them here. If you’re looking for a powerful 50-series PC, a gaming laptop, or even a slick new monitor, there are plenty of options available, and history tells us that these deals are actually as good as (or even better) than the full Black Friday deals that’ll come in a few months. That could mean you can snag a 5080 series PC at a $750 discount, or These are the best deals on PC hardware in Dell’s Black Friday in July sale Gaming desktop PCs Starting with gaming PCs with 50-series GPUs, the popular Alienware Aurora R16 lineup is discounted by up to 30% in the deals. That price cut comes on the $2,674.99 model, which is down from $3,399.99 and comes with an RTX 5080 GPU, 2TB of NVMe storage, and 64GB of RAM alongside an Intel Core Ultra 9. You can also save $500 on a version with 1TB of storage, 16GB of RAM, and an Intel Core Ultra 7 (which still has the 5080). You can also grab a 5070Ti model, which is down to $1,749.99 and has a 5070 Ti instead. If you really want the best performance around, though, there are even discounts on 5090 prebuilds. You can save 14% on the Alienware Area 51 with 32GB of RAM, an Intel Core Ultra 7, 2TB of M.2 storage and that all-powerful GPU for $4,449.99 (a saving of $700). If you’ve got even more to spend, there’s an $800 saving on the same build but with a Core Ultra 9. It’s down to $4,699.99. Gaming laptops Alienware’s Aurora 16 is the company’s new 2025 laptop, and it starts at $1,099.99 with a 27% discount on the 5060 version that we covered yesterday. You can also opt for a better processor (an Intel Core 9 versus the Core 7), and a better GPU (a 5070, albeit with just 8GB of VRAM) and save $300. That brings it down to $1,599.99. Even the more impressive Aurora 16X is discounted, with a better display and a better CPU. The best saving knocks $300 off the 5060 model which also packs 2TB of storage and 32GB of RAM. It’s down to $1,599.99. Finally, the best deal we’ve found on Alienware’s Area 51 models can save you $700 on a model with RTX 5090, as well as 64GB of RAM and 2TB. It’s still $3,599.99, but if you’ve been waiting for a laptop as powerful as a desktop, here you are. Monitors Finally, we’ve got some monitor deals. There’s a saving of just $30 on the 34-inch AW3425DW monitor, which is a QLED panel, but it’s not much of a deal, we admit. On the other hand, you can save $300 on the 27-inch AW2725DF which has an OLED panel and a refresh rate of 360Hz. That brings it down to $599.99.",
