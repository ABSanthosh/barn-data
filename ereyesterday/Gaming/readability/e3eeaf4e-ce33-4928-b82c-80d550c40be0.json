  "text": "We heard a bit back from Playable Worlds that they want to run a Kickstarter campaign for Stars Reach. Stars Reach is coming Any mentioned of Kickstarter and the MMORPG space in the same breath is almost guaranteed to generate some level of backlash, that patch of land having been burned to the ground and salted for good measure by people like Chris Roberts and Mark Jacobs. Trust is not high when it comes to MMORPG Kickstarters. But the Playable Worlds team knew this when they went down this path and attempted to both acknowledge that many of us still feel burned by unfulfilled promises from more than a decade back and frame their own plans as being different, with the foundation being that they aren’t starting development on some future project but wrapping up a work already more than five years in the making. The point of the Kickstarter is to demonstrate interest in the project to help secure additional funding in a world where investors are also feeling burned… this time because they thought that the 2020 Covid would somehow last forever… and reluctant to back projects that aren’t already making money… at which point why would you need them? The only exceptions are VCs like Andreesen Horowitz who are still pushing the blockchain/crypto grift hard… both CCP and Mark Jacobs have gotten into bed with them… or the VCs who are betting it all on AI, which means you have to have AI deeply embedded in the product. So the hope is that a good Kickstarter campaign will demonstrate there is a market for the game, which not a new idea at all.  Mark Jacobs was pretty clear he wasn’t making an MMORPG for what a Kickstarter campaign would raise and I have posts more than a decade old that frame such campaigns as marketing tools rather than fundraising efforts. Again, this isn’t cutting any ice with a lot of core fans, and even I have to admit I have not been exactly swept up in the moment since the announcement. I will admit some of my own tepid response has been based on a very simple “what’s in it for me?”  What am I going to get for my pledge? If Stars Reach were going to sell a box, I would expect that maybe a copy of the game on Steam would be the base level pledge, with the now industry standard collector’s editions and such being available at higher price points. Except, of course, we don’t know the business model for the game… as Playable Worlds hasn’t sorted that out yet… so things like a copy of the game or subscription time or a stack of virtual currency or whatever seems to be off the table.  You have to be able to frame the monetization scheme if you’re going to sell it in advance. Which leaves us with… what? There are all the usual cosmetic options… pets, hats, shirts, titles, badges, avatar frames, hair styles, skin colors, name in the credits, special musical accompaniment when you dance, or maybe even an extra sparkling corpse marker when you die. And those are, if not 100% easy, then at least things that people do want… in the right circumstances. But those sorts of things also feel pretty thin as an anchor for a Kickstarter project.  Cosmetics and titles feel like they stray a little too close to the Star Citizen sales of pictures of spaceships you will be able to fly some day, and I fear Chris Roberts has tapped out the gullible space pilot market. The dreaded read admiral And even that ID card is out as they want to steer clear of physical items that need to be delivered world-wide, always a complication.  So things like hats and T-shirts and bumper stickers and ship models and whatever, all off the table. Which leaves us with what?  Early access to the game?  I mean, it worked for Path of Exile II I suppose.  And that kicks the can down the road for a bit on the business model.  You can sell early access now and figure that out later. But POEII is a bit of an outlier, a popular free to play title that had people breaking down the doors eager to play.  Also, it was ready to play, a complete game in need of feedback and tuning.  Stars Reach is not there yet. So do you then pre-sell early access… which would require some sort of promised target date… which would in turn trigger flashbacks to past broken Kickstarter promises… is that a risk even worth discussing?  That seems like a bad idea. Then do they sell access to join the testing?  That also seems… not ideal.  Being in the test is not always fun.  You have seen me kvetch about the need to constantly start over again.  And what does that sort of Kickstarter do for me, somebody already in the test?  Would they boot me from the test to motivate me to pledge to their campaign in order to get back into the test? Let me tell you up front, that will not make me a bigger fan of the project. All of which brings me back to a copy of the game.  I feel like anything less than that will make the campaign feel trivial.  But that also forces Playable Worlds to commit to a business model AND gets us into the promised delivery dates end of the pool which is what has burned us all on MMORPG Kickstarters in the past. Both Raph and Carneros have responded to me in various threads asking what it is that I want as a reward when I have suggested that enthusiasm will be anchored on what people will get for their money, but it is clear that I don’t have a good answer. I don’t know what I want.  Or maybe I do know what I want… a copy of the game… but I am not sure if that desire makes any sense in the context of their plans. So what should Playable Worlds do for rewards for their Kickstarter campaign? What has enough heft, gravitas, or whatever that will make people take the campaign seriously?  I have looked back to see what past campaigns have offered… and I keep running into “a copy of the game at a reduced price.”  Even Project: Gorgon, which has run crowd funding campaigns for specific features, succeeded with Kickstarter running with a copy of the game as the base reward. What will it need to be to make this campaign a success?  Because if it doesn’t succeed, then it will likely have been better to have not done it at all.",
