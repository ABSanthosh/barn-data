Tomb Raider Pinball arrives in Pinball FX on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on June 19, including two awesome new tables: Adventures of Lara Croft and Secrets of Croft Manor. But why is this an amazing crossover, you may ask? At their core, both Tomb Raider and pinball are about quick reflexes, careful planning, and that rush you get when you finally pull off the impossible. Whether you’re dodging traps in a crumbling tomb or trying to save a ball rolling toward the drain, it’s that same exciting mix of precision and chaos. But there’s more to pinball than just keeping that silver ball alive. Each table tells a story that makes it unique. Let’s see what lies behind the ramps and rails of these two beauties! Adventures of Lara Croft is all about Lara’s classic expeditions – from Peru’s jungles to Egypt’s pyramids, from the Great Wall to the frozen caves of Tibet. Along the way, you’ll face off against familiar foes like Mark Willard, Werner Von Croy, or Natla and the Atlanteans. While exploring these remarkable locations and fighting your way through your enemies, you can even play a special third-person shooting mode with Lara’s iconic dual pistols.  There’s a lot to discover while you explore this world, choosing your missions from the globe pictured above: massive Tomb Multiballs, tricky trap ramps, dangerous pits, and finally, the Survivor Wizard Mode that pulls moments from the Survivor Trilogy for one final showdown. It’s pure, distilled Tomb Raider adventure mixed with the excitement of pinball. In Secrets of Croft Manor, you’ll flip your way through the grand halls, uncover hidden rooms, and unlock the secrets that lie deep within the Croft family estate. There’s a ton going on here: agility courses, combat training, puzzle-solving sessions, and a maze to get lost (and found) in.  Even the Croft family butler, Winston, makes an appearance. Be careful not to lock him in the freezer! The magic is in the details in this table – the grand staircase ramps, the spiral library staircase, the hidden study… It’s a love letter to anyone who ever spent hours just exploring Croft Manor between adventures. This table also features a rotating “fireplace” target in the middle, which will transform into interactive table elements according to which main mission you’ve activated.  By translating Lara Croft’s world into fast-paced pinball gameplay, Tomb Raider Pinball captures the spirit of discovery, challenge, and triumph that has made the series legendary, with a whole new perspective that’s perfect for fans and newcomers alike.  Do you have what it takes to become the ultimate tomb raider?
