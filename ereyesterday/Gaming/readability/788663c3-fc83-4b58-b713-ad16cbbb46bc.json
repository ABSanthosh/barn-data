While the company hasn't indicated an intent to sue the Pokemon leaker, Nintendo has a history of seeking litigation against those whose actions it perceives as a business threat.Gary Bowser, for example, was arrested on federal charges of fraud for his part in creating and selling tools to hack video game consoles, including the Nintendo Switch, so people could play games on their devices without paying for them. Bowser was released from prison, but owes Nintendo $10 million in compensation and has 25 percent of his monthly income garnished to pay the settlement.
