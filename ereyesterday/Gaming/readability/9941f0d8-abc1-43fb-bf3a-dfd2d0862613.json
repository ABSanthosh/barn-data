  "text": "SummaryThe Living Lands are full of exciting adventure, hidden treasure, captivating secrets… and danger!We’ve compiled some of our favorite tips and strategies to help you on your first steps into the world of Avowed.Avowed is launching February 18, 2025, for Xbox Series X|S, the Xbox app for Windows PC, Battle.net, Steam, cloud, and will be available on day one with Game Pass. Start playing today by picking up the Avowed Premium Edition on the Xbox Store, Battle.net, and Steam. Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass members, and standard edition owners can purchase the Avowed Premium Upgrade Addon for early access. The Living Lands is ripe with adventure, excitement, and a significant amount of danger – and we’re here to help. We’ve been exploring Avowed for a while now and throughout our time with Obsidian’s next great RPG, we’ve come away with a few tips to share with new adventurers who are about to take their first steps into this new corner of Eora. These are not meant to be an all-encompassing guide to the Living Lands, but we think you might benefit from one or two of these to help you on your journey. Explore! Avowed is a deeply inviting game – each of its open zones are truly dense, not just with the typical quests and side quests, but hidden treasure, buried lore, and points of interest. If something looks or sounds a little odd, there’s almost always a reason for that. Did that NPC just say something interesting as you passed? They might not have a quest marker over their head, but that doesn’t mean it won’t kick off a cutscene when you talk to them. Does that out-of-the-way balcony look a little too conspicuous? Work out a parkour route to it and you might just find – to take an example – a room full of spirits and treasure. And it’s not just solid ground that is brimming with treats – the waters of The Living Lands are also ripe with goods. Secrets are scattered across the bottoms of riverbeds, underground pools, and most importantly, nestled behind waterfalls, making it worth your while to take a dip wherever you can. If you can resist the urge to plough on with the main story, there’s so much to discover here. Don’t Neglect Upgrades to Your Equipment Unlike a lot of RPGs, your ability to tackle tougher quests is tied to your gear more than your level – which means you should be thinking about upgrades to your equipment often at the workshop in your Party Camp. Quests are clearly marked in your Journal with skull ratings. No skull showing? You’ll be fine. One skull? It might be tough but be careful and you’ll make it through. Three skulls? Here be some ferocious enemies. While you can find better equipment as you travel, it’s often more efficient to simply upgrade what you have, using crafting materials you’ll find all over the world to incrementally improve your weapons and armor. Find your preferred items and keep levelling them when you can, and your progression will keep feeling smooth. Here’s a tip to speed up the gather/trudge to camp/upgrade/return to what you were doing process: Once you’ve gathered what you need for an upgrade, you can fast travel to a previously established Party Camp to do your business from almost anywhere by popping open the map. Then when you’re ready to get to exploring, select Exit to Previous Location at the Adra Stone or preferred fast travel point, to pick up exactly where you left off. Easy! And remember: You can easily send items directly to your Party Camp from your Inventory at any time by pressing the X button if you become over encumbered. And you can break down any unused weapons or items by holding down the X button from your inventory – helpful if you’re coming up short on crafting ingredients like wood and metal. Speak to Your Companions At the Party Camp, you’ll always have a chance to catch up with your travelling companions – and this can be more practical than you might think. You’ll know when a party member wants to speak to you when you see their icon pop up with a speech bubble on the left of the screen. Once you head to Party Camp, aside from learning their backstories (and filling out your own), you may even stumble on some real benefits. For instance, early on, Kai may bring up that he’s been studying your fighting style, and has some pointers. You can ask him to train you in his own style, leading to permanent stat buffs that would have taken multiple levels’ worth of upgrades to get. It’s a huge bonus, simply for stopping for a chinwag. Pay Attention to Companion Abilities You’re not the only one levelling up in your party – for every few of your levels, your companions will also open up the opportunity to learn or upgrade an ability, and some of these can be gamechangers. Every active ability they learn can be accessed easily in combat, and while your party members will use them on their own, we highly recommend working them into your combat loop. For example, if you’re playing primarily as a magic user, it may mean you do a lot of damage but also take a lot of damage. Kai’s ability to leap onto an enemy can not only stun them but taunt them as well, meaning you can get out of a pinch by redirecting their ire onto him, letting you step back and drop ice knives out of a blizzard without fear. It’s saved us more times than we can count already. Your Map is Your Guide… and Your Shopping List The Living Lands are a colorful, visually dense world, filled not only with awe inspiring sights, but lots of stuff you’re going to want to pick up. The best way to separate the signal from the (beautiful) noise? Your minimap. In the early game, the biggest limiter to your being able to upgrade is the ‘Paradisan Ladder’ – these handy plants are usually hidden away in crannies in and outside of settlements, just out of sight. And if you’re having trouble locating them, make sure you check for an up or down icon on the marker. That  will give you better insight on where to look. Back to that mini-map: it not only shows the location of harvestable plants, but there’s a specific icon just for that Paridisan Ladder (and later, its more potent varieties like Hylea’s Talon). It looks like this (left). Now you can spare the occasional glance at the map to get what you need, but keep your eyes focused where they’ll already be drawn to: the danger and beauty of The Living Lands. Examine All of the Abilities Building out your character and assigning abilities is one of the highlights of customization in Avowed. And even though you may start approaching combat as a specific build type, like Fighter, Ranger, or Wizard, you should know that as a classless game, there are many complimentary abilities hiding within each of these trees that can help you become a well-rounded adventurer. For example, even though you may be going down the Fighter branch, one of the most helpful abilities that you can get early on is Parry, which is located under the Ranger branch as a passive ability. So, it’s worthwhile to take some time and look over all the abilities afforded to you which can be helpful in creating a balanced character as you set out on your adventure. And if you find that you’d like to change your build later, you can reset everything  by spending your skeyts. Utilize Combat Techniques As much fun as it could be to just swing wildly at your enemies, there is a strategic flow to battle in Avowed where being able to step aside from attacks, blocking them, or masterfully parrying them to run up the stun meter are key to your survival in the Living Lands. One of the key indicators you want to pay attention to in combat are the colored circles that will appear on enemies – putting points into Perception can help here. For example, if you see a red circle on an enemy as they’re about to attack, that’s unblockable so you should be nimble and dodge (A button) that attack. Or if you see a white diamond hovering over the location of an enemy while aiming with a rifle, pistol, or bow, that’s a weak point you should focus your attack on. Weapon Swapping This is for those of you who (like us) were so dang excited to jump into Avowed, that you somehow breezed through the section of the opening level that explained that you can hot-swap between two weapon builds by tapping Y on your controller or hitting U on your keyboard. Now that admission is out of the way, this is one of the more important aspects of combat for you to utilize and master, and it all comes down to how you like to play, giving you flexibility in how to approach a variety of enemies and combat situations. A few of our favorite combos include pairing an arquebus with a sword and shield, giving us a great option to use in wide open areas or while navigating narrow caverns. Another pairing we like is having a pistol and shield mixed with a grimoire and wand, providing a mix of magic-based and projectile-based attacks (with a shield to help guard attacks as you load your pistol). Or if you prefer a quieter approach, we were also partial to wielding a two-handed bow in one loadout setting and a combination of a wand and grimoire in the other, which helped for stealthily picking off enemies before launching into a flurry of aggressive magic after being discovered. Go Treasure Hunting A good way to get off the beaten path and to explore more of Eora is to pick up bounties or unearth treasure maps to not only line your pockets with new weapons and crafting materials, but to get a better sense of the world around you – and you never know what you’ll stumble upon as you dive deeper into the Living Lands. Once acquired, treasure maps won’t simply drop a marker on your map, oh no. They artistically illustrate an area – maybe a cave, a path by a river, etc, with a classic X marking The Spot. Commit that vista to memory, because the only way you’ll find that treasure is by paying attention. And even then, don’t expect a chest to just be sitting on the beach, but the map should get you close enough to hear the telltale twinkling of treasure. My precious! Use Your Environment There’s a logic to the lay of the Living Lands if you take the time to assess what’s in front of and around you. See some xaurips up ahead surrounded by tall grass? Perhaps a stealthy approach could work best. Notice that brick wall that’s hanging on by a thread? A well-thrown grenade — or, if you’re lucky, a well-aimed shot at a nearby exploding barrel — can give you a surprise advantage against a group of enemies. Mysterious ice looking plant located above a body of water? Shoot it down to create an ice platform for you to jump on. Another mantra that has been repeating for us as we explored pockets of the Living Lands was ‘anything but the front door’ – there is often an obvious, visible entrance to a building or area, but entering could cost you a fair few lockpicks. Instead of using up those precious picks in the early game, consider scouting around the location you’re exploring – perhaps there’s a hidden window to crawl through or a weak wall that you can destroy. This often offers an alternate route in that saves your lockpicks and may even give you an upper hand on any nasties lurking inside. The point here is to not always rush into every situation (although that too can be fun) but recognize the way the land and world is presented to you for your adventure. Player freedom is at the heart of Avowed and all these unique ways to approach it is intentional. So have some fun experimenting on the ways to utilize the environment to your advantage. Don’t Forget Your Grimoire Even if you find yourself focusing your abilities as more of a Fighter or Ranger, you’ll discover that always having access to a Grimoire of Elements (which you get for free at the start of the game) will come in handy more times than you can count. Yes, it can be effective in battle, but it’s also very useful at helping you solve many of the environmental puzzles. For example, being able to cast lighting spells to activate an electronic switch or being able to burn away a batch of cobwebs that could reveal a shortcut that wasn’t available to you before. So even if you’re not wielding it in your off-hand, make sure you give it a little spot in your inventory. You’ll never know when you’re going to need it (spoiler: you’re going to need it). Avowed is launching February 18, 2025, for Xbox Series X|S, the Xbox app for Windows PC, Battle.net, Steam, cloud, and will be available on day one with Game Pass.

Once acquired, treasure maps won’t simply drop a marker on your map, oh no. They artistically illustrate an area – maybe a cave, a path by a river, etc, with a classic X marking The Spot. Commit that vista to memory, because the only way you’ll find that treasure is by paying attention.

See some xaurips up ahead surrounded by tall grass? Perhaps a stealthy approach could work best. Notice that brick wall that’s hanging on by a thread? A well-thrown grenade — or, if you’re lucky, a well-aimed shot at a nearby exploding barrel — can give you a surprise advantage against a group of enemies.

Instead of using up those precious picks in the early game, consider scouting around the location you’re exploring – perhaps there’s a hidden window to crawl through or a weak wall that you can destroy. This often offers an alternate route in that saves your lockpicks and may even give you an upper hand on any nasties lurking inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe point here is to not always rush into every situation (although that too can be fun) but recognize the way the land and world is presented to you for your adventure.
