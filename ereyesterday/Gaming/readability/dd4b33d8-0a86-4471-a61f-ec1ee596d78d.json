  "text": "Did you know that Stardew Valley is the 21st best-selling game of all time? It's sold more than Skyrim! At least by the numbers we currently have, anyway. I don't care all that much about sales figures, but if creator Eric Barone cared more about money, I can only imagine that a sequel would be all but guaranteed. As it turns out though, the developer could actually see himself making a sequel to the beloved farming sim. Barone recently appeared on the podcast Tiger Belly (thanks, GamesRadar), where host Bobby Lee asked why he doesn't just make a Stardew Valley 2 when he's constantly releasing new updates. \"It's just so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch,\" Barone explains. \"Because Stardew Valley, all the systems, the major systems, are already all done. That's the stuff that's not fun to do. When I make an update, it's like, throw in this, throw in that, let's add green rain. These random ideas I have. Whimsical ideas.\" Bobby's Dream Guest, Stardew Valley Creator Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) | Bonus TigerBelly Watch on YouTube He noted that a lot of these ideas come about from playing the game himself and thinking, \"'Oh, wouldn't it be cool if there was this or that?' And then I can just do it, and that's a new update. It's really just fun and creative and spontaneous to do it that way than to make a whole new game.\" And then came the comment that struck fear into my heart: \"I might eventually make a Stardew Valley 2, to be honest.\" I say fear, because Barone struggles to not update the original game, so much so he's somewhat forcing himself to stop working on it so he can actually finish Haunted Chocolatier. However, Barone did also say that while he won't deny the possibility of a Stardew Valley 2, he doesn't \"want to just be the Stardew Valley guy, that's why I'm making Haunted Chocolatier.\" So, really we've got a Schrodinger's Stardew Valley sequel here. Fingers crossed Barone doesn't get carried away and do it, I'd like to play Haunted Chocolatier before I retire.",
