  "text": "After messing about outside the fortress, I was directed to the back of Helm’s Deep and told, in low tones, that I really needed to hang out until after midnight before things broke loose.  And, sure enough, back in the back, behind the citadel, there is a table that says… Helm’s Deep, After Midnight. How does a table tell the time? Or set the time? That is the trigger point to get you to the battle of Helm’s Deep, which does occur on a rainy night… and I guess around midnight.  I don’t recall from the books or the movies. Of course, the first thing you do is get an option to train for the brand new for this expansion epic battles option for the story, which takes you out into a field in the middle of a bright sunny day.  There you learn about commanding troops, fixing things, and operating siege weapons to help defend Helm’s Deep. Training time on the catapult and the ballista The actual mechanics of things are simple enough.  The controls are simple, though the reaction times are a bit ponderous.  But I guess a medieval catapult is supposed to whip around and aim like a CIWS. There is also a brief run down of selecting battles and rewards and commendations and all that. After that I was willing to give it a try… though there is an option.  You can play through the siege via the epic battles, or you can follow the “storied tale” which ends up being a string of quests most of the time. Choose your path For this first part of the siege, Helm’s Dike, I opted for the epic battles because… well… EPIC BATTLES or something.  I was willing to give it a try. And it was, I suppose, kind of okay.  There is a whole effing epic battles skill tree you can skill into, so if you’re really into it you can go nuts and epic battle yourself all day long. Epic Battles has a talent tree… but so does your horse I forget when Turbine decided they needed to be more like WoW and have class specializations and talent trees for all the things… but it is certainly here in Helm’s Deep.  Did this start it?  Or was it the mounted combat?  Because your horse also has a talent tree. This all means that on your first outing you get two points to apply and can’t do a number of things in the battle, like setup new siege engines, because you don’t have enough points invested.  I figured I would just man a ballista and slaughter orcs and maybe have a bit of fun that way.  I mean, remember how fun the harpoon guns were in Wrath of the Lich King?  Surely Turbine would have attempted to capture a bit of that joy. Ballista 5 standing by And it was okay.  I mean, the orc forces looked cool out there and once they walked into range I was able to pop away at them with my rubber tipped training darts, slaying pairs at a time with each elaborately prepped shot. I ran around to the big catapult and tried that, thinking that was going to hit a lot harder.  But it was like launching Nerf balls into the wind.  The thing had the range of an old man pissing and the position it was in had a big rock outcropping in front of it so I couldn’t really see exactly where I was aiming.  Then, when an orc force nicely marched up and stopped right in where I figured the reticle was, I fired away and was rewarded with a couple of archers or warriors being slain with each shot. Of course, I am not sure I was doing things correctly, and there were other events popping up, so I started running around to do things like defend the main gate, which I successfully managed.  But otherwise it took a long time and not a lot seemed to be happening. Eventually we hit a point where the head guy said we needed to retreat and I had seen the map table for that, so it was make to Helm’s Deep.  There I was given a big banner about the battle with nothing written in it… which felt kind of odd. What are you trying to say with this? So I was not all that impressed with epic battles. Now, I get it.  Back in the day this was the end game for an expansion and I could see a kinship spending weeks perfecting battles and playing a semi-tolerable version of a Total War game set in Middle-earth.  But for me, with more than a decade’s worth of content ahead of me and a goal of getting to Mordor… it was never going to be something I invested it.  So I gave the rest of the epic battles a miss and did the “story focused experience.” That got me on the wall with Legolas, watching him pick off single orcs like he was trying to drain the ocean with an eye dropper.  I helped by pushing over ladders, killing orcs that made it up onto the wall, and dropped rocks on the orcs below. Legolas playing Middle-earth Sniper Elite Then there was the devilry of Isengard, their blasting powder, which tore asunder the wall of the right flank. I swear, it was like that when I got here… Then it was into the glittering caves behind the walls, which followed the Moria pattern of being full of extra large, twin bed sized glowing crystals, so lighting wasn’t an issue.  There I ran into Gimli and Eomer and helped secure the caves with them. As part of that I ran around with Gimli and ended up running into some Dunlendings who were sneaking in through some back door, led by Lheu Brenin of the Falcon Clan, the nemesis of the Grey Company misadventures in Dunland. Lheu Brenin of the Falcon Clan arrives He was still full of himself and the quest at that point had to objectives, kill Lheu Brenin… well, it said to “damage” him, but we all know where that leads… and that Gimli must survive.  Killing Lheu was fine.  Having done so much in Rohan I arrived in Helm’s Deep a bit over level, so slaying first his minions and then him was not going to be the toughest fight I had experienced. As for the second objective… well, there were issues. The corpse of Gimli… it didn’t go like that in the book But, in the words of Miracle Max, he was apparently only mostly dead, which meant he was slightly alive… alive enough for me to speak with him, end the quest, and travel back to where I had met up with him and Eomer, where he seemed completely alive.  So dodged a bullet on that one. I would still go with Halbarad back to Dunland and burn the Falcon Clan’s village to the ground, to crush them, and to hear the lamentations of their women, if he asked.  But I suspect we pretty much closed the book on Dunland with this bit.  I don’t expect Nora and Horn will show up either. Meanwhile, I moved on, back to the citadel, where things were going poorly and Theodan, unwilling to be trapped like a rat, was set to make his last charge to find his way to Valhalla… or where ever the gallant riders of the mark end up. It is going to be time to ride! And I even got an invite to come along and witness this event. This is the moment I have been waiting for Here is where whatever minor effort I put into learning mounted combat was going to pay off.  It was time to charge forward into the thick of the orcs.  And you do start off into the valley… and then you get offered a session play thing… that bit where you have to play as somebody else and your UI is all scaled wrong and world chat is active and spewing garbage onto your screen. So I did that… and it turned out I was going to see that story from the point of view of an orc grunt. Haven’t been in a crowd like this since I went to see The Who I was set in the back row of a long column of orcs who are stalled and wondering what is going on.  And then Theodan’s vanguard appears and mows us all down and passes over us… which seemed like a pretty quick venture to setup.  Very Wiley Coyote.  But, as it turned out, I survived the first pass. The sole surviving orc in my platoon I was then instructed to run first in one direction then another, but each path led to more bad news for orcs, culminating in a run into the forest where I was ganked by viscous hurons, which ended the event. That huron is pretty pissed off All of which took place in the dim dark so it was tough to see and made for some crappy screen shots… it was “Helm’s Deep, After Midnight” after all, though at least the rain had stopped. So the session ended and I was back in Helm’s Deep and we had won and the next step in the epic quest line was to go speak to Theodan and Aragorn out on the field before the keep… but they were not there.  I was somehow in the wrong version of Helm’s Deep and couldn’t find them anywhere. I logged out and back in again, rode back to Edoras and returned, but I couldn’t get to where I needed to be.  So I dropped the quest, hoping to be able to pick it back up again… but the quest giver was in that other version of Helm’s Deep as well, so there was an epic quest line I won’t be finishing. But I am not here to complete those.  I am here on my way to Mordor.  So it was time to push on.  I had another destination laid out for me, so it was time to bid farewell to Helm’s Deep. As I said before, Helm’s Deep is one of the most impressive locations I have seen so far in my journey.  The battle was interesting and seeing masses of orcs out beyond the walls was pretty cool… though if you look too closely you can see that the orcs were copied and pasted up and down the hills around the valley and into some pretty unlikely locations.  But they did achieve the effect of having the keep surrounded and facing masses of orcs.",

that, thinking that was going to hit a lot harder.  But it was like launching Nerf balls into the wind.  The thing had the range of an old man pissing and the position it was in had a big rock outcropping in front of it so I couldn’t really see exactly where I was aiming.  Then, when an orc force nicely marched up and stopped right in where I figured the reticle was, I fired away and was rewarded with a couple of archers or warriors being slain with each shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, I am not sure I was doing things correctly, and there were other events popping up, so

id=\"caption-attachment-135287\"\u003eThat huron is pretty pissed off\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of which took place in the dim dark so it was tough to see and made for some crappy screen shots… it was “Helm’s Deep, After Midnight” after all, though at least the rain had stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the session ended and I was back in Helm’s Deep and we had won and the next step in the epic quest line was to go speak to Theodan and Aragorn out on the field before the keep… but they were not there.  I was somehow in the wrong version of Helm’s Deep and couldn’t find them anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI logged out and back in again, rode back to Edoras and returned, but I couldn’t get to where I needed to be.  So I dropped the quest, hoping to be able to pick it back up again… but the quest giver was in that other version of Helm’s Deep as well, so there was an epic quest line I won’t be finishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I am not here to complete those.  I am here on my way to Mordor.  So it was time to push on.  I had another destination laid out for me, so it was time to bid farewell to Helm’s Deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I said before, Helm’s Deep is one of the most impressive locations I have seen so far in my journey.  The battle was interesting and seeing masses of orcs out beyond the walls was pretty cool… though if you look too closely you can see that the orcs were copied and pasted up and down the hills around the valley and into some pretty unlikely locations.  But they did achieve the effect of having the keep surrounded and facing masses of orcs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
