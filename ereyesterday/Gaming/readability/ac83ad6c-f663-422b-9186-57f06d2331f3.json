  "description": "The Crossroads is a large region that you'll visit often in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Part of the realm known as the Fade, it holds many secrets. One of these concerns a thrice-locked gate, and the challenges it entails are sure to test your mettle. Here's our guide on how to complete The Heart of Corruption in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.Dragon Age: The Veilguard Heart of Corruption guideThe Heart of Corruption in Dragon Age: The Veilguard is an over-arcing quest. This is due to the following:The quest itself appears in your journal once you spot the thrice-locked door. It can be found on Beacon Island, the first area upon entering the Crossroads. From the Lighthouse eluvian, just go immediately to your right to see it.The seals can only be removed by obtaining three Revenant Essences. These items come from deadly, high-level bosses found in specific areas of the Crossroads.However, you won't be able to enter these areas normally. Instead, you must first eliminate a Darkspawn Champion in another region.Tracking The Heart of Corruption quest makes markers appear on your map, and these show you the general location of the revenant bosses. You could then track the side quest that appears to look for the champion enemy in a different region.In any case, we hope you're well-prepared prior to tackling these tasks. We suggest collecting a few unique items and picking the best skills/specializations. Much later in the campaign, you should also unlock Hero of the Veilguard perks for your companions to bolster their capabilities. Heart of Corruption Part 1A: The Gate of Lost AgesOnce you've arrived at the Converged City--i.e. the southern island in the Crossroads--you'll notice a barred doorway with only one seal. A quest will then appear in your journal, and it's called The Gate of Lost Ages.Your target is a champion called. This beast can be found in Dock Town, in an area to the east called Andraste's Watch. Go past the Fen'harel Statue and head down the pit. Take out all the demons and undead that will spawn once you're down below, so they don't become an annoyance during the battle.Once you're done, destroy the blight pod to free Quyn the Sparkwielder, a level 20 demon. Kill it and pick up the orb that it drops. Heart of Corruption Part 1B: Betrayal of FelassanNow that you have the Champion's Essence, use it on the doorway in the Converged City. This unlocks a path that takes you to an underground section of the island. There, you'll face a level 32 boss named Betrayal of Felassan. If you've been tackling the Regrets of the Dread Wolf quest, then you've likely seen this fella's elven form a few times.In any case, Betrayal of Felassan periodically summons additional enemy mobs, and it also creates a protective barrier that you need to destroy. Once the boss has been defeated, you'll receive your first Revenant Essence.For your efforts, you'll receive The Burden, a unique amulet that has the following effects: +20% damage when at low health; low health status triggers earlier; your health cannot go above 70%.That does for our Dragon Age: The Veilguard Heart of Corruption guide. We'll continue updating this article once we've eliminated the other targets, so stay tuned.The lands of Thedas are under threat from formidable foes, including some menacing elven gods, and it's up to Rook and their allies to save the day.
