This is $50 less than SteelSeries' Easter Sale deal price of $189.99. The Arctis Pro is a top-end SteelSeries headset (in fact, its flagship model before the Nova Arctis Pro was released), and one of only two models with swappable batteries.50% Off SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless Gaming HeadsetSteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless HeadsetThe Arctis Pro was the highest-end gaming headset in SteelSeries' repertoire until its successor, the Arctis Nova Pro, was released. It boasts some great features you don't see in other gaming headsets, like a separate standalone base station with volume knob and OLED display, simultaneous Bluetooth and 2.4GHz WiFi pairing, and probably the best one: the hot-swappable battery system. This way, you get wireless freedom with no waiting to recharge. SteelSeries includes two batteries: one that's in use in your headset and the other that's charging in the base station.The Arctis Pro features as good of a build quality you'll find in a SteelSeries headset. The headband is made of a lightweight steel and aluminum alloy construction and the suspension headstrap is very comfortable for marathon gaming sessions. The ear cushions are made of an AirWeave performance fabric similar to the ones found on the new Arctis Nova Pro. The ClearCast boom microphone can be retracted when not in use. Audio quality is great thanks to the premium 40mm speaker drivers with high-density neodymium magnets that reproduce hi-res audio up to 40,000Hz.The Arctis Pro was replaced by the Arctis Nova Pro in 2022. The current best price for a brand new pair of Nova Pros is $270 on Amazon. Although it's an excellent headset that we reviewed favorably and features significant upgrades like active noise cancellation and USB Type-C charging, it most certainly isn't worth nearly double the cost of the Arctis Pro.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
