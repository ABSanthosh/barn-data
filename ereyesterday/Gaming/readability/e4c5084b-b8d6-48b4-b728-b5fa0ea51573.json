Thanks to your support of the 2024 “Mercy for a Cause” campaign, we’ve raised a staggering $12.3 million for BCRF— the second-largest single corporate donation ever made to the Foundation. This brings Overwatch and Blizzard's total contribution to over $25 million in life-saving breast cancer research.   Hope for a Brighter Future Earlier this year, Overwatch teamed up once again with BCRF, the largest private funder of breast cancer research globally. By supporting our in-game “Mercy for a Cause” campaign, players around the world helped drive this incredible fundraising success. One hundred percent of the proceeds from the sale of the exclusive Pink Mercy skins (minus applicable platform fees and taxes) went directly to BCRF’s mission of preventing and curing breast cancer. This year’s campaign came close to matching the $12.7 million raised in the original 2018 Pink Mercy campaign, further cementing the Overwatch community’s impact on breast cancer research and bringing the cumulative total to over $25 million raised for life-saving breast cancer research to-date. The 2018 campaign funded groundbreaking projects, including: Advanced AI methods for mammogram image analysis, improving breast cancer diagnosis and risk assessment. Predictive models for identifying the most aggressive forms of the disease, including triple-negative breast cancer. Development of treatments that delay tumor formation. A gene classifier that predicts the risk of invasive breast cancer in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), helping countless individuals navigate difficult treatment decisions. Stay tuned—in the coming months, BCRF and Overwatch will share details about the impactful research that will be powered by the 2024 campaign donation. Heroes for a Cause Overwatch 2’s “Mercy for a Cause” event hailed an all-new Rose Gold Mercy skin and bundle along with the return of the beloved Pink Mercy skin. Our community got to enjoy these lovely in-game looks while becoming real-life heroes by fueling research that saves lives. Mercy’s journey in Overwatch continues to inspire, as she advocates for peace, healing, and hope in the game—and in our world. Without you this milestone would have never been possible. You’ve helped advance the most promising research in breast cancer prevention and treatment, and we couldn’t be more grateful. Together, we’re creating a future where breast cancer could become a thing of the past. On behalf of Blizzard Entertainment and BCRF, we want to extend our deepest gratitude to every player who contributed to this campaign. With your help, we’ve once again proven that together, we can make a real-world difference. Thank You for Your Support. \u003c3 About BCRF Founded in 1993, BCRF is the largest private funder of breast cancer research in the world.
