  "text": "Eternal Evil is a first-person survival horror game that captures the spirit of the genre’s roots. With two playable characters, limited resources, and a city on the edge of collapse, players must think fast, aim carefully, and survive the night. In Eternal Evil, Every Mistake Fuels Your Enemy Vampires don’t just attack – they feed. If you let them get close, they’ll grow faster, tougher and harder to kill. This survival horror FPS turns every encounter into a choice: strike first, or be bled dry. At the core of Eternal Evil is its “feeding mechanic” – the longer a vampire is on you, the stronger it becomes. What starts as a basic fight can quickly become a deadly chase if you hesitate. You’re not just trying to survive. You’re managing your own downfall. Every Bullet Matters Combat is slow, deliberate, and brutal. Ammo is scarce. Headshots are everything. You won’t blast through hordes – you’ll count every round and pray you brought enough. The game demands tight inventory management, attention to detail, and preparation. Puzzles are embedded in the environment. There are no glowing objectives or quest markers. Progress comes from observation, not hand-holding. Two Storylines. One Outbreak. You’ll play as two characters: detective Hank Richards, locked inside a hotel during the first wave of infection, and his ex-military ally Marcus, navigating the city from the outskirts. Each path reveals a different part of the story – and only one of them makes it to the end. Environments shift from cramped hallways to burned-out streets and abandoned facilities. Enemy placement and pacing are designed to keep tension high throughout both campaigns. No Shortcuts, No Hand-Holding There are no tutorials. No mini-maps. No regenerating health. Eternal Evil respects your ability to adapt – and punishes those who don’t. If you’re stuck on a puzzle, an optional item allows limited auto-solves – but nothing comes free. Everything in Eternal Evil has a cost. Pure Survival Horror Eternal Evil doesn’t chase spectacle. It builds fear through restraint. Minimalist UI. Cold, comic-style cutscenes. No noise – just tension. This is what defined the golden age of survival horror: constant pressure, deliberate pacing, and the kind of dread that doesn’t let go. Eternal Evil is now available on Xbox Series X|S. In Eternal Evil, you'll immerse yourself in a dark, blood-soaked atmosphere filled with terrifying enemies and a gripping, mysterious storyline. Armed with a diverse arsenal of firearms, you'll experience realistic shooting mechanics as you battle evolving ghouls. The game challenges you with intricate puzzles. As you explore diverse and immersive locations, you'll manage your inventory carefully, all within a classic survival-horror experience. The game also features a physics-based damage system, allowing for enemy dismemberment, adding to the intense and visceral horror. Fans of traditional survival-horror gameplay—featuring tight corridors, limited resources, and a constant sense of dread—will feel right at home. The experience pays homage to the golden age of the genre with a modern edge, offering methodical combat, strategic exploration, and a deeply atmospheric world.",
