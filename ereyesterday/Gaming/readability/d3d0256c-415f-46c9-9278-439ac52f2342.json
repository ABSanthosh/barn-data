Welcome to Enshrouded This time around our goal was to finish the quest that would get us the next glider upgrade, the ghost glider… which isn’t particularly ghost-like in anyway… it just glides faster so you can go further… but it is a pretty bitchin’ name, so I’ll allow it. We met up at our base and made sure we all had a good hat image going. Checking out our hat game I had just found the tricorn hat and chose to go with that.  It was the final entry on a quest chain dedicated to cosmetic hats… and I am all about the hats in these games. We then spent a bit discussing food.  We had used up all our food last week and needed to provision ourselves and the food system in Enshrouded looks superficially like the system in Valheim… but they are not all that alike.  Eventually Potshot came up with a chart. The food chart As with such thing, you might need to click on it to make it legible.  Also, I am not sure where it is from otherwise I would give credit. The chart raised more questions than it answered in some ways, but eventually we had our supplies together and headed out to the Kindlewastes spire via fast travel.  From there we would glide south to the sun temple where the plans of the ghost glider lay. However, given our experience with sun temples being pretty easy, we decided to stop along the way, hitting an elixir well and a shroud root on the glide path between the spire and the temple.  We first hit a shroud root to the west, which was quick and easy, then fast traveled back to the spire to glide south.  I stopped at a bit of high ground before gliding down to the elixir well. The top of the elixir well to the extreme left, the sun temple straight ahead for me We glided in, landing safely around the elixir well and avoided the red stuff that kills your shroud timer… and then you… and found the flame shrine.  Once set with that we… couldn’t figure out how to get in. Elixir wells are usually straight forward, with a ladder or steps or a climbing grate visible from the flame shrine.  We had one previously with an entry elsewhere… not immediately visible, so we ran around and searched the area, but came up with nothing.  The only clue was a ladder down in a pit below the flame shrine sticking out of some dirt.  Could it be under that? Potshot started digging and told us he saw something just as I was walking up to help and I fell right into the hole.  Postshot was correct and, while I survived the fall, it was a bit unnerving. Looking back up through the hole We managed the get down into the well, then threaded our way down carefully.  The whole thing was a series of platforms and climbing and swinging bits, all over more of the red gunk that kills your shroud timer when you touch it.  So we tried to take a lot of care moving through the place. Standing on a tilted platform I managed to fall off of twice However, it was dark and dangerous and we fell a few times into the red stuff, or tried to double jump and accidentally deployed our glider, sending us off across the room to either die or get stuck in places that were as good as dying.  In the process we got spread out and at least twice shroud timers simply expired as we tried to find the shroud root that is at the heart of every elixir well. After being separated and lost for a while, we managed to group up deep in the well, but could not find the root. We did, however, spot a suspiciously blank wall with a number or red explosive barrels around it.  That, too, seemed to be a clue.  We all stood back and I put an arrow into one of the barrels and… BOOM… a big hole appeared, through which we found the root. The shroud root revealed at last But even getting up to the root was a challenge and Ula fell off the path at one point and we couldn’t get to her corpse, so she had to release and run back, which meant threading her way back through the elixir well, but she made it. Then Potshot cut the root… I had already managed to fall through a hole up by the root, it was up to him… at which point we were awarded our skill point and the shroud disappeared from the area so we fast traveled out, leaving behind a few corpses. Red corpse markers on the map I’m still not 100% sure how the game decides what you keep on death and what stays on your corpse… but there was nothing I really wanted, so I was fine with that. We then glided down from the spire again, this time towards a shroud root that was in the middle of that unrevealed part of my map, but Potshot had it and pinged it so we could guide ourselves in.  We landed almost on top of it, cleared out the locals, then Ula gave it the big chop. Ula taking the axe to the shroud root That done, we trotted around some headlands to head south to our final destination only to find that, unlike some other sun temples I could mention, this one was actually a big of a challenge. There were all the usual suspects, the ranged guys on high spots dropping bombs on us, that annoying double cleaver poisonous looking guy we hate, the dual wielding red tinted guys, and then, on top of that, two matron boss mobs throwing poison everywhere to make things interesting.  It was quite a fight. The matron coming for us I managed to die early on fighting the first matron, which put me back up at the spire, the last flame shrine I touched.  But that seemed fine.  I could just glide back most of the way and rejoin.  And then, about two thirds into my glide I realized I was going to run out of stamina before I landed and dived for the ground… but too late.  Stamina ran out and I went from dive to plummet and died again. Back to the spire. I took the next glide in stages, hitting a high spot waypoint along the way to regen my stamina, though I noticed my stam was not fully regenerating despite having consumed, yet again, food that should help with that. (Rooibos tea.)  So I was careful on the way back. Meanwhile, a matron was spitting poison and otherwise trying to make chutney out of Potshot and Ula who kited her around while hitting her whenever was practicable.  It is always a bit awkward when the tank is off doing something else. They got the first matron down by the time I got back and I was able to get in and do the tank thing which, thanks to my skill point allocation, basically pulls all aggro from others onto me if I do things right.  So I ended up with the matron focused on me and spitting poison my way… note to self, carry antidote next time as that poison is murder… allowing Potshot and Ula to pound here down.  That got it done. After that there were a few other mobs to clean up, but after that the compound was cleared out and the tower at the back faced us.  A locked door with three unlit lights above it… so we ran around and found the three buttons to press. Inside there were some more mobs to fight and a couple more puzzles to figure out… nothing too tough, but enough to make you stop, gather yourself, and look around.  That included another door, this time with four unlit lights indicating four buttons to find. More lights to get lit This one had a couple of tricky hidden buttons, but we managed it.  Then it was up the stairs, past a grapple or two, and up to the top where a big chest wait for us.  I opened it up. The glow of what is in the briefcase… erm, chest… It was the ghost glider… and the recipe to make more. The carpenter will roll you up one The ghost glider gets you 250% of the speed/distance of the first glider according to the wiki, and it is zippy fast.  You need to be level 30 to use it… but we were all there now. We sorted out the rest of our haul from various chests and a couple of bosses, which included a spiffy new tunic for Potshot. A nice look Then it was back to base to see what we needed to make more ghost gliders. We had most of the ingredients to hand, but we did have to roll up some shroud oil, an item from the chemistry set, which needed a few things we had to hand in various chests. But we’re all set on ghost gliders.  The next thing on the list is being able to build bee hives.  After having gone through the food chart and the potions, honey is kind of a gating item for some of the stuff we want, and collecting it in the wild, while possible… we have 8-9 wild hives that you can knock down and harvest pretty close by our base… being able to control the output is really what we need. And to get that, there is another boss out there to find and fight.",

last flame shrine I touched.  But that seemed fine.  I could just glide back most of the way and rejoin.  And then, about two thirds into my glide I realized I was going to run out of stamina before I landed and dived for the ground… but too late.  Stamina ran out and I went from dive to plummet and died again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack to the spire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the next glide in stages, hitting a high spot waypoint along the way to regen my stamina, though I noticed my stam was not fully regenerating despite having consumed, yet again, food that should help with that. (Rooibos tea.)  So I was careful on the way back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, a matron was spitting poison and otherwise trying to make chutney out of Potshot and Ula who kited her around while hitting her whenever was practicable.  It is always a bit awkward when the tank is off doing something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey got the first matron down by the time I got back and I was able to get in and do the tank thing which, thanks to my skill point allocation, basically pulls all aggro from others onto me if I do things right.  So I ended up with the matron focused on me and spitting poison my way… note to self, carry antidote next time as that poison is murder… allowing Potshot and Ula to pound here down.  That got it done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that there were a few other mobs to clean up, but after that the compound was cleared out and the tower at the back faced us.  A locked door with three unlit lights above it… so we ran around and found the three buttons to press.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside there were some more mobs to fight and a couple more puzzles to figure out… nothing too tough, but enough to make you stop, gather yourself, and look around.  That included another door, this time with four unlit lights indicating four buttons to find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\"
