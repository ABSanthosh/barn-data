  "text": "Look, I love the Steam Deck. In fact, we’re such big fans of it in our home that I have an OLED and my wife has the LCD model I had before it. It’s my main way of playing Diablo 4 and Path of Exile 2 these days, and yet, I yearn for more. For all of the Steam Deck’s strengths, it just won’t be supported by some games, including my all-time most-played game, Destiny 2, and I’d be lying if I said that didn’t mean I was flirting with the idea of moving to a ROG Ally. Destiny on the go, and at a discount? I’m keen Alas, being in the UK, this deal isn’t one for me, but over at Best Buy, US gamers can save $150 on the ROG Ally, bringing it down to $499.99. For that, you’re getting the AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme and a 1080p screen with up to 120Hz refresh rate, along with 512GB of storage. As James said in his review, the console shows the best and worst of Windows, and that might mean I’m better off waiting for the Xbox version coming later this year with its interchangeable storefronts. Still, with Destiny 2’s latest expansion, Edge of Fate, waiting for me to take on the go, I’d probably jump at a similar discount in the UK. Would I use it for endgame raiding? Unlikely, but just to sit and play while the TV is in use? That sounds ideal.",
