The second half of the show focuses on a coven of vampires looking to create their own undead kingdom, as well as the foul-mouthed Grim Reaper himself (this might just be Malcolm McDowell's best role ever).As you'd expect, the show is violent and has beautifully animated action scenes, as well as banter sharper than a razor blade during some of the more quiet scenes. The Blu-ray editions come with behind-the-scenes videos, voice actor interviews, storyboards, art galleries, and other special features.Castlevania: NocturneSet hundreds of years after the original Castlevania animated series, Nocturne Season 1 followed Richter Belmont and took inspiration from the 1993 PC Engine game Rondo of Blood, which some fans may know better by a different name. Rondo of Blood was exclusive to Japan at launch; Konami brought the story to North America on Super Nintendo as Castlevania: Dracula X. Nocturne Season 2 answered many of the remaining questions from Season 1 while leaving the door open for a third season.Netflix hasn't renewed Castlevania: Nocturne for Season 3. There's also a chance that instead of continuing Nocturne's story, a new Castlevania arc begins. The Castlevania animated series has been a bright spot for the franchise in recent years, so hopefully it continues in some fashion.Speaking of Netflix animated adaptations of video games, Arcane Season 1 released on 4K and standard Blu-ray alongside Nocturne last October. Arcane launched with two Limited Edition Steelbooks, a 4K Blu-ray featuring Jinx cover art and a 1080p Blu-ray featuring Vi cover art. Amazon recently restocked Arcane's 4K Blu-ray Limited Edition Steelbook for $37.76 (was $60), and the standard Blu-ray Limited Edition Steelbook for $35.64 (was $55). The non-steelbook Blu-ray edition is available for only $26 (was $45). Arcane concluded its run on Netflix with its second and final season in November. 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller Gets Nice Discount A Month After Its Release Best 4K Blu-Rays \u0026 Box Sets In Amazon's B2G1 Free Big Spring Sale Lenovo Legion Go SteamOS Handheld Preorders Are Live At Best Buy + Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals \u0026 Preorders Links (5) Zelda: Twilight Princess 11-Book Manga Box Set Is Nearly 50% Off At Amazon Lego Transformers Optimus Prime Is Finally Back In Stock With A Big Discount Middle-earth 6-Film 4K Blu-Ray Collection Gets Huge Launch Discount Star Trek: Lower Decks Steelbook Box Set Preorders Restocked At Amazon The Last Of Us Limited-Edition PS5 Controller Preorders Restocked At Major Retailers Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?
