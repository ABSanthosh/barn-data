Over the years, Google has cemented the Pixel as one of the best Android smartphones around, but it can be challenging to recall each and every model since the first one dropped back in 2016. Below, we've compiled every Google Pixel smartphone and its release date. If you've ever been keen to explore how Google upgraded its flagship phone lineup over the years, there has never been a better time!How Many Google Pixel Generations Have There Been?In total, there have been 17 different Google Pixel generations. This list does not include separate listings for Pro or XL models, but we have included separate Pixel models like the a and Fold series.Every Google Pixel Generation in Order of ReleaseGoogle Pixel - October 20, 2016Google Pixel was the first phone in the Pixel line, launching in October 2016. At the time, this was one of the first smartphones to take advantage of USB-C, with the device also packing in a 12.3 megapixel camera. Both a Pixel and Pixel XL were offered, with the latter featuring a larger display.Google Pixel 2 - October 17, 2017Google Pixel 2 was relased just one year after the original Pixel in October 2017. Google also made some significant improvements to the camera system, including support for optical image stabilization. Above all else, the Pixel 2 was also notorious for removing the headphone jack, while at least addressing some Bluetooth issues from the first model.Google Pixel 3 - October 18, 2018The Google Pixel 3 made many noticable changes for users. First, the bezels surrounding the display were drastically slimmed down compared to both Google Pixel and Google Pixel 2. As a result, the resolution of the screen was also made higher, with an increase of 12.5% and a shift to a 5.5\" display. Pixel 3 also introduced wireless charging, allowing users to charge the device without the need for a USB-C cable.Google Pixel 3a - May 7, 20192019 marked the first time that Google offered mid-range smartphones to the market, with the Google Pixel 3a acting as a cheaper companion to the flagship Google Pixel 3. Although the Pixel 3a released after the Pixel 3, this model ommitted a few things here and there, but it at least kept the flagship's back camera system intact. You can read our review of the Pixel 3a for what we thought about it when it first came out.Google Pixel 4 - October 15, 2019Google Pixel 4 was a quiet upgrade that focused much more on internals. Google upped the refresh rate of the display to 90Hz, and there were numerous upgrades made to the camera system such as a 2x optical zoom. Additionally, Google upgraded the RAM inside the Pixel 4, with a whole 6GB available, up from 4GB in the Pixel 3.Google Pixel 4a - August 20, 2020Similar to the Google Pixel 3a, the 4a left out a few features from the Google Pixel 4 while still making upgrades of its own. While the 90Hz refresh rate was dropped, Pixel 4a made huge improvements with display brightness, delivering a peak brightness of 796 nits - an 83% increase over Pixel 4. Additionally, Google made the 4a more power efficient, so you got an extra four hours compared to the flagship model.Google Pixel 5 - October 15, 2020Google Pixel 5 made battery life a major priority, providing a 4080mAh battery that delivered almost 50% more battery life per charge over Google Pixel 4. Additionally, this model brought in the increased display brightness from the Pixel 4a, as well as the fingerprint scanner. Google even added the reverse charging feature, which allowed you to wirelessly charge another device using your Pixel 5.Google Pixel 5a - August 26, 2021Image Credit: Ars TechnicaThe Google Pixel 5 and Pixel 5a almost look identical next to each other, but the 5a actually sports a slightly bigger display of 6.34\". While the battery is bigger on the 5a, sitting at 4680mAh, the Pixel 5a does not support any wireless charging feature, so you cannot use the phone to charge another device like you can with Pixel 5.Google Pixel 6 - October 28, 2021Google Pixel 6 made a huge splash when it launched in October 2021 with a fresh new design that saw the cameras integrated into a bar design. Despite all the new technology integrated inside the device, Pixel 6 actually launched for $100 less than Pixel 5. Major improvements to the camera systems were also made, which allowed for better pictures in low light settings. The Pro version of this phone was one of our favorite new phones that year and is still a solid device.Google Pixel 6a - July 21, 2022The Google Pixel 6a launched later than most other a models, arriving in late July 2022. This smartphone cut the 90Hz refresh rate of Google Pixel 6 to 60Hz, in addition to the RAM from 8GB to 6GB. However, by far the biggest difference is the main camera sensor, which is only 12.2MP on the Pixel 6a compared to 50MP on the Pixel 6.Google Pixel 7 - October 13, 2022Google Pixel 7 was largely a minimal upgrade, while at least still refining some of the Pixel's most used features. Launched in October 2022, the Pixel 7 brought an improved fingerprint sensor, a redesigned camera bar, and better performance. While it was not anything to run home about, this was a solid upgrade for those with an older Pixel model. We prefered the larger Pixel 7 Pro when we compared it to the standard 7 model.Google Pixel 7 (128GB)Google Pixel 7a - May 10, 2023Google Pixel 7a launched on May 10, 2023, bringing a 64MP main camera and keeping the 90Hz refresh rate and 8GB of RAM. The 7a is a bit smaller than the Pixel 7 despite still retaining a similar screen sizer. While battery life across both models was largely the same, the Pixel 7 was able to recharge faster due to support for 20W fast charging across both wired and wireless capabilities.Google Pixel 7aA slightly cheaper and toned-down version of the Pixel 7, the Pixel 7a offers the same powerful processor, impressive AI features, and decent cameras. Google Pixel Fold - June 20, 2023Google made its first major shakeup to the Pixel lineup in years with 2023's Google Pixel Fold. This foldable phone features a huge 7.6\" display when folded open, with a standard display on the outside so you can use it like any normal smartphone. The Fold featured many of the beloved Google Pixel 7 Pro camera features, and the unique design allowed for numerous camera angles by using half the phone as a stand.Google Pixel 8 - October 12, 2023Google Pixel 8 was a decent upgrade from the Pixel 7 line, with some major features being a peak brightness of 2000 nits and a refresh rate of 120Hz. This phone launched on October 12, 2023, just a few months after Google debuted the wildly unique Google Pixel Fold.Google Pixel 8Running on a G3 Tensor chip, youâ€™ll enjoy solid cameras, smart AI functions, and a bright, beautiful OLED display for an affordable price.Google Pixel 8a - May 14, 2024Google Pixel 8a was launched on May 14, 2024. This model dropped the Gorilla Glass Victus, opting for Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. While both have an OLED display and sport similar performance, the real difference lies in the cameras on back. The Pixel 8 has a 50MP main camera while the Pixel 8a has a 64MP camera. This led to higher pixel count but less depth due to the supporting cameras and sensors on the Pixel 8.Google Pixel 9 - August 22, 2024Google Pixel 9 was launched in August 2024. This broke from a years-long tradition of launching new Pixel flagship models in October, but it seems likely that this new release strategy could be here to stay. Pixel 9 brought Satellite SOS features, a completely new design, and a triple rear camera. The Pro series even brought it up to 16GB of RAM, which is a huge leap forward for Pixel as a whole.Google Pixel 9 ProAn elegant design, exceptional cameras, a quality display, and extensive software support make the Pixel 9 Pro a champ among smartphones. Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold - September 4, 2024The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the latest phone in the Pixel line, featuring a foldable display that builds off the 2023 Pixel Fold. The display is now taller and thinner, allowing for a bigger screen on the device. OLED displays can be found on both the front and interior screens, with the outer display sitting at 6.3 inches and the inner screen at 8 inches. With three rear facing cameras and 16GB of RAM, the Pixel 9 Fold Pro is Google's premier phone at the moment.Preorder the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold 256GBWhen Is the Google Pixel 10 Coming Out?It is expected that Google will release the Google Pixel 10 lineup, including the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, sometime in Fall 2025. While in the past Google has traditionally stuck to October for these releases, the Pixel 9 was released in August 2024, so it is plausible that Google will launch the Pixel 10 lineup in August 2025 as well.Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.
