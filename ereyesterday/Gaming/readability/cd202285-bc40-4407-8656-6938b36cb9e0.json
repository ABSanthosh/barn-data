  "description": "Why settle for one kind of horror story when you can explore them all? That's the TLDR behind Video Ghastlies, an upcoming horror game that sees players pulled into many different eras of horror movie history, from 1930s gothic horror and Carpenteresque body horror to Giallo slashers and even modern styles like found footage. The game doesn't have a release date just yet, but it'll debut on PC. Video Ghastlies is set in 1990s Scotland, casting players as the sibling of a missing brother. To find him, you'll explore illegal VHS tapes, with each one pulling you into a different horror story. In between, your apartment acts as a safe haven where you can put clues together and try to solve a multilayered mystery. The game doesn't intend to be a defenseless horror game akin to Amnesia or Outlast. Instead, you'll be equipped with weapons befitting of each era and genre you're pulled into, with puzzles to slow you down and enemies staring back at you.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
