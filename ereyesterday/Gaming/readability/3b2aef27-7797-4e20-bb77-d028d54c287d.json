EVE Online Legion Legion seems like a bit of a borrowed name, both because of the history of what is currently called EVE Vanguard, the first person shooter idea that CCP won’t ever let go of, but which was also Project Legion for a time. That and there is a ship in game called the Legion… which is not there on the splash screen.  Also, just to confuse things I suppose, there was also a popular WoW expansion with the name Legion.  So, there is the possibility of mistaken identity. The Legion strategic cruiser We don’t actually know a lot about the expansion, but there is another keynote tomorrow and some panels so there are details to come.  However, I figured I should mark the announcement and take a peek at what they have posted about it.  So what are the high level plans? Connect. Collaborate. Conquer.  More corporation project things. Your Brand. Your Colors. Your Legacy. More SKINR things… specifically a corporation color palette plus some more items. Amass Firepower, Command Destruction. Two new ships.  We always love new ships.  Nothing shakes up the meta like a new ship that will be overpowered until it becomes too easy to obtain, after which it will be nerfed into submission.  This time around we’re getting a Triglavian marauder and an Angel Cartel dreadnought.  Exciting stuff there.  Those are the ships on the splash screen. Shape Your Space More null sec sovereignty updates, because they’re going to get this right some day! Balance Pass Cruisers and dreads will be getting their turn on the balance scales.  Make the Moros great again. Expansion Trailer There is, of course, a trailer for the expansion.  So we have that going for us. I am sure we’ll get more tomorrow. That Shooter Meanwhile, having mentioned EVE Vanguard above in the context of Project Legion of old, there were plans announced for that as well which were tacked onto the end of the Legion announcement, no doubt fearing people wouldn’t read it otherwise. There is another play test event coming up in September and they are eyeing Summer 2026 for early access.  Plus, you can now go wishlist the game on Steam. The sooner they get it off of my EVE launcher, the better.  But I am not an FPS fan. So there we go.  There are a few more details and more videos at the link at the end of the post, which is just down below. Related: CCP – Legion Expansion Launches on 27 May",
