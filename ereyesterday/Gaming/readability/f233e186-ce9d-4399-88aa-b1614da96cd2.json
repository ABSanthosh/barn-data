  "description": "There are some major changes coming to Nvidia's popular GeForce Now cloud streaming service, starting with a cap on monthly playtime starting in 2025. As of January 1, new subscribers will be limited to 100-hours streaming hours of gaming per month.The changes were announced on Nvidia's official blog, which also revealed that Priority membership is being renamed Performance. The price tier for Performance will remain the same as Priority, with new support for 1440p resolution streaming, ultrawide resolution, and the option to save graphics settings across all streaming sessions.Existing Performance and Ultimate GeForce Now subscribers, or users who sign up before the end of 2024, won't be affected by the 100-hours streaming limit until January 1, 2026. According to Nvidia, only 6% of its subscribers go over 100-hours. Subscribers will also have the option to carry over 15 hours unused streaming time every month. But if players exceed 100-hours in any given month, they will have the option of buying 15-hour blocks of playtime.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Those day passes can be upgraded to monthly or six-month recurring memberships that can also lock in a year without the 100-hour restriction. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?
