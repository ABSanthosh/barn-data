There's a lot coming in this new update, namely a new area to head to, the Waifei Peninsula, a \"remote yet vibrant district of New Eridu.\" The story follows on from where the Sacrifice crisis was left off in previous chapters, seeing you \"uncover the hidden secrets of Phaethon and experience new Hollow exploration gameplay that harnesses the forces of Ether.\" You'll be able to wander around a new city, Failume Heights, which is filled with things like dessert stalls, tea houses, and pawnshops. Getting around this new city, and the original map, should be a bit easier too, as the 3D navigation system will be receiving an overhaul, with an added mini-map to help you keep track of where you are. Exploring Hollows will work slightly differently too, as there are new perception techniques that let you do things like finding clues to follow the flow of Ether. Version 2.0 Teaser \"Where Clouds Embrace the Dawn\" | Zenless Zone Zero Watch on YouTube What essentially looks like a 3D platformer minigame has been added in too where you play as Eous through different levels to gather up Star Anchor Data. An entire management minigame has been added in too where you get to run your own Suibian Temple. Here you send Bangboo out to explore to find different goods to sell. On top of all of this, you'll also be able to change your Proxies' outfit, take part in a mech-battle event, take part in a new agent story, unlock new W-Engines, and a lot more. You can take a look at the teaser trailer above for more specifics. There will, as is typical of many gacha games, be anniversary benefits like free pulls and a free standard S-Rank agent, plus some giveaways too. Seems a bit overwhelming to be honest, but in a roguelike like this with the kind of character designs that it has, being overwhelmed almost seems like the whole point.",
