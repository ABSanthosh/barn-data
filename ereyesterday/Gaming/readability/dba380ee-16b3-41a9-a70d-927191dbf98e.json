  "description": "When Destiny 2: Heresy arrives early next month, players will find themselves back on the Dreadnaught, the Hive ship that's been left adrift since The Taken King expansion. And while players have fought inside the ship before, the Dreadnaught has undergone some changes since its last appearance. \"What's significant about the Dreadnaught's return for Heresy is that it's going to be changing, and we're going to be fighting through it in ways we've yet to experience,\" said Nikko Stevens--Destiny 2's Narrative Architect--during a feature on PlayStation's official site. \"The Dreadnaught has reawakened for the first time in almost a decade, spurring the Vanguard and Guardians across the system to take notice. We finally get to see what has become of the Dreadnaught years after Oryx was felled and its halls were left to corrode, without a Navigator.\"There are plenty of Taken enemies waiting for players on the Dreadnaught, and the goal of the mission is to push back against the corruption that has largely overtaken the ship. That's why this mission will introduce a new activity called The Nether. In this task, Players will be dispatched to disable the ship's internal weapons and prevent the Taken corruption from spreading. Both the players and their enemies can also be positively or negatively affected by boons which will shake up the balance of power between them.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Some of Destiny 2's previous collaborations have featured items from and inspired by The Witcher, Mass Effect, and Assassin's Creed. Bungie also recently shared a first look at Destiny 2's new dungeon, Sundered Doctrine, and the invitation for the best players in the game to compete in a race to be the first to finish it.
