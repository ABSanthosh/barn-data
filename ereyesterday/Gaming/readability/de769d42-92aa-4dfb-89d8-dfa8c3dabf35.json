Responding to news Twitch has updated its enforcement rules so that streamers caught violating guidelines will now be subjected to varying limited-time bans, Beahm issued a comment from his personal account X/Twitter, saying Twitch \"should've never allowed a low-level employee to override the entire ban system\". Xbox Developer Direct - four promising games also coming to PlayStation.Watch on YouTube Although its difficult to verify the identity of this X profile given anyone can now purchase a blue tick, the account was established in 2011 and appears to be Beahm's personal account where he posts outside of his Doc persona.

Pathetic.\" Beahm admitted to conduct that \"leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate\" with a minor back in June, after Twitch's former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, claimed an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform \"because [he] got caught sexting a minor\". Those allegations were later directly linked to Beahm. After a period away from the spotlight, an agitated Beahm returned in a combative YouTube stream in September in which he repeatedly accused Conners and \"so-called journalists\" of a \"planned and coordinated attack\". All this, Beahm admitted, came ahead of a 25th September \"opportunity\" to reapply for partnership on YouTube and re-monetise his channel, which was eventually approved. Since that admission, Robert Bowling - who co-founded developer Midnight Society with Beahm - distanced himself from the streamer, and many long-running partners terminated their agreements. By the end of January, four months after making \"significant\" layoffs, Midnight Society announced it was permanently shutting its doors. Beahm has yet to publicly share the \"mutual jokes and bantering\" messages he sent to the minor.",
