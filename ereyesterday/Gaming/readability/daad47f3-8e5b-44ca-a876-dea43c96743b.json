No Man’s Sky – Worlds Part II It has been almost hard to ignore enthusiasm for the update.  Over on the NMS subreddit people have been posting screen shots of all the different things they have found since the update, so I had some sense of what was on tap for the update.  I mean, there is some crazy stuff.  I figured I would just go over to the NMS site and grab the key points from the updates page… and then it just kept going and going and going…. holy hell, I have seen $50 MMO expansions with less content than what has landed with this update. It is the reason this meme surfaces with every update. Sean Murray is giving us free stuff again… Hello Games sold us a “buy the box” title… a 2018 “buy the box” title no less… and continues to give away vast amounts of new content on a regular schedule.  I hope they’re spending some time with Light No Fire, their upcoming co-op survival title, because their tending to NMS makes me all the more eager for that to show up. Anyway, I gave up on trying to put together my own list of features from the update page, which scrolls forever, and just grabbed the patch notes… and then trimmed those down by removing bug fixes and quality of life updates and technical items like changes to lighting to just tray and focus on new features, which is below.  It is a lot. There is also a minute and a half overview video about the update. Or, if you want a bit more, there is a six minute “deep dive” video available… but I am not sure the FedEx guy from the old ads could read through the patch note bullet points in six minutes. I think the new “abandoned” mode sounds interesting, though all of this is so much I am not even sure how to begin to appreciate it.  Is this a “start a new character” level event?  Does this overlay my past missions?  Doe it change planets I’ve been to already? It is almost too much to consider.  Anyway, they’ve also been doing a Twitch drops campaign, so I’ve been collecting those for possible future use. So this is what I grabbed from the patch notes: NEW STAR SYSTEMS A new class of stellar body has been added to the universe. These purple-class systems are additional stars, allowing the universe to expand with increased diversity without regenerating existing planets or resetting the exploration and construction efforts of the community. TERRAIN GENERATION The terrain generation algorithm has been evolved and refined to generate more diverse planetary shapes, with mountains, deep valleys, and sprawling plains. Specific improvements have been made to reduce repeating patterns on individual planets, increasing the range of different shapes and terrain styles seen on a single world. Other improvements include the ability to generate significantly deeper oceans. These new terrain settings have been applied to all planets found within purple star systems. Terrain in existing systems has not been regenerated, and bases have not been reset. On all planets in all systems, large resource deposits can now appear underwater. NEW WORLDS Planets found in purple-class star systems feature a significant range of new environments and planetary characteristics. Find gas giant planets, with their hostile planet-wide storms and challenging conditions. These titans dominate the collection of moons found in their orbit, warping the effects of gravity. Other planets are totally dominated by water, with seas that dwarf even their highest mountains. Specialist aquatic landing technology will be required to land upon such a waterworld. These worlds feature exceptionally deep oceans, stretching down kilometres. Find rare non-gas giants, colossal worlds on a scale never before seen. Non-waterworld planets in purple-class star systems may also feature extremely deep water alongside their conventional terrestrial features. Moons in purple-class star systems can now feature water. Gas giants and waterworlds have their own unique and valuable terrain deposit materials, as well as new atmospheric gases to harvest. All planets in purple-class star systems feature deposits of Quartzite, a new stellar mineral. New refining crafting recipes have been added to take advantage of these new materials. WATER RENDERING Surface water rendering has been significantly improved, with a large increase in fidelity. Clouds, nebulae, and other planets are now correctly reflected in the water surface. Terrain reflections have been improved with accurate lighting and fogging effects. Subsurface scattering has been enhanced, creating spectacular glows when the sun’s light grazes the crest of a wave. Wave foam rendering has been enhanced. Wave foam now benefits from a greater range of colours. In rare circumstances, wave foam now pulsates with strange and alien effects. Underwater rendering has been entirely reworked to feature accurate light scattering and transmittance, creating realistic and atmospheric deep water environments. Support has been added for underwater crepuscular rays as light shimmers through the surface. Water caustic effects have been significantly improved. In rare circumstances, water can now settle into absolutely tranquility, creating a perfectly still surface. Rain will now generate tiny ripples in the water surface. Other objects – such as creatures, starships, vehicles, Travellers, and weapon systems – will also generate dynamic water effects as they move through the surface. WATER VARIETY Significant new levels of environmental diversity have been added to the seas of all planets, including those in non-purple systems. The water environment has been enriched with a range of new effects, coming to life with bubbles, algae blooms, bioluminescent organisms, strange floating flora, and much more. Additional levels of environmental diversity are to be found in the deepest oceans… DEEP WATER GAMEPLAY Swimming into deep water now has additional hazard effects, including an increased rate of oxygen consumption, increased strain on life support systems, and magnified planetary hazards. A new technology has been added, the Pressure Membrane, which can be installed to offset some of the harmful effects of deep water. The baseline amount of time a player can breathe underwater has been increased. The bonuses provided by water breathing upgrades have been increased. A valuable new item, Seaglass, has been added to ultra-deep water. Find ultra-rich terrain deposits in the deepest waters, material seams with exceptionally high yields. SWIMMING AND BUOYANCY The player now responds accurately to the waves, gently bobbing in the water or being thrown around in a storm. The swimming camera has been significantly improved, responding to the water state as well as player actions. Fixed a number of popping and jerkiness issues with the swimming camera. Fixed a number of visual glitches with player swimming animations. Improved the responsiveness of player movement while swimming. The camera now allows a much greater range of movement while underwater. The depth of the sea floor beneath the player’s position is now displayed on the HUD. Jetpacking straight up to ascend to the surface of the water now uses less jetpack fuel than boosting horizontal speed. The jetpack’s water ascent speed has been increased. When underwater, the player torch now behaves as a volumetric light. The player torch is now more stable and consistent in its position, avoiding casting a bright light on the back or arm as you run. Fixed an issue that could cause the player to drop to the bottom of the ocean if a popup appeared while they were swimming. Fixed an issue that could cause the normal jetpack effects to play while underwater. MISSIONS A significant new chain of story-driven missions have been added, “In Stellar Multitudes”. Work with the Autophage to uncover stories of the Atlas and Atlantid, and weave together time and space on an epic adventure to recover that which was lost… A new multiplayer fishing mission has been added to the Nexus. A new procedurally generated fishing mission has been added to the Space Station mission listings. Fixed an issue that could prevent the Atlas Path from being displayed within the Collected Knowledge catalogue on very old saves. Fixed a number of issues that could lead to a blocker in the Space Anomaly mission when players have no discoveries to present to Helios. Fixed a rare issue that could lead to two copies of the Atlas Eternal mission running at the same time. Fixed a number of issues that could lead to two copies of the Space Anomaly mission running after completing an expedition. PLANETARY VARIETY Planetary variety and diversity has been increased all across the universe. Dense jungle worlds can now be found all across the universe. New desolate desert worlds can now be found all across the universe. Rare and strange ruined relic worlds can now be found all across the universe. These new worlds have been added to both existing systems and the new purple-class star systems, but in such a way as to minimise change to existing worlds. The diversity and variety of hazardous flora on all worlds has been increased. On top of this, significant additional planetary diversity can be found in purple-class star systems. A large number of new procedurally generated varieties of scorched, frozen, toxic and barren worlds have been introduced, as well as additional variety for worlds featuring floating islands. A new resource, polished stone, has been added to relic planets. Players who search the ruins of relic planets may uncover plans to construct replica ruins of their own. Planetary weather hazards such as lightning and tornadoes have been reworked for additional visual impact. Additional localised planetary hazards have been where appropriate, providing both visual diversity and additional exploration challenge. Hazards included localised clouds of toxic spores; small-scale radioactive fallout; electromagnetic anomalies; volcanic eruptions; geothermal geysers; and localised gravity inversion zones. COOKING Cronus now maintains a market aboard the Space Anomaly. Each day, they will seek a different range of edible items. Travellers may donate large amounts of these items at a time, in exchange for nanites and esteem. When presenting food to Cronus for judging, the options available will always include your highest-quality food. Cronus’ station aboard the Space Anomaly now has a functional grill available. The Exo-Skiff now has a functioning grill for mid-sea cookery. The recipe catalogue has been overhauled. The catalogue is now sorted by output item, and variant recipes can be viewed by expanding the main recipe. Recipe names are now presented more clearly in the catalogue. The recipe catalogue now allows access to a crafting-tree style view of any recipe, allowing intermediate steps to be seen more clearly. As well as in the catalogue, these recipe details are also available while using the Nutrient Processor. Filter options have been added to sort ingredients by quality while browsing ingredients to place into the Nutrient Processor. The Nutrient Processor’s ingredient storage can now be accessed at any time while nearby. Procedurally generated tasting notes have been added to the descriptions of edible products. A new Exosuit technology has been added, the Nutrient Ingestor. Once installed in the Exosuit, the Ingestor allows players to input large amounts of edible items, which will be consumed one at a time as necessary, providing powerful and long-lasting benefits. TITAN EXPEDITION Expedition Seventeen, Titan, will begin shortly after the conclusion of the redux edition of the Cursed Expedition and will run for approximately six weeks. This expedition invites players to explore the beauty and the danger of the new planets and stars added in Worlds Part II. Rewards include new posters; a dazzling new starship customisation material; an explorer’s cape; the Pillar of Titan staff; and the Wraith starship, a unique living fighter. EXOCRAFT The Colossus has been made easier to interact with. Fixed an issue that caused the player to be placed underneath or inside the Colossus when disembarking. Added the Mineral Processing Rig, an advanced refining unit that can be installed within the Colossus. Added the Mounted Flamethrower, a new short-range weapon for all Exocraft. Fixed a number of issues that caused technology to be categorised incorrectly when installing items in Exocraft. Exocraft handling in first person, particularly when controlled with a pad, has been significantly improved. The seating position within each Exocraft has been adjusted to improve visibility in first person. When driving in first person, the steering wheel and throttle within the Exocraft cockpit now respond accurately to player inputs. The Exocraft speed display now outputs in kilometres per hour rather than meters per second. Specific “dive” and “surface” control options have been added to the Nautilon submarine. The base speed and manoeuverability of the Nautilon submarine has been increased. The upper limit of the strongest Humboldt Drive upgrades has been tweaked slightly to compensate. Fixed an issue that caused the Nautilon to slowly rise or sink by itself. A Dredging Laser has been added for the Nautilon Submarine, allowing underwater terrain excavation. The Nautilon can now activate a short boost to reach higher speeds, similar to other Exocraft. No technology upgrade is required to access boost in the Nautilon. An alternative Floating Nautilon Platform has been added, allowing construction of a Nautilon chamber on the surface of the water. CREATURES New types of procedurally-generated fish have been added and may appear in any seas. New types of procedurally-generated squid have been added and may appear in any seas. New types of procedurally-generated hermit crabs have been added and may appear in any seas. New types of procedurally-generated manta rays have been added and may appear in any seas. New types of procedurally-generated seahorses have been added and may appear in any seas. New types of procedurally-generated prawns have been added and may appear in any seas. Particularly large versions of sea creatures can be found in the deepest oceans. New types of strange and exotic creatures have been added and can be found on planets in purple-class star systems. New types of bioluminescent creatures have been added and can be found on planets in purple-class star systems. Creature navigation systems have been improved, allowing creatures to better select and reach destinations such as food or water sources. Ragdoll and death effects for underwater creatures have been improved. ABANDONED MODE A new option has been added to the difficulty settings that allows players to remove all advanced alien life from the universe. This option is only available when starting a new custom game, and cannot be changed once a save is in progress. This option drastically changes the play experience and will disable the story and tutorial. STARSHIP AND MULTI-TOOL ARCHIVING Players with a capital ship can now make use of long-term storage for their starships. Find the starship archive at the fleet management terminal on the bridge of your freighter. Archive up to 18 starships, in addition to your active fleet. Archiving a ship removes it from your list of available starships, freeing up space to acquire new ships. Archived ships can be reactivated from cold storage at any time, as long as there is space in your active fleet. Archived ships retain their installed technology but will be purged of all loose cargo. The buildable Weapon Rack base part now serves as a point of access for Multi-Tool archiving. Archive up to 18 Multi-Tools, in addition to your carried equipment. Archiving a Multi-Tool removes it from your list of available equipment, freeing up space to acquire new Multi-Tools. Archived Multi-Tools retain all installed technology and can be reactivated at any time, as long as you have space to carry them. FISHING A new array of fish have been added to waterworlds and gas giants. Players may now fish in the moonpool of their underwater base. Players may now occasionally catch a Child of Aquarius. Release this strange creature to attract the attention of a Deepwater Guardian… New titles have been added for players who reach significant fishing milestones. A collection of unusual customisation options have been added for players who reach significant fishing milestones. Apply these cranium/aquarium interchanges at an Appearance Modifier. The float used in your fishing rig can now be customised. Apply these options from the Bait menu. The colour of your fishing line can now be customised. There it is.  Now to figure out how to even grasp all of that along with the many bits I left out.",
