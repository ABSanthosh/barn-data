  "text": "‘A Minecraft Movie’ has proved that everyone yearns for the mines – not just the children. Now that the film based on the best-selling video game of all time is a smash-hit success, Minecraft players new and old might be wondering how they can recreate iconic movie moments in their own worlds – or maybe just run around yelling “I am Steve!” Thankfully, we have the answers (well, apart from the “I am Steve!” one – you can probably just do that for yourself). Read on to find out: Taming a Wolf If you want to be like Steve, taming a wolf has to be your first task. Unfortunately, it’s not so easy – you’ll need bones to feed a wild wolf, and the easiest way to get those is by killing skeletons. But if you don’t want to risk life and limb fighting skeletons all night, there’s another, much safer way to get them – go fishing! Finding a Village Many Minecraft players start their journey by building houses from common materials like dirt and wood. But if you want to step up your game like Steve does in ‘A Minecraft Movie’, you’re going to want to find a real village to call your own. After all, villagers make great neighbors. There are many ways to find a village. One thing to remember is, in most worlds, you generally won’t have to wander too far from your initial spawn point. But if you’re really feeling lost, you can always use Creative Mode to fly around without a care. Venturing to the Nether One of the pivotal moments in ‘A Minecraft Movie’ occurs when Steve enters the Nether for the first time. Players who are looking to live dangerously can do the same as soon as they find some diamonds and iron in their Minecraft worlds. Using iron to make buckets, you can pour water on lava to create obsidian. Then craft a diamond pickaxe to mine that obsidian, build it into a five-by-four rectangle, and ignite the center using flint and steel (“Flint and steel!”). Ruined portals can also be found, just like you might have seen in the movie. Getting Elytra and Firework Rockets If you’ve seen ‘A Minecraft Movie’, you’re probably interested in recreating the thrilling elytra flight using firework rockets to propel you at breakneck speeds. Fireworks are easy enough to craft using gunpowder from Creepers and paper crafted from sugarcane. But finding your own elytra is a different story – you’ll need to locate a stronghold in the overworld, jump through the portal to the End, defeat the Ender Dragon, and venture out to distant End islands until you find an End City. Easier said than done – but it’s worth the effort once you’re flying through the sky. If you’d like to skip straight to the flying, you can take a sneak peek at the new happy ghast in Minecraft’s upcoming game drop. Curious about how the ghast became happy? Check them out in our most recent Minecraft Live broadcast! Chicken, Creeper, and More Farms ‘A Minecraft Movie’ showcases some of the different farms that players might build in their Minecraft worlds. For example, Steve’s lava chicken cooker is based on a real contraption that uses Minecraft items including a dispenser, chicken eggs, and a bucket full of lava to automatically hatch, cook, and harvest chickens. Likewise, the “Creeper farm” that the movie characters venture through on their minecart ride is a useful build for players who need lots of gunpowder – if, say, they wanted to craft a lot of fireworks for some reason (wink). If you want to build these in your own world, the Minecraft community has created countless wonderful, in-depth tutorials on YouTube and elsewhere. Applying Official A Minecraft Movie Marketplace Content For those who don’t just want to recreate ‘A Minecraft Movie’ moments in their worlds, but want to really live them, the Minecraft Marketplace has several movie-inspired downloadable items – and the best part is that they’re all free. A Minecraft Movie: Add-On and Lava Chicken Add-On can be applied to any world, including existing ones, to bring items and entities from the movie into your game; while A Minecraft Movie DLC is a full-on standalone movie-themed adventure. Of course, you can always simply download A Minecraft Movie Hero Pack to play as Steve, Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison, and the other movie characters in any Minecraft world. ‘A Minecraft Movie’ is in theaters worldwide now.",
