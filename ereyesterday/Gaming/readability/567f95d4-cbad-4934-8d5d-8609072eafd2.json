Anyway, last week we got an update on the 2025 roadmap update which Orion assures us is “jam packed” with stuff mid-year. Version 2 of the LOTRO 2025 Roadmap I mean, I guess I can applaud them for not cluttering it up with a bunch of trivia, but they could still learn a thing or three about roadmaps from the RuneScape team. I’ll leave aside the “…and more!” aspect, which is BS and should have been removed before this saw the light of day… if you have more, you say what it is… and will move on to what they do say they have.  Oh, you have two new 64-bit servers showing up?  Maybe put it on the update?  Or just keep burying the lede… I’ll just keep complaining. Going in order, the new content pack… is fine.  Something to sell.  Probably not something for me… but I am a VIP so I should get it anyway, right? The 18th anniversary… again, fine.  I will get another gift box in game, hopefully with something useful in it… or interesting… or fun. More cosmetics to buy.  Good.  The engines of commerce must be fed constantly. And then we arrive at the VIP Exclusive: Favoured Standing Updates.  That affects me!  Better quote the details, such that they are, in full! Update 44 also adds the VIP-only Favoured Standing Reputation enhancement extended to nearly all the Reputations throughout the game. Introduced as a feature only accessible to VIP players who purchased The Legacy of Morgoth expansion, this feature will soon be accessible to all VIP players across the game, starting with the earliest reputations in The Shire, Ered Luin, or Bree-land and extending through The Legacy of Morgoth. This enhancement allows alternate characters on an account to earn reputation with the myriad reputation factions at an accelerated rate, provided one of their characters has greater standing with the faction. Wait, I already bought The Legacy of Morgoth expansion… didn’t I? I mean, I buy all the expansions as soon as they are available in the in-game store… so does that mean I already have this?  Or was it just for pre-orders?  Okay, maybe that was more confusing than exciting.  It certainly didn’t seem to be helping me in Forochel. Then there is the Midsummerfest update… holidays will holiday. It is when we move to Q3 that I start to become concerned, because they are proposing class updates for the hunter and the burglar. SSG does not have a sterling reputation when it comes to revising classes and this seems like a pretty ominous warning for me.  I am enjoying playing a hunter in my most recent assault on Middle-earth and one thing that could really put a stop to it is SSG nerfing the hunter into oblivion in the name of fun and balance.  The lamentations of players after past class updates is setting the mood here… that and SSG’s persistent failure to learn from past mistakes, a tradition going back to beta. That is potential future trouble, so I had best make hay while the sun shines. Speaking of learning issues, then there are hobby updates… maybe they will make birding a thing this time. Wrapping up Q3 is the farmer’s faire and something about monster play.  I have not once in 18 years of coming and going from the game touched monster play. Finally, there is the Q4 entry, which is the annual expansion we were all expecting.  SSG has decided that they need 10 levels and some overland zones to get people to buy in, so that is what we’re getting.  Somehow the LOTRO team has never quite gotten a firm hold on decent horizontal or even a parallel vertical progression mechanic that can replace the love of levels that lives deep in the hearts of players… though only the EverQuest team has really managed that in a levels focused game… so more levels it is! The new level cap will be 160.  That isn’t any sort of record.  I think Lineage II has a level cap in the 400s now, doesn’t it?  But 160 is still a lot and their Curse of the Valar insta-levels program is both expensive and not very useful the last time I tried it on. As for the zones, we’ll have to see where we end up.  Are we headed further south?  Desert zones next? In addition to all of that, there are two new 64-bit servers launching, the whole 64-bit server thing having become a bit of a phenomena.  From the short update: We’re launching two additional 64-bit servers—Grond (EU) on April 9th and Sting (US) shortly thereafter! Due to popular demand, we’re pleased to announce the addition of two brand-new 64-bit servers! Grond (EU) will officially open Wednesday, April 9th, while Sting (US) will launch in the following weeks. Exact dates for Sting (US) will be announced soon, so stay tuned. The new Grond (EU) server will open to VIP gameplay on Wednesday, April 9th at 2:00 PM Eastern (-4 GMT). Following that, Grond (EU) will open for to all for play and transfers starting at 3:00 PM Eastern (-4 GMT). Free character transfers from both 32-bit and other 64-bit EU worlds to Grond (EU) will become available at 3:00 PM Eastern (-4 GMT). All housing will be open for immediate claiming when the server goes live for VIPs at 2:00 PM Eastern (-4 GMT). The transfer policy has yet to be solidified, but will be in the FAQ at some point.
