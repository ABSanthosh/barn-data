  "description": "Mods were a core part of the experience for PC players with the original Oblivion, adding thousands of community-made updates, fixes, and full-blown expansions. In Oblivion Remastered, mods are not officially supported by Bethesda, so there's no creation kit for players on consoles to download mods. However, mods for the remaster are still fully available and actively being developed by the community. While the modding scene for Oblivion Remastered only features a few hundred mods at the time of writing, that won't be the case for too long. Modders will continue to work on new mods and even attempt to port over mods that were made for the original Oblivion. For the time being, though, we have come up with a list of the best mods you can download for Oblivion Remastered right now. These mods are in no particular order, and we've tried to cover a wide range of areas with our selections. You can see a full walkthrough of how to download mods in Oblivion Remastered in our previous guide. Ultimate Engine TweaksCreated by: VP40L0If you're plugged into the Bethesda RPG modding scene at all, you knew this one was coming. The Ultimate Engine Tweaks mod is always one of the most popular and useful mods for any Bethesda game, and the same is true in Oblivion Remastered. This mod tweaks the game engine to remove a large majority of stutters, improve latency, and increase overall performance. All of this is accomplished without any downgrade to visual fidelity. Carry Weight ModifierCreated by: ErokNext up is another classic RPG mod. The Carry Weight Modifier mod allows you to drastically reduce the weight of the items currently in your inventory. The way this mod works in Oblivion Remastered is that it makes your lockpicks weigh -150 pounds. According to the mod creator, this is done due to how the engine is set up. So, in order to make use of this mod, you'll need to always ensure you have at least one lockpick in your inventory. The more lockpicks you have, the more weight you can carry. No Item DegradationCreated by: ErokFollowing the Carry Weight Modifier mod is another quality-of-life mod called No Item Degradation. This mod does exactly what it says it does; it makes it so that all of your weapons and armor don't degrade the more you use them. This essentially cuts out the need for blacksmiths and repair hammers in Oblivion Remastered, giving you one less thing to worry about when you're traveling across Cyrodiil. This doesn't apply to enchantment degradation, though, so you'll still need some Soul Gems to recharge your enchanted weapons. Difficulty Slider FixedCreated by: IxionXVIIIf you've tried to play Oblivion Remastered at some of the higher difficulty levels, you may have noticed that combat is extremely unforgiving. Enemies hit way harder than you expect them to and your damage barely seems to affect them, regardless of what weapon you're using. With the Difficulty Slider Fixed mod, you can take out the strict difficulty levels and instead use a slider system. This allows you to customize the damage taken and damage dealt multipliers to be more in line with what you expect. Now, the Master difficulty level feels much more forgiving compared to how it works by default. Weightless Alchemy and Misc. ItemsCreated by: ExalderanThis mod falls in line with the Carry Weight Modifier mod, but it offers a different experience. If you don't want to worry about your carry weight entirely but still don't want useful items clogging up your capacity, then the Weightless Alchemy and Misc. Items mod is what you want. This mod brings the carrying weight of several items down to zero. The items include arrows, alchemy items, potions, books, soul gems, and other miscellaneous loot you might pick up. Your weapons and armor still weigh their normal amount, but you no longer have to stress about picking up too many arrows or brewing too many potions. Richer VendorsCreated by: ErokIf you've ever gone to a merchant in Oblivion Remastered with a ton of valuable loot to sell but the vendor didn't have enough gold to cover the sale, then the Richer Vendors mod is one you should download. This mod gives all merchants across Cyrodiil the ability to hold 10x their normal gold amount. This means all merchants will have at least 1,000 gold to spend on all of the loot you want to offer them. Horse Whistle - Summon and FollowCreated by: PushTheWinButtonBuying a horse is a rite of passage in Oblivion Remastered. They're certainly not the cheapest thing you can purchase in Cyrodiil, but having one makes your life much easier. Unfortunately, the game doesn't offer a traditional way to summon your horse or issue it any commands. Fortunately, the Horse Whistle mod implements just that, giving you the ability to whistle for your horse. When you use the power, your horse will either teleport to you if it's farther away or slowly walk over to you. You can also make the horse follow you by using the power in conjunction with the waiting mechanic. The Horse Whistle mod only works when you're outside of a city's gates. Less Restrictive Spells and Utility SpellsCreated by: Oblivion6871If you're playing as a mage or simply want to use magicka from time to time in Oblivion Remastered, you'll immediately notice there are quite a few restrictions on spellcasting. The Less Restrictive Spells and Utility Spells mod aims to rectify that, allowing all magic effects to be made available when casting a spell or enchanting an item. You need to have the spell effect learned already, though. The mod also allows you to spellcast and enchant anywhere you want and increases the summon limit to 10, giving you the ability to unleash a horde of minions on enemies. Finally, the mod adds a few utility spells to the game as well, such as True Invisibility, Master Key, and more. Oblivion Remastered High Quality MusicCreated by: DEEJMASTER 333While the music in Oblivion Remastered is extremely well done, it can always be improved. The Oblivion Remastered High Quality Music mod replaces the current audio files in the remaster with HD MP3s from the official soundtrack, making the music sound much crisper and clearer. The audio files in use are of the \"highest quality\" according to the mod creator, and nearly all of the music in the game is replaced with the HD versions. If you're simply looking for a way to increase the game's fidelity, this mod is a great starting point. Classic Oblivion Color GradingCreated by: WickedzzThe team behind Oblivion Remastered did an absolutely phenomenal job of updating the game's graphics to look much clearer and more modern. However, if you're still in love with the old, more vibrant color palette of the original Oblivion, you can download the Classic Oblivion Color Grading mod. This replaces all of the new landscapes, which are slightly duller in color, with the landscapes of old that feature a much brighter palette. The mod certainly brings back waves of nostalgia as you're traveling through the various roads of Cyrodiil and seeing all of the classic yellow and green colors from the original game.",

They\u0026#39;re certainly not the cheapest thing you can purchase in Cyrodiil, but having one makes your life much easier. Unfortunately, the game doesn\u0026#39;t offer a traditional way to summon your horse or issue it any commands. Fortunately, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/153\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow  \"\u003eHorse Whistle mod\u003c/a\u003e implements just that, giving you the ability to whistle for your horse. When you use the power, your horse will either teleport to you if it\u0026#39;s farther away or slowly walk over to you. You can also make the horse follow you by using the power in conjunction with the waiting mechanic. The Horse Whistle mod only works when you\u0026#39;re outside of a city\u0026#39;s gates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-item-position-url=\"#9\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1745/17457013/4482288-less.jpg\" alt=\"Less Restrictive Spells and Utility Spells\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3\u003eLess Restrictive Spells and Utility Spells\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreated by: \u003c/strong\u003eOblivion6871\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re playing as a mage or simply want to use magicka from time to time in Oblivion Remastered, you\u0026#39;ll immediately notice there are quite a few restrictions on spellcasting.

You need to have the spell effect learned already, though. The mod also allows you to spellcast and enchant anywhere you want and increases the summon limit to 10, giving you the ability to unleash a horde of minions on enemies. Finally, the mod adds a few utility spells to the game as well, such as True Invisibility, Master Key, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-item-position-url=\"#10\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1745/17457013/4482289-muasic.jpg\" alt=\"Oblivion Remastered High Quality Music\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3\u003eOblivion Remastered High Quality Music\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreated by: \u003c/strong\u003eDEEJMASTER 333\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the music in Oblivion Remastered is extremely well done, it can always be improved.
