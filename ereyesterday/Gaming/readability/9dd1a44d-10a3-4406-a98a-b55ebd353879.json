In our recent Legion Tower 7 review (the sample we received wasn't as powerful as this one), Jacqueline Thomas wrote that \"The Legion Tower 7i is an incredibly powerful gaming PC, especially for the money you’re likely going to be paying for it. If all you want is a powerful, upgradeable machine without having to go through the trouble of building it yourself, it’s hard to find many gaming PCs better than this one.\"Lenovo Legion Tower 7i Gen 8 RTX 4080 Super Gaming PCLenovo Legion Tower 7i Intel Core i9-14900KF RTX 4080 Super Gaming PC with 32GB RAM, 1TB SSDApply second code: BUYMORELENOVO (may be auto applied)The Lenovo Legion Tower 7i Gen 8 is equipped with an Intel Core i9-14900KF CPU, GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER GPU, 32GB of DDR5-4000MHz RAM, and a 2TB PCIe NVMe SSD. The unlocked 14th gen Intel Core i9-14900KF Raptor Lake \"Refresh\" CPU boasts a max Turbo clock of 6GHz with 24 cores, 32 threads, and a 36MB cache. It's still one of the most powerful Intel CPUs available (in many cases it even beats out the new Intel Core Ultra 9 285K). It's cooled by a robust 360mm all-in-one liquid cooling system that rivals many enthusiast setups.The RTX 4080 Super is Nvidia's second most powerful RTX 40 series card. You'll be able to handle any game in 4K at high frame rates, even with ray tracing enabled. It's 5-10% faster in performance than the RTX 4080 thanks to its higher base clock speed, higher CUDA core count, and higher memory bandwidth. It trades blows with AMD's most powerful GPU, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, but the RTX 4080 Super pulls ahead in ray tracing performance and where DLSS 3.0 is supported. It's nearly identical in performance to the new RTX 5080 GPU and also has the same amount of VRAM. Why Choose Lenovo?Lenovo Legion gaming PCs and laptops generally feature better and more rugged build quality than what you'd find from most other prebuilt PCs. For desktop PCs in particular, people like the fact that Lenovo does not use many proprietary components in their rigs, so the PCs are much easier to upgrade with easiy obtainable, off-the-shelf parts. For laptops, Lenovo generally does not throttle the GPU on most of their Legion laptops, so you should expect maximum performance from a given GPU. Lenovo generally includes a solid 1 year warranty with the option to extend.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
