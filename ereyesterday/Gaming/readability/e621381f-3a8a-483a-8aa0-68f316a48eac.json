Silver Tempest is in a unique position right now, with single card prices soaring and stock set to run out by the end of 2025. It's also one of the cheapest sets to collect right now, with Elite Trainer Boxes dipping just below £40 at Amazon and Zavvi. But why Silver Tempest specifically? Let's look at the insane pulls this Sword and Shield era expansion delivers.UK Deals: I'm Buying Silver Tempest Before It Goes Out Of StockLugia V 186/195 (Alt Art)Credit: The Pokémon Company / Creatures IncThis is hands down the best Lugia Pokémon card out there; look at that amazing artwork! Whilst being playable to quickly get through a deck, this is one for the collectors. Lugia V Alt Art is starting to climb in value, from around £150 on the secondary market at the end of 2024 to around the £230 mark at the time of writing. There's every chance to still pull one of these bad boys in Silver Tempest products on store shelves right now.Rayquaza VMAX TG20/TG30 (Trainer Gallery)Credit: The Pokémon Company / Creatures Inc.Honourable Silver Tempest Mentions- Lugia VSTAR 202/195 (Rainbow Rare)- Unown V 177/195 (Alt Art)- Regidrago V 184/195 (Alt Art)- Trainer Gallery Cards, the artwork is stunning on them allTrainer Gallery cards are still very cheap for the most part (usually under £5), so I'd highly recommend picking them up. They're stunning, and their value will only climb as time goes on. Plus, they're so fun to collect. Rayquaza Vmax is stunning, rocking its Dragon Clan routes whilst considering how massive this Pokémon is. This card has nearly tripled in value from the back end of 2024, with sold listings from December going for as low as £25. Most recent sales are going for between £60 to £80, and I don't see that price getting any cheaper as 2025 progresses.Pokemon TCG: Sword \u0026 Shield 12 Silver Tempest Elite Trainer BoxPokémon TCG: Sword \u0026 Shield—Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box8 booster packs of Silver Tempest, Alolan Vulpix sleeves, dice, damage counters, and a cool box to store your bulk are a solid deal for £39.99. Unfortunately, this is the dark times before every ETB has a cool promo card, but it's still a sweet deal. It's also probably a good idea to keep one sealed if you're a collector; the value for these will certainly rise as stock runs out in stores. Pokémon Sword \u0026 Shield—Silver Tempest Build \u0026 Battle Stadium Pokémon Sword \u0026 Shield—Silver Tempest Build \u0026 Battle Stadium For an extra £20 over the Silver Tempest ETB, trainers can snag 12 booster packs, two 40-card build and battle decks, extra energy cards, damage counter dice, coins, and status markers. There's also a foil promo card. It's certainly worth the extra few quid to pony up. It is perfect for trainers wanting everything they need to start battling with one handy product. Pokémon Silver Tempest Triple Pack Pokémon Silver Tempest Triple PackLooking for cheap Silver Tempest pulls? The triple booster blister packs are a good deal at £12.99, with a cool promo card and game-legal coin to sweeten the deal. Buying three will get you one extra booster over elite trainer boxes for £1 less. If you're not bothered about the ETB swag, this one's for you.Pokemon TCG: Sword \u0026 Shield 12 Silver Tempest Elite Trainer BoxPokemon TCG: Sword \u0026 Shield 12 Silver Tempest Elite Trainer BoxUse Code \"POKE20\" for 20% off Pokémon TCGAn honourable mention goes to Zavvi as they've got a sale going this weekend with 20% off in-stock Pokémon TCG products. This brings down the Silver Tempest ETB to the same price as Amazon, but adding more products to your basket means a solid deal for any trainers looking to stock up on other Scarlet and Violet boxed products.Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
