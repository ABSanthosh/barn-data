  "text": "K!CHIN explores the life of a former dinosaur criminal trying to walk a clean path by making custom shirts for people. In this game, you play as Din Dino, who is now no longer apart of the mob. The thing about being a part of a mob at any point in time, however, is that you never really leave the mob. Your current passion is t-shirt making – an honest living – until your past comes back to haunt you. As much as you want to just focus on t-shirts, there are debts to be paid and your previous work colleagues know exactly where you are. In K!CHIN, you spend time worrying about yourself and creating the things your clients want. In the front of the shop, you can get to know different characters and progress the story. Once you have an order, you can move to the back of the shop to try to fulfil it. At the back of the shop, you are able to pick different pictures and phrases to put on your t-shirt, along with their size and color. These designs have different categories related to them so that you can make the shirt that has been ordered. If someone wants something Anime, you can use the Anime items, for example. Often it’s more vague and you need to understand what they mean to get out the right shirt. Then, you need to heat the design so that it sticks to the t-shirt. This is a fun little mini-game that adds another stage of gameplay. Creating the t-shirt in K!CHIN is quite fun and following the story is very interesting. There is a lot of money you need to make back in a short amount of time to pay of your debt, so it’s a challenge! I only got to play the intro at Indie Dev Day, but I really enjoyed what I saw. K!CHIN is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
