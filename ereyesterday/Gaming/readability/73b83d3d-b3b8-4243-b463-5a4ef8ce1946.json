  "text": "\"See Pandora like never before...\"At D23 Brazil, new concept art was revealed for Avatar: Fire \u0026 Ash that gives fans a look at thew new fire and air tribes that will feature in this third film set to be released in theaters on December 19, 2025.The concept art, which is by Dylan Cole, Zachary Berger, and Steve Messing, showcases flying vehicles, gorgeous vistas, Ikran, a village that looks to belong to these fire/ash Na'vi, the beautiful ocean at night, a character whose hands are bound, and more. Avatar: Fire \u0026 Ash Concept ArtAs reported by @cinepop (via @DiscussingFilm), these Ash People are a \"reflection of the worst side of Na'vi.\"\"We have a lot of anger and a lot of rage in the world we live in right now,\" Cameron said.Cameron revealed the name of Avatar: Fire \u0026 Ash back at Anaheim's D23, and he also shared he'll direct both Avatar 4 and 5 unless he's \"hit by a bus.\" While we are still waiting for our first look at footage of this film, Cameron did say this is an \"insane adventure that also has high emotional stakes, more than ever before. We are going into challenging territories. There are new characters, and one you’ll love to hate. New cultures and settings and biomes and more of Pandora.\"Avatar: The Way of Water was released in late 2022 and we said it was \"a clear improvement on its predecessor and, though its story isn’t breaking new ground, its jaw-dropping visuals make this an irresistible return to Pandora.\" It also became the sixth film in history to earn $2 billion at the global box office.Have a tip for us?
