FragPunk‘s signature feature is an innovative card system known as Shard Cards, powerful gameplay modifiers which enhance suspense and tactical diversity during every match, which are designed to disrupt traditional first-person shooter gameplay, offering a fresh experience for both novice and advanced players. Creating Unexpected Dynamics The idea of incorporating a card system into a first-person shooter (FPS) was influenced by sports regulations. Chang Xin, the producer of FragPunk, is a tremendous fan of sports. He believes that the continuous reforms in those rules aim to enhance suspense and uncertainty, boosting viewer engagement. For instance, the popular King’s League in Europe introduces item-based elements to soccer, successfully adding diversity and excitement to the game. Chang Xin recognized that even in a sport like soccer, which demands a high degree of fairness, randomness could enhance the viewer experience, revealing a significant untapped market. This resembled the competitive FPS genre, where games strive for competitive balance and tactics, often leading to repetitive gameplay. Chang Xin recognized that a lack of suspense in traditional FPS designs has resulted in predictable matches where stronger players dominate consistently. In FragPunk, the creation of Shard Cards aims to inject unexpected dynamics into FPS gameplay, enriching tactical options and strategic depth for all types of players. Building Cards Creating Shard Cards is not without its challenges. The team at Bad Guitar Studio faced challenges about maintaining game balance while introducing new card designs. Initially, the prototype of FragPunk focused on allowing players to alter game rules, resulting in designs closely tied to basic gameplay mechanics. However, this limited the team’s creativity for further card development. Eventually, the team recognized that since the purpose of Shard Cards is to disrupt gameplay, they should not be constrained by existing rules. This shift in mindset led to a more open and imaginative card design process. For example, the “Dimensional Travel” enables all players can travel between two worlds, however, implementing two worlds within level design proved to be quite difficult, so we changed our approach. After using the card, players can become invisible to enemies and are not harmed by them. In fact, they remain in the same map; it’s just that enemies are not visible, achieving the effect of two worlds Balancing Fun and Competition There are concerns that cards might compromise the competitive integrity of the game. However, the design’s primary goal is to enhance suspense and diversify gameplay tactics; to enrich player enjoyment and the FPS experience. Core shooting skills remained, with cards providing unexpected possibilities. Feedback from newer players indicated that the card system introduced a refreshing variety to matches, making outcomes less predictable and enhancing their overall enjoyment. This is crucial for newer players to have a positive gaming experience, contrasting with traditional FPS games where skill disparities often lead to frustration. Moreover, every card is designed and accompanied by a tactical framework, allowing players to create unexpected strategies by combining Shard Cards. For example, players can develop unique card synergies to enhance their gameplay, such as the “Blade Master + Turtleback” combo, which allows blocking bullets from both front and back. In ranked modes, only strategic cards that enhance gameplay are included, maintaining a level of competitiveness and fairness through a ban-pick system that encourages strategic counterplay. Breaking the Rules While various game modes are available, FragPunk’s core experience revolves around the bomb defusal mode named Shard Clash. The design team aimed to innovate within this beloved FPS subgenre by introducing cards that revolutionize traditional gameplay mechanics. For attackers, cards like “Mission Bound” grant invincibility while planting, and “Throw to Plant” enables automatic planting by throwing the converter into the objective — transformative effects that could drastically alter existing tactical frameworks in standard bomb defusal games. With the Shard Card system, FPS game rules are broken no two matches in FragPunk are alike, contributing to a unique gaming experience.
