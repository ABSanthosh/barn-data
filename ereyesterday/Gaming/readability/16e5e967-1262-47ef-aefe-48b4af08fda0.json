  "text": "We’re more than halfway through 2025, making it an excellent time to revisit our list of the best of what the PlayStation 5 has to offer. We've added several new games this time – which means a few old favorites got bumped. (We still love them, though!)But what do we mean by “best?” To be very clear, this is not an attempt at an “objective” ranking that will indisputably line up with the tastes of gamers of all types. That, sadly, cannot exist; when one person’s epic RPG masterpiece is another’s boring and impenetrable slog, they’ll never see eye to eye on where that game should rank against others of different genres. Even the personal lists of two people who love the same types of games will rarely line up exactly.This is not an attempt at an “objective” ranking.Instead, this is a list of games that IGN’s crew of PlayStation gamers recommend as a group, ranked using our Face-Off tool so that everybody got to weigh in equally on which games they thought should be placed above others. It’s presented in the spirit of recognizing games we love, and encouraging others to try them if you haven’t.With only 25 slots to fill, there are tons of amazing recent games that didn’t float to the top – but that doesn’t mean we don’t think they’re awesome, too! Everybody who participated in voting has tons of personal favorites that didn’t gain quite enough traction with the group to make the cut, which is inevitable when there are this many games and so many different perspectives.Bear in mind that while the PS5 is a powerhouse that can play any PlayStation 4-compatible game, for the sake of clarity our criteria for this list narrowed the pool down to focus on games that have PlayStation 5-specific versions. So while we still love games like the 2016 Doom, God of War, Minecraft, Red Dead Redemption 2, and many, many more, until they get that update they're relegated to the PS4 list – and of course many will have a spot on our list of the Top 100 Games of All Time.Most importantly, remember that this list is just our group’s perspective and is no more “right” or “wrong” than a list that you create yourself. Speaking of which: if you have your own ranking you’d like to put out into the world, we’d like to invite you to make your own top 25 (or top 100!) list of PlayStation games using our Playlist tool and share it in the comments. The Best PS5 GamesThe Top 25 PlayStation 5 games, according to voters on IGN staff. Updated on March 28, 2024. Recent games like Helldivers 2, FF7 Rebirth, and Unicord Overlord were not included in the voting just yet!Most recent game updates were made on July 15, 2025.More on the best of PlayStation:Where to buy a PS5Best PS4 GamesBest PS3 Games25. Devil May Cry 5​Even with all of its imitators, there’s still nothing quite like a Devil May Cry game, and Devil May Cry 5 stands tall not only as not only one of the best in its own series but one of the best character action games ever created – full stop. No other game offers the same level of creativity and expression through its combat, whether you’re playing as Nero and bouncing foes around in the air with your Gerbera Devil Breaker, slashing them while precisely timing revs of your sword to charge up your Exceed meter; or chilling out as V while your summoned familiars fight all around you; or hot-swapping between an entire arsenal of weapons and fighting styles as Dante. The depth of DMC5’s combat is near bottomless and endlessly fun to play around in, with finely tuned difficulty options to meet you wherever your skill level is at.24. Returnal​​Returnal is a trailblazer of sorts. Roguelikes have long been one of the most popular genres on the indie scene, with games like Spelunky 2, Dead Cells, Enter the Gungeon, and The Binding of Isaac leading the charge, but we’ve never really seen anything quite like Returnal. Returnal combines Housemarque’s expertise in intense, arcadey bullet hell shoot-em-ups, with deep roguelite mechanics and a dense, chilling atmosphere, resulting in an unforgettable sci-fi experience. Returnal’s one issue on release was the inability to suspend its lengthy runs and save your progress, but since that’s been patched, it’s hard to find flaws in this incredibly bold and ambitious take on the action roguelite.23. Final Fantasy XVI​Final Fantasy 16 may have been a dramatic departure for one of the most well-known and beloved RPG series of all time, moving it closer to the realm of a pure-blooded action game – but that action does not take away away from its excellently told, brilliantly acted, dark, and captivating tale or its memorable characters. Its combat. meanwhile, is best-in-class among other action-RPGs, and is paired with an unbelievable soundtrack that enhances every emotion that it successfully attempts to pull from you. Taken all as a whole, Final Fantasy 16 is a very special game that proves that action games can also be 50-plus-hour-long epics, and that Final Fantasy games can also be action games.22. Horizon Forbidden WestHorizon Forbidden West builds on the already impressive foundations of Horizon Zero Dawn to tell a deeper, more thrilling story that amps up the series’ explosive fights against complex robotic foes and blockbuster action sequences, while also adding lively settlements and thoughtful, intriguing sidequests to the world. The Forbidden West itself is absolutely gorgeous on PS5 - ranging from the incredibly detailed faces of the people you meet and costumes they wear to sweeping and frequently stunning landscapes. There’s a genuine sense of exploration, and loads of completely involving worldbuilding to uncover as well for those wanting to learn more. A triumphant combination of enthralling combat, top-tier creature and character design, and a captivating open world, Horizon Forbidden West is an absolute blast and fantastic showcase for the power of the PS5.21. Star Wars Jedi: SurvivorMuch like the second Star Wars movie, Respawn's second Star Wars Jedi game vaulted over the original. Survivor trusts us with control of a version of Cal Kestis who's now a full-fledged Jedi Knight rather than reverting to a Padawan, so it gets off to a running start and never slows down. Over the course of this adventure he grows into a master of superhuman mobility who can thrive in fantastic and challenging combat using multiple lightsaber styles.With a new set of larger, more diverse, and densely packed worlds to explore and a memorable cast of new and returning characters, Survivor tells a story that may be predictable but is still fun and at times emotional to watch play out. Launch performance issues aside, it’s a sequel that does virtually everything better than the original – which was already an exceptional Star Wars game.20. Like a Dragon: Infinite WealthDescribing Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth sounds a bit like a fever dream: it's a collection of minigames stuffed inside of larger activities inspired by classics like Crazy Taxi, Pokémon Snap, Pokémon, and Animal Crossing… and all of that is wrapped up inside of a life simulator, which is itself inside of a 50-hour turn-based RPG. Miraculously, this somehow all works together and balances honoring the roots of the Like a Dragon/Yakuza series while continuing to propel it forward. This can be seen in almost every aspect, most obviously that a huge portion of the story takes place outside Japan, and instead has you exploring Hawaii.Meanwhile, turn-based combat makes a return from Yakuza 7, boasting even more jobs (tennis ace OP!) and a ton of small refinements that vastly increase the amount of control and customization in combat while remaining true to Yakuza's traditional beat em' up style. In a series known for heartfelt stories, Infinite Wealth’s is arguably the most emotional, paying homage to the franchise’s classic characters with a plot driven by the values and actions of the new cast. Mixing the old and new characters is something that often backfires in a long-running series, but RGG Studios expertly blends Kiryu's and Ichiban's stories, pulling off one of the best legacy stories anywhere.19. Balatro​Like Slay the Spire before it, Balatro is the kind of game you might not see coming, but when it gets its hooks in you and you start to wrap your head around how its many joker cards interact and synergize it might never let go. The fact that this deckbuilding roguelite uses what initially appears to be a standard deck of playing cards means that it’s a fairly easy game to get the basics of if you know anything about poker. However, from there it takes you down rabbit hole after rabbit hole as you figure out how to maximize your score multiplier and specialize your deck to aim for certain types of high-payout hands. Its pixelated 2D graphics set it apart from everything else on this list, but you could very well spend more hours playing it than even the biggest, most expansive RPGs.18. Ghost of Tsushima Directors Cut​​​When Ghost of Tsushima was released on the PlayStation 4, it already felt like a next-gen game thanks to its stunning graphics and impressive map; it was clear Sucker Punch had learned a lot about creating an engaging open world since its (admirable for the time) efforts on the Infamous franchise. But the Director's Cut is the definitive take on Ghost of Tsushima, and it's all the better on the PS5.This robust package, even as a refined PS4 game, makes great use of the DualSense in both exploration and combat. Add in new lip sync for Japanese voice over, and, somehow, visual and performance improvements, and you’ve got what is the must-play version of a must-play PlayStation game.Sucker Punch's next project is a sequel, Ghost of Yotei, and there's a Ghost of Tsushima movie in the works. Directed by Chad Stahleski (John Wick), it will be a retelling of the game's story.17. Alan Wake 2​​Alan Wake II is a standout single-player adventure that seamlessly shifts from slow-burn psychological terror to frantic survival-horror action, from gorgeously rendered game worlds to masterfully directed full-motion video sequences, and from morbid murder investigations to show-stopping musical surprises. It features uniformly immaculate art direction and audio design, and reinvigorates the series’ signature light-based shooting as though it’s been locked and loaded with a fresh pack of Energizers. It’s bloody, it's bonkers, and for the most part it's utterly brilliant.Alan Wake II is a superb survival-horror sequel that makes the cult-classic original seem like little more than a rough first draft by comparison, and it’s genuinely unlike any other adventure currently available on the PlayStation 5.16. Resident Evil 4​Simultaneously one of the newer games on this list and also the oldest, the 2023 remake of 2005’s Resident Evil 4 took everything that made the original a standout action-horror classic and modernized it to thrill present-day gamers just as much as it had those who always saw it through rose-tinted glasses. Rebuilt from the ground up, it builds tension with high-intensity combat against a ferocious cast of creatures and brings the Resident Evil world to life with rich detail as the story rapidly guides you through a series of unwaveringly impressive action sequences. There’ve been many games that have attempted to evoke RE4’s style over the years, but none that nailed it quite as well as this.Related: Capcom has announced Resident Evil Requiem, AKA Resident Evil 9, will be released on February 27, 2026. 15. Cyberpunk 2077Cyberpunk 2077 has earned a spot on our Best PS5 Games list, marking a spectacular recovery after its disastrous launch on PlayStation 4 in 2020. While it was arguably great on PS4 Pro, it wasn’t until CD Projekt Red launched the major 2.0 patch and the Phantom Liberty expansion in 2023 that you didn’t really have to argue anymore. Even more gorgeous than ever and with years of polish and refinement to its combat and skill systems, exploring the gleaming yet seedy open world of Night City stands apart from anything else out there.Out of the box you’re in for more than 30 hours of the original story alongside Keanu Reeves as rockstar radical Johnny Silverhand, but when you include the spy-themed Phantom Liberty expansion you get another 20 starring Idris Elba as sleeper agent Solomon Reed. This chapter brings with it new and more interesting themes as it explores the intersection of capitalism, police states, and the mind-warping effects of near-future technology and human augmentation.Check out our Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review.14. Marvel's Spider-Man 2​As a sequel in a spectacular series, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is a showcase for the PlayStation 5. Its story of two Spider-Men is a great time and a Spidey fan’s dream to play through as comic book tussles with Venom and Kraven the Hunter are brought to life, elegantly walking the tightrope between light humour and heavier themes. Meanwhile, Insomniac refines a successful formula of combat and web-swinging without revolutionising either in major ways, making them comfy and familiar with just enough new tweaks and abilities to elevate them to fun new heights.It also makes use of the power of the PS5 like very few other games, providing blockbuster action moments that are a spectacle to behold, near-instant load times, and a best-in-class pinpoint fast travel system. It’s another thrilling Spider-Man adventure that delivers Insomniac's best tale yet, and a consistently fun superhero power trip.13. The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered​​Yes, The Last of Us Part 2 only launched on PlayStation 4 a few years ago, in 2020. Yes, that’s pretty quick; it certainly doesn’t feel like long enough to justify a standalone remaster. Heck, IGN’s users have tended to agree – particularly when the already incredible-looking existing PS4 version of The Last of Us Part 2 had already received a 60 frames-per-second performance update for the PS5.However, if your next question is, “Is this the best way to experience The Last of Us Part 2?” then the answer is also undoubtedly yes. If you haven’t gotten around to it yet, this is absolutely the place to play it. An ambitious and sweeping sequel that significantly expands the world of the masterful original, The Last of Us Part II is an impeccably assembled stealth action game that hits like a haymaker and is hard to forget.The heavy spotlight on revenge, hate, and self-destruction is emotionally sapping at times, but there remains room to breathe within a story that escalates, pivots, eases, and ultimately explodes again, playing out like two whole seasons of premium TV. (Which, incidentally, it is also doing on HBO.)Recently, Naughty Dog released a new mode that allows you to play through The Last of Us Part II’s non-linear story in straight chronological order, in case you’re looking for a different way to experience it.12. Grand Theft Auto V/GTA Online​Grand Theft Auto V’s sprawling yet meticulously detailed map is still the high bar to which most open-world games aspire. Not only is it huge, it’s incredibly dense with excellent content – not just the driving and shooting and three-protagonist story that make up its campaign, and not limited to the numerous side activities, but all the sights, sounds, and bustling activity you'd expect to find in a city teeming with humans – seedy underbelly included. With so much to do, explore, and play with, both as a single-player PC game and Grand Theft Auto Online, plus great creative tools and mods, it’s truly amazing on multiple levels.As for what’s next, Rockstar has confirmed GTA 6 will be released on May 26, 2026. It will feature a return to Vice City and star the series' first female playable character in a Bonnie \u0026 Clyde-inspired adventure. 11. HadesHades is the current gold standard of the roguelite genre, and it isn’t even close. From its exhilarating combat, to its incredible soundtrack, to its clever and well-written story with characters that seemingly never run out of meaningful things to say, all the way to its deep and innovative post game that keeps you wanting to come back for more even after beating the last boss.It may be incredibly difficult, but it never feels punishing in defeat. Dying is part of the fun, and actually comes with its own rewards in the form of new conversations with its fascinating cast of characters, new opportunities to purchase game changing upgrades, and an opportunity for a brand new run with a completely new set of godly boons that dramatically alter how you approach combat. Hades is a masterclass of roguelite design, and just another example of how Supergiant Games just doesn’t miss.Hades 2 Early Access is now available on Steam, and is expected to launch on consoles sometime in 2025.10. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition​Everyone has heard of The Witcher 3 by now. One of the best RPGs of the last generation and the game that firmly cemented CD Projekt Red as one of the world's premier game developers. While critics have heralded the game's visuals, storytelling, and gameplay, the same can hardly be said about The Witcher 3's technical performance. The new Complete Edition with a bevy of current-gen updates fixes most, if not all, the technical shortcomings that we had to caveat back when it first arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox One. With a smooth frame rate, 4K textures, and loads of other fixes, The Witcher 3 on PS5 is the definitive version of one of the best RPGs of all time.9. The Last of Us Part 1​The Last of Us Part I is arguably the best way to experience the story Naughty Dog was initially told back in 2013. While there is a point of contention on whether this remake was necessary overall, the improvements and changes introduced are enough to warrant this as a great first way to experience this decade-old classic that launched a game series and a breakout hit HBO drama. The improved character models and facial animation are the biggest praises for this remake, making the phenomenal acting done by the cast more meaningful and realistic.The Last of Us has an incredible and emotional story, and the updated technology allows even the most touching scenes to hit the closest to home. The use of the PS5's DualSense controller also greatly improves the gameplay and is one of the best showcases of what the controller is capable of to date. The haptic feedback you can feel in every weapon used, from melee to firearms, and the fact that environmental effects such as the sensation of falling rain help immerse you into this ravaged and desolated world. The one caveat is that the remake does not include the multiplayer mode found in the 2013 original – though that was never the main appeal of this very story-focused experience.8. Final Fantasy VII Remake/Intergrade​​​Final Fantasy VII Remake/Intergrade was the pipe dream that many fans hoped would happen but didn’t believe would see the light of day until the moment they played it for themselves. Seeing the first chapter of FFVII remake in crisp 4K and fully voice-acted not only made the day for those who tout it as the best in the franchise but also for those who may have missed out in the PS1 era. It's a shining example of how far gaming has come in the five generations of PlayStation.This remake updated more than graphics, opting for a completely different combat system that swaps the turn-based battles of the original for faster real-time action that rewards skill and preparation (while still allowing anyone who wants the traditional turn-based combat a way to choose that option as well). Because you never leave Midgar in this portion of the story, Square Enix improved and added to the side stories with the other members of Avalanche, your time in Wall Market, and added a few more areas to expand upon the original. The Intermission expansion puts Yuffie front and center and gives her a chance to shine before you jump into the next part of the story. It includes arguably the best and most engaging combat via her elemental ninjutsu, synergy attacks, and other ninja skills. Both the core game and the Intermission DLC add to the context of the world and lead into the events of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. It’s well worth a try for first-time and longtime fans of Final Fantasy games.Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth are available now.7. Persona 5 Royal​Until the past few years brought on a series of impressive challengers, Persona 5 Royal had very little true competition in the contest for the best JRPG of all time. Its endlessly stylish art and unforgettable, jazzy soundtrack create a vibe it's hard not to fall in love with. And that's before we even get to the cast of iconic, endearing characters and an unexpectedly deep, thought-provoking story that only grows more relevant with every year since it was originally released in 2016. Nobody does this style of turn-based, small-party combat better than Atlus, and P5R is the ultimate refinement of everything great about the franchise's earlier adventures.All of that could be said of the original 2016 version, too, but with Royal, just about everything – from the dialogue to the story to dungeon exploration – has been made bigger and better. It's far from just a remaster with some neat extras; it's almost like getting another entire game on top of an already fantastic one.6. Astro BotFor decades, Mario reigned unchallenged as the king of the 3D platformer. Few if any games came close to Nintendo’s level of creativity and polish in this extremely popular genre. Astro Bot, however, changes things: this adorable robotic mascot can easily go toe-to-toe with games like Super Mario Odyssey as it takes us through a multitude of hyper-colorful and lively worlds, all overflowing with both imaginative level design ideas and countless loving references to PlayStation history. Each new world gives you a fantastic and surprising new ability to play with that sets its puzzles and challenges apart from everything that came before it, and few other games make such excellent use of the unique capabilities of the PS5’s DualSense controllers.5. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth​As a middle chapter of a trilogy that retells one of gaming’s most beloved stories, threading the needle of standing on its own while being a continuation of an ongoing story was a delicate task for Square Enix. Rising to the occasion, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth does this extremely well as an evolution of the principles established in 2020’s FFVII Remake; there's still a grand sense of adventure within a beautiful recreation of the original FFVII's world. Each character is given the chance to grow meaningfully over the course of a 70- to 80-hour journey and become greater versions of their beloved originals. It hits hard, even if you never touched the 1997 classic.The way Rebirth adds tactical layers on top of the action-RPG formula that Remake began is nothing short of amazing. It retains traces of the feeling of the original’s turn-based RPG even in its real-time combat, but having characters like Yuffie, Cait Sith, and Red XIII added to mix open up new possibilities. Especially when you take advantage of the new Synergy abilities and unique partner attacks, pairing up your favorite party members offers satisfying ways to stagger enemies before hitting them with a nasty Limit Break. When you establish a flow, there’s just nothing like overcoming the toughest bosses with your favorite characters while the nostalgic boss themes inspire victory.4. God of War Ragnarok​God of War Ragnarok is hands down one of the easiest games to recommend to anyone asking what game they should play first on their PS5. The gameplay is an immensely satisfying combination of combat, puzzle solving, and exploration that is bound together with a heartwarming story of family, adolescence, and letting go. The combat rewards players for experimentation and precision but also is versatile enough that even using a fraction of the moves at your disposal feels effective and rewarding. Each moment is bolstered by its fantastic soundtrack that elevates everything from the smallest interaction to the most impactful moments in the story. The world's jaw-dropping landscapes feel organic and filled with life (except for Helheim, of course), but it's hard not to stop and admire it every step.Its story, gameplay, soundtrack, and nearly every other part of the game culminate masterfully to live up to expectations for a flagship PlayStation game. Some may take issue with the pacing in certain parts of the game, but the next chapter in Kratos and Atreus's saga is filled with heart, charm, and humor. With the combination of the improvements from God of War (2018) and the path it's carved out for itself among other action-adventure games, God of War: Ragnarok is one of the benchmarks for what PlayStation exclusives can do on the PS5.3. Metaphor: ReFantazioTo call Metaphor: ReFantazio \"fantasy Persona\" is to sell it short. It's a culmination of developer Atlus' RPGs, refining a tried-and-true framework that blends social sim elements and dungeon-crawling RPG combat. But here, Atlus wields that foundation for a brand-new fantasy world to tell a mature story with deep parallels to the political realities we face. It's whimsical and harrowing in equal measure, and just as it shows the ugliness of humanity, it also inspires us to work towards a brighter future. That story and context is what makes the gameplay experience all the more meaningful, and it's a joy to play as you connect with its cast of characters across its imaginative painterly world, building up a strong party with the new Job-like Archetype system that offers a level of depth we haven't seen in a previous Atlus RPG. There are some tough battles in this turn-based combat system, and the tactical considerations required showed that this genre can keep growing.On top of all of that, Metaphor has the Atlus team's distinct sense of style and emphasis on amazing music to drive its story, but in stepping out of its comfort zone and still doing what it does best, Atlus created an all-timer RPG. Sometimes we play games for escapism, but Metaphor reminds us that while it’s important to get away sometimes, you still have to live in your real world. And if you're going to spend 80-something hours in this fantasy universe, why not take a few lessons along the way to hopefully make your world a better place?2. Baldur's Gate 3This 2023 Game of the Year nominee may have narrowly lost that award to Tears of the Kingdom, but it triumphantly takes the one of the top spots in 2025’s Best PS5 Games list. Baldur’s Gate 3’s massive roleplaying adventure is both enormously ambitious in its scope and yet endearingly old-school in its style. Its storytelling is epic, stocked with memorable characters rendered in impressive detail, and a multitude of meaningful choices to make along with them. Its tactical combat is a throwback to the turn-based BioWare RPGs of old and loyal to its Dungeons \u0026 Dragons roots to the point where it can be quite intimidating to get into, but when you do you’re in for over 100 hours of all-thriller, no-filler questing.1. Elden Ring​​​Whether you're a longtime fan of FromSoftware's notoriously challenging games or intrigued by the constant buzz, Elden Ring is a fantastic starting point for seeing what the soulsborne genre is all about. Its streamlined introduction, versatility in accommodating your choice of playstyle, and open-world design all work to alleviate the “brick wall” dilemma of getting stuck on a difficult boss in Dark Souls games. It's that elasticity that makes this FromSoftware adventure a (slightly) friendlier one, while still being full of godlike bosses looking to snuff out your life, threateningly large maps, and intriguing NPCs rife with charm, mystery, and tragedy.It’s since been kicked up a notch thanks to the outstanding Shadow of the Erdtree DLC expansion, which serves as a condensed version of the main game that’s absolutely jam-packed with secrets, valuable treasures, ultra-challenging boss battles, and horrific monstrosities to face of against at every turn. When you stack that on top of the main game, it’s an incredible quantity of high-quality tests of your soulslike mettle.Elden Ring is one of the best-reviewed games in modern history. It was crowned Game of the Year by IGN and The Game Awards in 2022. The co-op roguelite spinoff, Elden Ring: Nightreign, is now available.The Best PS5 GamesBest PS5 Games FAQ What PS5 Games Are Coming Out Soon?Mafia: The Old Country comes out August 8, 2025, followed by Madden NFL 26 on August 11, Dying Light: The Beast on August 22, Gears of War Reloaded on August 26, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater on August 28, Borderlands 4 on September 12, Silent Hill f on September 25, Ghost of Yotei on October 2, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 and Jurassic World Evolution 3 on October 31.

Returnal combines Housemarque’s expertise in intense, arcadey bullet hell shoot-em-ups, with deep roguelite mechanics and a dense, chilling atmosphere, resulting in an unforgettable sci-fi experience.

Its combat. meanwhile, is best-in-class among other action-RPGs, and is paired with an unbelievable soundtrack that enhances every emotion that it successfully attempts to pull from you.

Miraculously, this somehow all works together and balances honoring the roots of the Like a Dragon/Yakuza series while continuing to propel it forward.

The fact that this deckbuilding roguelite uses what initially appears to be a standard deck of playing cards means that it’s a fairly easy game to get the basics of if you know anything about poker. However, from there it takes you down rabbit hole after rabbit hole as you figure out how to maximize your score multiplier and specialize your deck to aim for certain types of high-payout hands.

It\u0026#39;s whimsical and harrowing in equal measure, and just as it shows the ugliness of humanity, it also inspires us to work towards a brighter future. That story and context is what makes the gameplay experience all the more meaningful, and it\u0026#39;s a joy to play as you connect with its cast of characters across its imaginative painterly world, building up a strong party with the new Job-like Archetype system that offers a level of depth we haven\u0026#39;t seen in a previous Atlus RPG. There are some tough battles in this turn-based combat system, and the tactical considerations required showed that this genre can keep growing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eOn top of all of that, Metaphor has the Atlus team\u0026#39;s distinct sense of style and emphasis on amazing music to drive its story, but in stepping out of its comfort zone and still doing what it does best, Atlus created an all-timer RPG. Sometimes we play games for escapism, but Metaphor reminds us that while it’s important to get away sometimes, you still have to live in your real world. And if you\u0026#39;re going to spend 80-something hours in this fantasy universe, why not take a few lessons along the way to hopefully make your world a better place?\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-cy=\"title2\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.

Baldur’s Gate 3’s massive roleplaying adventure is both enormously ambitious in its scope and yet endearingly old-school in its style. Its storytelling is epic, stocked with memorable characters rendered in impressive detail, and a multitude of meaningful choices to make along with them. Its tactical combat is a throwback to the turn-based BioWare RPGs of old and loyal to its Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons roots to the point where it can be quite intimidating to get into, but when you do you’re in for over 100 hours of all-thriller, no-filler questing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-cy=\"title2\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.

Its streamlined introduction, versatility in accommodating your choice of playstyle, and open-world design all work to alleviate the “brick wall” dilemma of getting stuck on a difficult boss in Dark Souls games. It\u0026#39;s that elasticity that makes this FromSoftware adventure a (slightly) friendlier one, while still being full of godlike bosses looking to snuff out your life, threateningly large maps, and intriguing NPCs rife with charm, mystery, and tragedy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eIt’s since been kicked up a notch thanks to the outstanding \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eShadow of the Erdtree DLC expansion\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, which serves as a condensed version of the main game that’s absolutely jam-packed with secrets, valuable treasures, ultra-challenging boss battles, and horrific monstrosities to face of against at every turn.
