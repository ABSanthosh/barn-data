  "text": "The dam broke and people have started flooding into… or back into in some cases… BlueSky. BlueSky social media Part of that is easy to understand, though the timing is odd. I mean sure, X is effectively Truth Social now, but it has been trending that was for months and has pretty much been there since August when Elon declared for Trump and put his resources, including X, behind that effort.  But people stuck around out of habit. In hindsight I feel like I stuck around on X too long, though I stopped once Elon openly endorsed Trump.  My account there is gone… or should be.  I don’t go to check, I deleted the bookmarks and the app. I could go on about the hypocrisy of Elon making a fuss over Twitter not being neutral before he arrived only to go full on with Trump, but hypocrisy is the Republican brand now.  They beat their chests and say “fuck your feelings” then cry like the most delicate snowflake when things don’t go their way.  Everything is a bad faith argument and they should be blocked at the first hint of such… oh, right, Elon took away block too. A surprising number of people seemed to have stuck it out there through last week but, post-election, have finally decided to leave.  There is still some pissing and moaning about all the followers they had, as though they were all real. (Hint: Elon did not, in any way, “solve” the bot problem and likely encouraged it.) The odd bit is that it isn’t just people landing in BlueSky from X.  There are a number of high profile people who have been coming over from Threads, and I am not sure why. I mean yes, Threads suffers from using the Instagram algorithm that wants to keep shoving new content at you, so that you can never find anything again should you accidentally refresh.  Also, engagement is awful unless you’re a big name or brand. Threads has also been overtly, even proudly, suppressing news, and especially political news.  And, of course, there is Zuck, whose main claim to billionaire fame is that he knows how to be slightly less of a pompous ass than Elon and went pro-Trump quietly.  He has been giving the “no more mister nice guy” speech and sucking up to his fellow billionaires, because he too wants a big tax cut and hates when poor children get something like a free lunch. But, again, that isn’t even last week’s news.  That has been the state of affairs on Threads for most of the time it has been up.  It has always been awkward to use and way too tied to the Meta mother ship properties of Instagram, then Facebook and way too interested in promoting brands and style and leaving sentient discussion on the cutting room floor.  So why are people, including some very high profile people, if not exactly hitting the eject button, then marking out space on BlueSky suddenly? Threads, which has passed the 275 million user mark, at one point seemed to be to go-to destination for those who wanted to find a new home away from X.  Did we have a case of mass sanity suddenly hit? MJF on the migration So things are suddenly booming on BlueSky.  Over a month ago the site was celebrating hitting the 10 million users mark, letting some of us know when we joined up. This at $7.00 will get me a small coffee at Starbucks This past week the number had climbed past 16 million users early on and there was a day when over one million new users joined the site. Now, you can rightly point out that relative to old Twitter or current Threads, that is chicken feed, with BlueSky not even claiming 10% of the users that Threads does… though Threads cheats pretty hard to get that number.  I have two Threads accounts because on the Instagram I keep for our cats I accidentally clicked on one of the many “this person posted on Threads” things they inject into the app and, hey presto, another Threads account, and one that I will never use. And it isn’t just me thinking this is a thing.  Sites like TechCrunch started reporting about this sudden drive on BlueSky early in the week and then it started to hit the mainstream media, being picked up by USA Today, CNN, Vox, Reuters, and others. I have even seen a number of Mastodon “Do you have a minute to talk about our lord and savior the Fediverse?” types show up on BlueSky.  Granted, BlueSky can be federated, so it is part of their ecosystem, but at least one person I saw had previously shat all over BlueSky and declared Mastodon the only true faith, so it is a bit of a surprise. The biggest surprise though has been that BlueSky hasn’t completely fallen over with this mass arrival… at least not for very long.  They seem to have been ready this time.  Previously, every time Elon sneezed BlueSky broke. I am just not sure why the exodus has begun this past week.  Elon has been an ass for two years at this point, driving NPR and the New York Times off of his site pretty much immediately, before turning it into the proverbial Nazi bar it has become.  Did the election do it?  Was that the last straw. Meanwhile, over on BlueSky… dare I say it… it feels a bit like early era Twitter.  I mean, I don’t want to jinx it, but a lot of people who I followed over on the old place have shown up and started posting and it is kind of nice. My timeline is now too active to keep up with by just glancing at it twice a day.  It is, once again, easy to lose half an hour just scrolling back on my phone while waiting for something.  And I have more than 6 active followers, so I am way ahead of where I stand on any other site. So, come on in, the water is fine?  You can find me, if you so desire, under the usual handle, which over there translates to wilhelm2451.bsky.social There is still a lot that could go wrong.  At some point somebody is going to have to figure out how to, you know, fund the damn thing.  Ads will be a thing at some point I am sure.  But right now it feels pretty special, like we’re in that brief window of time that people will complain the site is no longer like in a few years.  Get in now so you can be that person who is all, “2024 BlueSky, if you weren’t there you won’t understand what I mean!” My only recommendation would be to follow what has become the rule among those who now consider themselves the “old hands” on the site, which is to simply block anybody who tries to bring their toxic X.com content to the site.  There is no need to engage, that only encourages them.  We managed to get that malignant shit Catturd to walk away with a wall of silence.  Help keep the sky blue by not feeding the trolls. Also, content on BlueSky comes in the form of posts.  Some people are trying to make “skeets” a thing, and I am very much against it as it is trying to recycle “tweets” from the old place, and I feel we just need to let that go.  Also, it sounds dumb.  I won’t argue the point unless provoked, or make it my mission to police that in any way.  I just want to ask nicely if you could just not use that term. Thank you.",

to have to figure out how to, you know, fund the damn thing.  Ads will be a thing at some point I am sure.  But right now it feels pretty special, like we’re in that brief window of time that people will complain the site is no longer like in a few years.  Get in now so you can be that person who is all, “2024 BlueSky, if you weren’t there you won’t understand what I mean!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy only recommendation would be to follow what has become the rule among those who now consider themselves the “old hands” on the site, which is to simply block anybody who tries to bring their toxic X.com content to the site.  There is no need to engage, that only encourages them.  We managed to get that malignant shit Catturd to walk away with a wall of silence.  Help keep the sky blue by not feeding the trolls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, content on BlueSky comes in the form of posts.  Some people are trying to make “skeets” a thing, and I am very much against it as it is trying to recycle “tweets” from the old place, and I feel we just need to let that go.  Also, it sounds dumb.  I won’t argue the point unless provoked, or make it my mission to police that in any way.  I just want to ask nicely if you could just not use that term.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
