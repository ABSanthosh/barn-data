  "text": "Image credit: Rock Paper Shotgun/Paradox Interactive I think there might be a chance, just ever so slightly, that the development of Cities Skylines 2 has been a bit difficult. The game launched back in October of 2023 and has suffered from performance issues, rushed DLC, and a delay to its first expansion Bridges and Ports. This expansion was meant to come soon after the Beach Properties DLC, but that obviously didn't happen, catching a delay to sometime in the second quarter of 2025 specifically to continue improving upon the base game. Except the expansion has been delayed once again. Over on a forum post, developer Colossal Order shared an update explaining why the DLC has caught another delay. \"After reviewing the content ourselves and sharing it with our early access group, we’ve received consistent feedback: the bridges are super exciting, and the port works well, but there are aspects of the expansion that are not as polished as they could be.\" This, they say, left them with \"a difficult choice: delay the release once again to add more depth, or release it as-is, knowing players may feel it falls short.\" Colossal also said they think Bridges and Ports is enjoyable as is, but to \"bring it to the level you deserve, we need more time.\" Now, it's expected to launch sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. Ironically, a free update is coming on June 11th that was meant to coincide with the expansion that includes a couple of new bridges, three leisure piers, and three quays. It's something! To be fair to Colossal, delaying it probably is the better decision, I could quite easily see another botched DLC sinking that city builder shaped ship. I think there was some famous guy who had a plumber for a son that once said something like \"a delayed Bridges and Ports expansion is eventually good, but a rushed Bridges and Ports expansion is forever bad.\" Might be paraphrasing.",
