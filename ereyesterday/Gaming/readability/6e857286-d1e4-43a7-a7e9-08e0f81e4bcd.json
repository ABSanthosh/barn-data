  "description": "Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix kicks off on Saturday, and Epic Games finally revealed the new season on Friday night in an unusual way: with a Snoop Dogg concert in Times Square. It's only fitting for the man who is not only headlining Fortnite Festival Season 6, but who will also feature prominently in this new music-heavy retro season of battle royale. As has long been rumored, Fortnite Chapter 5 is wrapping up with a sequel to last year's OG season. Chapter 2 Remix will, as the name implies, focus on Chapter 2--specifically the first few seasons. The season will run for just a month, ending on the evening of November 30, and will bring with it the Remix Pass. The Remix Pass is shorter than a normal battle pass at just 70 tiers, and it includes five skins that are remixes of existing skins from early Chapter 2. That's one more skin than last year's OG Pass included.Each week of the Remix season will focus on a different artist. Week 1 is Snoop, Week 2 is Eminem--complete with a new skin inspired by his Houdini music video get-up, Week 3 is Ice Spice, and the fourth and final week will feature a tribute to the late Juice WRLD. Each week will come with themed locations and weapons in battle royale, and new item shop skins for each of the artists. And to top it all off, a cel-shaded Juice WRLD skin will be given out for free to anyone who logs in on the final day of the season, November 30, when the Remix finale event will go down.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
