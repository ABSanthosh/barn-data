  "text": "Combine with a 10% IGN coupon code for extra savingsAndaSeat isn't as big of a name in the congested gaming chair market as some other brands like Secretlab, DXRacer, or Razer, but rest assured they make some high quality gaming chairs. We reviewed the Kaiser 3 in the past and consider it to be one of the better gaming chairs on the market. Right now there's an AndaSeat Black Friday Sale with up to $260 off their gaming chairs. These instant discounts stack with our 10% off IGN code \"AndaIGN\".Andaseat Kaiser 4Use 10% off code: AndaIGNAndaSeat Kaiser 4 Gaming ChairThe Kaiser 4 is AndaSeat's flagship chair. The price normally starts from $569 but this sale drops it to $449.10 after the IGN code. It's only available in Extra Large with a weight capabity of 395 pounds so this is a very spacious chair. You can choose among eight different color options in PVC leather or two different color options in fabric. It has all of the creature comforts you'd expect in a quality gaming chair, like a unibody 2mm tubular steel frame, one-piece high density foam with a plush seat bottom (softer in my experience than the very firm Secretlab seat), 4-way lumbar adjustment system, 5D armrests, up to 135 degrees of recline and a rocking toggle, included magnetic armrests, and more. This chair sounds a lot like the Titan Evo, and you'd be right; the design, features, and build quality are almost a carbon copy, minus the price tag.Andaseat Kaiser 3Use 10% off code: AndaIGNAndaSeat Kaiser 3 Gaming ChairAlthough the discount on the Kaiser 3 isn't as big as the Kaiser 4, in my opinion this is AndaSeat's best value for a high-end gaming chair. The Kaiser 3 currently costs $386.10, which is about $60 cheaper than the Kaiser 4 for mostly the same features. The aesthetic styling is a bit different, you lose out on the 5D armrests, and the lumbar is less adjustable, but that's about it. The Kaiser 3 Pro is also available for $45 more but the only upgrade is the 5D armrests.Another Alternative: SecretlabBoth the Andaseat Kaiser 4 and 3 are excellent gaming chairs that are on par with the quality you'll find from more expensive chair manufacturers. That said, if you're willing to spend substantially more, Secretlab is still our favorite gaming chair brand. Secret recently released their flagship Titan Evo chair in a \"Nanogen\" upholstery and it is, in our opinion, the new best gaming chair. In our Titan Evo review, Chris Coke wrote that \"The Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen Edition deserves every bit of the overwhelming praise I’ve given. Granted, at $799 it’s significantly more expensive than the original and not far off from an entry-level Herman-Miller. But the return it offers in comfortable, supportive gaming is well worth the extra cost thanks to dramatically improved materials in both the fabric and multi-layered padding. The Titan Evo Nanogen Edition is class-leading, and is hands-down the most comfortable gaming chair I’ve ever used.\"Secretlab also released a new recliner add-on to anyone who already owns the Titan Evo chair, and it has turned out to be a very practical addition that's worthy of its lofty $250 price point. In our recliner add-on review, Chris Coke wrote that \"While both comfort and value are subjective things, the recliner is able to take the Titan Evo and transform it from one of the best racing style gaming chairs to standing head and shoulders above the competition at its price point. It’s novel enough that I wouldn’t be surprised to see other brands following suit in the near future. If you don’t mind paying for it, it’s an absolutely killer upgrade for your gaming chair.\"Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
