  "text": "Image credit: The Coalition Fall Guy director David Leitch is in talks to direct the movie adaptation of Gears of War. According to Hollywood Reporter, Leitch is in negotiations to direct and produce the film with Kelly McCormick and their 87North production company in partnership with game developer, The Coalition. We already knew Jon Spaihts, whose Dune screenplay was nominated for an Oscar, is also on board as script writer. GEARS 5 - OFFICIAL LAUNCH TRAILER - THE CHAIN Gears of War's most recent mainline entry launched in 2019.Watch on YouTube Netflix did not comment on this latest development but has previously said this will be an adaptation of the Gears of War \"video game saga\", suggesting it'll be more faithful to the source material than Universal's stalled effort. Netflix announced it had acquired the rights to adapt Gear of War into a movie in November 2022, following earlier unsuccessful attempts by New Line Cinema to get a live-action adaptation off the ground. That version, first trumpeted in 2007, had abandoned all pretence of being set in the game's universe by 2019, when the project became permanently stuck in development hell. People Can Fly is working with The Coalition on the next Gears of War game, Gears of War: E-Day. Late last year, we learned that John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro are reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago in Gears of War: E-Day. Yesterday, we revealed that bid numbers in the \"multiple millions\" were reportedly on the table for the adaptation of EA's fan-favourite co-op adventure, Split Fiction.",
