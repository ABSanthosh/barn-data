While the sales may not be as great as Black Friday and Prime Day, it’s still a great time to save on everything to prepare for the warm months ahead. Summer essentials aren’t the only discounted items either, with everything from TVs and mattresses to PCs and gaming essentials getting in on the action. TL;DR: Deals for TodayThis might not be a deal, but if you missed out on the first Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy pre-orders, you’re in luck, as you can still grab the bundle and starter kit. Individual cards are also up for pre-order, ensuring you can lock down your favorites before the drop in June. 2025 Apple iPad (A16)Apple iPad (A16) 128GBThe new iPad is back down to its lowest price ever. Apple released the latest 11-inch iPad in March, and $50 has already been knocked off the price tag for the holiday weekend. The newest model got a few upgrades over its predecessor. Most notably, the tablet now runs on an A16 processor for a snappy experience performing everyday tasks, and base storage has been doubled to 128 GB. But even with these improvements, Apple didn’t increase the starting price from the 10th-generation iPad, making it just $349 to start. While the classic iPad is the best iPad for most people, many of Apple’s other latest tablets have similar discounts for the holiday weekend. Our favorite iPad for students, the iPad Air (M3), which also came out in March, has up to $100 off, while the latest iPad mini has a similar deal, making it 20% off. Sonos Move 2Sonos Move 2Sonos is synonymous with creating high-quality, great-sounding speakers, and one of its portable Bluetooth offerings, the Move 2, is at its lowest price ever.

Everything from charcoal grills and pellet smokers to massive cooktops and portable BBQs are all on sale. Blink Outdoor 4Blink Outdoor 4Adding a few security cameras to your home is never a bad idea.

It wraps the Switch 2 in a shock-absorbing, ergonomic shell for 24/7 protection. When taking the gaming handheld on the go, the over 50% off TZGZT case is a great way to keep it safe and bring along some extra accessories too.
