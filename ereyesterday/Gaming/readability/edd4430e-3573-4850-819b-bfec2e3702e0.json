  "text": "Ahoy mateys! We hope you’ve worked on your sea legs because it’s time to set sail in Rogue Waters! Rogue Waters is a tactical turn-based roguelite where players take control of Captain Cutter, a pirate captain on a quest for revenge after being betrayed by rival pirate Blackbone and left with a mysterious cursed eye. On the journey to find Blackbone, players will hire a ragtag crew and navigate a procedurally generated game world full of turn-based naval and melee combat encounters, curious landmarks, plunderable treasures and even more secrets to discover.  Rogue Waters sets sail on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One starting today! Rather than break open a bottle of oh-so-precious rum, we threw together a list of four ways Rogue Waters lets you live the pirate life. Captain Your Own Ship No true pirate can call themselves captain without their very own ship! In Rogue Waters, players can use their ship to navigate the game world and equip various types of artillery to dominate in in naval combat and leave the enemy ship vulnerable to their boarding party. Hire and Manage a Ragtag Crew Although players start with humble beginnings, they’ll quickly find that there are plenty of swashbuckling cooks, spearmaidens, grapplers, and more just waiting to be hired aboard your ship! As the crew gains combat experience, they’ll unlock new abilities and increase their combat proficiency. However, their health persists through each rogue-lite “run” (similar to a traditional mission, but with a rogue-lite twist). Between runs, crew members will need to rest in order to get themselves back into fighting order. Become a Master of Naval and Melee Combat Experience Rogue Waters’ fresh take on turn-based tactical combat designed to replicate the delicate and visceral dance of high-seas sword-fighting and naval combat. After boarding an enemy vessel, players will have to navigate a grid-like play space, trading turn-based attacks with enemy AI and sending them overboard into the briny deep. Summon Creatures of Pirate Legend Creatures of legend no more! In Rogue Waters, the Kraken is very, very real. There are three monsters in total just waiting to be discovered along your journey. Play your cards right, and they may choose to be your ally; aiding you in battle and striking fear in the hearts of your enemies. There you have it, folks! There are plenty more piratey secrets awaiting Captain Cutter on his quest for vengeance that we’d rather not spoil here. So, hoist anchor and set sail in Rogue Waters on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One today! Tripwire Interactive LLC $29.99 $23.99 Rogue Waters is a Pirate Tactical Turn-Based Rogue-lite. Play as Captain Cutter, commanding your ship and crew through procedurally generated encounters to seek revenge. Recruit, train, and upgrade crew, use powerful sea creatures, and engage in dynamic naval and melee combat to gain the upper hand.

Recruit and grow your pirate crew, discovering their hidden potential as you lead them into battle. It's your responsibility to mold them into the legendary pirates they were destined to be. ● Recruit from 6 unique classes, each with distinct abilities and playstyles for your ship’s crew. ● After each run, upgrade your crew’s skills to increase their effectiveness. ● Damage persists across runs, requiring you to swap out crew members to allow them time to heal. Face new challenges as the game world shifts procedurally with each run, offering fresh secrets, combat scenarios, and treasures to discover. ● Encounters feature diverse pirate factions and enemy types—choose your battles wisely. ● Your crew will engage enemies on ships and land alike. ● Visit shops to heal, upgrade crew, buy cannons, and repair your ship. ● You can extort shops for loot, but it’ll lead to a fight.

Experience a fresh take on turn-based tactical combat that replicates the visceral intensity of cloak-and-dagger duels. Use the environment to gain the upper hand like never before. ● The boarding phase involves hand-to-hand combat where your crew faces off against enemies. ● Use your crew's unique abilities to maneuver and pin enemies against obstacles for fatal damage. ● Leverage the environment by pushing enemies into spikes, grabbing one-time weapons, or swinging into position with ropes. Legendary sea creatures, once thought to be myths, roam the oceans of Rogue Waters. Free them from captivity and gain their trust to summon them in battle. Summon 3 sea monsters to assist in the boarding phase: ● The Kraken crushes nearby enemies. ● The Mermaid disrupts and pushes enemies in any direction. ● The Giant Snail drops a deadly spiked obstacle on the deck. Each run resets your equipment and items, but unlocks permanent upgrades for your crew, ship, and Captain Cutter, allowing you to grow stronger with every battle. Items and upgrades reset between each run: ● Personal items (character equipment): additional weapons, attack modifiers, and side upgrades for abilities. ● Shipboard weapons (cannons and similar items): each new run begins with a usable, basic starter set. ● Ship modules reset as well. Each run permanently increases your progress: ● Unlock skill trees for crew members and Captain Cutter. ● Acquire ship and port facility upgrades in the Pirate Cave (HUB).",
