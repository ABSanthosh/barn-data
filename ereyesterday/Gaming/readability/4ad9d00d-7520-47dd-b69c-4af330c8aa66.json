Image credit: Singularity 6 It's been a little over a year since Palia had its proper launch, and its next big update, the Elderwood Expansion, received a little reveal today.

That doesn't mean everyone will be able to play it right off the bat though, as it's designed for higher level players that have already beaten the main story (you can still head there beforehand if you're impatient). Looking at the trailer I'd say that the big theme here is the colour purple. It's everywhere, that's just the vibe of the place I suppose. In terms of actual additions, outside of the new area itself, there's apparently a new story. There's some kind of essence infecting the area, but story details are pretty light right now. Palia | PS5 \u0026 Xbox - Elderwood Announcement Trailer Watch on YouTube You'll find a couple new creatures to track down like the Ogapuu and Smole (yes, these are their names), and there are hidden artifacts that can net you some strong relics, a \"new equipment system that buffs you and your party.\" On top of that there's new fish, insects, and plushies too. It seems like a pretty sizable update, one that feels surprising to be completely free, but hey, the whole idea is that the game is free-to-play, so, no complaints here! The update is arriving pretty soon too, on May 13, where it'll be launching on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. I mention this only because the game has cross-play, so if you've got some console buds that have been wanting to check Palia out, now might be the time to give them a nudge.",
