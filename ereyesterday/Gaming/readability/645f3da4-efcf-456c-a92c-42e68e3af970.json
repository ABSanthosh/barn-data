  "text": "Hello, everyone! This is Baiyon, Creative Director and multimedia artist at Kyoto-based indie game studio, Q-Games. On behalf of the team, I’m thrilled to share some exciting news with you. During State of Play, we officially announced our latest title, Dreams of Another! This newest addition to the PixelJunk series is coming to PS5 and PS VR2. It’s also the first game where I’ve directed all aspects including; concept, story, visuals and of course the soundtrack creation. Today, I’m excited to introduce the game through our debut trailer and highlight what makes this title so unique. A philosophical and allegorical gaming experience where shooting creates rather than destroys Dreams of Another is a third-person exploration-action game built around the philosophical theme, “no creation without destruction.” Rather than destroying objects by shooting—as in traditional shooting games—here, your shots materialize and create the world. This unconventional mechanic offers a gameplay experience that challenges the norms of the genre and invites players into a whole new dimension. As a developer, I’ve long been interested in finding a new perspective on third-person shooting games. Could we create a game that explores the beauty of life and creation in the context of destruction? This question inspired Dreams of Another. A dreamlike world brought to life by point cloud technology The world of Dreams of Another is crafted using cutting-edge point cloud technology, creating an ethereal, impressionistic dreamscape. Existing in an abstracted state, made up of countless particles, this visually stunning environment reacts to the player’s actions. By shooting at these particles with your gun, they scatter and transform, ultimately materializing into existences. Repeating this process brings objects to life which you can then interact and communicate with. A narrative of two-troubled characters in a mystical world The story revolves around two emotionally scarred characters: The Man in Pajamas and The Wandering Soldier. While the focus is on these two characters, players will also interact with sentient objects like talking trees and doors, uncovering their thoughts, emotions, and secrets. As you journey through the dream world, you will witness the unfolding story of the characters and their experiences, discovering what they have encountered and how they feel along the way; all the while piecing together the mysteries of the world and navigating the liminal space between dreams and reality. A soundtrack to enhance the experience Alongside my work as a visual artist, I’ve spent many years as a musician, performing as a DJ and creating original albums while contributing to films and other mediums. Over the years, I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with many creatives in the boundless medium of video games. For projects I direct, I also compose the music, adding a unique touch to the game experience. The soundtrack for Dreams of Another was carefully crafted to evoke the ephemeral and nebulous nature of its dream world. By blending sounds from all kinds of instruments, synthesizers, non-instrumental sources and field recordings, I created something truly one-of-a-kind for this title. I hope this experimental soundtrack resonates with players as you explore the game’s world. PS5 Pro enhancements Dreams of Another takes full advantage of PS5 Pro Enhancements, delivering highly detailed point cloud visuals in stunning resolution as well as smooth animations, letting you fully immerse yourself in the vivid world. Enhanced for PS VR2 For PS VR2 players, the game offers an immersive full 360-degree experience of its breathtaking point cloud environments, making it feel as though you’ve stepped right into a dream. Dreams of Another is set to launch in 2025 for PS5 and PS VR2. If you’re intrigued, be sure to add it to your wishlist! We can’t wait to share this extraordinary adventure with you.
