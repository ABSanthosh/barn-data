  "text": "Might even launch before June. Image credit: Bethesda Bethesda's long-rumoured The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake is reportedly due to be formally unveiled very soon, with signs pointing to a possible release before June. Word of an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake first surfaced in 2023, when a former employee of Chinese studio Virtuos posted to Reddit claiming it was in the works. And while references to an Oblivion remaster were later spotted in a leaked internal Microsoft document from 2020, more talk of a remake emerged earlier this year - again from a former Virtuous employee. But despite all this chatter, Bethesda's lips have remained firmly sealed. That might be about to change, however, according to multiple reports. NatetheHate - an insider with a strong track record of accurate Microsoft leaks - took to social media to say they expect an official announcement \"either this month or next month.\" The Elder Scrolls VI – Official Announcement Teaser And a reminder that it's now been nearly 7 years since that Elder Scrolls 6 reveal.Watch on YouTube Additionally, they offered a revised release window, having previously claimed the Oblivion remake would launch this June. \"[It's] likely to be sooner than the original June target,\" they wrote, \"but still working to get details on an updated release date.\" Lending further credence to NatetheHate's claims, VGC says it's corroborated the report with its own sources, adding it's heard the game may even release as early as next month. As to what players can expect, the most recent Virtuous leak called it a\"fully remade\" version of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, developed in Unreal 5. It's also said to features various system overhauls, including reworked stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery, hit reaction, and HUD. And with Oblivion's birthday looming - it originally released on 20th March 2006 - now seem like a good moment for Bethesda to finally revel its hand.",
