  "text": "As I mentioned near the end of last month, I was ready for level 47 in Pokemon Go on the xp front, but was being blocked from advancing due to one of the tasks required to make that jump. Pokemon Go – Since 2016 Well, I made it.  Actually, I made it on the day of my month in review post, but I had already written it and wasn’t going to update it because I was going to do this post either way so why spoil it? Anyway, I made it.  Go me.  It turns out that just playing regularly generates stardust at a pretty reasonable rate so I was able to get enough to get my last Pokemon to max CP.  I arrived at level 47. Arrival at level 47 with previous level summary With that I got a few goodies and a new post. Level 47 rewards I will probably end up throwing away the max revives, the max heals, and the nanab berries (even if you don’t play if you spell that backwards you will know which item in the image I am referring to) because bag space and inventory management are always a thing. I am sure that one of the arguments that Pokemon Go is an MMO is the inventory management aspect of the game. So there was a moment of celebration and then it was on to how to get to level 48.  As with all the post-40 levels, there is both an xp requirement and a set of four tasks to be accomplished. The level 48 requirements When it comes to leveling up, xp is just xp and it is going to take as long as it takes.  I have a bunch of people on my friend’s list on the way to “best” friend and the 100K xp reward.  That will probably be what gets me there. On the activity front there is a bunch about your buddy. The 10 souvenirs task will be easy enough.  Your buddy will bring you one a day if your friendship level is high enough, and I have several Pokemon who can cover me on that.  No sweat here. Likewise, earning 300 hearts with your buddy isn’t something you can do in a day.  But getting, say, five in a day is pretty easy… and ten in a day if one puts in a little effort isn’t too hard.  This will still take some time, but I won’t need to resort to buying poffins… which double your daily hearts collected… from the cash shop or anything. Walking 200km with your buddy… is just walking.  I don’t walk enough, but I still get in 10-15km a week with Pokemon Go easily enough.  That is going to take longer than the hearts with my buddy, but I expect that hitting the 21 million xp will take longer. (Levels 1-40 were 20 million xp total, for a sense of scale.) Which leaves us with the final task, which is to walk 25km a week for eight weeks.  That should take… what… eight weeks? Except, of course, as I mentioned above, I am usually good for 10-15km a week.  So this is going to require some extra effort on my part.  Riding on the stationary bike at home won’t cut it, those don’t count.  I need to get out and walk more.  On the plus side, I live in coastal California, where it is still nice out most days, so I can go out and walk.  It is a little chilly, but that is a plus if you’re walking any distance.  I just have to find the time. And I have to drag my wife along because she too needs to finish that task and there will be some complaining if I run… well, walk… out ahead of her and finish it while she still hasn’t started.  She can be very competitive and this being the one video game we play together, she is doubly so. But she is also not so keen on getting out and walking.  So we’ll see.  I have been scouting out a neighborhood course that could cover a set base distance with an eye towards having a couple of set route to cover distance needs. We’ll see.  Lots of xp to go still.",
