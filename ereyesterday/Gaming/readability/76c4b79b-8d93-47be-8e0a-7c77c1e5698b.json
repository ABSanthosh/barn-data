Despite being a short season, popular characters from the franchise are expected to arrive throughout the month-long celebrations.  Epic Games has finally revealed the roadmap for this season, including all the characters and the weapons that will arrive over the next few weeks.  What to Expect in the Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 Galactic Battle Roadmap Galactic Battle is expected to be the shortest season so far, coming to a close in a little over a month. Here’s what Epic Games is adding to the island in the forthcoming updates:  May 8 Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia skins will make it to the Item shop.  Mace Windu Holograms will give you the Purple Lightsaber and teach you the Force Pull ability.  Darth Maul Holograms will give you the Red Lightsaber and teach you the Force Throw ability.  May 15 Chewbacca is set to make a comeback to the island along with the Wookie Bowcaster and the CA-87 Jawa Scatter Blaster. May 22 Mandalorian NPCs will join the battle. You will be able to recruit a Heavy, Scout, Supply, or Medic Mandalorian to your team.  Heavy Jetpack returns along with the Amban Sniper Rifle and the new dual-wield WESTAR-34 Blaster Pistols.  Image by Epic Games May 29 You finally get to use a Star Destroyer in Fortnite during the Galactic Battle season. A portal to the control room will spawn in every match. In the control room, you take control of the turbolaser and obliterate your enemies. June 7 This is the final showdown of the season and will include an in-game narrative live event where you go up against Emperor Palpatine. This could likely be followed by a downtime, leading into the new season.  Epic Games announcing the roadmap for Fortnite Chapter Six, Season Three Galactic Battle so early makes it unlikely that it will be extended or the schedule will change. We’ll be sure to update this page with more information if they announce any changes. The Escapist is supported by our audience.
