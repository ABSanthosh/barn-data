Whatever you want to call them, love them or hate them, in an age where the biggest companies only seem interested in serving you the same thing over and over again, we're stuck with them. This time around, it's a bit of an odd one, as Palworld is getting a Terraria-themed update sometime this summer. Why Terraria? Genuinely no idea, I suppose they might appeal to a similarish kind of crowd, outside of that I haven't the foggiest. Titled \"Tides of Terraria\" (is it particularly ocean-themed? Why? Terraria isn't exactly an ocean-focused game), the update will apparently let you \"catch, train, fight, and work monsters from Terraria just like Pals...?\" I would have put a question mark at the end of that copy too, because the whole thing sounds a bit absurd, but I suppose it's better than just a Terraria-themed gun or whatever. Aside from being described as \"large\", there aren't any other details on the Terraria aspect of the update. Pocketpair say that there'll be other new Pals to catch and islands to explore in the multiplayer game's Terraria update, but again, no more than that. \"The contents of the update will be announced across official Palworld social media channels over the next few weeks, so please follow!\" they wrote in a Steam post about the update. It wasn't that long ago that Palworld received its last patch, which wasn't a particularly massive one. The thing it was noticeable for was technically removing a feature, specifically making it so that when you glide, instead of doing so with a Pal, you just do so with a regular, boring glider. In case you were wondering, this is because of Nintendo's lawsuit, so you can thank Mario for this one.",
