  "text": "Wreak havoc across the dangerous new planet Kairos when Borderlands 4 launches on September 12, 2025. I’m Graeme Timmins, Creative Director at Gearbox Entertainment—and today, the team and I are thrilled to give you our deepest ever look at some explosive, carnage-filled gameplay, all running on PlayStation 5 Pro. We’re showing off two of our four new Vault Hunters and some of their Action Skills, intense looter shooter gameplay with details on all kinds of new gear, the deadly regions you’ll explore on the all-new planet Kairos, and much more. Following the cataclysm seen in our teaser trailer and the contentious clash of our First Look trailer, the tyrannical Timekeeper is here to admonish us as we meet our four new Vault Hunters in this pulse-pounding Gameplay Trailer: Ever since Gearbox created the looter shooter genre nearly 16 years ago, we’ve continued to refine the formula, delivering more loot and action with every entry. I’ve worked on every mainline Borderlands game since starting out as Lead Level Designer on the original Borderlands, and my Gameplay Deep Dive co-op buddy Anthony Nicholson, Senior Project Producer on Borderlands 4, has been with the series since Borderlands 2. With Borderlands 4, we truly believe that this team is creating the best, most ambitious Borderlands game to date. This all-new adventure is the perfect entry point for new players—and for existing players, you’ll find the awesome gameplay you know and love cranked up to 11, with new movement abilities, our biggest and baddest enemies yet, a vast new planet to explore, and of course, billions of guns to loot.  Wreak havoc as a Vault Hunter The Borderlands games are set in an unforgiving sci-fi universe, where life is cheap and guns are plentiful. You play as a Vault Hunter, a badass mercenary on the hunt for alien Vaults, wielding wild guns and devastating abilities. In the Gameplay Deep Dive, we’re showing off two of our four all-new Vault Hunters: Vex the Siren, who uses supernatural phase energy to empower herself and can conjure deadly minions, and Rafa the Exo-Soldier, a former Tediore trooper who wears an experimental exo-suit capable of digistructing an arsenal of weapons. Personally, I’m a huge fan of Vex’s spectral feline familiar Trouble, who can absolutely maul any enemies that try to attack my flank during a shootout. Each Vault Hunter class in Borderlands 4 offers a unique playstyle that empowers you to choose from three signature abilities that serve as your Action Skills. We’re delivering our most advanced skill tree system yet, letting you enhance your Action Skills with special augments and capstone abilities. You can choose from three branching paths of passive abilities that enable an incredibly wide variety of distinctly powerful builds.  Each Vault Hunter also has a unique Trait that shapes their playstyle; for instance, Vex’s Trait makes her Action Skills attune to the element of the weapon she currently has equipped, incentivizing an arsenal of elemental weapons to shock, burn, or freeze enemies based on the situation. One of our guiding design principles for our Vault Hunters is that playing as them should make you feel like an unstoppable force on the battlefield, that unleashes Action Skills to control the flow of combat and blast through enemies with an arsenal of outrageous weaponry. You can also flex even more skill expression during battle with a wide range of new movement abilities, including gliding, dashing, double-jumping, and point-grappling. Welcome to Kairos In Borderlands 4, we’re dropping you into the middle of Kairos, an all-new planet rife with warring factions, deadly fauna, and desperate inhabitants. For thousands of years, the oppressive Timekeeper kept the planet hidden, controlling its inhabitants with cybernetic implants called Bolts and an army of synthetic soldiers known as The Order. But six years before the events of Borderlands 4, a rogue moon suddenly teleported into Kairos’ orbit, shattering the planet’s protective veil and plunging the world into chaos. Now the denizens of Kairos have started rising up, with some even ripping their Bolts right out of their skulls. That’s the situation our four Vault Hunters have crash-landed into: a planet with a population primed to explode, and you’re the spark. In your quest to ignite a revolution against the Timekeeper, you’ll meet unique factions that you’ll need to recruit to your cause, including a slew of new characters and some returning faces that’ll be instantly familiar to Borderlands fans. We’re delighted to be bringing back fan-favorite characters like Claptrap, Moxxi, and Zane—but we’re also so excited for you to meet some of the charming allies and loathsome adversaries that await you on Kairos. To help you get around Kairos’ sprawling, seamlessly connected spaces, you can now summon a personalized Digirunner vehicle at will and jet-boost your way towards the horizon. We’ve built a world that exudes craftsmanship and encourages you to explore it at your own pace—with the option for guidance provided by your ECHO-4 robot buddy—as you take on new enemies, encounter world events, and discover hidden treasures. From Order patrols to world bosses, there’s always something to shoot and loot as you explore Kairos. You’ll also come across short gameplay experiences and new activities that auto-grant a tracked mission whenever you discover them—like Silos, which house old, decommissioned Order tech that you can hijack for the Crimson Resistance with the help of ECHO-4.  Once you’ve reclaimed a Silo, it will reveal the approximate location of a Vault Key Fragment. Collect enough fragments and you’ll unlock a hidden Vault—a high level dungeon with challenging combat and serious loot. Reclaimed Silos can also be used as Fast Travel points, or you can zipline up their hacked communications balloon to start gliding through the air towards your next objective. Wreaking havoc across Kairos is awesome alone and even better with friends—which is why we’ve made it easier than ever to jump into co-op multiplayer, whether through 2-player splitscreen or via our improved lobby system with drop-in/drop-out action for up to 4 players online, with full crossplay at launch.* Borderlands 4 is designed for co-op from the ground up, with instanced loot for each player, dynamic level scaling, individual difficulty settings, and the option to Fast Travel directly to other players to keep the party together and having fun through the whole campaign. Gearing up for a fight In the new gameplay footage, you can watch us go on the offensive across the Terminus Range, where one of the Timekeeper’s generals, Vile Lictor, has been conducting nefarious experiments. We’re breaking into his secret blacksite with the help of Amara, an allied Siren and former Vault Hunter. You can also see the destructive power of some deadly weapons from our eight unique manufacturers: Order, Ripper, Daedalus, Tediore, Maliwan, Jakobs, Vladof, and Torgue, each boasting their own devastating strengths. Longtime Borderlands fans will notice that the first three of these manufacturers are brand new, with fresh characteristics:  Order guns focus on precision with high-powered bursts Ripper guns charge up to go fully automatic Daedalus guns are easy-to-use and incorporate multiple ammo types   Tediore guns are reloaded by tossing them as grenades Maliwan guns specialize in elemental damage to burn, freeze, and shock Jakobs guns can fire bullets as fast as you can shoot with ricochets on critical hits Vladof guns have a high rate of fire and huge magazines Torgue guns have heavy-duty explosive rounds that can switch to sticky projectiles. With the new Licensed Parts system, you can find guns that incorporate the behaviors and abilities from multiple manufacturers into a single weapon, fueling our wildest loot variety yet. In addition, Borderlands 4 reworks our approach to the iconic Legendary guns that have unique effects you won’t find on any other piece of gear. In Borderlands 3, Legendaries dropped too often, devaluing them and making other loot feel less special overall. In our new system, not only do all guns feel great, but now Legendary drops will truly be special events. We’ve added the magic back to our loot chase, and we know you’ll love grinding all the great gear on Kairos. Farming coveted gear is much more intuitive now that you can replay entire missions or use Moxxi’s Big Encore Machine to fight bosses whenever you’d like. Speaking of bosses, Borderlands 4 makes them bigger and better than ever—like Vile Lictor himself, a monstrosity you can glimpse at the end of the Gameplay Deep Dive. These boss fights will put all your new skills, gear, and abilities to the ultimate test, requiring that you think quickly and adapt to whatever each boss throws at you. There are also new gear slots to specialize your builds even further: Ordnance, a shared slot for Grenades and Heavy Weapons like rocket launchers, recharges on a cooldown to keep you locked and loaded during especially tough encounters  Enhancements, which replace the Artifact slot seen in Borderlands 3, augment your weapons based on their manufacturer, rewarding you with extra firepower when you optimize your gear loadout Repkits add utility by letting you heal yourself or activate temporary buffs to help turn the tide of an intense battle We’re incredibly excited to unveil more Borderlands 4 when we host our first hands-on event this June, with tons to show off ahead of the full launch on September 12. Wishlist Borderlands 4 now and stay tuned as we reveal more in the coming months! *Online play requires an Internet connection, a SHiFT Account, and a PlayStation Plus subscription. Terms apply.",

Reclaimed Silos can also be used as Fast Travel points, or you can zipline up their hacked communications balloon to start gliding through the air towards your next objective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWreaking havoc across Kairos is awesome alone and even better with friends—which is why we’ve made it easier than ever to jump into co-op multiplayer, whether through 2-player splitscreen or via our improved lobby system with drop-in/drop-out action for up to 4 players online, with full crossplay at launch.* Borderlands 4 is designed for co-op from the ground up, with instanced loot for each player, dynamic level scaling, individual difficulty settings, and the option to Fast Travel directly to other players to keep the party together and having fun through the whole campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/04/576b19b726b5bf2834349340b9d2fd6027d57a5a-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/04/576b19b726b5bf2834349340b9d2fd6027d57a5a-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=1 1024w, https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/04/576b19b726b5bf2834349340b9d2fd6027d57a5a-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=0.75 768w, https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/04/576b19b726b5bf2834349340b9d2fd6027d57a5a-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=0.57 584w, https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/04/576b19b726b5bf2834349340b9d2fd6027d57a5a-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=0.46 471w, https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/04/576b19b726b5bf2834349340b9d2fd6027d57a5a-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=0.37 379w, https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/04/576b19b726b5bf2834349340b9d2fd6027d57a5a-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=0.31 317w, https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/04/576b19b726b5bf2834349340b9d2fd6027d57a5a-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=0.24 246w, https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2025/04/576b19b726b5bf2834349340b9d2fd6027d57a5a-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C576\u0026amp;zoom=0.19 195w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1170px) 936px, (min-width: 960px) 80vw, 100vw\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eGearing up for a fight\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the new gameplay footage, you can watch us go on the offensive across the Terminus Range, where one of the Timekeeper’s generals, Vile Lictor, has been conducting nefarious experiments. We’re breaking into his secret blacksite with the help of Amara, an allied Siren and former Vault Hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also see the destructive power of some deadly weapons from our eight unique manufacturers: Order, Ripper, Daedalus, Tediore, Maliwan, Jakobs, Vladof, and Torgue, each boasting their own devastating strengths. Longtime Borderlands fans will notice that the first three of these manufacturers are brand new, with fresh characteristics: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOrder guns focus on precision with high-powered bursts\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eRipper guns charge up to go fully automatic\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eDaedalus guns are easy-to-use and incorporate multiple ammo types  \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eTediore guns are reloaded by tossing them as grenades\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eMaliwan guns specialize in elemental damage to burn, freeze, and shock\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eJakobs guns can fire bullets as fast as you can shoot with ricochets on critical hits\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eVladof guns have a high rate of fire and huge magazines\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eTorgue guns have heavy-duty explosive rounds that can switch to sticky projectiles.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith the new Licensed Parts system, you can find guns that incorporate the behaviors and abilities from multiple manufacturers into a single weapon, fueling our wildest loot variety yet. In addition, Borderlands 4 reworks our approach to the iconic Legendary guns that have unique effects you won’t find on any other piece of gear. In Borderlands 3, Legendaries dropped too often, devaluing them and making other loot feel less special overall. In our new system, not only do all guns feel great, but now Legendary drops will truly be special events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve added the magic back to our loot chase, and we know you’ll love grinding all the great gear on Kairos. Farming coveted gear is much more intuitive now that you can replay entire missions or use Moxxi’s Big Encore Machine to fight bosses whenever you’d like. Speaking of bosses, Borderlands 4 makes them bigger and better than ever—like Vile Lictor himself, a monstrosity you can glimpse at the end of the Gameplay Deep Dive. These boss fights will put all your new skills, gear, and abilities to the ultimate test, requiring that you think quickly and adapt to whatever each boss throws at you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also new gear slots to specialize your builds even further:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOrdnance\u003c/strong\u003e, a shared slot for Grenades and Heavy Weapons like rocket launchers, recharges on a cooldown to keep you locked and loaded during especially tough encounters \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnhancements\u003c/strong\u003e, which replace the Artifact slot seen in Borderlands 3, augment your weapons based on their manufacturer, rewarding you with extra firepower when you optimize your gear loadout\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRepkits\u003c/strong\u003e add utility by letting you heal yourself or activate temporary buffs to help turn the tide of an intense battle\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re incredibly excited to unveil more Borderlands 4 when we host our first hands-on event this June, with tons to show off ahead of the full launch on September 12. \u003ca href=\"https://www.playstation.com/games/borderlands-4/\"\u003eWishlist Borderlands 4 now\u003c/a\u003e and stay tuned as we reveal more in the coming months!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e*Online play requires an Internet connection, a SHiFT Account, and a PlayStation Plus subscription.
