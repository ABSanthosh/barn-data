It’s time to wreak havoc with the launch of Season 01 which brings with it new maps, a variety of new modes, the integration of Call of Duty: Warzone with BO6, and the debut of the new Resurgence map Area 99! Read on for the full details on what you can expect with Season 01. New Multiplayer Maps Prepare for a vast new season of content with six Multiplayer maps including a festive variant of a fan-favorite later in the season. Three of these new maps will land at the start of Season 01 today: Hideout; a medium-sized training site. Extraction, another medium-sized map taking place near the remnants of a heliport; and Heirloom, a compact-sized map taking place in a fine art museum. You can then look forward to the return of Hacienda (a Multiplayer map from Black Ops 4) to arrive during Season 01, Racket, a brand new small-sized underground bank vault, and a variation of Nuketown that is promising to be pretty festive. New Multiplayer Modes Two new modes will drop with Season 01. The first is Ransack, where you’ll be looting gold bars from crates on 6v6 maps. Once you’ve acquired your gold bars, you then bring it back to your team’s stash. Naturally, this batch of gold bars needs to be guarded, as enemy teams can raid the stash. So, expect a flurry of activity and planning between gathering and defending to achieve victory. The second is Prop Hunt, where you’ll play as a Prop (e.g. a piece of the scenery) or as a Hunter. If you’re the Prop, you’ll be given a limited amount of time at the start of the match to find a hiding spot for you to blend in with the landscape. You can drop decoys to try and throw off your scent or change shapes into different scenery. Just don’t let the Hunters spot you or the jig it up. You can also look forward to some time-limited modes in the middle of the season and beyond. And expect Ranked Play to land in the coming days featuring plenty of rewards, innovations, and updates. New Warzone Map and More Welcome to Area 99! Step into the scorching Nevada desert and uncover a once-classified Weapons Station where Nuketowns were constructed and dispatched for testing. After being dormant for decades, it reopens today for all Operators with the launch of Season 01 Then, head to Urzikstan at launch and soon after launch drop into Rebirth Island, both seamlessly integrated with Black Ops 6 innovations, including Omnimovement. Enjoy classic modes like Resurgence, Battle Royale, and Plunder to kick off with the start of Season 01, followed later by Battle Royale Ranked and a variety of LTM modes later in the season. As mentioned above, Warzone is now integrated with the Black Ops 6 Loadout System. This means you can look forward to features like Dedicated Melee, three Perks, and a Wildcard. You can also transfer your Global Weapon Builds, utilize an enhanced Gunsmith, and choose from over 170 weapons from Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, or Black Ops 6 that you’ve collected! There will also be the “Pick-3” Perk System which allows for three active Perks at the start of the match, with up to six more to find in-game. Everything Else You Need to Know New Weapons – Seven new weapons will be available across Season 01, including four Primaries (the Krig C AR, Saug SMG, Maelstrom Shotgun, and AMR Mod 4 Sniper Rifle), a Special Secondary (the foldable Sirin 9mm), as well as two Melees (Power Drill and Cleaver). Plus, unlock four weapon attachments, and face more Challenges to unlock firepower in the new Armory. Battle Pass and BlackCell – Whether you’re unlocking the free tiers and base weapons or obtaining the Battle Pass Bundle (available in-game) or going all out with BlackCell (available for purchase here in the Microsoft Store), the Season 01 Battle Pass System grants you the opportunity to earn 100+ rewards, including free base weapons, numerous Weapon Blueprints, Equipment Skins, Operator Skins, and much more. This can be done by: Earning 20+ free rewards, including cosmetic content and base weapons Purchase the Premium Battle Pass (in-game) and earn up to 1,100 COD Points as you progress through the Battle Pass Pages. Purchase BlackCell for the ultimate seasonal experience, including new Operator “Goliath”, a variety of molten hot Operator Skins, Weapon Blueprints, COD points, and other rewards. Purchase the Vault Edition or Vault Edition Upgrade which includes Season 01 BlackCell plus additional premium content. New Operators – And who doesn’t love having some new Operators to play as? For Season 01 you’ll have Goliath as a BlackCell Operator, along with Sevati “Sev” Dumas, a clandestine assassin from Rogue Team available in the Battle Pass. Plus, The Replacer is back, and “Competitor” Operators arrive in time for the 2025 Call of Duty: League season. Also be on the lookout for some new Mastercraft Bundles to drop in the in-game Store.
