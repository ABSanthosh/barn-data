  "text": "Hidalgo needs a pair of characters (inspired de Cervantes’ book) to solve puzzles together in a world of cardboard \u0026 construction paper. Don Quixote is a classic novel that I feel is a staple in a lot of schools. This game takes inspiration from that story and brings it to life through an interactive, narrative-driven, puzzle game full of character. This game can either be played as a single player game, controlling and switching between two characters, or a two-player game if you’ve got a friend to play with. Hidalgo is a charming and stunning game right off the bat. You will watch a watercolor sequence showing a parent reading to their child, then the story comes to life. Seemingly made of paper and cardboard, you will start off playing as Don Quijote, galloping around on your house and exploring the land, helping out characters that need help within the town. Soon, you will meet Sancho. Sancho has the ability to use his donkey to move carts, which is needed for some puzzles. You’ll need to make sure both characters are sort of sticking together, as if you pass one through a puzzle, you’ll need to go back and grab the other character and walk them through so that you can use their expertise once that’s needed. Nothing is particularly difficult in Hidalgo, the game instead focusing on story that’s conveyed through discovery and exploration. You are able to play through five chapters of the story that highlight iconic moments from the novel, giving you the chance to really dive into the book. Hidalgo is a fantastic game for all ages, but especially for children who would benefit from the messages this story tells. It feels like a wholesome adventure and one with puzzles that are satisfying to solve. I got the chance to play through the first part of the game at Indie Dev Day, where I was drawn in by the visuals but really enjoyed how the game showcased the classic story as well. Hidalgo is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can sign up to be notified when the game goes live on Kickstarter.
