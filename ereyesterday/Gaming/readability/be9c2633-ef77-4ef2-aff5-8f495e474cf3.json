  "text": "The first big post-expansion patch for the Legion expansion… doesn’t really have a lot to do with the core of the expansion.  This is in contrast to last summer’s Equinox expansion, which sought to revamp null sec infrastructure which saw changes and twists and turns well into autumn before CCP said we were stuck with whatever they had done because they had to move on to Havoc… which included Equinox updates at launch and in its initial update. Of course, the reason the update doesn’t improve the core of Legion is probably because Legion didn’t have much of a core to begin with.  It was more a couple of new hulls and some feature updates flying in loose formation.  Which was fine.  There were some complaints that there wasn’t a lot to tie Legion together as an expansion, no theme that covered the whole thing… but sometimes that is fine.  Sometimes new hulls are enough. So the first big update is mostly a scattering of fixes and updates that players have be complaining about.  The update is being pitched as being about “not so little things,” but it is also not very many big things either. Legion Update There are a bunch of things in the update, so I won’t go over them all.  I generally don’t do that.  Instead I’ll poke at a couple of items that stood out to me. The Compare Tool I am voting this one as most likely to need further work yet never get it.  A good idea with mediocre execution.  The old compare tool was a cramped, awkward little thing, but let you choose which modules you wanted to compare.  The new tool… was clearly designed by somebody with a 4K monitor for whom size was no barrier. When size is no limit! You can limit the comparison down to just attributes that differ and you can remove variations from the list, but it still feels like UI from somebody who has seen a spreadsheet, but never used one.  The left side label shouldn’t scroll off and the orientation means you can’t sort on a given attribute. The window gets better when you find that you can change to a horizontal orientation. I stumbled over that when looking in vain for a compact mode. Compare along a different axis That helps with the sizing and enables some useful sorting, but the column labels are wrong and you can no longer toggle on/off the attributes that change option.  Also, if you don’t close/clear the compare tool but move right along to another module, it keeps all the previous modules as part of the selection. Let’s mix it up! Of course, maybe YOU want to compare mining lasers, MWDs, and capacitor power relays in a single view.  If so, this is your moment! War Dec Loopholes High sec war decs remain a sore point no matter what CCP does, something I doubt will ever change.  The desire for a completely safe high sec will never be fulfilled.  But for the moment they have shut down a few paths that were being abused. It’s no longer possible to declare a structure which is already reinforced as a War HQ when declaring war on a corporation or alliance. Creating an alliance while you have active, offensive wars, will now cause all of the allies involved in those wars to correctly be copied over to the new war that is created when the alliance is formed High sec war decs will continue until morale improves, if slightly more slowly. Give the People Pyrite  Meanwhile, we also have the latest chapter in CCP’s attempts to repair the damage from the starvation economy era. (Obligatory Year of Disappointment link.)  Right now pyrite is the bottleneck for industry so the company is just going to put more pyrite in rocks. Scordite Pyerite Reprocessing amount improved by approximately 10%. Scordite – Pyerite reprocessing amount increased from 90 to 99. Condensed Scordite – Pyerite reprocessing amount increased from 95 to 103. Massive Scordite – Pyerite reprocessing amount increased from 99 to 110. Glossy Scordite – Pyerite reprocessing amount increased from 104 to 114. Mordunium – Pyerite Reprocessing amount improved by approximately 5%. Mordunium – Pyerite reprocessing amount increased from 84 to 88. Plum Mordunium – Pyerite reprocessing amount increased from 88 to 92. Prize Mordunium – Pyerite reprocessing amount increased from 92 to 97. Plunder Mordunium – Pyerite reprocessing amount increased from 98 to 101. Will this alleviate the current bottleneck?  I don’t know.  But I bet CCP doesn’t “know” either.  After more than five years of this, it is clear they are often just throwing things at the wall to see what sticks. Triglavian Love Finally, after the having Triglavian ships and weapons in the game for more than half a decade, CCP is finally updating the weapon tool tips.  The Trig theme is a continuous beam weapon that spools up in damage over time.  But the tool tip in game only showed the start damage.  Now you can see the full depth of your DPS Triglavian Entropic Disintegrator weapons now show their current progress towards maximum spool in the tooltip when you mouse over them in space while they’re active, and how long it will take in seconds for them to reach their maximum spool. Triglavian Entropic Disintegrator weapons now show their DPS range from starting to max spool in the fitting simulation window when you mouse over the DPS, rather than only showing the starting DPS. And Much More There are a lot of other things in the update.  Too many to cover, but most of it is very good so kudos to the EVE Online team for putting this all together.  There is also an accompanying video to go over the highlights. So that is our EVE Online update for the month. Related: CCP – Legion Update: Not-So-Little Things CCP – Patch Notes",
