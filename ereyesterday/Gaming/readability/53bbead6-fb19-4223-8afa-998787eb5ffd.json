  "text": "SummaryThe team-based, free-to-play shooter Delta Force is landing on Xbox Series X|S on August 19, 2025!Delta Force includes two delightful gameplay modes in one single package: Extraction and Warfare.The Black Hawk Down PvE campaign will also be available as free download. Now it’s your turn to join the fray, Xbox players. The team-based, free-to-play shooter Delta Force is landing on Xbox Series X|S on August 19, 2025! Whether you’re into intense combat, high-stakes missions, or just want to blow stuff up with your squad, Delta Force delivers everything you need for an unforgettable experience with two distinctively unique, yet equally fun, multiplayer modes in one action-packed game. The Tried-and-True Extraction Shooter In Operations, the PvEvP extraction shooter mode, you can dive into a plethora of maps filled with ever-changing enemies, events, and encounters with your goal of getting out with as much loot as possible. The gist? If you get taken down, you lose everything. It’s all about executing your strategy and pulling off successful executions – and the tension feels so much more real on bigger screens! One of our favorites is Tide Prison, a secret, high-tech facility designed to house the most dangerous criminals. Players must infiltrate it disguised as a prisoner, solving solo or co-op puzzles to escape their cell, retrieve their gear, and gather critical intel and supplies — all while facing hostile inmates, defense troops, and other players. All-out War Game Is Also Here If you’re looking for something a little more chaotic, the Warfare mode has got you covered offering up to 32v32 combat. It’s an all-out war game mode where the stakes are high, the maps are massive, and the action is nonstop. Squad up with your friends or go head-to-head with other players in massive multiplayer battles that will test your skills, teamwork, and ability to survive. If you love explosive firefights and large-scale warfare, this mode is totally for you. Dive into its latest map, Cyclone, a massive tropical island, offering great scale for both infantry and vehicle combat. With the introduction of swimming and diving, players can plan their actions across more routes. The map also features dynamic weather, bringing torrential rain and strong winds to the battlefield, further heightening the tension and thrills. That Black Hawk Down, Faithfully Rebooted And there’s even more good news – the PvE single-player campaign, Black Hawk Down, will be available on day one as well! This is a faithful reboot of both the iconic movie and the beloved Delta Force: Black Hawk Down game. The campaign is structured around multiple missions, each offering unique challenges and gameplay experiences. Take one vehicle escort mission, for example: players will need to protect and navigate through hostile areas while exploring maze-like indoor environments to identify and eliminate threats. They’ll also need to stay alert for snipers and RPGs while deep in the heat of close-quarters combat. But we don’t want to spoil too much — let’s just say, it’s going to keep you on your toes! The campaign’s difficulty ramps up quickly, demanding skill and strategy, but that’s part of the fun – overcoming tough obstacles and completing missions will leave you with a real sense of accomplishment.
