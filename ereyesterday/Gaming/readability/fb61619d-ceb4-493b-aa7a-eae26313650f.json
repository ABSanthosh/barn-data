  "text": "SummaryBungie has shared new gameplay for Marathon, a new team-based FPS extraction shooter.Players work in crews of three to take down rival Runner teams, scavenge for resources and gear, and extract safely.Marathon launches on Xbox Series X|S on September 23, 2025. Bungie has unveiled a first look at Marathon, its upcoming sci-fi extraction shooter, as well as some brand-new details about the game. In a showcase today, the studio debuted gameplay, as well as a stylish cinematic short about the Marathon universe. Even better – Bungie shared that there’s not much longer to wait – Marathon releases on Xbox Series X|S on September 23, 2025. Become a Runner In Marathon, you are a Runner, a mercenary who has traded your human form for a host of enhanced cybernetic abilities. Each playable Runner features a loadout of unique skills to compliment how you play – whether you want to run in guns blazing or take a more tactical approach. You’ll also be able to customize your Runner with implants and weapons at the start of the game, and with resources you’ll find during runs. In teams of up to three players, you’ll drop into a zone where the goal is to loot as much as possible and get out alive. You’ll be up against several threats, including AI security forces and other teams, that you’ll need to deal with in some way. If you survive, everything you’ve collected is yours to keep for future runs. For extra challenge seekers, there’s also an option to run a match solo, take down teams alone, and extract with all the loot by yourself. Bungie brings decades of satisfying FPS shooter experience to the table in Marathon from its previous work on Halo, and its ongoing work on Destiny 2. Marathon seeks to blend a dynamic, tactile FPS experience with seasonal content, giving you and your friends new mysteries to unravel about Tau Ceti IV and the abandoned Marathon ship that hangs above. The World of Marathon The studio also shared a cinematic short that gave us a deeper look at the cutthroat world of Tau Ceti IV where Marathon is set, directed by award-winning director Alberto Mielgo (“Love, Death \u0026 Robots”, “The Witness” episode). The short features several playable characters from the Marathon roster and sets the stage for the lost colony where your runs will take place. Check out the short here. Marathon is heading to Xbox Series X|S on September 23, and you can wishlist it today.

Welcome to Tau Ceti IV: What once was a thriving colony is now a battleground for rival factions competing for power and fortune, hiring Runners to track down weapons, valuables, and the edge they need to win.

With multiple maps to choose from, you can sharpen your skills in starter areas, then challenge yourself in high-stakes zones and Ranked mode in season one.
