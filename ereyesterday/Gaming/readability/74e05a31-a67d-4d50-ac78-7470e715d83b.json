  "text": "When it comes to Super Earth, you are the law–the final word on freedom and Managed Democracy in our streets. You are the keeper of the peace and the deliverer of justice, but you need to step up your gear before you go out on patrol. That’s why the Ministry of Defense has approved the release of the Force of Law Premium Warbond1 on June 12! First, let’s talk gear. The AR-32 Pacifier, a large capacity assault rifle, is the last word in defense against enemies roaming the colonies. Combine it with the new G-109 Urchin stun grenade, which attaches to the perp and dispenses electrical pulses until they’re incapacitated, and you can handle any size squid assembly. But hold on–you’re still going to need some backup, diver. We can’t think of a better companion than the AX/ARC-3 “Guard Dog” K-9. Loyal to its core, the arc-powered K-9 will get between you and any threat to your authority. Just be wary of the occasional (accidental) friendly bite. We’re also including access to the GL-52 De-Escalator support weapon, a grenade launcher that fires high-powered arc grenades. The negotiations will be short and shocking when you call this one in.  This isn’t an undercover job, either, so you need to get some gear that lets citizens, SEAF, and squids alike know you’re on the beat. Nothing inspires a sense of safety and obedience quite like the sight of a Helldiver wearing the BP-20 Correct Officer medium armor, with its protective padding and roomy pouches. But maybe you want to be first on the scene, which means you need something lightweight. In that case, try the BP-32 Jackboot, a light armor packing fewer pouches, but more panache with an official-looking tailored jacket and sturdy pauldrons. Both armors come with the Ballistic Padding passive that grants the wearer higher resistance to chest damage, explosive damage, and all damage from bleeding. These armors also pair well with either the Miranda’s Legacy or the Mother Eagle’s Wings capes, and their matching player cards, in coordinating blue and gold color schemes. Force of Law also includes new patterns! Watch them scatter when your paddy wagon, the FRV, rolls down the street with the True Blue pattern, also available for your Exosuits and Hellpods. Speaking of Hellpods, be sure to equip the new booster–Stun Pods–which hotwires your drops to shock nearby suspects into a stupor. We haven’t forgotten the emotes, either. This Warbond comes with three hand signal emotes for Hold, Silence, and Group Up. Even if the mic is off, you can still organize your unit. And lastly, you’ve got the gun, but now you need the badge. You’ll be able to equip the Extra Judicial title, reserved only for those who protect and serve the citizens of Super Earth. Be on the lookout, Helldivers: Force of Law is coming June 12! This Managed Democracy isn’t gonna enforce itself.  1 Requires base game, paid purchase of Super Credits, and game progression to unlock. Trending Stories",
