Our team is proud to announce that Wanderstop will be released on PlayStation 5 on March 11, 2025. We are eager for the chance for players to step into Alta’s shoes and contribute to PlayStation’s tradition of representing impactful, emotional storytelling in games.   A Mysterious Tea Shop In Wanderstop, you’ll play as a former tournament fighter named Alta who has to put her troubled past aside to tend a charming shop and brew tea for its various customers. One would anticipate that after a lifetime of dedication, determination, and constant competition, Alta would welcome the opportunity to slow down. But Alta isn’t quite like everyone else, and this golden opportunity for rest is something she wishes she could escape. Instead of fighting, Alta must spend time growing and harvesting the ingredients needed for tea and mixing them in an unusual tea-making contraption, speaking with the many travelers who pass through the shop, learning their stories, and making tea to match their unique requests.  In your downtime, you might tidy up around the clearing, decorate the shop in your style, or just sit on a bench with a cup of tea and listen to your own thoughts. Maybe doing nothing at all is okay. The shop demands patience and rejects those who have come only in the pursuit of growth unchecked.  Inspired by Personal Experience Creative Director Davey Wreden’s experience with burnout initially inspired the concept of Wanderstop, and as the team and project grew, each member brought their perspectives to the table. We also drew from the groundwork of many narrative and cozy games that have also explored challenging topics.In our release date announcement video, we had the opportunity to share a bit of Davey’s journey. Years ago, he wrote and directed two games – The Stanley Parable and The Beginner’s Guide – and after finishing those games, he felt incredibly burnt out. In the hopes of bringing some balance to his life, and to inspire a healthier work/life balance, he started to explore making a cozy game. As he progressed, he discovered that playing cozy games can provide lots of relaxation – making them still contain the stresses and challenges that all game development holds. After collaborating with other members of the team, like co-founder and writer, Karla Zimonja, art director Temi Olujobi, and lead designer, Steve Margolin, the game’s central themes and questions evolved. Rather than simply creating a cozy experience, there was a tension that they began to explore. What happens when you have a protagonist who isn’t excited about or willing to engage with a cozy world? The coziness, rather than simply being the solution to her inner turmoil, became a point of contention for our protagonist, Alta, and it also became an interesting design element for us as a team. We looked towards many of the games already out that’ve explored these intersections of burnout, grief, fatigue, and healing, as well as previous research articles on topics like player motivation and the work on coziness from Project Horseshoe. Our hope was to continue expanding on the ways that these types of games provide spaces for players to reflect and address potentially challenging issues. Let Your Mind Wander In Wanderstop, there are ample activities a player can do to pass the time. Let your interests guide you to the tasks that bring you the most fulfillment. Players who enjoy decorating can take their time arranging plants in the garden and around the shop, petting adorable pluffins, and finding trinkets scattered about the glade. Periodically, visitors will arrive, providing an opportunity for conversation. Talk with them, see what’s on their minds, and perhaps take on a request to brew their favorite tea. Need a moment to yourself? Create your own cuppa, find a spot to sit, and take in the sights and sounds of the clearing. The music – composed by C418 — shifts dynamically based on your actions in-game and provides a relaxing soundtrack to reflect on. These verbs of Wanderstop – brew, decorate, talk, sit, drink tea – all support our goal for you: that you find your own sense of meaning and connection to this world and Alta’s journey when it comes to PS5 March 11, 2025.  Trending Stories",
