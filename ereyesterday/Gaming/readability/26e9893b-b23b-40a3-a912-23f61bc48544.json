  "text": "Image credit: Naughty Dog It feels like we've only just been introduced to Naughty Dog's sci-fi action-adventure Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, but studio boss Neil Druckmann has now confirmed there's a second game in development at the studio. Druckmann shared the news in conversation with the Press X to Continue podcast, explaining that alongside Intergalactic - where's he's serving as writer and creative director - \"there's another game that's being worked on at Naughty Dog where I am more of a producer role.\" \"And I get to mentor and watch this other team, and give feedback and be, like, the executive in the room,\" he continued. \"I enjoy all those roles, and the fact that I jump between one to the next, it makes my job very exciting and always feeling fresh. I'm never bored.\" Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Announcement Trailer Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet was unveiled in December.Watch on YouTube This isn't the first time we've heard multiple games are in development at Naughty Dog; the studio said it had \"more than one ambitious, brand-new single player game\" in the works back in 2023, when it announced the cancellation of The Last of Us Online. Druckmann's latest statement is, however, the first confirmation since then that multiple projects are still underway. As to what this second project might be, Druckmann offered no hints, but it's possible it's being helmed by Uncharted: The Lost Legacy director Shaun Escayg - who rejoined Naughty Dog back in 2021 after serving as creative director on Crystal Dynamics' Marvel Avengers. Druckmann has, of course, been teasing a third The Last of Us game in recent years, but he seemingly backtracked on that in March, telling fans, \"Don't bet on there being more.\" For now, his main focus appears to be Intergalactic, which is currently expected to arrive in 2027. And while details on the game are currently limited, Druckmann recently named another actor who's been cast in Intergalactic after their appearance in The Last of Us' television show.",
