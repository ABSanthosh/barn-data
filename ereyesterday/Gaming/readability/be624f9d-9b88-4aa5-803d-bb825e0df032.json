  "text": "Hi everyone! My name is Juan Martinez, executive producer at Fatshark and part of the Warhammer 40,000: Darktide team. I’d like to welcome all PlayStation players to the four-player co-operative grimdark experience we have created. Today we opened access to Warhammer 40,000: Darktide for PS5 players who pre-ordered the Imperial Edition. We are super excited to announce that the game will be available for all PS5 players on December 3.  Darktide originally launched on PC in November 2022 and since then we have been working nonstop to expand the game, including nine major additions and 25+ updates worth of content and improvements. The release on PS5 coincides with the release of our 10th major free update: Grim Protocols. And we have even more in store for you in the years ahead!  Fast paced-combat, Fatshark style  We have dreamt of making a game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe for years, and with Darktide, we’ve turned this dream into reality. Darktide is a four-player co-op action game in which you play as a conscripted convict – a Reject – serving the Inquisition in reclaiming the city of Tertium, which has fallen to hordes of Chaos. To survive, you’ll switch between melee and ranged combat, a hybrid system we’ve worked hard to perfect. Bringing Warhammer 40,000: Darktide to PS5 and PS5 Pro While developing Darktide for PS5, we focused on delivering the best possible experience to players. We spent a great deal of time and effort in adapting the game to the PS5 hardware. PS5 users have the freedom to choose between Performance mode (running at 60FPS on a 1440p resolution) and Quality mode (running at 30FPS on a 4K resolution). For those of you with a PS5 Pro, we harnessed PSSR technology to get Warhammer 40,000: Darktide running at a steady 60FPS at 4K resolution.  We also spent quite a bit of time with the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback features of the DualSense wireless controller. Our team wants the DualSense controller to feel like a natural extension of the Warhammer 40,000: Darktide experience. From the iconic Boltgun firing explosive rounds, to the point accuracy of the energy-based Lasgun or a Force Staff channeling psyker powers, each weapon provides a unique experience whenever you swap gear.  Automatic weapons have never felt as good as they do with the DualSense controller’s haptic rumble and trigger effects. Feel the triggers shaking with every shot, while the rumble is punching away inside the DualSense controller. When your ammo count is getting lower, the triggers feel more intense, so you always know when you are about to run dry. Feeling the blades of the Chainsword spinning and the haptic feedback of your blade cutting through the flesh of heretics and demons is pure, grisly enjoyment. We can’t wait to see your reactions to these features once they launch on December 3.  Unlock your potential To make you feel at home on Tertium, we included a huge amount of options in the character creator so that you can fine-tune the appearance of your Reject in the game including their class, looks, background history, and voice. We want to empower players to become part of this world, and its conflict, in more personal ways.  Each class has its own complex talent tree, allowing you to further customize your play style among three main domains (or sub-classes) and anything in between. We also expanded freedom of choice with our Itemization overhaul, which allows you to gain experience within each of the 40+ weapon families you want to become proficient in. An ever-evolving game December 3 is both the launch of the game on PlayStation and sees the release of our 10th major update: Grim Protocols which brings a slew of new content. Here is a glimpse at what we have in store!  We will be introducing a new endgame mode called Havoc where the most seasoned operatives test their mettle. Be ready to face daunting challenges! But first, you have to master Tertium. A new mission will enter our 20+ mission roster, challenging Rejects to explore the Carnival, a notorious area for entertainment, the sort of place you go for a little relaxation and lots of illicit diversions. Three new weapon families will be added, allowing you to tear through waves of enemies with the destructive might of the Two-Handed Force and Power Swords, and the Ogryn Heavy Stubber. Keep an eye out for our official PS5 news to keep up to date with all the content coming in 2025. Warhammer 40,000: Darktide officially launches onto PS5 on December 3. Welcome to Tertium, Rejects, we hope you survive the challenges ahead. For the Emperor! Trending Stories",
