  "text": "Image credit: HP / RPS Sure, Prime Day is here, but in its efforts to combat Amazon’s deals, HP is offering a gaming PC deal that’s better than you’ll find on any rival store. The excellent HP Omen 45L, with an RTX 4090 GPU, has seen a discount of a third, netting you a saving over well over $1000 the $3679.99 MSRP if you’re in the market for a powerful new PC. Save a third on this 4090 monster To get that deal, you’ll need to opt for the aforementioned 4090 GPU, and then apply discount code ‘LEVELUP20’ at checkout which lops 20% off of the price. That should bring this beast of a PC down to just $2,463.99 with free shipping (hooray!). Sure, the 50-series is here, nudging the 4090 off of shelves, but there’s no denying it’s a powerhouse GPU that’s an easy recommendation for 4K gaming or anyone looking to play competitive titles at high frame rates. It’s not just the Omen 45L’s GPU that makes this worth considering, either. There’s an Intel Core Ultra 7 265K Arrow Lake-S CPU, 16GB of DDR5 RGB memory modules, and a 1TB M.2 drive for storage, while the case isn’t too shabby, either, with plenty of lighting while still looking pretty sleek. Add in plenty of fans for airflow and a liquid cooling system and you’re getting a PC with the second most powerful NVIDIA GPU at a third off.",
