  "text": "Lord of the Rings Online launched 18 years ago yesterday, on April 24, 2007.  I know, I was there! Eighteen Years LOTRO was one of the first games I covered that came out after I started blogging.  I mean sure, there was Vanguard: Saga of Heroes as well.  But that was a non-stop train wreck until SOE finally took it off of Brad’s hands, and never became anything remotely like a success, having been finally laid to rest (after a failed attempt to revive it via free to play) as part of the purge before the Columbus Nova acquisition… which plays into the LOTRO story as well, because the whole Standing Stone Games thing was just a front for Jason Epstein to buy LOTRO and Dungeons \u0026 Dragons Online from the decaying corpse of Turbine. But those are all part of the later days which eventually brought some semblance of stability to the title.  There were rough waters along the way for LOTRO as well, which started out with very high expectations for the title. Yahoo Headline 2007 – Back when we still gave a shit about Yahoo Later we got tales from deep in the heart of Turbine that their predictions for the title and its popularity were never even close to being achieved.  Stuff like this quote: LOTRO’s launches in Japan and Korea were so disappointing they were immediately and quite effectively brushed under the carpet and never spoken of again. Those have long since been dumped in the memory hole by staff looking to continue the tradition of denying all problems, but you can still get a taste of it over at Massively OP who broke the story for a wider audience, or over on Ravalations blog where it first saw the light of day outside the forums.  (The quote about legendary items so lines up with my experience.  Also, some of it lives on over at the Internet Archive.  Praise be to the Wayback Machine!) That was in 2015, long after the launch and only a couple years before Turbine would disappear entirely. But back in 2007 our group dove into the game.  I was quite the partisan, pushing for it over our time in World of Warcraft.  But after five months of play, at which point we stood in our 30s… which gives you an inkling as to how slow progress was back in the day… and had not yet arrived at the full on content drought that was still a thing between levels 40 and 50, we went back to WoW because it was simply more fun to play. I was already piling up some gripes in May, and while some of those were addressed with significant reworks of the content… the need to run back and forth between Bree and Buckland multiple time was mitigated, as an example… the UI was and remains a treasure trove of negative examples in the art of design, starting with the icons. Basically, things were not smooth.  It wasn’t awful, but there were a lot of things making people unhappy.  Among other things, the game managed to toast my 8800GT video card.  And Turbine knew things were not going so well.  Even as our group was bailing out for the first time… but not the last time… the company was offering up deals and giving away free time, letting people claim founder’s packs based on referrals, and even offering up the lifetime subscription again. Then there were the dark periods, where it wasn’t clear if the game was going to survive, where Turbine decided its future was in its Infinite Crisis MOBA and let its MMORPGs languish as all hands were directed towards the shiny new thing.  The shiny new thing lasted less than six months and its failure likely set things in motion for the sale of LOTRO and DDO to Daybreak in December of 2016. (Noted on the timeline I made.) And yet LOTRO also had enough unique things about it to make it compelling, not the least of which is a completely unique look into the world of Middle-earth, the likes of which we will probably not see again, at least in my lifetime. Not all of the quirks of the game are bad either.  The classes all have pretty good “flavors” to them.  I’m not so sure about the new mariner class… in my first pass run it felt like they took the warden and said “what it you need to avoid building up combos?” or something.  And there are features, like the music system, which you simply cannot find in a competing title. So I have been back to the game again and again over the years.  At some point I will need to dig out the various generations of our attempts at the game, because I have been back quite a few times. Some of that is because 18 years back I opted for the lifetime subscription. Founders Choices back in 2007 I remember back in the day that not being an easy choice.  Would it be better to take the $10 a month subscription plan or pay $200 for lifetime access?  Was I really going to play for TWENTY months?  Eighteen years later I think even the later $300 lifetime offer was a deal and a half. Somebody occasionally calls lifetime subscribers names like “freeloader” because we don’t have to subscribe to get VIP.  But I was willing to give Turbine $200 up front, mostly sight unseen, for a game that wasn’t ready to launch and which had… and continues to have… plenty of issues.  Plus, I purchased, as pre-orders, the expansions up until Riders of Rohan, while never even getting to that content until this year.  I am more than a dozen years behind playing content I paid for. So the lifetime subscription makes it easy to come back.  But I also bought the lifetime subscription for Star Trek Online, and have never gone back to play that.  The LOTRO and STO lifetimes subscriptions were my best and worst MMORPG purchases. The lifetime makes it easy, but free to play would make it easy too. And what really draws me back is the innate charm the game has.  I may gripe about carrying water for silly hobbits or now lazy the rangers of the north are when it comes to getting things done, such that they hand out critical tasks to random passers by like myself… and I am not done on that front… and some really annoying quest design, but in the end the game itself is different enough that it has its own unique feel for me. That gets us into the whole question of what is just like WoW and what is not.  I remember Jeff Green of EGM/1-Up declaring it was just “WoW in Middle-earth” as though the meta mechanics of a game were all that defined it.  Yes, it is in the Diku/EQ/WoW model.  From the 10,000 foot view, they all look the same.  But people who lump them in like that then need to face the burden of explaining why some succeed and some fail.  It isn’t all just implementation. Anyway, that is a rabbit hole I should avoid going down yet again.  The problem of perspective between the connoisseur versus the dilettante will never be resolved. Besides, the message here is really that we are eighteen years down the road and I am still playing, that the game is still alive and kicking and pushing out new content.  LOTRO doesn’t lack for problems, and the whole 64-bit server transfer thing is yet another eye-rolling fumble by the team, but the venture carries on.",
