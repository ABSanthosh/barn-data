With seven years between the final installment of Netflix’s Daredevil and this year’s Daredevil: Born Again, nobody would blame you for assuming the wait will be a long one. Fortunately, Disney Plus’ more MCU-integrated Daredevil series will return almost unbelievably soon, as far as the realm of comic book TV shows goes. And… there’s maybe even a season 3 on the way? Daredevil: Born Again season 2: When will it come out? Photo: Giovanni Rufino/Marvel StudiosMarvel Studios announced they were already planning a Daredevil: Born Again season 2 in August 2024 — not particularly surprising, as the show was initially conceived as a finite 18-episode series. While production was paused for the 2023 Hollywood strikes, Marvel execs made the decision to overhaul the show and rewrite and reshoot some of what had already been shot. Speaking to The Reel Roundup in February, Marvel Studios head of streaming Brad Winderbaum said that shooting for Born Again season 2’s eight episodes would begin in the first week of March, with a plan to release the season in a year — placing the season premiere in early 2026. “Hopefully,” Winderbaum concluded, “we’ll be able to expect a new Daredevil season annually.” Marvel Studios hasn’t made any official announcements about a Born Again season 3, however. Though it has announced that it’s working on a solo TV special for Jon Bernthal’s Punisher, also set to air in 2026, at least according to The Hollywood Reporter. What will Daredevil: Born Again season 2 be about? We can’t say for certain, but Charlie Cox (Daredevil), Vincent D’Onofrio (Kingpin), Deborah Ann Woll (Karen), Wilson Bethel (Bullseye), Clark Johnson (Cherry), Genneya Walton (BB Urich), and Michael Gandolfini (Fisk’s smarmy little Yes Man, Daniel) are all confirmed to return, so expect their plotlines to continue. Also confirmed to return? Elden Henson (Foggy), despite his character’s death, curiously enough. Could be a flashback, could be a Catholic-guilt-laden dream or hallucination — heck, in the wide world of Marvel Comics Daredevil stories, it wouldn’t be unheard of for Matt to make a trip to literal hell to get Foggy back. We’ll have to wait and see. [Ed. note: The rest of this piece contains spoilers for the end of Daredevil: Born Again season 1.]How does Fisk leave office in the comics? Photo: Giovanni Rufino/Disney PlusThat’s the million-dollar question asked at the end of Daredevil: Born Again: How can Matt Murdock prevail against a man with criminal and institutional power? Not alone, the finale episode implies, but with the united front of all his allies, vigilantes and civilians alike. But it’s likely left you wondering how this all turned out in the comics. Daredevil: Born Again is heavily influenced by writer Charles Soule’s 2015 run on Daredevil, in which Wilson Fisk became mayor and a mysterious serial killer/graffiti artist called Muse went on a killing spree. But when Soule left the book in 2018, Fisk was still in power! In the comics, Wilson Fisk didn’t actually lose the mayoral seat until the Devil’s Reign story arc, from writer Chip Zdarsky and artist Marco Checchetto, in which a city attorney witnesses him beating Matt Murdock to death (it wasn’t actually Matt, it was a guy who looked just like him, but don’t worry about that). It doesn’t seem like Born Again is headed in exactly that direction, but a reputable and righteous witness to one of his acts of brutality would be one way Born Again could get him out of Gracie Mansion. But if we go back to Soule’s Daredevil, there may be another answer. Fisk does not leave office during Soule’s work, but Matt is still able to use his resources as a district attorney and as Daredevil to dissuade Fisk from enacting his anti-superhuman registration act, eking out at least that win. That could be one direction that Born Again’s writers choose to go in, with Daredevil torpedoing Fisk’s plans to make Red Hook a haven from the law but in a way that leaves the Kingpin’s mayoralty intact. We’ll find out in 2026!",

Not alone, the finale episode implies, but with the united front of all his allies, vigilantes and civilians alike. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut it’s likely left you wondering how this all turned out in the comics. \u003cem\u003eDaredevil: Born Again\u003c/em\u003e is heavily influenced by writer Charles Soule’s 2015 run on \u003cem\u003eDaredevil\u003c/em\u003e, in which \u003ca href=\"https://www.polygon.com/tv/545831/daredevil-born-again-comic-book\"\u003eWilson Fisk became mayor\u003c/a\u003e and a mysterious \u003ca href=\"https://www.polygon.com/marvel/541635/daredevil-born-again-mask-graffiti-subway-serial-killer-muse\"\u003eserial killer/graffiti artist called Muse\u003c/a\u003e went on a killing spree. But when Soule left the book in 2018, Fisk was still in power! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the comics, Wilson Fisk didn’t actually lose the mayoral seat until the \u003cem\u003eDevil’s Reign\u003c/em\u003e story arc, from writer Chip Zdarsky and artist Marco Checchetto, in which a city attorney witnesses him beating Matt Murdock to death (it wasn’t actually Matt, it was \u003ca href=\"https://www.polygon.com/comics/2020/8/31/21406076/daredevil-marvel-comics-new-backstory-origin-matt-murdock-mike-brother-twin\"\u003ea guy who looked just like him\u003c/a\u003e, but don’t worry about that). It doesn’t seem like \u003cem\u003eBorn Again\u003c/em\u003e is headed in exactly that direction, but a reputable and righteous witness to one of his acts of brutality would be one way \u003cem\u003eBorn Again\u003c/em\u003e could get him out of Gracie Mansion. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut if we go back to Soule’s \u003cem\u003eDaredevil\u003c/em\u003e, there may be another answer. Fisk does not leave office during Soule’s work, but Matt is still able to use his resources as a district attorney and as Daredevil to dissuade Fisk from enacting his anti-superhuman registration act, eking out at least that win. That could be one direction that \u003cem\u003eBorn Again\u003c/em\u003e’s writers choose to go in, with Daredevil torpedoing Fisk’s plans to make Red Hook a haven from the law but in a way that leaves the Kingpin’s mayoralty intact. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ll find out in 2026!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
