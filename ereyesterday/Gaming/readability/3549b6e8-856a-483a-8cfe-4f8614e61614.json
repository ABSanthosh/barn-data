  "text": "Image credit: Two Point Studios/Sega Daft but brilliant curation sim Two Point Museum is grabbing its D20s and venturing into the world of medieval fantasy for its first paid DLC release, which promises magical exhibits (and ensuing curses for unsuspecting guests), RPG-inspired expeditions, and more this July. Fantasy Finds, as developer Two Point Studios is calling its DLC, introduces a total of 40 mysterious and magically inclined exhibits. You've got your Flying Carpet, your Teanie Kettle, your Novel Wardrobe, and more, all granting beneficial blessings to guests. Unless, that is, you fail to keep them well-maintained - in which case you'll be dealing with cursed patrons instead. As in the base game, all these curios are acquired out on expeditions, which is where Fantasy Finds' RPG-style twist comes in. In order to track down or maintain the DLC's new exhibits, you'll need to hire new Fantasy Experts. These come in a range of familiar classes - barbarian, wizard, rogue, and bard - each with their own stats. \"Does your team have enough combined Strength and Dexterity to counter a dragon attack?\", Two Points Studios teases. \"Perhaps you need the right combination of Intelligence and Luck to overcome a Picked Lock shortcut.\" Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds | Coming 17th July Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds trailer.Watch on YouTube Fantasy Finds also includes three new guest archetypes, 26 decorations and utility items, a new medieval-themed paint job for your expedition chopper, Mythical Gear buffs for staff, plus new interactive displays, banners, wallpapers, floors, and more. All this arrives for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on 17th July, and while there's no word of a price yet, a week-long 10 percent launch discount is confirmed. And if you haven't played Two Point Museum yet (which you should if you're a management sim fan, because it's great and easily the best entry in the series so far) you can currently pick it up with 20 percent off as part of the Steam Summer Sale. \"Come for the clowns and cavemen,\" Eurogamer contributing editor Christian Donlan wrote in his four star review of Two Point Museum, \"stay for the zombie capitalism.\"",
