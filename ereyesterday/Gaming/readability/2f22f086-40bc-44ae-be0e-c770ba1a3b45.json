  "text": "Chicken. Pork. Beef. Bread. Milk. None of these plants or animals existed in the Americas before European contact. Earth’s geography has always been imbalanced, and Ara: History Untold aims to vividly illustrate this asymmetry with the free version 1.4 update and first DLC, Untold Scenarios, available today for Xbox PC and Steam. Version 1.4 of Xbox Game Studios’ ambitious historical 4X strategy game is the first update designed and developed by strategy and simulation experts Stardock Entertainment, who assumed production leadership in April. The companion DLC highlights what the game can now achieve. Geography is Destiny The free update overhauls the game’s map generator, making each randomly generated world more distinct. Meanwhile, the Untold Scenarios DLC features maps with resources positioned realistically, causing societies to evolve very differently. In the Mongol Invasion scenario, you will step into the boots of Genghis Khan, leading the Mongols who, uniquely, cannot found new cities. Without Settlers, you must conquer territory, using specialized technologies and units to dominate the Asian steppes. Europe at the Crossroads, another scenario, places historical figures into critical positions at the dawn of the Enlightenment. How might history unfold if Caesar, Alexander the Great, and Elizabeth I led 18th-century Europe instead of Louis XIV, William III, and Peter the Great? Living Strategy Upon loading version 1.4, you will immediately notice the new Living Strategy view. Previously, Ara featured two modes: the detailed Living World and the icon-based Strategic View. The new Living Strategy mode combines these, clearly showing units scaled on the map to enhance visibility and strategic clarity. Simulation Meets Strategy Ara’s Living World has always been a vibrant simulation. Farmers, bakers, and soldiers are individually simulated entities with their own needs and behaviors. Version 1.4 leverages this deep simulation to dramatically reduce micromanagement. You now have the option to let citizens autonomously supply their homes and shops, removing the need for constant manual decisions about resource allocation. Additionally, computer opponents have significantly improved thanks to Stardock’s experience crafting AI for strategy games like Galactic Civilizations, Fallen Enchantress, and The Political Machine. Opponents now play uniquely based on their traits, employing sophisticated economic and military strategies to challenge you from ancient times through technological singularity. Prettier, Yet Faster Oxide’s Nitrous engine has also been enhanced, dramatically improving performance, particularly in late-game scenarios. Smarter culling, optimized shaders, and refined simulations ensure a smoother experience, while visual enhancements make units and cities noticeably sharper and more detailed than ever. If you’re a fan of history or strategy games, there’s never been a better time to rewrite history.
