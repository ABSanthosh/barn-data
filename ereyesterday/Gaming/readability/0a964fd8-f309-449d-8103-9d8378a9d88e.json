  "text": "\"Both teams working on it.\" Image credit: Activision The next Call of Duty installment was announced over the weekend, along with its release platforms: Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is slated to debut across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC. Black Ops 7's omission of a Switch 2 release (at least presently) from the launch platform line-up has raised some eyebrows due to the fact that, back in 2023, Microsoft announced a deal with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to its platforms on \"the same day as Xbox, with full feature and content parity\". However, while for now there is no word of a Switch 2 release for Black Ops 7, the team is \"committed\" to bringing the Call of Duty series to Nintendo, Activision has told Eurogamer. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Official Teaser | Xbox Games Showcase 2025 Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Official Teaser | Xbox Games Showcase 2025. Watch on YouTube In a statement shared with Eurogamer, Activision confirmed: \"We're committed to getting the franchise on Switch. Both teams [are] working on it. Will share details when ready.\" On its release, Black Ops 7 will be able to be played solo or with friends \"in a thrilling and innovative\" co-op campaign, while also having the series' \"signature\" multiplayer experience. This will include new maps and more from Zombies. The upcoming game is being helmed by Treyarch and Raven Software, with the developers promising the \"most mind-bending\" Black Ops release yet. It stars Heroes and Gilmore Girls' Milo Ventimiglia as David Mason. We can expect further details on Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this summer, the team has said, so stay tuned for more.",
