  "text": "If Nightdive Studios were a home, it would be built upon the foundation of System Shock. As one of the studio’s formative projects, the Kickstarter campaign for its acclaimed System Shock remake put Nightdive on the map. But it wasn’t System Shock that inspired Nightdive’s creation, rather its sequel, System Shock 2. With the recently announced June 26, 2024, release date for System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster fast approaching, some have wondered: why a remaster instead of a full remake? To answer this, let’s look back at Nightdive’s origins, remasters as a form of preservation, and the many enhancements that make System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster a worthy tribute to a beloved classic! Where It All Began “Like many others, my first experience with System Shock was the sequel,” begins Nightdive Founder and CEO Stephen Kick, who recounts being introduced to the game while eating lunch with his friends at school. After sharing how much he loved Half-Life, his friend Marshall suggested giving System Shock 2 a try. “The next day, he came back to the table and handed me the Big Box. That night, I installed the game and was instantly captivated. Every aspect of it congealed into an unforgettably immersive experience that still gives me chills every time I think about it.” Little did he know at the time, this pivotal moment would later contribute to Nightdive’s founding in 2012 when Kick had the nostalgic desire to replay System Shock 2. Unable to get his game to run, and unable to re-purchase it on digital platforms, Kick began reaching out to license holders and was ultimately rewarded with the rights to re-release System Shock 2 in 2013, followed by the original. “After System Shock: Enhanced Edition introduced mouse look and other quality of life improvements, we knew we had the unique opportunity to re-introduce the gaming world at large to one of the most influential and overlooked experiences ever created. The decision was then made to assemble a team to remake System Shock to not only honor the original, but to celebrate the legacy it created,” Kick explains. “While we’d already announced an enhanced edition of System Shock 2, the success of the remake caused us to pivot and re-evaluate our goals for System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition, ultimately leading to a remaster that’s much grander in scope and ambition.” So, why didn’t this pivot with System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster (formerly System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition) lead to another remake? Remaster vs. Remake “With System Shock 2, the game was already in a playable state, it just needed the same care and attention we’ve brought to other games we’ve worked on from that generation,” Kick clarifies. “Improved graphics, performance, and the ability to play on console — so it was decided to remaster the game instead of completely remaking it.” Nightdive’s mission extends beyond ‘bringing lost and forgotten games back from the depths’ with its commitment to game preservation. As Nightdive developer Alex Lima points out, remasters and remakes are “two very different approaches” to game preservation. “In a remake, we have the liberty of using modern engines, and we need to seek a specific type of talent when assembling a development team. In a remaster, we’re adapting legacy source code and doing lots of reverse engineering when that source code is lost.” If you think of games as art, like Nightdive VP of Business Development Larry Kuperman does, a remaster is closer to restoration work done with old paintings while remakes are akin to creating a replica. “Games are a form of interactive art and should be preserved as art deserves to be preserved,” says Kuperman. Being able to leverage as much of a game’s original content as possible is not only valuable from a preservation standpoint, but from a modding one too. “In a remaster, we adhere to the modding standards the original developers or community have already established. In a remake, we’re able to create the modding ecosystems with modern practices and standards. All in all, we do both with passion, and it’s up to the public to decide which one they favor,” notes Lima. “We decided to go with a remaster because we care a lot about the System Shock 2 fanbase, and we know a modding community has built around this game that’d benefit from the addition of advanced features. A remake would also be great, but it wouldn’t affect the modding community in as positive a way as this remaster will.” Bringing a Horror Classic to Xbox Modders aren’t the only ones who’ll benefit from the enhancements of System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster. With a wealth of fixes and improvements, the game’s shaping up to be more approachable than ever. For example, as you explore the creepy corridors of the Von Braun, one of the first things you’ll notice is the game’s visual enhancements. “Menus and in-game UI elements have been upgraded to high-resolution assets, providing enhanced clarity and readability,” confirms Lima. “The Xbox family of systems has the kind of hardware that PC players in the ‘90s could only dream of, and we make use of that extra muscle,” adds developer Lexi Mayfield. “The game runs natively at 4K resolution on the Xbox One X and Xbox Series X|S with 120Hz also supported on the Xbox Series X|S version.” It’s not just looks — System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster plays better, too. “The 3D renderer used by System Shock 2’s “Dark” Engine has been modernized. You can expect to see high-resolution assets, modern materials and shaders, support for ambient occlusion, and many of the performance bottlenecks of the older renderer addressed,” explains Mayfield. As expected for a game releasing on consoles, System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster offers comprehensive controller support. “Every interface in the game, from PDA screens to hacking tools, can now be quickly navigated with the directional pad and face buttons. Cycling between PDA interfaces is done with the triggers, and tabular interfaces in those screens are cycled with the bumpers.” You can do more with the bumpers than cycle between screens, thanks to the game’s newly added quickbar system. Now, switching between weapons and psi powers is both faster and easier thanks to two quick-access bars bound by default to the Left and Right bumpers. “You can also slow down your aim for the sake of accuracy, and instead of multiple lean buttons there’s now a single lean toggle that uses the control stick for the lean direction.” If the default setup doesn’t work for you, “nearly every control except looking and walking with the analog sticks can be remapped. You can even swap the sticks to a southpaw configuration if you prefer.” And if you’d rather stick to mouse and keyboard, Mayfield assures “we have you covered there too.” While the team can’t delve too deep into either of these just yet, multiplayer and co-op are in development for System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster. “Crossplay functionality is also supported, allowing players across different platforms to connect and play together,” notes Lima. A Look to the Future Nightdive’s remaster of System Shock 2 isn’t a highly-polished reimagining; it’s the same game you remember from 1999… but better. With visual enhancements, optimized performance, and full controller support, Xbox players are in for a real treat. Perhaps more than one. With several projects in active development, including some highly requested fan favorites, the Nightdive team shows no signs of slowing down. While a full remake of System Shock 2 isn’t on the list (yet), it’s certainly not outside the realm of possibility. According to Stephen Kick: “Our team has been working within the world of System Shock for the last 10 years and I couldn’t think of a more qualified group of developers to tackle a project like that should we decide to take that on.” So, whether you’re a first-timer or a longtime fan, Nightdive looks forward to welcoming you aboard the Von Braun when System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster launches on June 26, 2024, for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S!
