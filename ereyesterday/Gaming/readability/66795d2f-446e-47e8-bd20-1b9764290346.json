For the most part I'm a single-player only kind of person, and when I play something online I normally like to do so with just my partner. I imagine I'm not the only person this applies to, nor am I likely to be the only one who thought \"I don't really want some rando called xX_fartmaster_Xx third wheeling my partner and me.\" Luckily, FromSoftware seem to be at least considering a two-player option for the upcoming Soulslike. Game director Junya Ishizaki recently spoke with IGN about the things he learned under Elden Ring's director Hidetaka Miyazaki. It's a great interview, but the main thing we're concerned with here is Ishizaki's comments on not having a two-player option. When asked why the option was omitted, Ishizaki quite plainly said that \"the simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that. \"As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign. Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start.\" Ishizaki went on to say that the team put a lot of effort into making something enjoyable and playable for solo players. However, because they were so focused on that, they \"kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect.\" However! The director did also say that a duos mode \"is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well.\" Considering it is good enough for me for now! Here's hoping the update comes before that Elden Ring movie that's in the works that I'm pretending doesn't exist.",
