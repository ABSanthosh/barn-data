  "text": "It was only a matter of time Image credit: Supergiant Games Supergiant Games have released the latest big patch for Hades 2 today, The Unseen Update, bringing in a number of changes so big I won't be able to tell you about them all here, but I'll pick out a few good ones. First of all, and perhaps most importantly, Narcissus finally has character art and, oh no, he's hot! I'm not going to embed any pictures of him here just in case you want to witness him in game for yourself, but here's a little tweet for those that can't wait. Very much a \"why does he have to be obsessed with himself and be attractive enough for that to be understandable\" kind of vibe. Anyway, you can put the spray bottle down, I'll tell you about some gameplay additions. All of the roguelike's Nocturnal Arms now have their own Hidden Aspects for you to unlock, though you'll have to find them yourself. Some new music has been added in too, including a \"hot new single from a certain band…\" Zero prize for guessing this is likely to be Scylla and the Sirens. Several, optional new events have been added in for when you get close to a number of the game's characters, and there's even some new artwork for certain characters in the salt bath (and some \"visual flourishes\" have been added to the artwork in general). There's a new Vow of Rivals feature that makes each Guardian (i.e. boss) \"more challenging in unique ways; the first Rank affects the first Guardian of both the Underworld and Surface routes; prevail against both to reveal the next Rank, and so on.\" There's also just a ridiculously long list of additions and tweaks to boons, Daedalus Hammer upgrades, Hexes, enemies, and more, so you're probably going to want to read the full patch notes if you like to dig that deep. In a blog post on their website, Supergiant Games also offered up some development progress. While they didn't have a release date to share, after some follow-up patches to iron out some Unseen Update kinks, the big next steps will be adding in the game's anticipated true ending. There's also plans for achievements and other finishing touches, but the big thing here is that they are gearing up for the 1.0 release at the very least. For now, just uh, drool over Narcissus or something.",
