Pandas are Coming I mean, I made it all the way to the black gates of Mordor in about a quarter of the time Cataclysm Classic has been hanging about. While the main expansion won’t be here until the 21st, we do now have the following available to us, per Blizz: New Playable Race: With the release of the Mists of Pandaria pre-patch, set out as a member of the enigmatic Pandaren and join the ranks of either the Horde or Alliance as you enter the conflict brewing on Pandaria’s shores. New Class: Learn the mystic powers of the Monk—destroy foes with the Windwalker’s devastating attacks, replenish allies with the Mistweaver’s spiritual energies, and shrug off enormous damage with the Brewmaster’s unyielding strength. Revamped Classes: All classes have been updated with a new talent system, improved abilities, and spells. AOE Looting: Loot all nearby enemies at once, streamlining the loot process. World Event: Attack on Theramore Isle: Join the battle and take part in the Theramore’s Fall scenario, detailing events leading up to the expansion’s launch. Pet Battles: Dust off your vanity pet collection and prepare them for new tactical mini-game battles. Need pets? Adopt, don’t shop—tame a slew of new and interesting critters while on your adventures in Pandaria. I was never that big on pandas or monks really, though I came late to MoP back in the day, so maybe I missed their OP period.  And does Blizz ever say that any class revamp did not “improve” things? AOE looting will be nice.  I must admit, after almost four months in LOTRO, I have grown used to auto looting, so having to grub around in corpses one by one like some sort of peasant might have been too much for me.  Now I can just click one corpse and be done. A glimpse of Pandaria Then there are pet battles.  I am feeling a bit ambivalent on that front.  I’ll have to see if there is a decent mod for making pre-set teams.  The default UI was primitive to the point of being an obstacle without addons as I recall. I am also a bit miffed that my BlizzCon pets are stuck in retail.  I had a whole rotation built around a couple of them.  And do I even want to invest in the whole pet thing?  As I recall, it was a bit of a slog until Warlords of Draenor.  But we’ll see. Just to get you in and invested, Blizz also has Shaohao’s Sage Serpent Skyriding mount available if you’ll just roll up a panda and get through the tutorial. The mount revealed The requirements, in detail, are: Install World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria Classic Create a Pandaren character. Complete the Pandaren starting experience, including choosing the path of either Alliance or Horde. Once complete, Shaohao’s Sage Serpent will be delivered to your Collection in modern WoW. The catch is that the mount ends up in retail. Retail, retail, retail. Anyway, there we go.  Because it is Blizz, they had the staff to do a pre-patch trailer even. Off to the races once more… the panda races this time… though my enthusiasm was somewhat dampened this morning by Microsoft laying off another 9,000 people while Phil Spencer pleads poverty and the need to run a viable business.  Those huge bonuses don’t pay for themselves!
