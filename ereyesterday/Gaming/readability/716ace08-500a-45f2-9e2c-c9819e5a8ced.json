  "description": "You’re probably gonna laugh with how haphazard I am with makeup these days, but it’s the best I can do with the time I have, so here it is: I use a twist-up, long wearing gel pencil (MAC Colour Excess) and draw a messy line on my upper lash line with no concern about the precision at all, LOL! If it’s too thick, then I smudge it out. If it’s too thin, then I figure the makeup goddesses wanted it to look that way, so I go with it. I don’t even bother trying to line my waterline, either. I usually layer eyeshadow on top of it anyway, so I’m not overly concerned. Seriously, THAT’S IT! How about you? How do are you doing your liner these days?
