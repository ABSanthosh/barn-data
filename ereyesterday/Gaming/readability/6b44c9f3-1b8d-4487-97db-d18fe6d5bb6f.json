  "text": "As part of the 30th Anniversary Warcraft Direct presentation last week there was a tail end video teaser that had an adventurer coming in the door and settling into their chair with the tag line “Your next adventure begins at home.” Happy little Hallmark store cup not included Blizzard was straight up telling us that player housing was coming to Azeroth… with no details.  The video is 44 seconds and a good third of it is bumpers. And, naturally, on this announcement a cheer went up from the masses… a mixed cheer, certainly, with some enthusiasm over the announcement and some weariness that it has taken Blizzard 20 years to get around to this. My own initial reaction was skepticism.  I know, big surprise.  I was called out on that recently enough. And, truth be told, I don’t want to always be the obstinate, Missouri-esque blogger who insists you have to show him before he’ll believe in what you’re trying to sell him.  I’d like to jump on the bandwagon, buy into the vision, feel the excitement, and feel confident that I can put my faith in your announcement or teaser or press release.  I want to be a fan, really I do. But I’ve also played video games for a long, long time, and online, multiplayer video games since 1986.  Those fresh faced interns in marketing dropping superlatives into their press release trying to spark enthusiasm in their target market segment… which I will stipulate is probably never me now at my age… seem to lack the depth of experience, and clearly lack the experience of the industry, to get that over promising and under delivering is very much the norm. Ive been burned by promises and visions and innocent, wide-eyed optimism too many times to not immediately generate a healthy skepticism deep within me.  And that isn’t even getting into Kickstarter projects.  When it comes to video game promises there are lies, damn lies, and wholesale crowdfunded deception. Not that I don’t get it.  Software developers are the most optimistic people in the world.  They have to be to finish one project where a half a hundred little problems cropped up with the initial design and they had to throw away a lot of work and start over again half way through, thus leaving out a huge chunk of promised features only to turn around, look at the next projects and declare that it will be easy, two months tops. [Long winded diversion into personal examples removed, to be restored with the director’s cut of this post some day.] So I get it.  But in getting it I am unable to get past the doubt, I can see the lines where the vision starts to step past the confines of this world and possibility. Which brings me around to Blizzard and the promise of housing in World of Warcraft. The housing is for retail World of Warcraft, of course.  And not until the Midnight expansion for retail, which is close to two years off because the WoW team is going to stick to that every other year expansion cadence.  The hint of the possibility of annual WoW expansions that came with them announcing the next three expansions at BlizzCon last year has given way to the reality of the 2025 retail roadmap where they aren’t even going to formally reveal the Midnight expansion until next year. The Retail WoW 2025 roadmap That means we probably won’t hear much more for another year and that at some point at the far end summer 2026 this might become a reality. I am in the strange mental mix right now where time seems to fly by and yet two years also feels so far away and the future so uncertain that I cannot anchor any solid hope on something that distant.  I will have crossed over into my early 60s by then. In a particularly ironic turn of fate, the timing of this might mean that the WoW Classic expansion progression track our group is on might very well be in the midst of Warlords of Draenor when this housing lands, which will mean we’ll have garrisons which was, at least according to Tom Chilton (whose job for a while seemed to be to announce things for the company unofficially so they could be denied if they were particularly dumb) was going to be the WoW version of housing. Do I have to go into garrisons?  Yes?  Okay, but I’ll keep it brief. For the first decade of the game, Blizz insisted housing was bad because it took people out of the world into their own private spaces, and Blizz wanted a lively active world with a mass of itinerant adventurers hanging around visibly in Stormwind and Orgrimmar. (Side quest: If Blizz made WoW today would they have bothered with multiple home towns?  Gnomes and Trolls didn’t even get home towns to start with, and later Gilneans, Goblins, and Pandas only got starting areas.) But people kept asking and asking, so my unproven pet theory about garrisons is that they were put into the game to prove that point, because that is exactly what garrisons did; they pulled people out of the public areas into their own private instances. I mean sure, garrisons also destroyed crafting and piled on a huge number of regular tasks that the game would nag you about so you felt like you had to keep doing them in order to keep up making the expansion feel like a grind of trivial tasks… but Blizzard like that part… at least the trivial tasks part.  That grew and expanded so that retail is now a constant treadmill of FOMO, which, if I examine my feelings, is part of while retail has lost its appeal for me… but that is a whole different discussion. So Blizz went into Legion saying “no more of that solo location crap” and gave us class bunkers where we were forced to hang out with people who had made the same mistakes in picking back in 2004 and were now trapped into carrying on by the sunk cost fallacy. Which means, if nothing else, housing won’t be “garrisons plus” or something like that.  Or I hope that is what it means.  Damn if Blizz doesn’t learn the wrong lessons from things as often as not. Anyway, a thousand words into this I want to finally explore the idea of what housing might possibly mean in Azeroth. First, I am sure it will be instanced.   I mean, it will pretty much have to be instanced.  I know, there is a faction out there that won’t be happy unless they have an exclusive, in the world, everybody who walks by has to see it and know it is yours, homestead… but that is not going to happen. In the world housing is awesome in our little shared co-op games like Valheim, where there aren’t 20K other people vying for the perfect location.  But in a shared world MMORPG, no.  Never again.  We’ve all heard enough about scarcity problems in FFXIV and have seen some of the bad solutions.  I’m sorry SWG fans, but your housing was ugly, being literally a suburban sprawl blight on the land, a series of interchangeable housing units that felt more like a junkyard than a town. The Tatooine trailer park So I am going to take it as read that housing will be instanced.  That comes with its own set of problems, but they are solvable problems… or at least problems that can be mitigated fairly well.  I will stipulated to somebody complaining every day on r/wow about housing being instanced with the same people adding their voice in the comments.  They will be ignored. How it will be instanced is up in the air, but I suspect that it will be more like garrisons than the doors of EverQuest II, though maybe there will be an approach like New World, which would be fine. I am going to guess it won’t be instanced neighborhoods like LOTRO and EQ use.  That seems like a neat idea when housing first shows up and is active.  But once things settle down and you find yourself in version 238 of your particular neighborhood where all the neighbors have moved out so it is you nice little place and a bunch of undecorated lots, things seem less interesting. But I guess neighborhoods could be okay, done correctly.  This is an opportunity for Blizz to have learned from others and to improve on the state of the art. All of which is still not the heart of the matter.  Implementation could be done well, but will mean nothing if housing doesn’t offer something that players want.  Garrisons were customizable in that you could choose what was there, but nothing was unique to your garrison.  The limitations on your customization were such that every garrison felt pretty much like another.  There was no possibility to put your own mark on things in what you chose and how you arranged it really.  I like the ability for chaos and custom arrangement. The holiday spirit all year round in my EQII house This is usually the pass/fail point for me on MMO housing.  I have seen too much garbage, generic, limited, do nothing, housing schemes that the developers shouldn’t have wasted their time with, implementations that basically stole resources from other, more fruitful endeavors. I know there is a “some housing is better than no housing” feeling out there for some, but I reject that, if only because I know that no feature is free.  It costs time and money to develop and time and money to maintain.  There is no such thing as a feature you can leave unattended forever.  At a minimum all features need to be checked when foundational changes are made to the game, and all live service games get those on a regular basis. So Blizz has to make something that is engaging enough to be worth the maintenance, unless we just want to see it left behind like garrisons or farms or so many other features that lasted for an expansion. I would be encouraged if we got a leak that perhaps this housing was somehow related or repurposed from Blizzard’s unannounced (and later cancelled) survival game.  That would possibly indicate something serious in the works. In my own ideal scenario we would get something with free form decorating options like EQII or Rift, crafting related to furniture and other decor pieces, and some way to mount or otherwise display trophies from the past.  As noted, the way New World did decor would be a good implementation to copy. My worry is that it will be a superficial run at housing, a generic rework of garrisons where the options are limited such that every place looks the same and all you get are some battle pets wandering around. This could be a big deal, and a feature that some fans have been waiting for 20 years to see. What is on your housing wishlist for Azeroth?",

have an exclusive, in the world, everybody who walks by has to see it and know it is yours, homestead… but that is not going to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the world housing is awesome in our little shared co-op games like \u003cem\u003eValheim\u003c/em\u003e, where there aren’t 20K other people vying for the perfect location.  But in a shared world MMORPG, no.  Never again.  We’ve all heard enough about scarcity problems in FFXIV and have seen some of the bad solutions.  I’m sorry \u003cem\u003eSWG\u003c/em\u003e fans, but your housing was ugly, being literally a suburban sprawl blight on the land, a series of interchangeable housing units that felt more like a junkyard than a town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\"

id=\"caption-attachment-19887\"\u003eThe Tatooine trailer park\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I am going to take it as read that housing will be instanced.  That comes with its own set of problems, but they are solvable problems… or at least problems that can be mitigated fairly well.  I will stipulated to somebody complaining every day on r/wow about housing being instanced with the same people adding their voice in the comments.  They will be ignored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow it will be instanced is up in the air, but I suspect that it will be more like garrisons than the doors of \u003cem\u003eEverQuest II\u003c/em\u003e, though maybe there will be an approach like \u003cem\u003eNew World\u003c/em\u003e, which would be fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am going to guess it won’t be instanced neighborhoods like \u003cem\u003eLOTRO\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eEQ\u003c/em\u003e use.  That seems like a neat idea when housing first shows up and is active.  But once things settle down and you find yourself in version 238 of your particular neighborhood where all the neighbors have moved out so it is you nice little place and a bunch of undecorated lots, things seem less interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I guess neighborhoods could be okay, done correctly.  This is an opportunity for Blizz to have learned from others and to improve on the state of the art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of which is still not the heart of the matter.  Implementation could be done well, but will mean nothing if housing doesn’t offer something that players want.  Garrisons were customizable in that you could choose what was there, but nothing was unique to your garrison.  The limitations on your customization were such that every garrison felt pretty much like another.  There was no possibility to put your own mark on things in what you chose and how you arranged it really.  I like the ability for chaos and custom arrangement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_124791\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

id=\"caption-attachment-124791\"\u003eThe holiday spirit all year round in my EQII house\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is usually the pass/fail point for me on MMO housing.  I have seen too much garbage, generic, limited, do nothing, housing schemes that the developers shouldn’t have wasted their time with, implementations that basically stole resources from other, more fruitful endeavors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know there is a “some housing is better than no housing” feeling out there for some, but I reject that, if only because I know that no feature is free.  It costs time and money to develop and time and money to maintain.  There is no such thing as a feature you can leave unattended forever.  At a minimum all features need to be checked when foundational changes are made to the game, and all live service games get those on a regular basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Blizz has to make something that is engaging enough to be worth the maintenance, unless we just want to see it left behind like garrisons or farms or so many other features that lasted for an expansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would be encouraged if we got a leak that perhaps this housing was somehow related or repurposed from \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2022/01/26/blizzard-announces-an-unannounced-survival-game/\"\u003eBlizzard’s unannounced (and later cancelled) survival game\u003c/a\u003e.  That would possibly indicate something serious in the works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my own ideal scenario we would get something with free form decorating options like \u003cem\u003eEQII\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eRift\u003c/em\u003e, crafting related to furniture and other decor pieces, and some way to mount or otherwise display trophies from the past.  As noted, the way \u003cem\u003eNew World\u003c/em\u003e did decor would be a good implementation to copy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy worry is that it will be a superficial run at housing, a generic rework of garrisons where the options are limited such that every place looks the same and all you get are some battle pets wandering around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis could be a big deal, and a feature that some fans have been waiting for 20 years to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is on your housing wishlist for Azeroth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
