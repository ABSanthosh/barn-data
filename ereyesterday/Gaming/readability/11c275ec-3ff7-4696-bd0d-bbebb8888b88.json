This is the one item that makes or breaks the level of comfort you have while working or playing games at a desk, and if you don't choose wisely, it's easy to end up with back pain. As part of Wayfair's Back to School Sale, you can save up to $400 off select office chairs right now. If your chair is on its last legs, this is an excellent time to upgrade your workspace. This Wayfair Sale only lasts through Sunday, July 20. We likely won't see deals this good again until Labor Day sales at the end of August, so this is a good chance to save on office furniture if you can't wait until then. And with new tariffs potentially arriving in the U.S. on August 1, these could very well be some of the lowest prices we see at Wayfair for the rest of 2025.Save on Office Chairs at the Wayfair Back to School SaleWayfair Desk \u0026 Office Chair SaleAs mentioned, these deals are part of Wayfair's Back to School deals, and if you've been looking for a new chair, it's worth a look.

This depends on what you plan on doing at your desk. If you aim to only work, it's probably best to get an office chair. However, if you wish to use your desk to play on your PC or console, a gaming chair could be a great addition. Often, you'll find that despite having numerous enticing features, gaming chairs have a hard time rivaling the comfort and support you can get from a quality office chair.Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.
