Well, it's back and on sale again. Hate it or love it, snails are all the rage right now. Amazon is giving people what they want: slashing prices on skincare enthusiasts' favorite snail goo during Black Friday weekend/Early Cyber Monday. (That, and, Target's exclusive Taylor Swift vinyl and book release announcement of her Eras tour, of course.)People seem to be obsessed with this brand and line of products, as COSRX continues to get praise from beauty publishers and fans alike. And, there are different types of this Snail Mucin for different skin types and needs, such as acne, anti-aging, skin-tightening and hyperpigmentation (dark spots) correction.The Popular Snail Mucin is % OffCOSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence There's a limited-time deal on the viral skincare product (3.38 fl.oz 100ml bottle). Get it for yourself or give it as a unique gift, and see what all the fuss is about.Image via COSRX on AmazonI will let the thousands of positive reviews speak for themselves here, but there really isn't really a catch to this unique skincare product. If it doesn't gross you out too much and can help your skin feel hydrated and moisturized, it's really more of a question of \"why not?\" Is it time for you to try snail slime?Snail mucin is not the only big ticket item on sale at Amazon right now, either. You can get everything from vacuums to fitness deals, TVs to PS5s, streaming subscriptions to LEGO sets, and much more during Amazon's Black Friday sale.What to Expect on Cyber MondayAs Black Friday continues for big retailers throughout the weekend, keep an eye on video game deals specifically from Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox. Waiting for Cyber Monday is risky as the hottest gaming deals tend to sell out fast. This is why Black Friday tends to be the better time to buy video games. Also be sure to check out streaming deals before they expire!When does Black Friday end and Cyber Monday begin?It depends, but Black Friday tends to end between Saturday, Nov 30 and Sunday, Nov 31 for most retailers. As we inch closer to the end of the biggest consumer holiday, it's smart to keep in mind what each big retailer is planning, when their Black Friday sales end, and when certain Cyber Monday deals begin. As IGN's Commerce Manager, Eric Song states in his Black Friday deals post: \"I've worked through numerous Black Fridays over the years, and my experience has always been the same: about half of the deals end on Black Friday at midnight, and the other half will stay live through the weekend and end on Cyber Monday.Lindsey (she/her) is IGN's Director of Audience Development and Commerce.
