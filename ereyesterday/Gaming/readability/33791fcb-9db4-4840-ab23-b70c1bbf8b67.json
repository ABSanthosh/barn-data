Fantasy Critic League – Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games As noted in the headline, the first place position changed this week… which was totally expected, but we’ll get to that shortly.  First, the scoreboard as it stood at the end of last week. The Standings for Week 18 We left of with Bhagpuss in first position, with four titles released, one of only two players that far along. And then came Doom: The Dark Ages, which gave Potshot his fourth release. Doom: The Dark Ages has released! [Picked by Hare Brained Schemes (p0tsh0t)] Early reviews put it at a score of 85.7 last week and that has crept up to 87, easily enough to put Potshot in the lead once more. Hare Brained Schemes (p0tsh0t) Score has gone UP from 46.9 to 63.1 Moved from 2nd place to 1st place Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss) Moved from 1st place to 2nd place The only other activity on the board was a release update. Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra [Picked by Rusty Shackleford (Shilgrod)] Estimated release date changed from ‘2025’ to ‘Early 2026’. That led to the only activity for picks and bids as that title was quickly dropped. Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra [Picked by Rusty Shackleford (Shilgrod)] Drop Successful That left the scoreboard looking like this at the end of the week. The Standings for Week 19 As noted, the launch of Doom: The Dark Ages was enough to put Potshot back into first place.  However, the league estimate is still giving Bhagpuss the nod for an overall end of season first position finish. Meanwhile, showing how the estimates work… or the flaw in them… Shilgrod’s end of season estimate put them in 8th place, up one spot, and their estimated score went from 57.92 to 62.34 after dropping a title without replacement. Part of the algorithm includes the idea that you’re going to pick something decent for your remaining empty spots. That brings us to next week and what week twenty will deliver. Upcoming for Week 20 We have releases coming up on Tuesday and Wednesday, so we may see something change on the scoreboard. The big deal will probably be the following week however, as Elden Ring: Nightreign will hit, as that is both a much anticipated sequel and will give Kluwes only their third shipped title, which could put them in contention for the top spot as time goes on.  The game would need a 97 or so to take over the top spot, but a 90 would be a solid entry and would give them a solid platform from which to get to first place.

id=\"caption-attachment-135053\"\u003eUpcoming for Week 20\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have releases coming up on Tuesday and Wednesday, so we may see something change on the scoreboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big deal will probably be the following week however, as \u003cem\u003eElden Ring: Nightreign\u003c/em\u003e will hit, as that is both a much anticipated sequel and will give Kluwes only their third shipped title, which could put them in contention for the top spot as time goes on.  The game would need a 97 or so to take over the top spot, but a 90 would be a solid entry and would give them a solid platform from which to get to first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca
