  "text": "You can't say they're not committed Image credit: Rock Paper Shotgun/GSC Game World It's been four months since Stalker 2 was released, starting life as a really great shooter that had more tech issues than you can shake a stick at, but GSC Game World have kept themselves busy with some hefty patches. The first one alone had almost 2000 fixes, with the second one following that up with more than 1700. As of today, patch 1.3 is here, this time bringing in over 1200 changes, fixes, and improvements. Obviously quite a bit less than the previous two main patches, but a sizable figure nonetheless, and hopefully a sign that the game is getting to a healthy point. Over on Steam, GSC Game World highlighted a few of the more notable changes that come with the patch on Steam, covering a broad range of aspects like AI, general balance, story bits, audio bits, and story progression. On the AI and combat front, mutants' movements during combat are smoother now, and NPCs will have an \"improved\" reaction to hearing the sound of footsteps. Balance wise, A-life encounters will generally be a bit rarer now, and arch artifacts have had a rebalance themselves; weird water has decreased radiation protection, and weird flower has an increased smell masking effect now for example. There's also a bug that could let players \"permanently stack the effect of unequipped artifacts\" that has been fixed now too. I really can't list out all of the other patch notes here as there's just too many, which continues to be impressive work from GSC Game World. You can check the full patch notes if you're that desperate to take in every single change. And in case you were wondering, this won't be the last update either, CSC Game World did also note that they have already started working on the next update.",
