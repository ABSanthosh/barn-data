Announced on Marvel’s stage at New York Comic Con today, our latest entry in the critically acclaimed Marvel’s Spider-Man franchise arrives on PC January 30, 2025 via Steam and the Epic Games Store – wishlist now. Once again, we’re happy to share the PC version is being developed and optimized by our friends at Nixxes Software in close collaboration with Insomniac Games, PlayStation, and Marvel Games.  “Bringing Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales to a new audience on PC together with Insomniac and Marvel Games has been a great experience for us at Nixxes,” says Julian Huijbregts, Community Manager at Nixxes. “We are excited to continue this collaboration and bring Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 to PC with a suite of enhanced features, including enhanced ray-tracing options, to take full advantage of a variety of setups and configurations. Stay tuned for more details on features and recommended specs closer to launch.” Speaking of launch, two editions of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 will be available when it launches on PC, including the Standard Edition and Digital Deluxe Edition (DDE). Players will also have the option to upgrade to the DDE content, similar to our upgrade paths on PS5. Here’s a quick breakdown of what’s included in each: Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 – Standard Edition The complete game All the latest updates since Marvel Spider-Man 2’s PS5 launch, including: 12 new suits New Game+ Ultimate Levels New Symbiote Suit Styles Time of Day options Post-Game Achievements Action Figure Mode in Photo Mode Screen Reader and Audio Descriptions Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 – Digital Deluxe Edition The complete game with updates listed above 5 exclusive suits for Peter Parker 5 exclusive suits for Miles Morales Early unlock for the Arachknight Suit (Peter) Early unlock for the Shadow-Spider Suit (Miles) Early unlock for the Web Grabber gadget +5 skill points  Additional Photo Mode items “Showcasing our characters to as many fans as possible, in the coolest ways possible, are some of the reasons they are so beloved. In that spirit, we’re excited that our Spider Heroes, their friends, and their Super Villains are coming to PC in the critically acclaimed Marvel’s Spider-Man 2,” says Eric Monacelli, Executive Producer for Marvel Games. “Collaborating with Insomniac Games and PlayStation produced a timeless Super Hero video game classic that, thanks to Nixxes and the support of all teams involved, players can now experience on PC with thrilling enhanced features.” Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is a continuation of our Peter Parker and Miles Morales story featuring iconic foes such as Venom and Kraven, as well as many returning favorites. We introduced all-new abilities and traversal options such as Symbiote Surge and Web Wings, and we’ve also expanded Marvel’s New York with new boroughs and side missions to explore. While we have no additional story content planned for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, we’re delighted to bring all of our previously released post-launch content to the PC version, including New Game+, new suits and color variants, Photo Mode features, and more.We’re also delighted to announce that the Fly N’ Fresh Suit Pack, our charity collab with non-profit Gameheads, will be available for PS5 players in October and PC on launch at no additional cost. In the year since launching Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 on PlayStation 5, the game has received critical acclaim, numerous awards and nominations, and praise from fans all around the world. For us, it’s an honor to see players around the world share their love for our original take on Spider-Man and continue to share their favorite moments as they experience the game the first, second, and third time.  “Our amazing partners at Nixxes have once again done an incredible job bringing the world of Marvel’s Spider-Man to PC players,” says Mike Fitzgerald, Core Technology Director at Insomniac. “Our team put a lot of love into this game, and we’re excited that it will soon be enjoyed by a whole new audience with keyboard and mouse controls, ultra widescreen support, and numerous graphical options that make it feel at home on their platform.” As we approach the PC launch of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, we want to thank players for their support of our games and studio, especially amid Insomniac Games’ 30th anniversary celebrations. Together, we’ve flown to distant realms, explored galaxies, discovered new dimensions, and saved entire cities. Our players have been a key constant throughout three decades, so on behalf of Insomniac Games…. thank you! Trending Stories",
