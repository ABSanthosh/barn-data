  "text": "The threat of a new year looms and the promise of hundreds more television shows remains true. 2025 will see the long awaited return of a whole host of shows, including the likes of Severance, Peacemaker, Mythic Quest and Yellowjackets. Shows will end (so long, Cobra Kai, thanks for all of the karate drama) and shows will have series premieres (welcome Ironheart, we’re so excited to have you in the MCU), and about halfway through the year you’ll be asking yourself how you can possibly keep up with it all. And, though the answer is very probably that you can’t, I’m here to help you at least remain organized while you try. Read on for our most anticipated TV shows of 2025, their premiere dates, and where to stream them. The below release dates or lack thereof are accurate at the time of publish, but remember that Hollywood is fickle and all of the below — especially the shows slated for later in the year or without any release date at all — could play musical chairs several times before actually airing.Severance Season 2 (January 17 on Apple TV+)Our long, national nightmare is over: Severance Season 2 is finally right around the corner. We’ll be kicking off the year with a return to Lumon after Season 1’s monumental cliffhanger, but a real hurdle that Severance is going to have to clear is that the extremely intricate series will have last aired nearly three years ago by the time Season 2 drops. Here’s our Severance Season 1 ending explained to help out in that department, and stay tuned for some previews on what’s most important to remember before we head into Season 2. Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man (January 29 on Disney+)The latest animated entry into the MCU may be taking place in a different timeline, but it promises to continue X-Men ‘97’s resurgence of the Saturday morning cartoons of yore. The premise of the upcoming series wonders what would happen to young Peter Parker if Norman Osborn became his mentor rather than Tony Stark. Hudson Thames, who formerly appeared in the MCU’s What If…? Anthology, will reprise his role as Parker. Mythic Quest Season 4 (January 29 on Apple TV+) Like Severance, it’s been a good long time since we’ve seen our friends over at Mythic Quest Studios. Their Season 3 finale back in early 2023 saw Poppy (Charlotte Nicdao) and Ian (Rob McElhenny) give up on their new game Playpen only to return to Mythic Quest Studios to use their new creation as an expansion to the company’s titular game, the studio’s movie adaptation fell through, and Dana (Imani Hakim) left the company to create her own game with several other Mythic Quest staffers. It was an ending of change for the Mythic Quest team, and it’s been hanging in the air for quite some time. Mythic Quest: Side Quest (March 26 on Apple TV+)Mythic Quest (the series) will have its own expansion debuting later in 2025 on March 26. Side Quest (formerly titled Mere Mortals) is written by Mythic Quest series regulars Ashly Burch, John Howell Harris, and Katie McElhenney. The series will feature an entirely separate cast of characters and will focus on the employees, players and fans whose lives have been impacted by Mythic Quest.Invincible Season 3 (February 6 on Prime Video) Season 2 of Invincible saw a softer reception compared to Season 1, but the fractured attention of the audience wasn’t due to a drop in quality. On the heels of a long gap between seasons, Prime Video dropped the second season in two parts with a four month hiatus between the two. We’re 100% for weekly episode drops in these parts, but splitting up an eight-episode season like that really hurt viewership. Still, fans seem hyped for the series’ Season 3 return, with the upcoming chapter’s CCPX trailer receiving a very warm welcome from folks missing Mark, Eve and their friends. Here’s hoping those crazy kids work things out in Season 3. (And, no, there will be no weird hiatus in Season 3!) Cobra Kai Season 6 Part 3 (February 13 on Netflix)Prime Video may have learned its lesson when it comes to dropping their seasons in parts with huge gaps in between, but Netflix sure hasn’t! If you’re still engaged after November’s Season 6 Part 2 of Cobrai Kai and wondering when the heck you’ll finally see the ending to the karate drama series, it’s coming your way in February. Because yes, Season 6 is Cobra Kai’s last… though a new Karate Kid theatrical movie, Karate Kid: Legends, is coming in May with Ralph Macchio and Jackie Chan starring.Yellowjackets Season 3 (February 14 on Paramount+ and Showtime)After Season 2’s unbearable loss of adult [redacted], the surviving Yellowjackets must face a new challenge a woman down in Season 3. The series has never been for the faint of heart with cannibalism and survival playing heavy roles as the team of young soccer stars fight to return home in the past and, evidently, fight to stay alive in the present. As is customary for the show, we don’t yet know the nature of the threat looming over the remaining survivors in Season 3. But I’m betting things are going to get gnarly. Gnarlier? Whatever. It’s gonna get dark. Suits L.A. (February 23 on NBC, Possibly Peacock)That’s right, there’s a show on this list that, at the time of publishing, is solely debuting on linear television. That could change, as NBC and Peacock are a part of the same company but, for now, you might have to find a cable solution if you’re one of the eleventy people who binged the original Suits in 2024. Suits L.A. will actually mark the second spinoff of the series, as Pearson (the Jessica-centric spinoff featuring Gina Torres’ character) aired for one season back in 2019. The official logline for Suits L.A. isn’t available at this time, but you can feel safe in your assumption that it will be lawyers doing lawyer stuff. The series stars Stephen Amell (the [expletive] Green Arrow) as Ted Black.Daredevil: Born Again (March 4 on Disney+)The Avocados at Law are back, and Hell’s Kitchen remains under the watchful eye of Charlie Cox’s Daredevil. The Man Without Fear will take on Wilson Fisk’s (Vincent D’Onofrio) Kingpin once again as the former mob boss shifts his attention from organized crime to a life in politics in New York. We know that Foggy, Karen and Frank Castle will be back in action in Daredevil: Born Again, but are yet to receive confirmation on whether or not She-Hulk will be visiting with Matt Murdock between cases. Andor Season 2 (April 22 on Disney+)Star Wars’ most essential viewing is poised to return in April as we continue to follow Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) on his journey as a member of the resistance. Season 2 will see the return of fan-favorite snarky droid K-2S0 (Alan Tudyk) from Rogue One and march our complicated heroes closer to the fate that awaits them on Scarif. Devil May Cry (April)The animated adaptation of the beloved video game Devil May Cry will be headed to Netflix sometime in April of next year, but with a small caveat: Reuben Langdon, the American voice actor for the series’ lead, Dante, will not be reprising his role for the show. Instead, they’ll be using Johnny Yong Bosch (who traditionally voices Nero). Beyond that voice-acting shakeup, we don’t know a ton of details on the series yet. Adi Shankar, known for Netflix’s Castlevania series, will act as the showrunner for Devil May Cry. Shankar is also attached to Netflix’s long-dormant Assassin’s Creed adaptation.The Last of Us Season 2 (Spring on Max)The devil may cry, but we’re all certainly going to be crying come spring and the long-awaited return of The Last of Us. The real question headed into Season 2 is whether or not the series will stick to the game’s devastating story or if the show will decide to go in its own direction after making Joel considerably more sympathetic in Season 1. But, if you’re unfamiliar with the game and have no clue what I’m talking about, I recommend you head into the premiere episode with a box of tissues just to be safe. No matter what happens, it’s certainly not gonna be a happy story.A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (June 15 on Max)Game of Thrones prequels will continue until morale improves! And no, you’re probably never getting The Winds of Winter or A Dream of Spring (the last planned books of the A Song of Ice and Fire series) because, yes, George R.R. Martin seems to be heavily involved in the show. A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms will adapt Martin's Tales of Dunk and Egg novellas, and stars Peter Claffey as Dunk and Dexter Sol Ansell as Egg. If TV shows had shorts in the same way movies do, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms would likely be one of them as it only consists of six episodes. It’s currently unknown how long those episodes will be, but expect them to be similar to House of the Dragon in length. Ironheart (June 24 on Disney+)We’ve been missing Dominique Thorne’s Riri Williams since Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, so the fact that her show is right around the corner is very exciting. Ironheart will see the young genius heading back to Chicago, where she’ll find herself in some trouble of both the technological and magical varieties. Joining Thorne in the series will be Anthony Ramos as Parker Robbins aka The Hood (read: the guy that gets Riri into trouble), Lyric Ross as Riri’s bestie Natalie, and Alden Ehrenreich as, hold on, let me check my notes here: Joe McGillicuddy. Ironheart will be the end of the MCU’s Phase 5.Eyes of Wakanda (August 6 on Disney+)The MCU’s second animated series of the year will be coming your way August 6 in the form of Eyes of Wakanda. The series will follow Wakanda’s Hatut Zaraze, warriors who carry out dangerous missions around the world on behalf of their country and seek various vibranium artifacts throughout time. Immediately following Ironheart means that Eyes of Wakanda will be the first TV series in Marvel’s Phase 6. The series will only consist of four episodes and is developed and executive produced by Ryan Coogler.Peacemaker Season 2 (August on Max)Remember how dewy-eyed we were when we put Peacemaker Season 2 on this list two years ago? We were so young back then. So hopeful. Anyway! It’s finally happening for real this time. (We checked. Thrice.) John Cena’s Christopher Smith and his merry band of misfits are returning to Max for Peacemaker Season 2 in August, shortly after James Gunn’s Superman film kicks off the live-action DCU on July 11. Gunn clarified with IGN’s Scott Collura recently that most of Peacemaker Season 1 is canon and the rest of the series will be too.The Witcher Season 4 (Summer on Netflix)Netflix's The Witcher series viewership may have plummeted over the years, but Season 4 is coming whether you’re ready for Liam Hemsworth’s take on Geralt or not. Hemsworth is, of course, perfectly capable of taking on the role, but it’s hard to see the series surviving such a massive character change when fans of The Witcher had taken to Henry Cavill’s version of Geralt in the way that they did. Still, that (apparently very kidnappable) Ciri isn’t going to save herself! (Ciri does, in fact, save herself.)Alien: Earth (Summer on FX and Hulu)The Alien franchise heads to the small screen with this prequel series helmed by Noah Hawley (Bones, Fargo, Legion, etc.). The creator continues his longstanding partnership with FX (and, by proxy, Hulu) with the new Alien series, which boasts a logline of “when a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet’s greatest threat.”Marvel Zombies (October on Disney+)The MCU’s third animated project of the year takes on the form of Marvel Zombies, a spinoff from What If…? that, as you’ve likely guessed, builds off of the aforementioned series’ popular zombies episode. Key characters appearing in the series will be Shang-Chi’s Katy as well as Shang-Chi himself, Red Guardian, Wanda Maximoff, Jimmy Woo, Yelena Belova, Kate Bishop, Riri Williams, and Kamala Khan. Meanwhile, the Zombies will include Clint Barton’s Hawkeye, Steve Rogers’ Captain America, Abomination, Ghost, Captain Marvel, Ikarus and Okoye. Wonder Man (December on Disney+)Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Guest’s Wonder Man was initially meant to be a 2024 release, but was ultimately delayed due to the 2023 Writers Guild Strike. After wrapping up in April of 2024, the series is set to hit Disney+ toward the very end of 2025 and will remain a part of Phase 6 despite its initially planned release. The series doesn’t have a logline just yet, but it will star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Wonder Man, an Avenger and movie star in the comics, and Ben Kingsley will return as Trevor Slattery.One Piece Season 2 (December on Netflix)Season 2 of the wildly popular live-action adaptation of the One Piece manga and anime will drop about a year from now on Netflix. Luffy (Iñaki Gaddoy) and his crew of Straw Hat Pirates will continue their quest for the One Piece, the fabled piece of treasure that, when found, will bestow the title of King of the Pirates onto its finder. Other Shows We’re Excited For In 2025 (That Currently Don’t Have A Release Window)Hazbin Hotel Season 2 (On Prime Video)Charlie and her ragtag band of demons return as they continue the fight to save sinners souls in Season 2 of the wildly popular adult animated series. Percy Jackson and the Olympians Season 2 (On Disney+)Percy, Annabeth and Grover’s path only gets harder in Season 2. They may have stopped Zues and Ares’ war in Season 1, but Season 2 takes on the story of Rick Riordan’s Sea of Monsters. The adventure may be about to get more difficult, but we’ll meet new heroes Tyson and Thalia along the way. Anne Rice’s The Talamasca (On AMC+)AMC’s Vampire Chronicles universe continues to expand, with The Talamasca joining Interview with the Vampire and Mayfair Witches. Not a ton is known about the series just yet, but we met the Talamasca — a secret society focused on research of the paranormal.IT: Welcome to Derry (On Max)Set in the same canon as IT and IT Chapter 2, IT: Welcome to Derry will explore the era when Derry first became cursed by the presence of Pennywise the Clown. Stranger Things Season 5 (On Netflix)The Netflix sensation finally comes to an end with Season 5, which is for the best given that all of those kids are full grown adults at this point. With that in mind, there will be a time jump between Seasons 4 and 5 to justify the age difference. Beyond that and the fact that it will be very focused on the lore of the Upside Down, we don’t know much.The Bear Season 4 (On Hulu)We know The Bear Season 4 is happening, and we assume it will happen in 2025, but we don’t actually know a dang thing about it yet. I can provide one, major spoiler though: it will stress you out. Wednesday Season 2 (On Netflix)Plot twist: We barely know anything about Wednesday Season 2 either. There might be more Addams family members joining the fray, there will be more Morticia and Gomez with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman being promoted to series regular, and Jenna Ortega is now a producer on the show after insisting that it get more horror focused and less boy crazy.",

John Cena’s Christopher Smith and his merry band of misfits are returning to Max for Peacemaker Season 2 in August, shortly after James Gunn’s Superman film kicks off the live-action DCU on July 11. Gunn clarified with IGN’s Scott Collura recently that \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/james-gunn-clarifies-almost-all-peacemaker-is-canon-justice-league\"\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cem\u003emost \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu\u003eof Peacemaker Season 1 is canon\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and the rest of the series will be too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003coutput data-cy=\"article-video\"\u003e\u003c/output\u003e\u003ch2 data-cy=\"title2\"\u003eThe Witcher Season 4 (Summer on Netflix)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eNetflix\u0026#39;s The Witcher series viewership may have plummeted over the years, but Season 4 is coming whether you’re ready for Liam Hemsworth’s take on Geralt or not. Hemsworth is, of course, perfectly capable of taking on the role, but it’s hard to see the series surviving such a massive character change when fans of The Witcher had taken to Henry Cavill’s version of Geralt in the way that they did. Still, that (apparently very kidnappable) Ciri isn’t going to save herself! (Ciri does, in fact, save herself.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-cy=\"title2\"\u003eAlien: Earth (Summer on FX and Hulu)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThe Alien franchise heads to the small screen with this prequel series helmed by Noah Hawley (Bones, Fargo, Legion, etc.). The creator continues his longstanding partnership with FX (and, by proxy, Hulu) with the new Alien series, which boasts a logline of “when a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet’s greatest threat.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-cy=\"title2\"\u003eMarvel Zombies (October on Disney+)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThe MCU’s third animated project of the year takes on the form of Marvel Zombies, a spinoff from What If…? that, as you’ve likely guessed, builds off of the aforementioned series’ popular zombies episode. Key characters appearing in the series will be Shang-Chi’s Katy as well as Shang-Chi himself, Red Guardian, Wanda Maximoff, Jimmy Woo, Yelena Belova, Kate Bishop, Riri Williams, and Kamala Khan. Meanwhile, the Zombies will include Clint Barton’s Hawkeye, Steve Rogers’ Captain America, Abomination, Ghost, Captain Marvel, Ikarus and Okoye. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-cy=\"title2\"\u003eWonder Man (December on Disney+)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eDestin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Guest’s Wonder Man was initially meant to be a 2024 release, but was ultimately delayed due to the 2023 Writers Guild Strike. After wrapping up in April of 2024, the series is set to hit Disney+ toward the very end of 2025 and will remain a part of Phase 6 despite its initially planned release. The series doesn’t have a logline just yet, but it will star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Wonder Man, an Avenger and movie star in the comics, and Ben Kingsley will return as Trevor Slattery.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-cy=\"title2\"\u003eOne Piece Season 2 (December on Netflix)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eSeason 2 of the wildly popular live-action adaptation of the One Piece manga and anime will drop about a year from now on Netflix.
