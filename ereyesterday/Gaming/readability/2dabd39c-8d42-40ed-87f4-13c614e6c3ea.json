(And totally not to hide the fact that Facebook profited greatly along the way as it helped elect Donald Trump.) So, yeah, I do want to harp a bit on the fact that his dream of having a place where he could be a real boy… or the one person with legs in a legless world… appears to be falling by the wayside at last. Zuckerberg goes to France and Spain Meta Horizon Worlds is reported to be a ghost town these days… not at the level of Decentraland as an abject failure, but not too far off… and the losses continue to pile up at the Reality Labs division, which has burned through more than $60 billion since 2020. I mean sure, the rest of Facebook spins enough money through selling user data so that MAGA political operatives can target your crazy uncle with ads about Obama being a Muslim operative sent to undermine America.  Meta still makes money by the dump truck load. But seriously, there is a whole division of Meta that, if they simply had fired everybody in 2020 and done nothing, would yielded the company an additional $60 billion in profit.  There is no economic measurement by which all of the effort into VR has ended up making a bit of sense.  Even John Carmack, who was the leading VR proponent, was skeptical of this whole drang nach metaverse the industry got caught up in a couple of years back. But Carmack was kicked out, toadies willing to implement the Zuck vision of the future without objection were brought in, and $60 billion… well, it wasn’t set on fire.  It did go into paychecks and into the economy rather than being hidden away in some VC’s Scrooge McDuck value or crypto wallet or whatever the economic vampires on Sand Hill Road do with the capital they siphon off of the economy.  So maybe that was a societal net good?  Better than it going into a billionaire’s pocket. Anyway, that is winding down.  While Zuck is busy chopping 5% of Meta staff in general… somebody must have given him a copy of Jack Welch’s book about keeping your staff productive by making them live in a constant state of fear and desperate competition with each other… the Reality Labs team is getting special attention on the layoff front. Instead, Meta is jumping into the AI pool with all of the other chum, and Zuck will be turning to his legion of Facebook zombies as the potential market for it, because he thinks everybody is as alienated and alone as he is. So let’s get to the money quote already, the one that everybody was talking about for 15 minutes on Thursday. The average American has fewer than three friends, fewer than three people they would consider friends. Mark Zukerberg, various sources The discourse online started with the idea that the average American only has three friends, then somebody pointed out that he actually said “fewer” than three friends, that three is not a level that most of us manage. This to me, like his obsession with a VR world where he could be whoever he wanted… which is to say, anybody but himself I suppose… is a cry for help as much as anything. I mean sure, it can be hard to feel sorry for the petulant billionaire man child, and interpretations varied. Mark Zuckerberg saying “actually no one has friends” is at “the female orgasm doesn’t exist” levels of telling on yourself -Claire Willett, Blue Sky [Cue the Ben Shapiro response reel to Cardi B’s WAP where he says his wife told him there is no such thing as a classic case of telling on one’s self.] But the subtext is the same, the assumption that Zuck doesn’t have any friends… or at least knows somewhere in his heart that the people he surrounds himself with are not actual friends by any but the most generous interpretation. And that makes sense.  Friendship actually takes some effort.  You actually have to think about other people, show up places, consider their thoughts and feelings, all of which might come into conflict with your own immediate desires. If you’re a billionaire though, there is an endless supply of sycophants willing to pretend to be your friend, to do whatever you want, and be completely pliable and frictionless, all to be in a position to receive fabulous gifts and trips and cash in exchange for putting up with whatever your mood is and showering you with praise.  People are climbing over each other for that role.  Just follow Zuck or Musk or that type on social media, you’ll be in the thick of sycophant city. I’d call them prostitutes, but prostitutes are clear about their role up front and have limits.  At least in the movies and literature.  (My first hand experience is pretty much limited to a lap dance at the Gold Club up in SF during my bachelor party more than 27 years ago, and somebody else arranged that.  I just had to pretend to enjoy myself.  Says something about me that I was worried about her experience I suppose.) When you have people who are throwing themselves at you to be whatever you want them to be, an actual friend with actual needs and problems and dentist appointments and family obligations that mean they can just run over at any time day or night because you’ve decided you feel like playing Settlers of Catan. Zuck is likely extra susceptible to this, since he was well off at birth and has been rich since college when his “hot or not” web app for rating the attractiveness of his college classmates, his “Face Books” as he called it, took off.  So he’s always had nothing but hangers on around him for almost his entire adult life so far, which has made him especially intolerant of not getting what he wants right now. (Also, it feels like everything he has done is a cry for help from day one.) This general view of him was cemented for me earlier this year when I read Careless People by Sarah Wynn-Williams (which has been part of my obsessive vacillation this year between escapist reading and diving into depressing assessments of our current reality) which not only illustrates Zuck’s intolerance for meeting other people’s needs (he didn’t want to meet with Obama at one point because it would require him to be out the door before noon) and the absolutely awful people with which he has surrounded himself with at Facebook/Meta who seek to indulge Zuck’s every little wish while punishing anybody who won’t 100% go the distance on no notice to do so while making sure they themselves continue to suckle at the cash dispensing teat of the company. Some years back I made a statement about needing to remember that corporations are not your friends.  Well, neither are the people who run them.  You don’t get to that position without being something of a sociopath and, while there are some exceptions to that, the number is small enough to be of little or no consideration.  And Facebook execs are prime examples of the sociopath track. Anyway, read the book if you thought you already hated Facebook.  You will be surprised at how much more hate there is to go around for it. Pulling this back to some kind of point, in a world where you have surrounded yourself with sycophants who praise you ceaselessly, it feels like an AI chat bot is the next level of friction removal.  Even sycophants have to sleep, get sick, or fail to read your mood correctly accidentally praise or agree with the wrong thing.  The human factor is so unpredictable. But AI!  AI has already shown itself to be as careless with the truth as a Trump spokes-model at a White House press conference with MAGA influencers… which, I am sad to say, is an actual thing that is going on now.  If pressed, there is no fact that AI won’t disregard or back down from in order to give the user the answer they want. This is the future I think we’re headed for, with isolated billionaires talking to their AI chat bots which have been trained to conform to their world view and will continue to reinforce it, telling somebody like an aging Zuck that collecting his urine in jars is a completely logical reaction to the state of the world and how much such a process helped Howard Hughes. Or maybe that is too far.  I just know it won’t be good for the rest of us, no matter how much our own personal AI chat bots tell us everything is fine.  As I complained on another forum, we’re not even going to get the horrible dystopian future form Ready Player One, where at least they had cool VR video games in their conex box housing.  No, it is going to be enshittification and AI slop overwhelming us, telling us everything is fine until we’re extinct because the AI will definitely tell us to not look up. Such is my dark take, in any case, when it comes to the embracing of AI for general purpose use. But if you want the TL;DR insight, I made a meme. Mark Zuckerberg’s Official Position Statement So it goes.  At least he hasn’t embraced blockchain.",
