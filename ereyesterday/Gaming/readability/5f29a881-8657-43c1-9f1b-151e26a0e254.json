Pandas are Coming This coincided pretty well with my arrival in Mordor, so what time I have been putting into games this past week… which hasn’t been much because I was traveling and somewhere along the way caught a cold that is now in the constant coughing stage of things… has found me in WoW Classic once more. My plan for Pandaria is pretty much the same plan as has gone before, which is to play through the expansion on a character or three and see how things compare with my memories.  We’ll see if the group comes along as well.  We’re also a bit deep into Enshrouded still… but there doesn’t seem to be any hurry.  If Cataclysm Classic is any measure, we’ll be here for a while before Warlords of Draenor Classic is upon us. I have three characters at level cap for the expansion… and two more who could get there if I felt the need.  Am I feeling the need?  I am not sure.  Maybe dungeons, though we’re now in the part of the classic ride where dungeons didn’t leave much of an impression on me.  There is one in a brewery, right?  Other than that, I’ve got nothing. I need to warm up with at least one of my level cap characters because, as always happens, Blizz revamped the classes so that whatever I learned in Cata is now obsolete. Of course, there is also the new monk class, a three-in-one choice that you can roll up with a fresh panda.  I did that initially and started through the tutorial area, doing the Pandaria things. Knocking others off the poles I ran out of steam on that not too far in however.  I’ll probably go back and at least get out of the starter area so I can collect the mount they are offering.  But at the moment I am not feeling any great need to get a monk up to level cap in time for the launch.  I don’t think I have ever done more than tinker with monks quite frankly. The other new thing that Pandaria brings is pet battles.  This was another thing where I wasn’t sure I would be ready to do it all again or not.  I invested a lot of time into pet battles in retail back in the day… though I really didn’t get rolling on it until Warlords of Draenor, so playing through the Pandaria version might have its charm. So I started out on that over the weekend and was mildly into it.  Blizz did manage to capture some solid aspects of Pokemon battles in its remake of that long running franchise.  It was fun to run around and find some critters to battle, to level up some of the pets I had collected in classic so far… though I miss my BlizzCon pets, stuck over in retail… and get into it. There are a lot of early achievements to grab The only cloud on the horizon for me is that one of the things that really unlocked pet battles for me was an addon called Rematch.  I think Stargrace told me about it back in the day.  It streamlined so much, kept a queue of pets to level up, tracked who you battled, and let you setup teams to use against specific opponents.  It had it all going on. The Rematch addon UI in retail You can see there, on the right side of the window, all the tabs for teams for different areas, plus my Draenor leveling teams shown.  The up arrow on the team means your current level up focused pet is assigned that slot.  Draenor was setup so you could bring a pet to 25 daily. So I went looking for Rematch right away… and it isn’t available for Mists of Pandaria Classic.  It is retail WoW only at this time. Bummer. There are some other pet battle addons available for classic.  Most seem to be invested in helping you catch them all as opposed to building a pet army of extraordinary magnitude. I started working with on called Pet Tracker. Welcome to Pet Tracker That one at least keeps a history of your battles versus NPCs and lets you reload the teams you used previously, so you can build up a team list over time. Pet battles has been most of what I have done since the pre-patch landed.  We’ll see if that changes when we get to the expansion.",
