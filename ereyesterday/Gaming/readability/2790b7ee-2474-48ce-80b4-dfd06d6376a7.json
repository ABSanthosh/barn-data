  "text": "Written By Cristina Anderca Published 3/25/25 Save Midport village from the piglins and earn a cape! Midport Village needs your help! Just like in A MINECRAFT MOVIE, the piglins are attacking the idyllic village and its peaceful inhabitants. In this live event,* it’s up to you and other brave players to fight back against the piglins’ onslaught! Plus, if you complete a total of five challenges and save the village, you’ll receive the Yearn cape! In-game live events take place over limited periods of time on online multiplayer servers, and you can join them via the main menu of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition once they start. Each live event is different, but they often involve a series of mini-games, exclusive rewards, and most importantly, lots of excited fellow players to adventure with! The battle for Midport Village begins on March 25 at 2:30pm PT (10:30pm CET) and ends April 7 at 2 pm PT (11pm CET). If you don’t see the live event, you might need to update your game to the latest version. Upon spawning, Steve will be waiting for you in the village square for a quick battle briefing. Then, it’s up to you to do your part in three fun (but high stakes!) mini-games: Mining with Henry Every settlement under siege requires defenses and weapons, but someone needs to gather the resources to make them first! Could that someone be you? If you're up to the task, meet up with Henry and head into the mineshaft. But don’t forget that mining is hard work, and you need to keep an eye out for any approaching hostile mobs as you collect the resources... As long as you keep your wits about you and your head on a swivel, you’ll be fine! Protecting the payloads with Natalie and Dawn In a crisis, resources must be moved to where they’re needed most, and the cunning piglins know that intercepting these payloads is a great way to sabotage the village! In this mini-game, you need to escort the transport carriages (plus the adorable llamas pulling them) and fight off the waves of piglins charging at them. Meet up with Natalie and Dawn for detailed instructions! Defending the walls with Garrett Where are all these piglins coming from, anyway? Turns out that three huge Nether portals have opened on the outskirts of the village, and vicious piglins are just pouring out of them, ready to tear down your defenses. Help Garrett tackle the piglin problem head-on by grabbing your bow and fighting back from the safety of the defensive wall. Uh-oh, turns out they’re shooting projectiles as well... Maybe try to not stand in one spot for too long, okay? It’s a tough battle but as we all know, everything is much easier (and more fun!) with a fellow adventurer by your side. This live event is open to all Bedrock players, and you can bring some friends along or make some new ones in the village square. Plus, there’s more to do than battle! Despite its current piglin predicament, Midport Village is a bustling settlement filled with shops, unique structures, adorable mobs, and hidden items! Some of them might even help you fight off the piglins... The Yearn cape During the battle for Midport Village, you’ll receive a total of six challenges. Complete them (and perform heroic acts in your fight against the piglins!) and you'll be rewarded with the Yearn cape, featuring stunning art of a mineshaft inspired by Steve’s longing for the mines. You’ll be able to claim your reward once the event is over, and it’ll be available in Bedrock and Java Edition as well, provided you use the same account for both games. You’ll be able to earn the Yearn cape until the live event concludes on April 7. The Home and Menace cape Complete your movie-themed wardrobe with the Home and Menace capes, inspired by Steve’s love for the mines and the Nether portal’s aura of danger. You can get them by watching a Minecraft creator for at least 3 minutes on Twitch and TikTok, respectively. After that, you’ll receive a 5x5 redemption code that you can use to claim your cape. And yes, once redeemed, they’ll be available for your Java Edition avatars too, just like the Yearn cape! The deadline to claim the Home and Menace capes is April 6. Are you ready to enter Midport Village and push back against the Nether’s relentless forces with the heroes of A MINECRAFT MOVIE? Launch Bedrock Edition and join the live event between March 25 and April 7 – and save the village before the piglins win! *This promotion requires Internet, a valid Microsoft account, and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (sold separately) (excludes Minecraft Java Edition). Geography limitations, country and balance restrictions, taxes, and Internet connection fees may apply. Microsoft Services Agreement (aka.ms/MSA) applies. Live events and multiplayer functionality shown require platform-specific online subscriptions (sold separately). Once challenges are achieved, your Minecraft cape will appear on your account for both Bedrock and Java. © WBEI and Legendary (s25). Players must update to the latest Bedrock client (1.21.70) to play the live event.
