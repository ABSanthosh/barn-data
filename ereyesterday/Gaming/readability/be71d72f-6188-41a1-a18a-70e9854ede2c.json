  "text": "Image credit: Disney/Epic Games Exactly a year after the Walt Disney Company announced it was acquiring a $1.5bn USD stake in Epic Games and launched a multi-year partnership to create an \"expansive and open games and entertainment universe connected to Fortnite\", the Fortnite x Disney collaboration event has reportedly moved into a \"stable\" build. Whilst it remains unclear, what, exactly, the collaboration will be, noted Fortnite leaker HypeX said the status change likely comes because \"they probably made a lot of progress and moved into the next roadmap milestone\". Xbox Developer Direct - four promising games also coming to PlayStation.Watch on YouTube At the time the collaboration was announced, explicit mention was made of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and Avatar, with users able to \"create their own stories and experiences, express their fandom in a distinctly Disney way, and share content with each other in ways that they love\". Since then, fans have gone on to form their own theories - or wishlists - including the suggestion by some that we could see a Disney Infinity-esque mode added to the Fortnite, or some kind of persistent \"Disney Metaverse\" to explore. Whatever it is, hopefully we won't have to wait too much longer for the finer details. HypeX also confirmed over the weekend that Fast \u0026 Furious x Fortnite skins are also \"coming soon\". Did you know that Wicked's biggest song features a hidden Fortnite cameo?",
