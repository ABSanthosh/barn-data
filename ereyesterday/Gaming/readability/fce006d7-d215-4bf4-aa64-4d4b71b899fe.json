  "text": "Cyberpunk 2077! Planet Zoo! More! Image credit: Eurogamer/Sony July is here in a waft of warmth (your meteorological mileage may vary), meaning a fresh batch of games has arrived for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers. And it's a pretty exciting month, with CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 making its service debut, alongside the likes of Planet Zoo and Life is Strange studio Don't Nod's well-received Banishers. That's not everything, obviously, and July brings a total of 10 new games across PlayStation Plus' Extra and Premium tiers. Sony's latest catalogue refresh takes place next Tuesday, 15th July (with the exception of Cyberpunk 2077, which arrives a little earlier on 9th July), and you'll find the full list of this month's additions below: PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra: Cyberpunk 2077 (PS5, PS4) Abiotic Factor (PS5) Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden | PS5 Bluey: The Videogame (PS5, PS4) Planet Zoo: Console Edition (PS5) Risk of Rain 2 (PS5, PS4) Tropico 6 (PS5, PS4) New World: Aeternum (PS5) PlayStation Plus Premium: Twisted Metal 3 (PS5, PS4) Twisted Metal 4 (PS5, PS4) So there you go! Cyberpunk 2077 is obviously the biggie, but there's a bunch of other good stuff too. Planet Zoo's a rock-solid management sim, taking Frontier's usually rather lightweight formula and adding some welcome depth (it's also a treat if you just want to build stuff and stare at the beautifully realised animals), and the sun-kissed Tropico 6 is a fine time for genre fans too. Elsewhere, there's Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, which we called a \"poignantly performed story about grief and injustice, where the difficult choices tug at your heart and principles,\" in our four star review. Also worth a look: Abiotic Factor's chaotic co-op survival in the depths of a paranormal research lab, and some similarly frenzied co-op action in Risk of Rain 2. As for this month's Premium-exclusive retro titles, there's cult-classic driving mayhem in Twisted Metal 2 and 3, which launched for the original PlayStation in 1996 and 1998 respectively. And that's your lot! As a reminder, the above don't arrive until next Tuesday, 15th June (aside from Cyberpunk 2077, which is out today) meaning you've still got some time to focus on last month's PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra additions before your attention shifts elsewhere. And as for July's Essential tier offerings, you can read about them here.",
