  "text": "Enter a living galaxy filled with death, challenge and opportunity… and blockchain, always blockchain -EVE Frontier pitch, amended CCP has announced limited time founder’s packs… some of which are even alleged to be of limited supply… in order to get some money up front from suckers for their blockchain scam game, EVE Frontier. EVE Frontier – Install at your own risk I mean, this is a pure FOMO move, limited time, better buy now, and better buy the most expensive one it is both LIMITED SUPPLY and obviously the BEST VALUE… it says so right there.  And if you buy now you get a full ten dollars off!  Get in now of HFBP! For those catching up, EVE Frontier is a blockchain based game being funded by Andreesen Horowitz, which will own the currency exchange being used so they can collect a tax on every transaction, which is and always has been the end goal of blockchain as a technology.  It is there to tax transactions.  Without that blockchain is a slow, expensive, inefficient technology that does nothing we couldn’t do 20 years ago with a reasonably provisioned database. Anyway, CCP was given $40 million by Marc Andreesen to make this and CCP has moved resources away from EVE Online, their only money making venture, to appease the angry Trump funding VC.  The only possible silver lining is that maybe some tech for the scam will be useful to EVE Online and might get integrated some day. You know this is an issue when CCP is out there trying to get people to stop calling EVE Frontier a blockchain game, as they did in an interview with PC Gamer, while at the time trying to pump up the blockchain aspects of the title as, without those, it sounds like yet another low effort attempt to making something else work on the EVE Online IP. Anyway, Founder’s Access begins on Tuesday, December 10th, and if you want in you will need to pay.  You would think, after all the “pay first and maybe there will be a game later” fiascos of the last decade, people would be wary.  But there is a sucker born every minute… probably more than one, given the increase in world population since that phrase was coined… and when you bring in blockchain, there is a whole new army of suckers to be farmed. I guess you can applaud CCP’s attempt to seek a new audience.  Maybe. So if you’re on that list, here is what is up on offer. Take our quiz: What kind of idiot are you? There is a timer on those packs, but I image that is just for the $10 discount.  I am also pretty sure that “limited supply” is a lie, that they will sell as many $99 packs as they can. First off, I am going to suggest that the ultimate irony here is that, unless I am missing it somewhere, that they are kicking of an Etherium based blockchain game and you cannot buy in with Etherium.  It is almost as if crypto has not actual value.  Nope, you need to show up with dollars or Euros because the only value any such currency has is strictly measured in how much real world currency you can get for it.  Blockchain fans like to deride “fiat money” while failing to acknowledge that their own currency is a step below that. So what do you get for your real world dollars?  Let’s show people the grid! Founder levels I guess an early start at launch is something… depending on when launch really is.  Is this launch?  Is closed Alpha a launch? Is there going to be a wipe and a real launch?  How do you do a wipe on the immutable append only database register that is at the core of blockchain?  (Oh, I know. The owners of the exchange, who hold all the voting power, votes to fork… because the code is law until the people with the money say it isn’t.) The fact that they are going to gate dev streams behind a paywall however, that seems like a hot garbage idea, the sort of thing you do when you don’t want to face difficult questions or have people pointing out that you are running a blockchain game.  I mean, CCP can’t even get the mostly docile and subservient gaming press, always so eager for any story and afraid to be denied access if they ask hard questions, to stop calling it a blockchain game. I will never be granted an interview certainly. Otherwise maybe name reservation has some value.  I can see some anxiety about people jumping in and grabbing New Eden famous names in order to farm the integrity of the likes of Chribba for better scam opportunities. You do also get a special founders ship.  Let’s take a look at those. Such ships! I am going to give them a pass on these because I assume these are just the rookie ships and that players will advance into bigger and better ships maybe?  Otherwise they look like stripped down versions of the Bifrost ship model from EVE Online… which they likely are because how else to you bootstrap a whole new online title this fast without a complete asset grab from your current game? A Bifrost zipping about You don’t even get the electric nose hair trimmer attachment for your $99. Anyway, if you want in early to EVE Frontier, that is the only clear path.  Otherwise the Remnants (read: poors, losers, unwashed, or whatever) can sign up and hope to be deemed worthy… literally!  Read the text: We will periodically grant trial access to ‘Remnants’ willing to enter EVE Frontier. Gain access to specific development phases (starting with Closed Alpha), granted selectively to individuals worthy of exploring the Frontier. Trial Access players won’t receive any Founder Pack perks, content or customization options, but will be given the opportunity to experience the evolving universe of EVE Frontier first hand during a limited access window. You might be granted access if you are judged of value… or if they cannot find enough people willing to part with some cash just to play. My objections to the whole idea still stand.  Play to earn incentivizes an unsustainable play style, where people are there to earn money rather than play the game as it is an economic impossibility for people to take more money out of the game than they put in, so it will be scramble to extract maximum value early and screw the late arrivals.  That is the sole reason for concepts like “diamond hands” and “hodlers” Then there is the previously stated fact that blockchain itself is a cumbersome technology, the value of which, beyond being a buzzword that attracts the worst people, is that it is a way to tax transactions. These are my opinions and I have seen nothing so far to shift them.
