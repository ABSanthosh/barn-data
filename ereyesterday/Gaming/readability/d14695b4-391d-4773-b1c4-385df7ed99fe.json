This time around, the Barrow Dyad Exotic mission has been added to the game with the weekly reset, and no prior warning at all.Luckily, we've figured out how to locate the new Derealize Exotic mission, how to start it, and we have a step-by-step guide on how you can get your hands on the bizarre-looking SMG.Nether BlightsIf you've been playing Destiny 2 Episode Heresy already, you'll be familiar with the Nether activity. Formerly, we thought that you'd need to reload it until you spawn at the Trenchway or Hall of Souls, but it seems that you can start the Exotic quest from any landing zone in the Nether; you just might have a bit more of a search on your hands before you can trigger the quest steps.The hidden path to the Blight.You'll want to look for a large Taken Blight. Following some hidden platforms, jump up into it, and look for a plate on the floor after you teleport. If you're struggling to find the route, take out your Ghost and the platforms will briefly show.Symbols and FragmentsYou'll then see a symbol along with a message appearing on your HUD to the lower left. In our case, it said \"Something whispers to the right...\" Step off the plate in the same direction that this message tells you to and you'll be teleported out. You'll see a Taken Osseous Fragment in a stone bowl: collect it.The symbol and its corresponding directive messageScotopic RuneAfter this, visit the Slab inside Eris's Flat in the Lost City and purchase and activate the Scotopic Rune upgrade. This is a tier three Runic Enhancement. After activating it, you'll be given The Taken Path quest with the next step tasking you with finding something the Hive have hidden in Sorrow's Harbor.Lost Sector BlightsHead to the K1 Revelation Lost Sector in Sorrow's Harbor. There, you'll see a Blight leading to a plate, similar to the one from the Nether. Again, take note of the symbol, follow its direction, and kill the Taken that spawn before collecting the fragment. Repeat this process in the Forgotten Shore Lost Sector, Veles Labyrinth. The Blight will be in the maze area.The Taken Osseous FragmentCurse QuestsAfter completing the two Lost Sectors, return to the Slab in the Last City. This will trigger the start of three \"curse\" quests--the Curse of Endurance, the Curse of Urgency, and the Curse of Revenge all need to be broken. These are located in the Altars of Sorrow, the Hallowed Grove, and the Nightmare Hunt: Pride respectively. In each area you will find a Taken Relic. Killing enemies will extend the timer that it shows. Once an area opens up allowing you to do so, dunk the Taken Relic.After doing this, you'll need to head back into the Nether activity again. In each area, similar to the King's Fall raid, there will be a Hive statue that you need to interact with. This will spawn a mini-boss. After defeating it, another Taken Osseous Fragment will be yours to collect. Only after completing all of the steps will you begin the Exotic quest itself, named Derealize.Derealize Exotic MissionDerealize QuestThe mission is fairly straight-forward: You'll face off against some Tormentors and other Dread faction enemies while pursuing a commander. Then, when you reach a large arena, you'll repeat some of the steps you needed to unlock the mission and deal with more curses using a Taken Relic. After empowering the curse with the Relic, the mini-boss can be damaged. Repeat the process to take down the boss and enter another phase of seeking out Blights which contain symbols.Derealize Quest EntranceFollow the short jumping puzzle and claim the Corrupted Fragment. Follow another, longer jumping puzzle until you eventually find the final boss. Derealize is an extremely lore-heavy quest, so we won't spoil anything here, but pay attention if that's your thing. The Barrow Dyad Exotic is a guaranteed drop when you finish Derealize.After completing it once, another quest begins which allows you to get intrinsic upgrades for Barrow Dyad. Take note that you need to be at least rank nine at the Slab for this to be achievable. You'll also need to locate and secure more Fragments, but these can easily be found in the Nether activity.Barrow Dyad Exotic SMGThe Barrow Dyad Exotic SMG is a strange-looking weapon. Shaped like a disc, the weapon has the Panic Response Exotic perk which means it generates Blight as it deals damage. When it's not firing, Blight depletes, and the weapon's magazine is gradually refilled. Reloading it converts stored Blight into Blighted Seekers which track enemies and cause huge amounts of damage.If you're seeking out some of the other new Destiny 2 Heresy weapons, including Exotics, we have a dedicated guide for that, too.

Shaped like a disc, the weapon has the Panic Response Exotic perk which means it generates Blight as it deals damage. When it\u0026#39;s not firing, Blight depletes, and the weapon\u0026#39;s magazine is gradually refilled. Reloading it converts stored Blight into Blighted Seekers which track enemies and cause huge amounts of damage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re seeking out some of the other new \u003ca href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-destiny-2-heresy-weapons/1100-6529285/\" data-ref-id=\"1100-6529285\"\u003eDestiny 2 Heresy weapons\u003c/a\u003e, including Exotics, we have a dedicated guide for that, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n                        \n    \n        \n        \n  \n                                  \u003c/div\u003e\n\n          \n        \n                        \n            \u003cspan\u003e\n        \u003ca itemprop=\"reviewer\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/100905401902076465889?rel=author\"\u003eCheri Faulkner\u003c/a\u003e on Google+\n      \u003c/span\u003e\n      \n                    \n  \n    \n          \n            \n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?
