  "text": "Clive Standen to voice Titus. Image credit: Focus Entertainment Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 has only been out a couple of months, but already a sequel's on the horizon - albeit not in the way you might immediately assume. Games Workshop has confirmed Warhammer 40K's appearance in Amazon's upcoming Secret Level series will take the form of an animated Space Marine 2 sequel. Secret Level, if you're unfamiliar, is a new 15-episode animated anthology series from the creators of Netflix's Love, Death \u0026 Robots, with each episode featuring \"original stories set within the worlds of some of the most beloved video games\". Those games include Armored Core, Concord, Crossfire, Dungeons \u0026 Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, Pac-Man, Sifu, Spelunky, The Outer Worlds, Unreal Tournament, a variety of PlayStation Studios games, and, of course, Warhammer 40K. All that we already knew, but in a post on the Warhammer Community website (thanks IGN), Games Workshop now shared more on the franchise's upcoming Secret Level episode. For starters, it'll be directed by Tim Miller, with Dave Wilson (responsible for Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War's iconic intro movie) serving as executive producer and supervising director. Secret Level - Teaser Trailer | Prime Video Secret Level teaser trailer.Watch on YouTube As for specifics, Games Workshop has confirmed - as some sharp-eyed fans had already speculated after the release of Secret Level's teaser trailer - that the episode is indeed a sequel to this year's acclaimed Warhammer 40K shooter Space Marine 2, and follows the conclusion of the game \"like a... secret level\". Additionally, Clive Standen is onboard, once again voicing Space Marine protagonist Captain Demetrian Titus. And that's about all we know so far. However, Games Workshop notes a new trailer for the Secret Level series - presumably showing off a bit more of that Space Marine 2 sequel action - is on the way after its recent New York Comic Con reveal, and that fans \"won't have to wait too long to see it\". As for the series itself, it's set to air on Prime Video from 10th December.",
