  "text": "As it passes 1m copies sold. Image credit: Level-5 Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - the sequel to developer Level 5's 2012 Nintendo DS life sim and RPG thing - is getting a bunch of free DLC, which we already knew. What we weren't previously aware of, however, is that its DLC will include an open-world roguelike mode. It's not entirely clear why a relatively laidback, job-focused life sim RPG would want to get in on the roguelike action, but that's what Level 5 is going for. As detailed in its announcement blog, the update - which is currently \"actively underway\" - will feature an \"evolved version of Ginormosia, including a system blending roguelike and open-world elements\". Level 5's announcement stops short of explaining how the new mode will actually work, but it does say the update will include \"engaging content for both experienced players and newcomers alike.\" Additionally, the update promises \"powerful new gear\", plus \"stylish equipment, mounts, and a variety of unusual items.\" A telephone made of butts immediately springs to mind, but I suspect I'm likely to be disappointed. FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time - All Features at a Glance! Fantasy Life i - features trailer.Watch on YouTube And we're not quite done yet. Fantasy Life i's free DLC update will also include a brand-new character who'll \"leave a significant mark on the world\", plus new hairstyles and new emotes to \"make it even more enjoyable for players to express themselves in-game\". As for when all this will show up, Level 5 says \"as soon as possible\". \"Level 5 appreciates everyone's continued support and remains committed to continuously refining Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time,\" it concludes in its announcement post, \"as well as expanding content to provide the best possible gaming experience.\" Why all this free DLC? That'll be down to Fantasy Life i's impressive sales, with the game having already shifted 1m copies since its release at the end of May. Level 5 is also celebrating the milestone with a \"commemorative gift code\" that'll unlock an \"exclusive piece of equipment\", plus a \"commemorative Pegasus mount\" - although its post profusely apologises for mistakenly giving players on certain platforms a unicorn instead. That error should now be fixed, alas. And if you'd like to bump that sales number up to 1m and one, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, Switch, and Switch 2.",
