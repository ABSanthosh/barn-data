  "text": "Here we are at week seventeen of the TAGN Fantasy Critic League. Fantasy Critic League – Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games I had low expectations for this week, there not being anything on the board for release this time around.  But part of what I was wondering about when it came to this league was whether or not it would have a similar impact as Fantasy Movie League did, back in the before times when that was a thing, where those participating certainly became more aware of just what was in theaters and what was coming up. I don’t think FCL hits as hard in that regard, in part because there are way too many video game launches to be able to possibly be on board the way you can be for movies… but I am a bit more aware maybe.  How about you? Anyway, before I go further, let’s pick up where we left off with week sixteen scores. The Standings for Week 16 Since then there was one posted score change. Old Skies [Picked by Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss)] Score has gone UP from 79.4 to 81.2 Look at that, a score went UP!  See, it can happen.  It isn’t always down, the way we saw Oblivion drop off last week. And that was it for announced score changes.  I mean, sure, the FCL bot did tease us with a few titles that shipped with scores over 80, but those were titles nobody picked. Days Gone Remastered Now has a score of 83 StarVaders Now has a score of 87.7 StarVaders Score has gone DOWN from 88.2 to 86.6 Many Nights a Whisper Now has a score of 85 Many Nights a Whisper Score has gone DOWN from 85.0 to 83.8 Shotgun Cop Man Now has a score of 83.1 I do wonder about Shotgun Cop Man, but people do struggle for decent, memorable game titles. Anyway, that one announce score change left the roster in the same order. The Standings for Week 17 The one thing of note is that Bhagpuss is now predicted to end the season in first place by the bot, though there is less than a point separating him and Potshot in that estimate. I remain projected to land in 10th place. Meanwhile, there is nothing on the schedule for release next week. Upcoming for Week 18 That strongly suggest the score rankings will not change unless there is some major movement in the reviews of already released titles. Which brings us to changes in release dates, which is where things were happing. First up we have one resolving for this month. Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker [Picked by Crash and Burn Games (Shawn)] Release date changed from ‘Spring 2025’ to ‘Tuesday, May 20, 2025’ Then we have a slight adjustment as the Borderlands 4 release date was pulled in a bit. Borderlands 4 [Picked by Crash and Burn Games (Shawn)] Release date changed from ‘Tuesday, September 23, 2025’ to ‘Friday, September 12, 2025’. There is some uncertainty around Mewgenics. Mewgenics [Picked by Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss)] Estimated release date changed from ‘Late 2025’ to ‘October 2025 or Later’. Note removed: ‘Developers are considering an October release, but have not solidified anything yet’. Note added: ‘Developers are considering an October release, but have not solidified anything yet.’. I can’t see any difference between the two notes, so… there they are. But the two big changes of note started with Grand Theft Auto VI. Grand Theft Auto VI [Picked by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane)] Release date changed from ‘Fall 2025’ to ‘Tuesday, May 26, 2026’ That is now out in 2026, meaning it will not score this year… unless the date changes.  But word from the studio has been that the 2025 date has been unlikely for some time now. Fortunately the title has not been counter picked, so Cyanbane can drop it for another title… unless somebody counter picks it first.  I think for next time around, should there be a next time around, I will change the rule that locks you in when you get counter picked.  That would have saved some trouble so far this year. Finally, there is Half-Life 3, around which rumors started to swirl again in the less mainstream gamer press.  There were reports that play tests were going on at Valve and the game could be announced and launched this year.  Then FCL made this update. Unannounced Mainline Half-Life Game [Picked by TAGN HQ (Wilhelm), Counter Picked by Play Forever Mwahahaha (Shintar)] Game name changed from Half-Life 3 (Unannounced) to Unannounced Mainline Half-Life Game. As the Jim Carry line goes, “So you’re saying there’s a chance?” I will admit I picked this as a bit of a joke, something to spice things up a bit, an impossible hill to die on… and it might actually happen.
