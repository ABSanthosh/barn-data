  "text": "Image: NintendoThe original Nintendo Switch had such a massive piracy problem, hackers were able to play new first-party games weeks before they were available to the public. Since its release in early June, hackers have wondered if the Switch 2 might have similar vulnerabilities, but early reports suggest that Nintendo has anticipated typical methods of meddling with its portable hardware.Hackers on social media sites are beginning to share photos and anecdotes about their efforts to modify the Switch 2, only to be hit with bans that restrict usage of online connectivity. This means that hackers can’t use things like the eShop or play online multiplayer in games like Mario Kart World.“Must be some new detection Nintendo has on these,” one Redditor wrote on a thread about their ban. “Pretty dumb of me to go online with it. That’s on me.”The user says they used a type of flash cartridge favored by hackers on the original Nintendo Switch, which allowed them to download and load games onto what is essentially an SD card. Since it is literally a cartridge, some hopeful hackers popped it into the Switch 2 to see what would happen. At first, it seemed like the answer was nothing. One user claims that their cartridge wouldn’t load past the title screen after attempting to download an update. That same user now says that their console as a whole appears banned, and that they attempted contacting Nintendo customer support and were told that nothing could be done.“I don’t pirate games, I back-up my legitimate games I own on cartridges,” they wrote. “Piracy is shit, I work in software development.”Nintendo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.News of these bans is unlikely to deter some hackers, though, as creators of the flash carts claim they are still working on ensuring their products can be used on the new console. Elsewhere, Reddit communities specifically dedicated to hacking the Switch 2 are arguing whether or not it’s safe to try and log into accounts that were banned on the Switch on Switch 2, but fear around having their new $450 system restricted in some way is making them cautious.",
