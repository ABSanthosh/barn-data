Not entirely convinced by this one, Mr. Bowser. I could get into the weeds of why all of this is happening (none of it for being particularly good reasons), but I won't because I bring word of something actually getting less expensive. Shock horror, I know, and yet here are Rockfish Games announcing that Everspace 2's upcoming Wrath of the Ancients DLC will be a bit cheaper when it launches. Rockfish shared the news in a Steam post earlier this week, explaining that \"with events happening in the world, it seems like everything is getting more expensive and there’s a lot of uncertainty in general.\" Said events could perhaps be in reference to a certain man in a certain position of power enacting baffling tariffs, though I could be reading a smidge too deep between the lines here. As such, while the initial plan was for Wrath of the Ancients to be priced at $30, it'll now only be $25, quite a nice little reduction. In turn, the space game's previous bit of DLC Titans is also being lowered from $15 to $12. Great! Rockfish also quite quickly cleared up that no, \"no content has been cut,\" and that currently they're in the \"middle of our final polish and bug fixing phase ahead of release.\" I am genuinely not sure I've heard of a developer lowering the cost of DLC prior to it even releasing like this before. I'm sure it must have happened somewhere along the line, but couldn't possibly tell you when. It's genuinely just quite a nice move because $5 really can go a long way. You'll be able to pick it up pretty soon too, as it launches on May 12th next month.",
