  "text": "I've also found some tasty discounts on pre built gaming desktops and laptops too. Image credit: LG and Steelseries Today’s gaming deals are stacked, I'm so hyped. We’ve got premium laptops with decent discounts, curved OLED monitors, and high-refresh powerhouses, all with serious price cuts. A couple of these are big hitters from HP and ASUS with RTX 5080 GPUs inside, while the LG and Samsung monitors are flying under $800 thanks to that JULYFINDS coupon on eBay (don’t forget to apply it at checkout). Looking for a decent prebuilt desktop PC instead? I've got you covered there to. I've even got a deal on Steelseries Artic Nova to complete your battlestation. Let's get straight into it: This LG 27-inch OLED monitor is blazingly fast with a 480Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time. The color and contrast are top-tier, and the anti-glare finish helps keep focus in intense matches. Perfect for competitive gamers looking to step up their visual game. The Cooler Master 34-inch curved display hits all the right notes for immersion. You get 144Hz, a 3440x1440 resolution, and some serious contrast thanks to that quantum dot VA panel. Toss in USB-C and HDR modes and you’ve got a big screen win for under $250. This 49-inch G9 beast from Samsung wraps you in Dual QHD visuals and smooth 144Hz action. It’s VESA DisplayHDR 600 rated, comes with FreeSync Premium Pro, and supports picture-by-picture for multitasking. At $640, it’s hard to find anything this wide and this fast for less. The LG 39-inch OLED UltraGear delivers bold visuals with a tight 800R curve, 240Hz refresh rate, and rich contrast. It’s got HDMI 2.1, built-in speakers, and a clean design that looks great on any desk. G-SYNC and FreeSync support seal the deal for buttery-smooth play. This SteelSeries headset is a great grab if you want lag-free wireless sound and premium build quality. The audio is crisp, the dual-battery system keeps it powered up, and you get Bluetooth support on top of the gaming-ready 2.4G connection. The materials feel premium, and that ski goggle headband stays comfy even in longer sessions. This CyberPowerPC Gamer Master rig is built to handle serious multitasking, streaming, and fast-paced gaming. With a Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, and an RTX 5060 Ti, it’s quick and responsive. Add in a 2TB SSD and it boots and loads faster than you'd expect at this price. This 14-inch OMEN gaming laptop is the kind of powerhouse that’s ready for high-end gaming and creative work alike. That 3K OLED screen is a beauty, and with 32GB RAM and an RTX 5060, it handles everything from editing to AAA games without breaking a sweat. This ProArt PX13 is a creative studio in disguise. With a 3K OLED touchscreen, RTX 4050 graphics, and Ryzen AI 9 inside, it’s tailored for photo, video, and design work. The build is tough, the display is gorgeous, and it’s loaded with I/O so you don’t have to fuss with dongles. This HP Victus keeps gaming fast and fluid with a 144Hz display and RTX 3050 graphics. The Intel i5 chip and 512GB SSD make it feel quick and responsive for work and play, and the price right now makes it an easy choice for anyone who wants reliable gaming on a budget. The OMEN MAX 16t packs in serious firepower for top-tier gaming and content creation. With an Intel Ultra 7 chip and RTX 5080 GPU, it’s ready for whatever you throw at it. The 2K screen, per-key RGB keyboard, and premium build round it out nicely, especially with a $600 discount. This version of the OMEN MAX bumps things up even further with an Intel Ultra 9 processor and double the storage. You’re getting 1TB SSD space, an RTX 5080, and a seriously powerful 16-inch machine for a price that beats most rivals in its class.",
