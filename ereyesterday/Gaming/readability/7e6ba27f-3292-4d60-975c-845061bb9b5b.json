Tier lists are up to date for Anime Fantasy: RE update 1.5. In Anime Fantasy: RE, there are more than 80 Units you can get, and half of them have Evolutions, which boost their strength even further. However, with that many Units available, it isn’t easy to choose which ones to grind for. To help you summon new Units and focus your grind where it matters, we prepared the following Anime Fantasy: RE tier list.

We decided not to include unevolved Units in the tier list because all evolutions are just better versions of the same Units. Now, the ranking of each Unit is based on the following factors: DPS (Damage/SPA) SPA (Seconds per attack) — For support Units Range and AoE type and size — We gave a slight advantage to full AoE Units because they are optimal for dealing with a lot of enemies at once HP Attack type (Ground, Hybrid, and Hill) — Hybrid and Hill Units can target flying enemies, which are rare. However, not being able to target them makes it impossible to complete certain stages. Placement and upgrade costs Passive abilities (Slow, Freeze, Burn, Bleed, etc.) All units available on the Special Banner in Anime Fantasy: RE ranked from best to worst — Image via TierMaker A large number of Units on our overall Anime Fantasy: RE tier list can’t be obtained on the Special Banner. So, we made a simplified tier list of Mythic Units that can be on the rate-up every hour. In general, you should use Gems to summon on the Special Banner only when S or A-tier mythics are in the middle of it. AF: RE Element Tier List All units in Anime Fantasy: RE ranked from best to worst within their element type groups — Image via TierMaker. Last but not least, here is a tier list of all units in Anime Fantasy: RE by their element. This one should make it easier for you to decide which units to bring into content like Weekly Tournaments that buff the damage of certain elements. Anime Fantasy: RE Unit List Below is a list of Units from our Anime Fantasy: RE tier list, along with their pros and cons. We have also included the methods for obtaining each Unit. The pros and cons are there to give you some context for the ranking of each Unit.

of obtaining new Units. By completing specific Raid stages, you have a chance to get rare Secret Units. Some rare Units are available as event rewards. The main way of getting new units in Anime Fantasy: RE is summoning them on one of the Banners available in the Summon menu. The Special Banner features units that rotate every hour. The middle Unit on it has a 50% rate-up, while the Units on the side have a 20% rate-up. When you reach level 10, you unlock the ability to get Secret and Shiny Units from the Special Banner as well. Some exclusive and other rare Units in AF: RE are also available as rewards from Raids, Events, BattlePasses, Tournaments, and many other game modes. As a rule of thumb, these exclusive Units can be very powerful. So, make sure to participate in events whenever you can. How to Evolve Units in Anime Fantasy: RE To evolve a Unit, you need some Gold, a specific number of takedowns with that Unit, and a set of materials required for its evolution. To evolve Legendary Units, such as Gane and Asto, you need to have at least the second stage of Constellation on them. You can evolve specific Units in Anime Fantasy: RE through the Evolution menu. However, each Unit with an evolution has some requirements that you need to fulfill. Most commonly, you have to get a certain number of takedowns with them and collect some evolution components. When you successfully evolve a Unit, all of its stats will get upgraded to a certain extent. Farming Evo Materials in AF: RE The Craft NPC next to the Evolve area lets you craft almost every Unit evolution material in Anime Fantasy: RE. Specific Unit evolution materials are available at Luxxy’s Shop in exchange for Gems, while smaller components cost Gold. Half-hourly challenges reward you with Shard Capsules on completion. Some Evolution materials can be obtained from Story stages. You can find the Evolution materials for some Units in specific Event Shops. There are various methods for farming specific evolution materials in Anime Fantasy: RE. You can get colored Shards from Challenges and Luxxy’s Shop. Common materials, such as MarineCaps, can be farmed in Story stages. Most rare materials can be crafted at the Craft NPC. Lastly, some Units require limited materials that are only available in temporary Event Shops. That concludes our Anime Fantasy: RE tier list. Now, you have an idea of what Units to spend your Gems on, and which ones are worth bringing with you into the most challenging stages.
