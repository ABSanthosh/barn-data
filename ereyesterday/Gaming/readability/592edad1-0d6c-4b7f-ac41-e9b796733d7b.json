He has been writing professionally for over a decade.Disney unveiled the first trailer for its long-awaited, MCU-adjacent animated series Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man on Sunday, on the heels of its big What If…? series finale . Produced by Marvel Animation and Polygon Pictures (Knights of Sidonia, Kaina of the Great Snow Sea), the series will center on Peter Parker’s early days as Spider-Man, but with a twist: the show will take place in an alternate universe where Norman Osborn, not Tony Stark, will become the young web-slinger’s mentor.The trailer shows Peter in his early days, rotating through costumes, visiting Oscorp, and waxing poetic on the responsibilities of heroes. And it’s all done in retro fashion.Announced back in 2021 as Spider-Man: Freshman Year, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man was initially pitched as a series that would explore the origin story of Tom Holland’s Peter Parker, which was never fully detailed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Plans have changed slightly, but the series still appears to delve into the familiar backstory. The series will feature an art style inspired by the character’s earliest comic appearances, with an emphasis on home-made suits as well as the classic ’60s suit designed by Steve Ditko.Hudson Thames, who voiced Peter Parker in the animated anthology series What If...?, will return to reprise the role in this new series. Kari Wahlgren (Fooly Cooly) will voice Peter’s Aunt May Parker, Hugh Dancy (Hannibal) will voice Otto Octavius, and Charlie Cox (Daredevil) will reprise his role as the masked vigilante Daredevil.Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man premieres on Disney Plus on Jan 29.",
