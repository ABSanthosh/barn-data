Here's a quick summary:Chapter 3-5: Monster Hunter is the conclusion of the story proper.When you're done with the story, quests become more free-form. You simply need to take out targets and complete quests so you can continue to increase your Hunter Rank.Upon reaching Hunter Rank 20, you're given the Wyvern Sparks and Rose Thorns mission, which takes you back to the Ruins of Wyveria.This leads you to a battle against a Lala Barina that you're tracking, as well as a Guardian Fulgur Anjanath, the first Tempered Monster type that you encounter.Tempered Monsters are scarred veterans of countless battles.How to track down Tempered MonstersThe Monster Hunter Wilds Tempered Monsters offer the most difficult bouts in the game. These creatures are battle-hardened, as you can see by the scars and old wounds on their bodies. They're tougher compared to normal variants, so don't underestimate them.If you plan on tracking down a Tempered Monster, you can do so by opening the world map biomes to see which ones are currently active in a particular location. You'll also notice that a blue glow/waypoint leads you to these targets, as opposed to the green-colored trails for other creatures or items.Tempered Monster materialsThe reason why you want to eliminate Tempered Monsters whenever you see them is because they grant the usual loot from their species, as well as endgame materials. These are used to craft Artian Weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds--i.e. rank 6, 7, and 8 (currently the highest tier in the game).Once you've collected enough materials, talk to Gemma at your base and select the Forge Artian Weapons option. You'll notice some key differences here.Combine parts to come up with an Artian Weapon with a certain elemental property or status ailment.How to craft Artian WeaponsThe process of crafting Artian Weapons is vastly different compared to Low Rank or High Rank armaments. This time, you need to select three parts to develop a viable combination. Here are a few reminders:You may only select parts that have the same rarity--i.e. rank 6, 7, or 8.Parts have an elemental property or a status ailment property.If you pick two or more materials with the same properties, the weapon gains that effect. If all three materials have different properties, then the result will be a non-elemental gear piece.Example: 2x Thunder and 1x Sleep results in a weapon with the Thunder element. However, if you pick 1x Thunder, 1x Sleep, and 1x Dragon, then the combination would yield a non-elemental result.It's also worth noting that weapon categories require different part classifications:Great Sword - Requires 2x blade and 1x tube.Long Sword - Requires 1x blade and 2x tube.Sword \u0026 Shield - Requires 1x blade, 1x tube, and 1x disc.Dual Blades - Requires 2x blade and 1x disc.Hammer - Requires 2x disc and 1x tube.Hunting Horn - Requires 1x disc and 2x device.Lance - Requires 1x blade and 2x disc.Gunlance - Requires 2x disc and 1x device.Switch Axe - Requires 2x blade and 1x device.Charge Blade - Requires 1x blade, 1x disc, and 1x device.Insect Glaive - Requires 1x blade, 1x tube, and 1x device.Light Bowgun - Requires 1x tube and 2x device.Heavy Bowgun - Requires 1x disc, 1x tube, and 1x device.Bow - Requires 2x tube and 1x device.That does it for our Monster Hunter Tempered Monsters and Artian Weapons guide. Once you've crafted a couple of these high-end armaments, keep eliminating tougher creatures so you can continue to increase your Hunter Rank.Soon, rarer and more difficult Tempered Monsters will appear. Of course, this also means that you'll be able to create rank 7 and, eventually, rank 8 gear pieces.Need more tips as you continue fighting deadly creatures and venture into lands unknown?
