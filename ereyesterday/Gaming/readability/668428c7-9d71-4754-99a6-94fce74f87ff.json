  "text": "We just had the Legion expansion two days ago, so things are still digesting on that… though how comically bad freelance jobs are for their intended purpose is starting to become clear already.  (Also, Brave put a job up offering ISK to pilots who damaged Pandemic Horde ships, and Pandemic Horde pilots signed up, shot each other a bit, and collected 5 billion ISK.) But with every expansion comes the inevitable host of follow up patches to fix the things, and so it was that the first post expansion patch hit yesterday with lots of little changes and tweaks.  My favorite on the list was this gem. Fixed a rare defect which could cause a character to not be able to jump to a cynosural field if the last time the character cyno jumped was over 8 years ago. I am interested to know both what the root cause was and how they ended up finding it. But there, in the mix, was the announcement that CCP had decided to double the amount of skill points pilots on Omega accounts can collect for completing the AIR career program.  750K skill points in rewards was upped to 1.5 million skill points for subscribers. Double the SP on the AIR gravy train! The actual entry from the patch notes reads as follows: Improving the progress bar UI in the Air Career Program. Introducing an Omega Reward track. Omega rewards you with double Skill Point rewards; both graduation rewards from career paths and the Air Career Programs overall career point track rewards are doubled up to 1.5 million Skill Points. Players that have previously claimed their ACP Rewards will automatically receive these bonus points retroactively starting from 11:30 UTC. The important part for all my fellow capsuleers is that if you have previously earned any skill points from the AIR Career program, even if you have not completed it, and are subscribed, there is probably a small pile of skill points sitting there waiting for you to come collect them. I immediately logged in the one character I completed the program with and was able to collect another 750K in skill points.  I’ll take more pay for work I’ve already done any day of the week. Skill points are out there waiting to be had After gorging myself on more unearned skill points, I began to wonder why CCP would do this?  Did they need some more items for their Omega Benefits page?  If so, I remain unimpressed with the whole idea. Omega Benefits Or, with the killing of the skill point exploit aspect of the AIR Career Program back at the end of March have they now seen how few people will actually subject themselves to this tedious effort? I mean, 750K skill points is not nothing… but, also, I’ve only bothered to do all four paths on one character out of six that are currently Omega status because it is a bit of a pain. So will 1.5 million skill points get me to finish up the program with the other five?  Maybe? I don’t know.  I thought about it… but then I thought about it seriously when it was only 750K and didn’t do it.  We shall see. Related: CCP – Patch Notes",
