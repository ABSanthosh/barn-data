  "text": "Just in time for the original's 25th birthday Image credit: EA As rumoured, The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 have returned to (official) PC stores. Kindly Uncle EA has taken a break from his busy layoff schedule to rustle up a pair of Legacy collections that include a bunch of old expansions. It's the very first time the original Sims has graced a digital retail platform, I believe - it was first released in 2000, back when people used to access the internet using smoke signals and semaphore. Anyway, here's the reveal trailer. The Sims \u0026 The Sims 2 Legacy Collections - Official Reveal Trailer Watch on YouTube The Sims Legacy Collection includes the following expansion packs - sorry, just let me take a deep breath, OK let's go: The Sims Livin' Large, The Sims House Party, The Sims Hot Date, The Sims Vacation, The Sims Unleashed, The Sims Superstar, and The Sims Makin' Magic. You also get a bonus Throwback Fit Kit for The Sims 4. The Sims 2 Legacy Collection, meanwhile, harbours the following - sorry, just let me preemptively hook myself up to a defibrillator. OK, here we go: The Sims 2: University, The Sims 2: Nightlife, The Sims 2: Open for Business, The Sims 2: Pets, The Sims 2: Bon Voyage, The Sims 2: Seasons, The Sims 2: FreeTime, The Sims 2: Apartment Life, The Sims 2: Holiday Party Pack, The Sims 2: Family Fun Stuff, The Sims 2: Glamour Life Stuff, The Sims 2: Happy Holiday Stuff, The Sims 2: Celebration! Stuff, The Sims 2: H\u0026M Fashion Stuff, The Sims 2: Teen Style Stuff, The Sims 2: Kitchen \u0026 Bath Interior Design Stuff, and The Sims 2: Mansion \u0026 Garden Stuff. You also get a Grunge Revival Kit for The Sims 4.Why are there so many Sims 2 expansions? It's like some kind of Cambrian explosion of licensed boondoggles. I'm speaking from a position of blessed ignorance here. The only thing I know about The Sims 2 is that games journo extraordinaire Steve Hogarty once got blacklisted by EA for this PCZone review of the H\u0026M one. I doubt his subsequent review of an IKEA-themed pack did much to heal the breach. Find The Sims: Legacy Collection on Steam and the Epic Games Store. Find The Sims 2: Legacy Collection also on Steam and the Epic Games Store. Alternatively, grab them both in EA's 25th birthday bundle. I leave the judging of whether they're priced appropriately to you, the discerning Simmer.",
