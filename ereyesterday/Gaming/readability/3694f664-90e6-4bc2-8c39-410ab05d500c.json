The TikTok and Instagram versions of the teaser are the most illuminating versions, as they reveal that the astronaut is wearing a studded leather jacket. There aren't any skins that wore anything like that from Season 3, battle pass or otherwise, but our Metallica-themed remix of Rust from Chapter 5 Season 3 did.

Fortnite OG mode is taking another step toward the present very soon--Season 3 starts on March 25, taking us back to the season that kicked off way back in February of 2018. While Fortnite OG has waned in popularity a bit recently, one of the big reasons for that is that Fortnite changed very little during those original two seasons, so this nostalgic mode didn't get to do much differently either. Season 3, however, is where things began ramping up. The game's overall storyline made its very first appearance when a large meteor appeared over the island midway through the season.With just days remaining before the next round of Fortnite's throwback party begins, let's take a look at everything we know about Fortnite OG Season 3.Fortnite OG Season 3 teaserEpic has dropped a single teaser for OG Season 3, which shows an astronaut helmet with the Fortnite island visible in the reflection--along with the meteor above it. The TikTok and Instagram versions of the teaser are the most illuminating versions, as they reveal that the astronaut is wearing a studded leather jacket. There aren't any skins that wore anything like that from Season 3, battle pass or otherwise, but our Metallica-themed remix of Rust from Chapter 5 Season 3 did. Regardless, I doubt that thing is spaceworthy, but Fortnite isn't concerned with such things.Fortnite OG Pass Season 3The first two OG passes have included three new skins that are remixes of existing skins that first appeared during the original seasons. Each pass had two remixes of old pass skins and one remix of a shop skin, though it should be noted that they had to do it that way for those seasons because they didn't have many skins--the Season 1 shop only had two, and the Season 2 battle pass only had three knights and Sparkle Specialist.The original Season 3 pass, pictured here, will heavily inspire the OG Pass.The Season 3 battle pass, by contrast, had six skins--Rust Lord, Elite Agent, The Reaper (Fortnite-brand John Wick), and three astronauts. They could make three distinct skins from that group, but on the shop side of things, Season 3 did introduce Raven--and Epic loves doing new versions of Raven almost as much as it likes doing new versions of Midas.Fortnite OG Season 3 mapNot much changed between Season 2 and 3, as you can see--the Season 3 map is almost identical to the Season 2 island that's on the way out. But that teaser including the meteor could be hinting that we'll start in the middle. As the end of the season approached, and the meteor came along with it, small pieces of the meteor kept falling off and damaging the island every match, and that's exactly the sort of shakeup feature that the OG mode could use. Since Epic has typically not done many in-season map changes in the OG mode, would anybody be upset if they jumped straight to that part?Fortnite OG's presumed Season 3 mapFortnite OG Season 3 loot poolMost of the current OG loot pool will stick around for Season 3, but this season introduced a variety of interesting new weapons and gadgets that you will very likely see in the new OG season.Hand cannonCrossbowGuided missileEgg launcherPort-a-fortRemote explosivesClingers Phil Owen on Google+ Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?
