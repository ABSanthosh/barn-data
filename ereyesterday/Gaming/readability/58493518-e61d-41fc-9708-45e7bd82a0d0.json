In the spirit of celebrating our community, we’re excited to announce PlayStation Tournaments: XP, a new live studio event that invites the top competitive gamers globally on PS5 for a unique in-person team-based competition.  On January 18, 2025, the first-ever PlayStation Tournaments: XP competition will be held live in London. Qualifying players from across the globe and the competitive gaming community on PS5 will represent teams Triangle, Circle, Cross, and Square to earn points during the competition and vie for the title of champion, in addition to winning exclusive prizes. Through online qualifiers via PlayStation Tournaments on PS5, players will have a chance to compete to earn their trip to London, while fans at home will be able to tune into the event live stream, watch all the action, and win prizes. How to qualify for PlayStation Tournaments: XP  To battle for a chance to compete in London, play in any PlayStation Tournaments: XP Open Qualifier on PS5. Open Qualifiers will start today for Tekken 8 and EA Sports FC 25. Open Qualifiers for Fortnite will start on December 6, and Astro Bot will start on December 13, 2024. See here for full details on the rules and times for each qualifier. Players who win an Open Qualifier will be invited to a regional online Closed Final. After winning a Closed Final, the player will then earn a spot to compete in the live PlayStation Tournaments: XP event and a ticket to London, including flights and lodging.  Gear up for PlayStation Tournaments: XP in London on January 18, 2025 When qualifying players arrive in London, they’ll be seeded into one of the four teams (Triangle, Circle, Cross, and Square) and compete across several exciting live broadcast matches to earn points (called “XP”) for their team.   Each team will feature a Team Captain and Specialists, which are a crew of community favorites who specialize in one of the four featured titles. These Team Captains and Specialists will represent, cheer on, and coach their team through the tournament. We’ll be unveiling the full roster of Team Captains and Specialists in the coming weeks, so stay tuned!  After four rounds of competition and surprise mini-games, the top two teams will compete to become the first-ever Champions of PlayStation Tournaments: XP.
