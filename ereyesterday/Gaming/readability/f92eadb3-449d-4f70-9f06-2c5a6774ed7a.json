In addition to fighting the large, eye-obsessed boss, you’ll be able to wield powers inspired by some of the series’ biggest and baddest bosses.In this Diablo 4 guide, we’ll cover when season 8 releases in your time zone and what you can expect from Belial’s Return.Diablo 4 season 8 release time on PC, PS5, and XboxDiablo 4 season 8 will launch at 10 a.m. PDT on Tuesday, April 29. Here’s when that is in your time zone:10 a.m. PDT on April 29 for the West Coast of North America1 p.m. EDT on April 29 for the East Coast of North America6 p.m. BST on April 29 for the U.K.7 p.m. CEST on April 29 for Western Europe/Paris2 a.m. JST on April 30 for TokyoThe launch of season 8 will be global across PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. Blizzard Entertainment recently announced a Diablo 4 roadmap, showcasing what players should expect for the rest of 2025. According to that roadmap, season 8 will run until sometime in July, when season 9, Sins of the Horadrim, is set to begin.What to expect from Diablo 4 season 8Season 8 is all about killing bosses and taking their powers. Players will be able to harness signature abilities that are inspired by some of the game’s biggest bosses, such as the chest beam from Wandering Death.With the return of Belial, players will also need to battle ghost-like figures spawned from the Lord of Lies in the new Apparition Incursions world event. Belial himself will be featured as a new endgame boss, and Blizzard will be adding multiple bosses from Vessel of Hatred as Lair Bosses (although they will only be accessible to players who own the expansion). Speaking of Lair Bosses, players will be able to earn increased loot from them over the course of the season.In addition to some of these endgame updates, Blizzard is bringing some interesting new additions to the game’s cosmetics. First, as you can see in the trailer above, the world of Berserk is coming to Diablo 4 via cosmetics (that you can either earn or purchase). Players who complete the Season Journey during season 8 will also earn a new pet, Iris the hairless cat covered in gross, nasty eyes. It’s creepy!Finally, the studio is updating how the game’s battle pass works with what it’s calling the “Reliquary system.” Instead of a straight line battle pass that you can progress through, the new battle pass is split into four major categories:Belial’s Return (free cosmetics themed after the season)Weapons (a premium track for weapon skins)Beasts (a premium track for mounts and pets)Armor (a premium track for armor skins)There will also be an Event Reliquary section for Berserk coming on May 6 and lasting through June 3.Going into this season of Diablo 4, here are all Tenets of Akarat locations, and guides on how to unlock Mercenaries and get more loot in Kurast Undercity.",
