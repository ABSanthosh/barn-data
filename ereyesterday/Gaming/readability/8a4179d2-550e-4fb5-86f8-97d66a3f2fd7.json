  "text": "Color Lim is a puzzle platformer where you need to use your slimy color-switching ability to solve puzzles and save a small village. This is a fantastic, smooth puzzle platform that has you playing a colorless slime called Lim who is looking to find their true color. At first, you aren’t really colorless – you are blue, but this isn’t your true and only color, as you can change and adapt when needed. Why is that important? Because in this world, color determines everything. Being able to absorb and transform to different colors allows you to go through specific platforms or to spray slime and then slide into the walls of the world, finding a new way to navigate around. There isn’t a limit on your own slime, so you are able to blast out some goop and then inject yourself into the walls, moving quickly around levels and solving puzzles. There are enemies that are looking to harm you, too, but these can be easily avoided most of the time. Color Lim doesn’t just have endless platforms to enjoy, but also has a little story showcased through cute characters who seem quite helpful! In this world, something bad has happened, and now there is a small village that is rebuilding, needing your help. As someone with such a great ability, you can find yourself using your colors to help them. I got to play a short demo of Color Lim at Pocket Gamer Connects Barcelona where I really liked how sleek and fast the movement felt for the game. The cute characters and little hints of a story captivated me, especially when exploring the town. However, I did feel that sometimes it wasn’t obvious what to do next or where to go – especially in the town where the platforms were hard to determine against what was just the background. Hopefully, these minor issues will be fixed before release. Color Lim is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
