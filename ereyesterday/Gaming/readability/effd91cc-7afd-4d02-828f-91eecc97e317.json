The Destiny Edition is identical to the Nova Arctis 7 in build quality and performance, but with the addition of a deep red colorway with decorative gold dragon accents in celebration of 2024's Year of the Dragon motif. Even though 2024 has passed, this is still one of SteelSeries' classier designs that doesn't feel outdated or out of place.SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Gaming Headset Dragon EditionSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Wireless Gaming Headset Dragon EditionThe Arctis Nova 7 is one of the best headsets you can get for PS5 and PC. In his Nova 7 review, Matthew Adler wrote that \"SteelSeries continues to push the boundaries of what a headset is capable of. With the addition of simultaneous Bluetooth audio, you can enjoy music, podcasts, or just chat with your friends without losing your game audio – all with a single pair of headphones. The Arctis Nova 7’s new design is sleek, lightweight, and still remains one of the most comfortable headsets I’ve ever used.\" I own a pair of these myself and highly recommend it.The Nova 7 is the successor to the highly rated Arctis 7 series of headsets. It's every bit as good as its predecessor but with some welcome upgrades like a USB Type-C charging port, a longer battery life (38 hours vs. 30 hours), simultaneous wireless and Bluetooth connectivity, and multi-platform compatibility. PC gamers also have access to the SteelSeries GG app, which opens up a whole suite of customization for your audio. You can tailor your audio settings independently for each game. If that's too much for you, there are presets for specific games that are actually tailormade by the game developers. For PS5 gamers, the Nova 7 is also compatible with the PlayStation 5's Tempest 3D Audio.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
