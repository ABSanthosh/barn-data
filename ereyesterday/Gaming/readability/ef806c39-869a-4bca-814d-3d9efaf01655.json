  "text": "Back in March we got the Revenant update that included a change in yet another attempt to fix the EVE Online economyâ€¦ the economy that CCP took aim at and started breaking back in late 2020.Â  Never forget the Winter 2020 Ecosystem Outlook dev blog that introduced a series of blunders that killed off the largest war ever in New Eden and led to the lowest online numbers the game had seen since its earliest days and led to what I called The Year of Disappointment. It turns out if we feel we cannot afford to replace ships, if everything is very expensive and our incomes have been devastated, we donâ€™t go to war like CCP expected, we log off and play something else. If I seem overly critical, it is because CCP has now spent four years trying to fix a problem of their own making.Â  As Cindy Vortex used to say, you donâ€™t get credit for fixing a problem you created. Anyway, one of the side effects of these bad choices has been run away mineral prices due to shortages of key minerals.Â  CCP stomping their feet and insisting that low sec mining should be a thing failed to make it materialize and the game hit all time record prices even after some fixes went in. March 2025 â€“ Economic Indices for All Time The changes to null sec sovereignty with the long gestating Equinox expansion (launched in June, finalized in September) included selectable mining anomalies so null sec entities could choose what they wanted their mineral yield to include.Â  That had some impact, but not enough so the March update included level 3 mining upgrades to get better rocks available. We will see what impact those had with the April MER, which should be out soon.Â  But CCP Okami popped up on Discord to give an update on how things were looking at their end. Hey everyone! Thanks so much for tuning in and checking out fanfest. I wanted to make a quick check-in regarding balancing updates and mining as there are still several important topics here. There will be a tuning update that goes out shortly after Legion (targeting June 3rd, currently) Pyerite This is still the number one mineral that we feel like weâ€™re not hitting yet. Itâ€™s in high demand and the universe is not meeting itâ€™s needs. Weâ€™ll be making a change that will mainly target Highsec as we feel like this is the right region to get a Pyerite buff in at the moment. In regards to Pyerite Upgrades in Null, they will remain the same. These upgrades are largely meant to provide flexibility and option in the extreme need for self-sufficient production (also with the Trit upgrades), and not meant to be the main providers of these minerals or top ISK/hour producers. Morphite Did we overcorrect? Yes and no. Morphite is hitting some good traditional numbers right now, but it is still trending down. Weâ€™re seeing pretty large supplies, which is great but we feel like weâ€™re hitting a spot where weâ€™re happy and want to make sure there isnâ€™t an overcorrection. This will mean that we are going to make some minor tweaks to Morphite oriented Upgrades in Null. There wonâ€™t be any huge bumps here, just some tweaks to keep things on track. Zydrine This is probably the weirdest one right now, and because of that weâ€™re going to wait and see what happens post-Legion. There should be enough theoretical availability in Nullsec at the moment, and Zydrine has seen some volatility in its history despite relative available quantaties and trade volumes. One of the bigger factors here that weâ€™re want to see how it plays out, is the upcoming ability for Nullsec to swap Upgrades, which may make it easier for people to swap into Zydrine buildouts if and when needed. If this doesnâ€™t have the impact we want, then of course weâ€™ll keep looking for additional tuning adjustments in Legion. As noted, the MER will tell the tale soon enough, the the New Eden economy is complicated and perilous to navigate at times as the wisdom of crowds will eventually root out flaws to min/max and exploit any changes.Â  Still, I do give CCP Okami credit for being on this, in part because he wasnâ€™t around for the 2021 destruction of the economy. Meanwhile, in response to some follow on questions to that statement, which included a request to make carriers useful again, this was added to the thread. The main thing Iâ€™ll say for the moment is that Null has gotten a lot of love and in the near future I will be focusing our attention elsewhere for a bit, including WHâ€™s. Iâ€™ll try and take some time to give my thoughts on WHs sometime as well. And also YES carriers. ðŸ™‚ Both carriers and other regions of space now have active design and work happening around them that Iâ€™ll reveal~~~~ in some exciting and relevant moment in the future. ðŸ¤˜ So null secâ€™s turn in the barrel, for the attentions of CCP are always a double-edged sword, seems to be over for now.Â  Wormhole space and the blue loot crabs will now face the Icelandic unblinking eye of economic adjustment.Â  Good luck to them on that front. Finally, while I appreciate CCP Okami posting some updatesâ€¦ why on Discord?Â  One of the many chaotic elements is posting information to one source and then failing to mention it elsewhere. My absolute preferred method of communication is an official dev blog on the main site with a forum thread for discussion, which is then promoted on the communications channels like Discord, Facebook, Blue Sky, Instagram, and even the awful X. Â  That always works and spawns a related Reddit thread over on r/eve and posts on gaming sites and what not. I know, not everything is important enough for that level of treatment, so my second tier favorite is a dedicate forum thread which is then promoted at least on the main social sites and Discord. My least favorite method is when some critical bit of game information gets added in on one channel, like Discord or X, and appears nowhere else.Â  CCP generally does a pretty good job with communicating and shares more game info with its players than almost any other developer.Â  But sometimes it dumps interesting things into a silo that scrolls it off page never to be seen again. Does this mean I donâ€™t think somebody like CCP Okami should be making comments on a single channel on his own.Â  Maybe?Â  I mean, I donâ€™t want to throttle information, but when he posts as CCP Okami he is the voice of CCP in that moment.Â  With great power and all that. That aside, bring on the April MER.Â  Letâ€™s see what that tells us. Related: Reddit â€“ Post-Fanfest mining update",
