  "text": "Clair Obscur! Spider-Man 2! More! Image credit: Kepler Interactive/Digital Foundry The grey, uncomfortably moist British summer is finally here and Epic is celebrating the occasion - well, the season - with the launch of its Epic Store Summer Sale. But there's more, seeing as Thursday also marks a fresh batch of new freebies, which this week includes Civilisation 6. Starting with those freebies, Civilisation 6 is available in its Platinum Edition, meaning you get the base game, six DLC packs, and two expansions for your initial outlay of zero pence. That's good! Civilisation 6 is good (shut up haters)! So you should download it now. Civ 6 will continue to be free until next Thursday, 24th July, after which Legion TD 2 - an \"infinitely replayable multiplayer and single-player tower defense\" game - takes its place. So that's the free stuff out the way, which brings us to Epic's Summer Sale, which runs from today, 17th July, until 31st July. Working slightly backward, all purchases made during the sale (and using Epic's payment system) will earn you Epic Reward points as usual, but the percentage has been boosted to 20 percent. There's also a permanent 20 percent back for all purchases made in Fortnite, Rocket League, and Fall Guys. So what of this sale? Epic's calling it \"two weeks of discounts on best-selling games, from the biggest titles to some excellent indie games.\" And there's some good stuff here. There's 10 percent off developer Sandfall Interactive's highly acclaimed Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, for instance, plus 25 percent off Assassin's Creed Shadows, 50 percent off Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, or 20 percent off if you opt for its sequel. There's plenty more of course, and you'll find it all as you peruse moistly around the Epic Games Store.",
