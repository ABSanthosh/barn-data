  "text": "Marketplace Written By Linn Viberg Published 11/12/24 Journey the seas of Oceania in this new adventure The wind is warm, the water blocks are glistening, and I’m pretty sure I can hear the ancient voice of the ocean calling my name. Or perhaps it’s telling me that adventure awaits in the Moana 2 DLC by Disney and Starfish Studios! Since this DLC is available in multiplayer, let’s both hop into our canoes and set sail for the island of Motunui, and maybe even beyond... Oh, there she is! The one and only Moana, here to teach us how to sing. No? Oh, not sing – sail! Maybe wishful thinking but learning the ways of the ocean from somebody who knows how to wayfind sounds pretty epic. The Moana 2 DLC will take you on a journey across iconic locations on Motunui and beyond to relive moments from both Disney’s Moana and Moana 2. Meet new and familiar characters like Moana’s little sister Simea, the beady eyed Tamatoa, and, not to mention, our favorite rooster Hei Hei! Now that the people of Motunui have embraced voyaging once more, Chief Tui wants to expand the village to more islands. Moana and Maui will teach you to ride the ocean waves and then send you off on thrilling quests around the island and beyond the reef.  Discover the secrets of the Wayfinders’ Cavern, fight off the cute but equally sneaky little pirates called Kakamora, and dive into the monstrous realm of Lalotai to recover Maui’s hook. I don’t know if it’s the ocean again, but I think I hear whispers of a canoe race and an unforgettable island celebration in the name of an island hero, too.  Top off your island adventure with the Flower Crown, available for free in the Dressing Room for a limited time!  The Moana 2 DLC is out now, so put on your free Character Creator item: the Flower Crown and sail into Minecraft Marketplace to start your island adventure today.  Community Creations Discover the best add-ons, mods, and more being built by the incredible Minecraft community!",
