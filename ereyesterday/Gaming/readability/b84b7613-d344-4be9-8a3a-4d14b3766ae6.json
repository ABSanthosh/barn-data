The last time we saw the legendary Star Wars character was at the end of his own show, The Book of Boba Fett, in February 2022. Yes, the Disney+ spin-off series was divisive, with some Star Wars fans feeling it went too far in softening the iconic villain's character. But that can’t be it for Boba Fett, can it?Over three years later, it feels like The Book of Boba Fett Season 2 is stuck in a galaxy far, far away. Lucasfilm has given no indication that the show will return, with next year’s The Mandalorian \u0026 Grogu movie perhaps the best chance of a live-action reprisal. Will there be a The Mandalorian Season 4? Lucasfilm has yet to say, but if it does happen, perhaps Boba Fett would pop up there.In truth, the future of Boba Fett and Temuera Morrison, the actor who plays him, in the Star Wars franchise remains uncertain. And based on recent comments from Morrison himself, there is little reason to deviate from that position.Speaking in an interview with Collider to promote his new film, Ka Whawhai Tonu (In The Fire of War), the 64-year-old New Zealander said he felt \"sad\" not to have reprised the role since the end of The Book of Boba Fett.“Where [sic] The Book of Boba Fett Season 2? Where the hell is Season 2?\" Morrison said. \"I know they're doing Ahsoka Season 2. I'm going, 'Ah, where's my Season 2?'\"According to Collider, Morrison revealed he actually pitched Lucasfilm on Boba Fett appearing in Ahsoka Season 2 (\"can I be Rex and take his helmet off, please?\"), pointing out that he plays not just Boba Fett but all the clones based upon the character.He also bumped into Star Wars stewards Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau recently, and reminded them Boba Fett still exists. Apparently “they kind of said, 'Well, well,' they didn't want to say too much, put it that way. There was a few whispers of — they didn't want to say too much — but they just left it at that.\"That exchange left Morrison feeling like \"I've been preserved for a later date, and I'm going to be tastier.\" He compared his feeling following the encounter to going to grandma’s house and seeing “that preservative jar of peaches up on the shelf.”Every Upcoming Star Wars Movie and TV Show“That's what I think,” he continued. “I'm one of those peaches, and I've been put up on the shelf. I've been preserved for a later date, and I'm going to be tastier.”Morrison could be playing coy, knowing full well he’s coming back to Star Wars in some form. After all, Rosario Dawson had no idea Mark Hamill was returning as Luke Skywalker in The Mandalorian until he walked on set. Lucasfilm has a history of holding its cards close to its chest.But it does sound to me like nothing is in the works for Boba Fett, unfortunately, and indeed last year Morrison offered a reason for why that might be the case. Speaking at the From Clone Troopers to Bounty Hunters panel at Fan Expo Chicago, Morrison cited The Book of Boba Fett's poor reception as the reason for the once beloved character not returning in Star Wars: The Mandalorian \u0026 Grogu. He added that Star Wars owner Disney hadn’t asked him to appear in the incoming film or a second season of The Book of Boba Fett.The show, which told the story of Boba Fett as he escaped from the Sarlacc Pit and acted as a miniature season of The Mandalorian, was among the worst received Star Wars shows. \"This show's reception does seem to have impacted the future of the character in the franchise,\" Morrison said at the time. That was in August 2024. Has something changed in the year since? I'm not sure.Morrison originally played Jango Fett in Star Wars: Episode 2 – Attack of the Clones but years later rejoined Star Wars as Jango's son and clone Boba Fett. He's made clear his desire to return to Star Wars, saying he wants a chunk of The Mandalorian's time just as The Mandalorian led an episode of his show.Photo by Jun Sato/WireImage.Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
