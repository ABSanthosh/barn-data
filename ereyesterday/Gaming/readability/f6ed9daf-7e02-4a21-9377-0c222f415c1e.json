Although the official website still shows the physical PC and PS5 collector's editions for Baldur's Gate 3 were priced at £217 (€260) before they were promptly snapped up, scalpers are trying their luck and listing the collector's editions on auction sites for thousands of pounds. Baldur's Gate 3 for dummies: Basics for EVERYTHING You Need to Know (But Were Afraid to Ask).Watch on YouTube Appending an image that showed someone trying to flog their collector's edition for £2.9K (€3.4K), Douse said he \"understand[s] how commodity works\", but stressed that the point of releasing collector's editions like this is \"to make someone happy\". \"Hate scalpers, man,\" Douse said on X/Twitter (thanks, TheGamer). \"I understand how commodity works, but this CE isn't a commodity, it's designed to make someone happy, not rich. \"If you're buying it to trade, all you're doing is making someone sad.\" Hate scalpers, man. I understand how commodity works, but this CE isn’t a commodity it’s designed to make someone happy, not rich. If you’re buying it to trade, all you’re doing is making someone sad. pic.twitter.com/vtH2CX3OhQ— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) October 12, 2024 The post prompted over a hundred replies, many from fans who were equally frustrated. \"That someone is me,\" lamented one commenter. Last month brought news that Baldur's Gate 3 was a step closer to getting the series' classic real-time with pause combat thanks to one enterprising modder, but there was plenty to chew through even before official modding became a thing.",
