Woot sends a shipping confirmation email with a \"tracking number\" shortly after your order is finalized. The tracking number is actually the 25-character key that you need to redeem on the Xbox Store.Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is stackable up to 36 months, so you could buy up to 12 codes and redeem all of them today if you aren't a current member. These codes are redeemable for both new and active subscribers. If you are charged monthly by the Xbox Store, redeeming a prepaid code will automatically push your next billing date to the day after your prepaid voucher time ends.Buying three months of Game Pass Ultimate from Woot drops your monthly cost to $12.16, a nearly $8 discount versus the Xbox Store. It's also $4.50 less than the monthly average when buying the $50 three-month vouchers from major retailers. If you purchase four vouchers from Woot at $36.49 each, your annual Game Pass Ultimate cost is only $146--a steep reduction from the $240 cost from the Xbox Store and the $200 cost from prepaid vouchers at Amazon.Game Pass Ultimate costs $20/month when you subscribe directly on the Xbox Store. Even if Woot's deal sells out--and these Game Pass offers frequently do--you'll still want to opt for the prepaid voucher method for the time being. Microsoft raised the price of Game Pass Ultimate from $17 to $20 last month, but major retailers are still selling codes at the old prices: $50 for three months and $17 for one month. Amazon had three-month vouchers for $45 up until this week--the retailer finally joined other retailers at the $50 price point. But since it costs $60 across three months directly from Xbox, the $50 offer is still a smart way to subscribe. Amazon may have raised the price of three-month codes to $50, but the retailer still has a fantastic Game Pass-related deal right now. You can get a brand-new Xbox Wireless Controller, an Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K, and one month of Game Pass Ultimate for $75. This bundle is valued at up to $137, as Xbox Wireless Controllers retail for $60-$70, the Fire TV Stick 4K is $50, and Game Pass Ultimate is $17. A handful of controller color options are available, including the recently released transparent blue Sky Cipher Special Edition. Alternatively, you can get the same bundle with the Fire TV Stick 4K Max ($60 value) for $80.Xbox Cloud Gaming was added to Fire TV 4K streaming devices over the summer, so you can stream hundreds of Game Pass games on your Fire Stick, including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Xbox Cloud Gaming is only included with the Ultimate tier of Game Pass. If you need a new Xbox controller and have use for the Fire Stick--for game streaming or not--these bundles offer terrific value. Check out our full breakdown of Amazon's Xbox Cloud Gaming starter kit for more details--it's unclear when the promotion expires.
