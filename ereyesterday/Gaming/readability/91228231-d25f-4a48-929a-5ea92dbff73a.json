The fiercely competitive nature of the VPN market means you can find VPN services at a variety of different price points. What’s more, there are some excellent money-saving deals to be found, particularly if you’re willing to commit for one or two years.That said, I’ve tested many VPNs and found that the best VPN for the budget-conscious isn’t simply the cheapest VPN. Countless free and cheap VPNs fall short of our testing standards. It’s only by taking a deep dive into each VPN and specifics such as server speed and security features that I’ve identified the best budget VPNs. TL;DR – These Are the Best Budget VPNs:With a VPN, short for Virtual Private Network, you can secure your online activities from prying eyes. Your data is encrypted while your IP address is hidden for anonymous browsing. Other benefits include the ability to sidestep content restrictions and even bypass bandwidth throttling. The best budget VPNs allow you to do all of this at an affordable price without compromising on quality.1. MullvadBest Budget VPNSimultaneous connections 5PlatformsWindows, Mac, Android, iOS, LinuxCheapest one-month subscriptionFewer simultaneous connectionsMullvad is the best budget VPN that’s just €5 a month (approximately $5.65 at the time of writing). So if you’re looking for a quality cheap VPN without being tied to a long-term contract, Mullvad is your best bet. Just bear in mind that if you’re willing to commit to a two-year subscription, you can save over $3 a month with the base tiers of CyberGhost and Surfshark. That said, Mullvad offers just one subscription tier which includes access to all its features.One thing that Mullvad has proven is that it’s possible for a VPN to offer top-notch privacy without compromising on performance. Mullvad stands out in that you don’t need to provide an email address and can pay by sending cash in the mail. It’s one of the fastest VPNs I’ve tested, has user-friendly apps, and operates a genuine no-logs policy. You won’t find as many features as with NordVPN and Surfshark, but it does offer MultiHop servers as well as split tunneling.2. SurfsharkBest Budget VPN with Extra FeaturesPricingStarting from $1.99/mo.Simultaneous connectionsUnlimitedPlatformsWindows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TVLowest average monthly priceCan access popular streaming servicesExpensive one-month subscriptionSurfshark stands out for having the lowest monthly subscription price of any of the best budget VPNs. This is through its two year plan, which is priced at just $1.99. One caveat however is that this is the Surfshark Starter plan which doesn’t include Surfshark’s antivirus. Still, there’s no shortage of features here, including an ad blocker and MultiHop servers. One-year plans start from $3.19 a month, but single month plans are among the most expensive of any VPN at $15.45.From what I found in my review, Surfshark is an excellent streaming VPN thanks to a combination of fast speeds and reliable unblocking. It worked with multiple Netflix libraries as well as the likes of BBC iPlayer and Prime Video in testing. Surfshark is bursting with features with the highest tier plans including an antivirus and access to Incogni, which is Surfshark’s data removal service. It doesn’t hurt that you can secure all of your devices simultaneously with a single subscription either.3. Proton VPNBest Budget VPN with a Free TierPricingStarting from $4.49/mo.Simultaneous connections10PlatformsWindows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux, Android TV, Apple TVSome of the fastest speedsLive chat support isn’t 24/7Proton VPN has one of the more affordable one-year subscriptions. With a savings of 50% over its monthly plan, it costs just $4.99 a month ($59.88 total). Proton VPN’s one-month plan isn’t terribly priced either, at $9.99. You can only save an extra 5% with the two-year plan ($4.49/month) so paying less upfront with the one year deal is arguably the safer bet if you want to balance getting a good deal with having the flexibility to switch VPNs if needed.More than one of the best budget VPNs, Proton VPN has the best free VPN plan on the market. That’s because its free tier has no ads, no logging, and no data or speed limits. It’s hard to find fault with Proton VPN, a strong all-rounder. It’s one of the fastest VPNs I’ve tested and, unlike most VPNs, gives you the option to pay in cash. A growing feature list includes an ad, tracker, and malware blocker. It’s just a shame that live chat support isn’t available 24/7.4. IPVanishBest Budget VPN for Unlimited DevicesPricingStarting from $2.19/mo.Simultaneous connectionsUnlimitedPlatformsWindows, Mac, Android, iOS, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TVHigher tier includes phone supportHeadquartered in the U.S. (a Five Eyes member)IPVanish has one of the lowest monthly subscription rates of any VPN. Its two-year plan costs just $52.56, which equates to $2.19 a month – a price only beaten by Surfshark’s lowest subscription tier and PrivateVPN. The one-year subscription is also affordable at $3.33 a month. If you don’t mind paying roughly a dollar more per month for the Advanced tier, you get extras including cloud backup and phone support, the latter of which is a rarity in the VPN landscape.This is a popular option with North American users thanks to its 1,400 servers in the U.S. and Canada. It has made huge strides with regard to its server speeds and unblocking in recent years. There’s no limit to the number of devices you can connect at once either. More recently, IPVanish has introduced new features such as a secure browser, cloud storage, and Double VPN servers. Privacy enthusiasts may prefer that it isn’t headquartered in the US (a Five Eyes country) however.Disclosure: IPVanish is owned by Ziff Davis, IGN's parent company.5. CyberGhostBest Budget VPN With a Free TrialPricingStarting from $2.03/mo.Simultaneous connections7PlatformsWindows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux, Amazon Fire TVGenerous money-back guaranteeCyberGhost has one of the most affordable two-year plans, totaling $56.94 ($2.19 a month). It also offers a six-month plan, which is a rarity among VPNs. This is priced at $6.99 a month, providing a compromise between an expensive short-term subscription and the higher upfront costs of a multi-year plan. CyberGhost has a generous 45-day money-back guarantee and a 24-hour free trial for Windows and MacOS (no credit card required), so you can try it risk-free.One area in which CyberGhost stands out is its large server network that covers 100 countries. This gives you greater flexibility for unblocking and is a big reason why it’s among our best VPNs for streaming. That said, CyberGhost is one of many VPNs that struggles to work in China. Gamers will appreciate CyberGhost’s gaming-optimized servers located in London and New York, which allow for lag-free gaming when playing the likes of Fortnite and Apex Legends.6. NordVPNBest Budget VPN for GamingPricingStarting from $3.09/mo.Simultaneous connections10PlatformsWindows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TVPacked with extra featuresNordVPN has four different subscription tiers with generous discounts of up to 77% per month depending on which you opt for. Of course, the biggest savings come with its two-year plans starting from $3.09 a month. One-year subscriptions are a little more expensive and start from $4.99 a month. If you prefer to opt for just one month, you’ll pay $12.99 for the Basic tier but the Plus tier represents better value at $13.99 a month because it includes anti-malware protection and a password manager.This is arguably the best-known VPN provider and for good reason. NordVPN excels at bypassing content restrictions. It’s also our best VPN for gaming thanks to its vast server network (a highly impressive 7,000+ servers in 118 countries), consistent connections, and Meshnet feature for LAN gaming. However, the apps arguably suffer from having too many features squeezed in, as well as a server map that not everyone will find particularly useful.7. PrivateVPNBest Budget VPN for UnblockingPricingStarting from $2.00/mo.Simultaneous connections10PlatformsWindows, Mac, Android, iOS, Amazon Fire TVAffordable plans across the boardUnblocks popular streaming servicesSignificantly smaller server networkPrivateVPN offers one of the least expensive plans of the budget VPNs. As long as you don’t mind a three-year subscription, you can save significantly as it works out at just $2 a month ($72 total). PrivateVPN also has a three-month subscription ($6/month), while its one-month plan ($9.90) is one of the more affordable, albeit still nearly double the price of Mullvad. PrivateVPN may be a lesser-known provider but has some of the most beginner-friendly apps.I’ve found that PrivateVPN’s IP addresses don’t get blacklisted as quickly as more popular providers, making it particularly suitable for accessing streaming services such as Netflix, BBC iPlayer, and Prime Video. PrivateVPN only has a little over 200 servers but they’re located in 63 countries and this, of course, includes the UK, U.S., Canada, and Australia. Where PrivateVPN does fall short compared to other best cheap VPNs is that it’s relatively light on features.How to Pick a Budget VPNThe best budget VPN is not the same as the cheapest VPN. Instead, it’s that which offers the best service for the best possible price. In testing each VPN service, I measure server speeds, check for DNS leaks, time the reply speed of customer support, and more. None of this changes when looking at more affordable VPNs, only that I’m also factoring cost into the equation.The best cheap VPNs all meet the following key criteria:Affordable short-term or long-term subscriptionSpeeds that are fast enough for lag-free streamingHigh level of encryption and protection from leaksAbsolutely no logging of any identifying data of usersLive chat and email support, ideally 24/7Minimum of seven simultaneous connections allowedI’ve taken the one-month subscription rates of each VPN as well as their lowest possible monthly price (usually as part of a two-year subscription plan) and compiled an average, factoring this into my rankings.Mullvad VPN is the cheapest VPN if you’re looking for a short-term option or simply don’t want to have to commit to a VPN long-term. Yet Surfshark is arguably the best value VPN as its two-year subscription costs 65% less per month.How to Use a VPN:If you haven’t used a VPN before, rest assured that getting set up and connected is simple:Sign up with one of the best budget VPNs.Download and install the VPN app compatible with your device.Open the VPN app and log in.Connect to a server in your preferred location.You’re all set!Cheapest VPNs FAQsAre budget VPNs less secure?Not necessarily. Factors that can dictate a VPN’s pricing include the number of servers it operates and the availability of extra features like specialty servers or an antivirus or password manager. The best cheap VPNs still offer all of the key security features required from a quality VPN. It’s just that they do so at a more competitive price point.Can I use a free VPN instead of a budget VPN?Few free VPNs are trustworthy and of decent quality. Free VPNs don’t offer many servers or server locations, and they also tend to throttle bandwidth and cap data, resulting in poor performance. Many don’t provide an adequate level of encryption and may log and sell your browsing data. If you do need to opt for a free VPN, I’d recommend Proton VPN’s free plan.What’s the difference between monthly and yearly VPN plans?When you opt for a one-month VPN subscription, you’ll pay more each month than with an annual plan. The advantage is that you have more flexibility to switch if you’re unsatisfied. However, the biggest savings come with yearly or even multi-year subscriptions. While you’ll ultimately pay less when you break the pricing down per month with a yearly subscription, you have to pay the full amount upfront.Can I get a refund if I’m not satisfied with a VPN?All of these VPNs come with a 30-day money-back guarantee (except CyberGhost, which is 45 days). This allows you to try any of them out risk-free. As long as you remember to cancel before the end of that period, you’ll receive a full refund.Mark Gill is a freelance VPN writer for IGN, bringing over five years of dedicated experience from Comparitech, where he delves deep into the intricacies of VPNs.

It’s just that they do so at a more competitive price point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 data-cy=\"title3\"\u003eCan I use a free VPN instead of a budget VPN?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eFew free VPNs are trustworthy and of decent quality. Free VPNs don’t offer many servers or server locations, and they also tend to throttle bandwidth and cap data, resulting in poor performance.
