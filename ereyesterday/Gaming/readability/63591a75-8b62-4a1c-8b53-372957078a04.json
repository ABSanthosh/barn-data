  "text": "Sony revealed the latest in Q-Games’ PixelJunk series during its State of Play presentation Wednesday, and it’s a gorgeous shooter with a twist.Directed by Tomohisa Kuramitsu, who goes by “Baiyon” and is probably best known for his work on the PixelJunk Eden series, Dreams of Another is a shooter built around the idea that you don’t just use guns to destroy objects, but to create things, and it features a dreamlike art style.The trailer shows a character, who seems to be wearing pajamas, carrying various guns and traveling through surreal environments — one with horses running from a carousel, another with a robot running down a street.We don’t know exactly how it all works just yet, but some passages in the trailer give a few clues. “No creation without destruction,” the trailer says. “Because destruction is by no means an end but a beginning of something beyond. All human life is finite and that is why you feel an explosion of life when something is destroyed.”According to Q-Games, the game uses point cloud rendering technology to create its unique visual style, and to also allow players to alter the world in various ways. The particle-heavy visuals give off a bit of a Rez Infinite vibe, which seems appropriate given how well that approached worked in VR, as Dreams of Another is heading to both PS5 and PS VR2.Following the trailer, Kuramitsu said the game “defies the norms of shooting games. Rather than using weapons to harm or destroy, you use them to transform the abstract chaos and materialize the world around you.”Dreams of Another is heading scheduled for release in 2025.",
