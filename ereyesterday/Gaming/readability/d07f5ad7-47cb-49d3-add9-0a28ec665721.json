In the first week after launch, two new updates pave the way for Season 01 and beyond with the addition of two Multiplayer favorites: the Infected game mode and the original 1950s Nuketown map. The first content drop begins right now starting with Infected, followed by the release of Nuketown on November 1. Here’s what you need to know: Play Infected the Black Ops 6 Way Infected makes its Black Ops 6 debut just in time for Halloween! With the new Omnimovement system in place, this Party Mode takes on a whole new life… for the living and the undead. Cheat death — or add to the undead ranks — with the most fluid movement mechanics to date. For new and returning players, an Infected match begins with one player randomly assigned as the starting infected. The infected player’s goal is to eliminate all other players. Each time a survivor is eliminated, they will join the ranks of the undead, while the remaining survivors must keep the horde at bay until the match timer runs out. Drop into the Infected playlist right now, live in Black Ops 6! Classic Nuketown Arrives November 1 The original Nuketown is back! This homage to the version players first encountered in Call of Duty: Black Ops is an exact — though graphically much improved — version of the original, keeping the classic 1950s design of the Nevada testing site. For first-time Nuketowners and returning veterans alike, here’s the lay of the land: The Streets of Nuketown Built by Veteran Treyarch Map designer Adam Hoggatt and released as part of Call of Duty: Black Ops in November 2010, this remaster remains extremely faithful to the original design and layout of the map, even down to the precise placement of parked vehicles and other scenery harking back to the original three-lane design. This is Nuketown in its most original form, with a bright and bleached desert landscape, and even a double rainbow to gaze at, taking you all the way back to where it all began. Hoggatt gave a little more insight into this remastered version of his original creation. Although rumored to have been designed in just two days, it’s been a fan favorite for 14 years: \"The original Nuketown has always been my favorite, mainly because of how it came about and how the studio rallied around it,” Hoggatt said. “Recently, it occurred to me that many of our current players have never experienced the original, so they get to feel the Nuketown magic for the first time.” But Hoggatt also expressed excitement for players familiar with the original map. “I'm excited that we are bringing back the original Nuketown exactly as you remember it but looking better than ever! Those players will definitely be hit with a big wave of nostalgia. I can't wait!\" Nuketown for Dummies: A Tour of the Homes While most of the combat is centered around the bus and container truck, the interiors (and upper floors) of the opposing houses – recently installed after being constructed and shipped from nearby Area 99 – allow for a variety of excellent sightlines toward the opposing team’s spawn point. That is provided you’re not put off by the dead gaze of the plastic people inhabiting the cul-de-sac on the corner of Latchkey Road and Trinity Avenue. Welcome to the Nuketown Neighborhood: Warhead, Area 99 Can’t get enough of the iconic location? Deploy to the Multiplayer launch Strike map Warhead to battle in vicinity of the infamous testing site via Face Off 6v6 or 2v2 Gunfight. Warhead’s set of dwellings has been reclaimed by the desert sands. Watch the debris scattered all over the maps, with model homes and vehicles slowly sinking into the desert sands, and a colossal crater just out of bounds. And at the start of Season 01, deploy to the new Area 99 Resurgence map in the free-to-play Call of Duty: Warzone™ update. Also set in the Nevada desert, this top-secret government site is just miles away from the original Nuketown location. See where it all began by exploring the mannequin assembly plant, the factory warehouse including pieces of the Nuketown homes in development, and much more, when Season 01 launches! So… when is that, exactly? Massive Content Drop: Season 01 Arrives on Thursday, November 14! Make sure your Black Ops 6 weapons are fully leveled up, and all your gear is unlocked and ready to go when Area 99 launches just over two weeks from now! Season 01 arrives on November 14, adding a colossal amount of free content like all-new Multiplayer maps and modes, a terrifying new in-season Zombies map, as well as the introduction of Omnimovement and Black Ops 6 weapons and Loadout features to Call of Duty: Warzone!
