  "text": "SummaryUndying is available today.Help Anling and Cody survive the zombie apocalypse.A unique blend of heartfelt narrative, survival, and RPG gameplay. A Journey of Love and Survival Comes to Xbox Hello, Xbox players! I’m David Brevik, President and Executive Producer at Skystone Games. As someone who has spent decades creating and supporting games that blend immersive worlds with powerful storytelling, I am incredibly excited to share a game that pushes those boundaries even further. Undying, crafted by the brilliant minds at Vanimals, is out now. It’s not just a game; it’s an experience that will challenge your mind, touch your heart, and leave you thinking long after you’ve set the controller down. A Story That Stays with You In Undying, you step into the shoes of Anling, a mother facing the unimaginable. Bitten during a zombie outbreak, she knows her time is limited. With the clock ticking, her sole focus becomes teaching her young son, Cody, how to survive in a world that has fallen apart. This isn’t just a game about fighting off hordes of the undead. It’s a game about passing on knowledge, building bonds, and ensuring that what truly matters—love, resilience, and hope—endures. The narrative is deeply personal, and every choice you make ripples through Anling and Cody’s journey. Do you spend time gathering resources for the short term, or focus on teaching Cody skills that will last a lifetime? As Anling’s condition worsens, the weight of your decisions grows heavier. This is survival at its most intimate and emotional. A Unique Blend of Gameplay and Emotion From a gameplay perspective, Undying combines the best elements of survival mechanics with a heartfelt narrative. You’ll scavenge for resources, manage limited supplies, and craft tools to fend off the dangers of a zombie-ravaged world. But unlike other survival games, every action is tied to Anling’s dwindling time and Cody’s growth. Cody isn’t just a side character; he’s your legacy. As you teach him skills like cooking, crafting, and defending himself, you’ll see him grow into someone capable of facing the challenges ahead. The dynamic between Anling and Cody evolves in real-time, making every moment you spend together meaningful. The Vision Behind Undying What makes Undying truly special is the team behind it. Vanimals is a studio that doesn’t shy away from taking risks. They’ve created a game that not only challenges how we think about the survival genre but also prioritizes emotional depth and human connection. Every aspect of Undying reflects their passion and creativity. The art style, with its minimalist yet striking visuals, draws you into a world that feels both haunting and hopeful. The soundtrack underscores the emotional weight of the story, enhancing every moment. And the gameplay mechanics, from resource management to skill progression, are seamlessly integrated into the narrative. As someone who has spent a lifetime designing games, I’m constantly inspired by teams like Vanimals. They remind us that games aren’t just about mechanics or graphics; they’re about stories that resonate, characters that matter, and worlds that stay with us long after we’ve left them. And Guess What? It’s out Today Undying is more than just a game about surviving the end of the world. It’s a story about what it means to truly live, to love, and to leave something behind. It’s about the bonds that define us and the lessons that endure. Whether you’re a fan of survival games, narrative-driven experiences, or innovative gameplay, Undying has something for you. It’s a game that challenges not just your skills, but your emotions and your perspective on what survival really means. So, get ready to experience one of the most moving journeys in gaming. On behalf of Skystone Games and Vanimals, I can’t wait for you to step into Anling and Cody’s world. Their story is one of hope, resilience, and love—and it’s one you won’t soon forget. Caught amid the zombie apocalypse and with time running out, Anling will stop at nothing to ensure her son, Cody, gets to safety. Enduring countless perils, including the zombie infection that's beginning to take over her body, not to mention teaching Cody how to survive their harsh new reality. As Anling and Cody explore the world they'll come across an ensemble of characters that present unique challenges. How Anling and Cody handle each one determines their fates, some may die, some may live, and some may become staunch allies or even an archnemesis. Will humanity truly prevail? Your Path, Your Choices, Your Story! With everyone trying to survive, whether you help others or not can lead to devastating consequences. Everyone has their secrets, which begs the question… Who can you really trust? Every decision you make changes the outcome of your story, what will your ending look like? Crafting 1.0 Means of Survival! It's not a survival game if there's no crafting and now, with so many things to craft and enhance, it's a wonder if there'll even be enough resources! How you use the crafting system will determine if you survive or not, and how easy it will be. The World is filled with Dungeons, Stories, and loot! Did you really think we wouldn't have David Brevik (the godfather of Diablo) help design dungeons and make sure looting felt satisfying? Each time you start a game of Undying, you'll never know how the map will be laid out before your eyes. The 14 major locations will be spread across the map in a variety of layouts, while the other \"Unsafe Areas\" are filled with random events that can quickly alter your plans. Will you help an ungrateful survivor; what about a gang surrounded by zombies? You never know who you will encounter on your journey, each with their own tale to tell.",
