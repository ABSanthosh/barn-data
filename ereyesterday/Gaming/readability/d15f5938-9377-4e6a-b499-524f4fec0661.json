Fantasy Critic League â€“ Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games As a reminder, last week was the league draft where everybody ended up with five picks on their game roster. However, everybody still has four empty slots that they can fill.Â  It isnâ€™t requiredâ€¦ and if you pick something that is reviewed poorly it could possibly harm your final scoreâ€¦ but they are there if you have your eye on something coming up. In addition, everybody has a counter pick slot open.Â  That needs to be filled by November or it will cost you 15 points.Â  The counter picks available are all from the rosters of other players.Â  Hint:Â  If somebody picks Half-Life 3, which is an available pick, counter-pick that one. At the end of the draft the projected results were as follows: The initial standings estimate That ranking is pretty nebulous as no picked games have bee released yet and we all had exactly five picks.Â  As it turns out, you get points for empty slots in the estimate, so the four empty slots were boosting all of us. Over the course of the week, from Saturday at 17:00 Pacific / 20:00 Eastern (or 01:00 UTC Sunday) to Thursday at those same times, bidding is open. At 17:00 Pacific on Thursday open bidding is done and the titles in play are announced on the site and in the Discord channel on the TAGN Discord server.Â  For the first week, the following 11 titles were declared in play. Assassinâ€™s Creed Shadows (ðŸŽ¯ Counter Pick Bid) Release Date: 2025-03-20 Hype Factor: 58.1 Chained Echoes: Ashes of Elrant Release Date: Q2 2025 Hype Factor: 8.2 Coffee Talk Tokyo Release Date: 2025 Hype Factor: 5.4 Dune: Awakening Release Date: Early 2025 Hype Factor: 11.5 Dynasty Warriors: Origins (ðŸŽ¯ Counter Pick Bid) Release Date: 2025-01-17 Hype Factor: 30.4 EA Sports College Football 26 Release Date: Summer 2025 Hype Factor: 1.8 MLB the Show 25 Release Date: 2025 Hype Factor: 2.4 Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault Release Date: 2025 Hype Factor: 6.7 Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker Release Date: Spring 2025 Hype Factor: 17.1 Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter Release Date: 2025-01-28 Hype Factor: 17.3 World of Warcraft: Midnight (ðŸŽ¯ Counter Pick Bid) Release Date: Late 2025 or Later Hype Factor: 3.1 No bid prices or publisher names are mentioned.Â  It is just a notification that those titles are in play. Between that announcement and 17:00 Pacific time on Saturday anybody in the league can then also bid on titles that are in play, in case you see something you now realize is a good idea.Â  There is nothing like somebody else wanting something to spur interest. This week, these were the results of the bidding. Dune: Awakening Won by Crash and Burn Games (Shawn) with a bid of $50 Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane)â€™s bid of $15 did not succeed: Publisher was outbid. TAGN HQ (Wilhelm)â€™s bid of $2 did not succeed: Publisher was outbid. See, somebody bid on it then somebody else wanted itâ€¦ or maybe we all just bid on it.Â  But it went to Crash and Burn Games with a $50 bid, half of their bid allowance. That was the only contested bid.Â  The rest ran out as follows: MLB the Show 25 Won by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane) with a bid of $12 Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter Won by Rodent Entertainment (Arhanta) with a bid of $1 Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker Won by Crash and Burn Games (Shawn) with a bid of $25 EA Sports College Football 26 Won by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane) with a bid of $13 Chained Echoes: Ashes of Elrant Won by Crash and Burn Games (Shawn) with a bid of $10 Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault Won by Crash and Burn Games (Shawn) with a bid of $10 Coffee Talk Tokyo Crash and Burn Games (Shawn)â€™s bid of $5 did not succeed: No roster spots available. This final one did not go through as Crash and Burn Games had already filled up their roster. Then there were the counter pick bids, which all went through uncontested. Dynasty Warriors: Origins Won by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane) with a bid of $15 ( Counter Pick) Assassinâ€™s Creed Shadows Won by Rodent Entertainment (Arhanta) with a bid of $1 ( Counter Pick) World of Warcraft: Midnight Won by TAGN HQ (Wilhelm) with a bid of $1 ( Counter Pick) You can spot the spenders and the cheap skates I guess.Â  I donâ€™t like to spend too much of my budget early in the season. All of that left the league with the following standings. TAGN Fantasy Critic League Week 1 Standings As I mentioned, empty picks get some free points while filled slots depend on the projected possible score for a title, which likely bears little relationship with reality, so Crash and Burn Games dropped to the bottom of the projection due to filling all their empty slots.Â  They only need to fill the counter pickâ€¦ good thing they have $5.00 left in their budgetâ€¦ and they can sit back and watch the show. Likewise, Rodent Entertainment didnâ€™t drop in the projections, but also didnâ€™t benefit from their pick, their projected score actually dropping. Though, after saying that, I will note that Neutical Publishing, while suffering a reduced projection, didnâ€™t drop as far as I might have expected. Everybody else stood firmâ€¦ or are playing a canny long gameâ€¦ or forgot to bidâ€¦ or something. So far though, no titles picked have shipped.Â  That will change this week however, as two picks are slated to launch.Â  That means whoever grabbed them will be stuck with them while the rest of us wait for the scores to come in and settle down. It can take a bit of time for sufficient scores to land, and then additional time for all the counted scores to arrive. The first game to launch for the league will be Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, which was picked by Neutical Publishing.Â  First party Nintendo titles tend to review well.Â  We will see if that sends somebody out to an early lead.

empty picks get some free points while filled slots depend on the projected possible score for a title, which likely bears little relationship with reality, so Crash and Burn Games dropped to the bottom of the projection due to filling all their empty slots.Â  They only need to fill the counter pickâ€¦ good thing they have $5.00 left in their budgetâ€¦ and they can sit back and watch the show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLikewise, Rodent Entertainment didnâ€™t drop in the projections, but also didnâ€™t benefit from their pick, their projected score actually dropping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough, after saying that, I will note that Neutical Publishing, while suffering a reduced projection, didnâ€™t drop as far as I might have expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody else stood firmâ€¦ or are playing a canny long gameâ€¦ or forgot to bidâ€¦ or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far though, no titles picked have shipped.Â  That will change this week however, as two picks are slated to launch.Â  That means whoever grabbed them will be stuck with them while the rest of us wait for the scores to come in and settle down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can take a bit of time for sufficient scores to land, and then additional time for all the counted scores to arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first game to launch for the league will be \u003cem\u003eDonkey Kong Country Returns HD\u003c/em\u003e, which was picked by Neutical Publishing.Â  First party Nintendo titles tend to review well.Â  We will see if that sends somebody out to an early lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca
