We wanted to celebrate our studio, the series, and you, the fans, by making it easier than ever to experience this story. We’re proud to introduce The Last of Us Complete. Check out our announce trailer below: Available today on the PlayStation 5 console, The Last of Us Complete allows players to experience both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II Remastered in one package. The Last of Us Complete makes it easier than ever to experience the full story on PS5, whether you’ve played both entries, just one, or have yet to immerse yourself in the world of Joel, Ellie, Abby, and all of our characters. The Last of Us Complete digital download is available now, but we’ve also created a special physical version. The Last of Us Complete: Collector’s Edition is also now available for pre-order exclusively at direct.playstation.com and will be available on July 10.* The Last of Us Complete’s physical release is housed in a beautiful collector’s box featuring new artwork capturing the humanity at the heart of our story through a beautiful, intricate design. Included is a Steelbook Case with this artwork, which stores physical discs with new, minimal designs for both The Last of Us Part I and Part II Remastered.   The complete experiences of Part I and Part II Remastered are the definitive ways to play each of these games. Our team rebuilt The Last of Us Part I from the ground up specifically with PlayStation 5 in mind, offering full DualSense support, 3D audio, and more. The Last of Us Part II Remastered allows you to not only experience an enhanced edition of the sequel, but also dive behind-the-scenes with hours of commentary, and additions like Lost Levels, the roguelike No Return mode, Guitar Free Play, and more.  Additionally, we’re proud to include a set of lithographs from a host of talented artists. Our team hand-picked artists who we felt could offer beautiful takes on these characters that mean so much to both our studio and to all of you. They make for wonderful pieces to display, representing the heart, humanity, and beauty at the core of our series.  From our entire studio, thank you so much for your incredible support for The Last of Us and Naughty Dog over the years. This is such an exciting moment for both the franchise and our teams. We are so humbled by your personal stories of what the series has meant to you, have marveled at your incredible Photo Mode shots, and inspired to keep pushing ourselves forward to create more stories and worlds you’ll love. *direct.playstation.com purchase information: Starting April 10, 2025 at 10am PT in the U.S., and 6pm local time in the U.K and Portugal., 7pm France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, players will be able to pre-order The Last of Us Complete: Collector’s Edition exclusively through direct.playstation.com in limited quantities.
