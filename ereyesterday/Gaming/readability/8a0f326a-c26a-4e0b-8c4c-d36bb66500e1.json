  "description": "Are you looking for the secret reward from the Treasure Trove in Blue Prince? This particular room might seem like an inconspicuous location, but it hides an even deeper mystery. Before we delve into that, please know that this article contains spoilers, too.How to get the secret reward in the Treasure Trove in Blue Prince - Royal Scepter guideThe Treasure Trove isn't available by default since it's actually a Found Floorplan. The blueprint itself is located deep within the Underground, specifically in the upper section of the Rotating Gear just past the sealed Red Door.Once you obtain it, you'll see its default effect: Gain +5 gold whenever you draft the Treasure Trove. That means the room will end up containing more coins as you keep drafting it during your runs.As for the Treasure Trove secret, the clues actually come from the chest that you can open with any regular key. We're going to discuss this facet first before moving on to the solution itself. Treasure Trove cluesAside from an ever-increasing amount of gold, the Treasure Trove in Blue Prince also contains a locked chest. Once opened with a key, you'll find notes with different colors and symbols. There are a bunch of messages here, including which colors and symbols are true, which can also be contradicted by others that tell you how some phrases are actually false.The message that's 100% true comes from the blue memo, which only appears if:You've already unlocked the Blue Tents from the Gift Shop.You drafted the Treasure Trove in rank/row 8 of the house--i.e. one row below the Antechamber.You should then see a blue memo inside the chest when you open it.The blue memo states: \"All boxes marked by the sun symbol contain memos that are true.\" It just so happens that one particular memo leads to another phrase, saying: \"The true treasure of the Treasure Trove is not in this house.\" The Shrine: Blessing of the MonkEssentially, the Blue Prince Treasure Trove secret reward also involves the use of the Shrine, an outer room accessed via the West Gate Path. While the drafting options are randomized, you should check out the Shrine when it's available.You need to donate 30 gold to the Shrine statue to obtain the Blessing of the Monk. The Blessing of the Monk allows you to draft any room in the manor's interior in the outer shed. There's just one caveat: You must end your day while inside that particular room that you want to draft outside.Note 1: This buff lasts for four in-game days (counting your current run). As such, you need to consider when you'd activate it. Otherwise, you have to wait for the Shrine to reappear as an option in the outer shed.Note 2: Don't smash the stone chest inside the Shrine. You're going to do that eventually, but now would be a bad time especially if you're focusing on the Treasure Trove. Drafting the Treasure Trove as an outer roomProgress through your run normally until you can place down the Treasure Trove inside the manor. Then, assuming Blessing of the Monk is active, end your day while inside the Treasure Trove.The next day, you can pick the Treasure Trove as an option for the outer room. Inside, you'll notice all the gold lying around, as well as a curious-looking chest that wasn't there before. The Key of Aries: How to open the Treasure Trove chestSo, how exactly do you open this secret chest in the Treasure Trove. Well, you're going to need a unique key known as the Key of Aries. It actually comes from a long arc that's also quite a doozy. Here's a quick summary:You need to destroy the wall in the Chess Puzzle area to reveal a cipher with the word: CASTLE.You then need to perform a \"castle move\" involving the Rook and the King. Basically, you must choose the Rook power, followed by the King power, or vice versa. A path opens to an underground crypt.While inside the crypt, you have to wait until it's 1:30 p.m. in-game. Doing so reveals a large clock mechanism, and the clues to solve it come from the cipher itself.Once you've opened the small compartment of the mechanism, you'll receive the Key of Aries.You can learn all about these details in our Castle Cipher guide. Oh, and for reference, the crypt and the clock mechanism remain accessible in future runs. It means once you're able to draft the Treasure Trove as an outer room, you can head to the crypt, grab the key, and bring it to the Treasure Trove. The Royal Scepter: Treasure Trove secret rewardOnce you have the Key of Aries from the crypt, bring it to the Treasure Trove (outer room). You'll then be able to open the sealed chest.Your reward for finding the Treasure Trove secret in Blue Prince is none other than the Royal Scepter, one of the most powerful items in the game. Whenever you pick up the Royal Scepter, you can select a color. Rooms of this color appear more commonly as drafting options. For instance, if you want to see more hallways, then you can pick the orange color upon picking up this item.Moreover, the Royal Scepter has a unique mechanic involving its spawn location:If you end the day in a room that's the same color as the Royal Scepter, it will stay in your inventory for your next run.If you somehow lose it--i.e. you end the day in a room that has a different color--you'll find it on the altar of the Treasure Trove when you draft it inside the manor. There's no need to draft it outside again using the Blessing of the Monk.Well, that concludes the hunt for the Royal Scepter. Oh, and if you're wondering if there's another use for it, well, there certainly is. Maybe you plan on reclaiming something from a certain room.A surreal adventure filled with wonders and mysteries await you in Blue Prince.
