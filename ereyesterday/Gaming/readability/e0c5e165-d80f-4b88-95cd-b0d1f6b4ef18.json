Amazon has just dropped the price of the recently released Apple iPad Pro M4 13\" tablet to $1,099 after a $200 discount, matching the lowest price during Black Friday. The new iPad Pro was released on May 15, 2024, and boasts significant upgrades over its predecessor including a powerful M4 chip and, for the first time, a gorgeous tandem OLED display.$200 Off 2024 iPad Pro M4 13\"iPad Pro (M4) 13\"In our 2024 iPad Pro M4 review, Jacqueline Thomas wrote, \"For creative professionals, the 2024 iPad Pro is the most powerful tablet on the market and is going to shine if your work revolves around a touchscreen. For the rest of us, though, the iPad Pro is simply the most beautiful display you'll find in a tablet, with hardware that's powerful enough to be a top-end device for years to come.\"The 2024 iPad Pro is the best tablet on the market, iOS or otherwise, thanks to the new M4 processor which is both powerful and power efficient. Compared to the previous generation iPad M2, it performs about 20% better. However, the biggest update of the iPad Pro is not the M4 chip, but instead the tandem OLED panel which hadn't previously been seen on an Apple product. Tandem OLED is better than traditional OLED in two ways: 1) it's far brighter, and 2) it's less prone to burn-in. If you're wondering why this technology hasn't found its way into TVs, the answer is simply because it's not cost-effective at larger sizes. The iPad can get away with it because the 11\" screen is much smaller, but that's also a major reason why the iPad Pro is priced considerably higher than the other iPads in Apple's 2024 lineup.Looking for more iPad resources?If you're not sure which iPad is best for you, we have an iPad guide which details which iPad is ideal for which use case.
