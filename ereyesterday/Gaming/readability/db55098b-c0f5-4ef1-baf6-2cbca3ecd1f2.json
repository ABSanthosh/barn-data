Alliance Tournament XXI As has been the case in recent years, things kick off with a timeline on how we get from today (or yesterday, really) to the final event, which is slated to land in late October: 11 July – Tournament announcement and signups for Thunderdome start, talent applications open 17 July – Main Tournament rules announced, team registrations open, Thunderdome opens for existing accounts, and the first invite wave goes out. 21 July – Talent application deadline 25 July – Team registration closes 28 July – Talent interview starts 29 July – Tournament Teams announced 30 July – Roster submission 1 opens \u0026 Merc Registration begins 1 August – Feeder format announcement \u0026 Live Draw 8 August – Talent Team announced 21 August – Roster (and mercenary) submission 1 closes, and ad submission deadline for the Feeders 26 August – Team Rosters announced 30 August \u0026 31 August – Feeder tournament broadcast weekend 1 6 September \u0026 7 September – Feeder tournament broadcast weekend 2 11 September – Roster submission 2 opens 25 September – Roster submission 2 concludes \u0026 flagship submissions begin 29 September – Revised Team Rosters announced 2 October – Flagship lock deadline (ad submission deadline for the main tournament) 3 October – Flagships Announced 24, 25 \u0026 26 October – Alliance Tournament XXI Main Broadcast Of note is the change up in the actual tournament itself, which will now be run on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, wrapping up in a single weekend as opposed to being split between two consecutive weekends. Then there are the changes being planned for this year’s Alliance Tournament: In Alliance Tournament XX, a team’s total points were increased from 100 to 200, and many ship values were adjusted. The number of ships with unique point values has been increased again. During the process of increasing the maximum point value, multiple ships saw an overall increase in point value compared to before. This has been further adjusted, and the point cost of many more ships has been reduced. The Babaroga, Tholos and Cenotaph will be allowed in this tournament. As the Caldari are this year’s sponsor, a selection of Caldari ships will receive an additional point discount. Duplicate hulls being fielded, which resulted in what’s was known as “point inflation,” will be suppressed this tournament. The Caldari don’t like inflation. The maximum number of ships of a given hull size in the arena has been adjusted from 4 to 3. A new alternating ban system will be used. Additional changes have been made to the Flagship system. Last year, some of the previous Alliance Tournament prize ships were allowed. Point costs and a few of the constraints around these ships have been adjusted again. The Caldari have also opted to re-allow their flagship Black Ops battleship, the Widow, to the list of available flagships. As noted in the changes, after last year’s Guristas sponsorship things have returned to a more normal turn as the Caldari State will be the sponsoring entity, meaning Caldari ships will get discounts on points and the prize ships will likely be variations on past Caldari hulls used. So there it is, the march to the AT has officially begun.  Updates are being posted to the official EVE Online Discord server for those who want their news in the most timely fashion.
