It boasts an acceleration speed of up to 20000 mm/s² and can print a benchy in 18 minutes. A built-in camera remotely monitors the printing process and records timelapse photos. If you're ready to upgrade, the P1S is compatible with the AMS module for multi-material printing.Best Buy is currently selling the P1S Combo model, which actualy includes the AMS module.
