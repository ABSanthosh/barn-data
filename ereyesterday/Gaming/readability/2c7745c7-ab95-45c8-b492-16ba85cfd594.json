This time around, the best deals are on gaming handhelds and consoles, video games, gaming PCs and laptops, and TVs. One significant advantage that Best Buy has over online-only retailers like Amazon is that you have the option of buying online and picking it up in store. Chances are there's a retail location within driving distance of your home. Not only do you avoid the hassle of shipping, especially during the busy holiday season, but returning your order is also much easier.Deal of the Day: Apple AirPods Pro for $159.99Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) with USBAhead of Black Friday, the price of Apple's best earbuds have just been slashed by over 30%. Right now, Best Buy is offering the for only $159.99. This is the lowest price I've seen all year long and it's unlikely to drop further for Black Friday. This discount makes it even cheaper than the Apple AirPods 4 ANC. Between the two, the AirPods Pro still offers better sound quality and better noise cancellation performance. For most people, I think this is the better choice.Black Friday Video Game DealsBest Buy just unloaded a bunch of games for sale. The best deals are on the Final Fantasy games: Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth for $39.99, FF I-VI Collection for $54.99, and Final Fantasy 16 for $24.99. If you're a sports gamer, pick up the latest NBA 2K25 game for $29.99, which is discounted by over 50% off. Also, both the standard edition of Elden Ring and the Shadow of the Erdtree edition that includes the DLC are on sale.Best Buy isn't the only retailer with games already on sale.

Best Buy dropped the price of all of the most popular Windows gaming handhelds, including the Legion Go, Asus ROG Ally, and our top-ranked gaming handheld, the Asus ROG Ally X. If you're looking for a wireless gaming headset with swappable batteries, the SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless gaming headset is going to be your best bet. Best Buy also has the WD Black C50 1TB Expansion Card for Xbox Series consoles for only $99.99. This is one of the best SSDs for the Xbox.Black Friday Gaming PC DealsBest Buy completely refreshed its selection of early Black Friday gaming PC deals. If you're on a budget, the iBuyPower Scale RTX 4060 gaming PC for $699.99 is a solid deal and a great candidate for 1080p gaming. For something more powerful, consider the CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme gaming PC with an outstanding AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU and RTX 4070 Super GPU.
