These powerful items provide unique stats that can enhance your Vitality, Chakra, Mastery Levels, or regenerative abilities, giving you an edge in battle. Choosing the right Accessories can make all the difference between victory and defeat in this fast-paced ninja world, so make sure to follow our Ninja Time Accessories guide and tier list below. Ninja Time Accessories Tier List Image by Tiermaker As we can see, there are a lot of top-tier Accessories in Ninja Time, but the best ones are always the hardest to get. If you can’t get your hands on something as good as Black Flames Clothing or Hero’s Clothing, a good starting Accessory would be Bones Clothing or Ankokuji Member Clothing, as they are not too hard to get, and they give good stats for the early game. Ninja Time Accessories List Here is a detailed and complete list of all Accessories in Ninja Time, ranked by stats, usefulness, and rarity: After a detailed examination of all Accessories, in and out of combat, we found that Vitality is the most crucial factor when choosing an Accessory. In other words, being able to withstand a hit or two more can make all the difference. Chakra is also good, but as there are Chakra Regeneration abilities in everyone’s kit, they are not as important. Mastery Levels are also important, but those depend on your build, so choose them carefully. How do I Get Accessories in Ninja Time You can get Ninja Time Accessories in many different ways. Defeating Bosses is the simplest and main way to get them, but some Accessories are available through missions, too. Make sure to explore the world around you, and you will find good Accessories everywhere you look. And that is all for our Ninja Time Accessory guide and tier list. Want to learn more?
