  "description": "Adventuring in Dragon Age: The Veilguard naturally leads to many discoveries. More often than not, you'll even find chests just waiting to be looted. There's one, however, that's found in Rivain Coast, and it has a somewhat tricky riddle. Here's our guide on how to solve the Treasure of Sharksmouth Puzzle in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.How to solve the Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain puzzle in Dragon Age: The VeilguardThe Dragon Age: The Veilguard Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain objective takes place in an area of the Rivain Coast known as the Lair of the Dragon King. You'll gain access to this place by progressing Taash's personal quests.Once you're finally there, you might notice a message inscribed on a tower. However, you won't be able to solve it while you're in the middle of doing Taash's quest. Instead, you have to defeat the boss and return to the area so you can freely explore it. The Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain riddleTo solve the Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain puzzle in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, you have to take note of the clues in the riddle. The message can be read via the inscription on the tower's door or the shield inside the fortress.Four knights rode to battle.One fired unto the rightward flank, her arrows a steel rain.One lingered, their shield behind to guard all's back.One went boldly to the fore, her sword thrust forward unto the foe.One crept upon the leftward flank, his hammer a harvest reaped.While we can certain provide the solution immediately, let's first take a look at the mechanics of the puzzle itself. Basically, the passage refers to the knights and the cardinal directions that their statues should be facing. But we don't know the names of these knights yet, so we have to find more clues. Arrow: Ser Rian the RedWhen you track the quest, four markers will appear denoting the locations of four statues with clues. One of these is at the far corner of the fortress. A large blight boil is blocking the small nook, so destroy the pods and tendrils so you can check the clue. You'll learn that the knight that let arrows loose is Ser Rian the Red. Shield: Ser Ifean Beloved of the MoonIn the main area of the fortress, you should see a rift that you can interact with. Use the perk from Lucanis/Spite to create a spectral platform so you can cross the chasm. You'll then learn that Ser Ifean is the knight that used his shield to defend others. Sword: Ser Dheon the SilentOutside the fortress, you'll spot a ruined hut. On the roof of this hut and around it are multiple blight growths. Once destroyed, check the small room that became accessible to find another statue with a clue. It seems that Ser Dheon was the knight who thrust her sword forward when facing foes. Hammer: Ser Cruach the WolfFinally, head to the stone pathway that leads to the lava flows. Use Harding's perk to raise the stone slabs and interact with the note on the statue. The note tells you that the knight with the hammer was Ser Cruach. Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain solutionNow, it's time to solve the Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. In the inner section of the fortress, you'll see four knight statues. Next to them are shield decorations that mention their names. Basically, this means that each knight statue must face the correct cardinal direction: North, east, south, and west.You can see the solution in the image above, but take note that we angled the camera above our character. Also, we advise you to disable the \"rotate minimap\" option so it doesn't get confusing. Here's a quick summary in any case:Rian statue faces east.Ifean statue faces south.Dheon statue faces north.Cruach statue faces west. Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain rewardsIf you do it right, the tower door should open. Inside, you'll find three chests. You can grab duplicates of the Brawler's Decorated Leathers and Weisshaupt's Wall to increase their rarity. There's also a larger ornate chest that contains the Meredith's Legacy unique longsword. It has the following perks:Stats: +325 necrotic damage; +400 stagger.Perks: +10% leech effectiveness; this weapon leeches HP on hit; you no longer gain health from potions or companion abilities.That does it for our guide on how to complete Treasure of Sharksmouth Mountain in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The Meredith's Legacy is just one of many nifty rewards to acquire in the game. You can learn about the others in our unique items guide.The lands of Thedas are under threat from formidable foes, including some menacing elven gods, and it's up to Rook and their allies to save the day.
