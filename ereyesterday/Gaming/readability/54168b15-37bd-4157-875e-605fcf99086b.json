Steam Winter Sale 2024 It is technically not winter yet, that landing on the 21st here in the northern hemisphere.  But that is a Saturday and these things need to launch on a Tuesday or a Thursday, so here we are.  Also, they have to leave a few shopping days between the start of the sale and a chance to buy something for somebody for your chosen winter solstice anchored holiday event. This is the part where I generally go on about how Steam Sales have become so common that they have lost their allure or set a pricing expectation such that I am unlikely to rush to buy anything simply because it is one sale.  And that can be true… but sometimes it isn’t.  Last year I used the Winter Sale as an opportunity to buy a bunch of co-op survival titles. So it could happen.  I’ll have to go down my wishlist and see what is marked down. What sales really become is a test of whether I really want this title or that from my wishlist.  If I don’t buy it when it is marked down 10%… well, maybe I am not there yet.  If I don’t buy it if the discount goes to 50% or beyond… it might be better to conclude that I don’t really want it. We shall see.  That is a post for the end of the sale.  Also, I can’t even get to my wishlist right now as the site is completely jammed up.  Welcome to the start of the Winter Sale, when people want to find that one mistake that marked some game 99% off or some such. But the Winter Sale also brings with it other things, the first being the annual Steam Awards.  Steam users can vote on all categories between now and December 31st at 10:00 Pacific Time (18:00 UTC), after which the votes will be tallied and the winners will be posted. The Steam Awards 2024 This year I actually have some titles I played in the running.  Balatro, which won the Video Games Award for best indie title, is there on the Game of the Year selection. Steam Awards 2024 – GotY Options I suspect it doesn’t have a chance.  Helldivers II certainly got more attention and Black Myth Wukong is going to get vote brigaded by Chinese users who have already begun review bombing competing titles to substantiate their potential win.  So that seems foretold.  And maybe it should win for all I know.  But that is the world we live in. There is actually only one category where the game I nominated made the cut AND was a game I played.  I “guessed right” in a couple of categories, but this is the only one that I can really stand behind, which is the Labor of Love selection. Steam Awards 2024 – Labor of Love options I am down with No Man’s Sky because I can’t think of another title that has received so many updates and has changed so much.  I don’t feel like Elden Ring or Baldur’s Gate 3 have even been out long enough to qualify, and I have no sense of what DOTA 2 gets for updates beyond hero tuning for various seasons.  So I feel like the real race is between Stardew Valley and No Man’s Sky as two titles that have gotten a lot of updates over the years.  But I also feel like Elden Ring or Baldur’s Gate 3 will win, because popularity not logic will rule. The other categories… I will vote, but those are the two I can even bother to muster thoughts in advance around.  You earn a special chat sticker for each category in which you cast a vote.  I would have voted anyway, but will collect all the things, even if I chat so rarely in Steam that I cannot recall if I have ever used a chat sticker.  It feels like Steam could give Discord a run for their money if they put their mind to it, rather than just sticking with the 90s IM-centric model they have now. Then there is the annual Steam Replay, where you can get an accounting of your own time on Steam in 2024. Steam Replay 2024 I am going to follow custom and save that for its own post, in part because I actually played more games than usual on Steam in 2024 and because it is, in a way, a post that writes itself at the core and I only need to fill in the commentary, which during the holidays is all I can managed at times. So there we have it, Steam is off to the races with the Winter Sale and its other end of the year routines.  Now to see what will tempt me and what won’t be cheap enough for me to bother.

think of another title that has received so many updates and has changed so much.  I don’t feel like \u003cem\u003eElden Ring\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eBaldur’s Gate 3\u003c/em\u003e have even been out long enough to qualify, and I have no sense of what \u003cem\u003eDOTA 2\u003c/em\u003e gets for updates beyond hero tuning for various seasons.  So I feel like the real race is between \u003cem\u003eStardew Valley\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eNo Man’s Sky\u003c/em\u003e as two titles that have gotten a lot of updates over the years.  But I also feel like \u003cem\u003eElden Ring\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eBaldur’s Gate 3\u003c/em\u003e will win, because popularity not logic will rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other categories… I will vote, but those are the two I can even bother to muster thoughts in advance around.  You earn a special chat sticker for each category in which you cast a vote.  I would have voted anyway, but will collect all the things, even if I chat so rarely in Steam that I cannot recall if I have ever used a chat sticker.  It feels like Steam could give Discord a run for their money if they put their mind to it, rather than just sticking with the 90s IM-centric model they have now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there is the annual \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/replay/\"\u003eSteam Replay\u003c/a\u003e, where you can get an accounting of your own time on Steam in 2024.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_125915\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

games than usual on Steam in 2024 and because it is, in a way, a post that writes itself at the core and I only need to fill in the commentary, which during the holidays is all I can managed at times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo there we have it, Steam is off to the races with the Winter Sale and its other end of the year routines.  Now to see what will tempt me and what won’t be cheap
