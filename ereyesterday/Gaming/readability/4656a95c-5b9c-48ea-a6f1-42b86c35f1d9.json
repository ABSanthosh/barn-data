  "text": "The Switch has grown up.By , Jake Dekker , Jean-Luc Seipke , Steve Watts , and Max Blumenthal on June 13, 2025 at 4:56PM PDT Over the last several consoles, Nintendo has been the scrappy underdog. Its experimental approach was an apparent way to compensate for the fact that it was getting outpaced in hardware by the likes of PlayStation and Xbox. The Wii Remote controller, the 3DS's glasses-free 3D feature, and even the original Switch's hybrid console-handheld approach were all borne out of an attempt to take on the juggernauts without matching their power. But now, the Switch is one of Nintendo's most successful pieces of hardware of all time. For the first time in a long time, the rest of the industry is following Nintendo's lead.",
