  "text": "to a T is a silly game about a teenager who is stuck in a T pose and needs to go about their day-to-day life with their companion dog. Nobody really knows why this person is stuck in a T pose and there isn’t any story about trying to change it or solve the issue. Instead, you are just taking on the adventure of going to school and being this teenager. Moving the character through doors or interacting with things like the sink are really fun. There is a pulling that sort of happens from the button presses, making you pull towards what you want to do. It feels kinetic and interesting. All of the interactions feel like little mini-games, and in to a T, it’s neat seeing the different changes that the household has to make to accommodate a child stuck in this pose. Your adorable dog, who you get to name at the start of the game, is also a big help, though they do seem like they have super powers. The town that you are living in is also quite wacky and wild. At one point, a giant singing giraffe was telling me about my life and what I was doing. This song break felt very quirky and fun – giving a small break and a bit of background story to what you were doing in a very engaging way. When I played to a T at Day of the Devs, the first thing I thought was that it had the same joyous charm as Katamari Damacy. Turns out it’s made by the same creator! to a T is a very well-crafted game full of fun and unique concepts without being extremely text-heavy. I really enjoyed my time with the demo – it was my best of the show! to a T is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
