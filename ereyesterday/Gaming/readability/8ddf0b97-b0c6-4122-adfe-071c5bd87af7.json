Alienware desktops and laptops feature solid build quality, top-of-the-line gaming performance, excellent cooling (further improved on the newer models), aggressive styling, and pricing that is very competitive with other pre-built options. Best of all, there are plenty of sales that happen throughout the year, so it's not difficult to grab one of these computers at considerably less than their retail price.

See below for our favorite picks.Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 5080 Gaming PC for $2,400Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 7 265F RTX 5080 Gaming PCStarting today, Dell is offering an Alienware Aurora R16 gaming PC equipped with the new GeForce RTX 5080 GPU for just $2,399.99 shipped. This is one of the best prices you can get right now for an RTX 5080 equipped prebuilt, especially since most other brands seem to be jacking up prices steadily since the RTX 50 series launch in January. The only other prebuilt you can get at Dell with an RTX 5080 GPU costs over $4,000. Good luck trying to find a standalone GPU to build out your own DIY PC; you'll probably spend as much for the GPU as you would this entire system.Alienware Area-51 RTX 5080 Up for PreorderNew Price DropAlienware Area-51 Intel Core Ultra 9 285K RTX 5080 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)Dell has just dropped the price on a Alienware Area-51 system for the first time ever. This particular config has been upgraded with an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K processor, 32GB of RAM, and a 2TB M.2 SSD for $3,849.99 after a $600 off instant discount. The CPU is cooled by a 360mm all-in-one liquid cooler and the entire system is powered by a massive 1,500W 80PLUS Platinum power supply. Dell estimates this system to arrive at door in early April.New for 2025: The Alienware Area-51 ChassisDell unveiled the new Alienware Area-51 gaming PC at CES 2025. The chassis looks similar to the 2024 R16 system with some minor aesthetic and cooling redesigns and updated components. The I/O panel is positioned at the top of the case instead of the front, and the tempered glass window now spans the entire side panel instead of just a smaller cutout. As a result, the side panel vents are gone, and instead air intakes are located at the bottom as well as the front of the case. Alienware is now pushing a positive airflow design (more intake than exhaust airflow), which usually means a less dusty interior. The internal components have also all been refreshed, with a new motherboard, faster RAM, and more powerful power supply to accommodate the new generation of CPUs and the RTX 50 series GPUs.Alienware m16 Gaming LaptopsAlienware m16 R2 16\" Intel Core Ultra 9 185H RTX 4060 Gaming LaptopAlienware m16 R2 16\" Intel Core Ultra 9 185H RTX 4070 Gaming LaptopDell is offering an Alienware m16 R2 RTX 4060 gaming laptop for $1,599.99 shipped after a $300 instant discount. The m16 R2 is Alienware's most popular gaming laptop, which isn't surprising considering its excellent build quality, top-of-the-line gaming prowess, and reasonable price point. The \"R2\" is the second generation model that was released in 2024; it's 14% lighter and more compact than its predecessor without compromising on performance.Alienware x16 R2 Gaming LaptopsAlienware x16 R2 16\" Intel Core Ultra 9 185H RTX 4070 Gaming LaptopThe Alienware x16 gaming laptop is a slimmer and lighter redesign of the traditional m-series laptop. It's the thinnest 16\" Alienware laptop ever and compares in build quality and performance to other high-end ultra-thin laptops like the Razer Blade. This Alienware x16 R2 laptop is built with premium materials, like a magnesium alloy chassis and palm rest, anodized aluminum lid, stainless steel keyboard tray, and Micro LED RGB accent lighting. It's only 0.73\" thin and weighs in at 6 pounds. That's impressive considering the fact that this laptop can be equipped with the most power NVIDIA GPU.Alienware m18 R2 RTX 4090 Gaming LaptopAlienware m18 R2 18\" Intel Core i9-14900HX RTX 4090 Gaming LaptopAlienware m18 R2 18\" Intel Core i7-14700HX RTX 4070 Gaming LaptopThe Alienware m18 is the biggest Alienware laptop you can buy with an imposing 18\" 2560x1600 display and top-of-the-line components. There are three models that are on sale today. The highest end model includes an Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU RTX 4090 GPU, 64GB of RAM, and a 4TB SSD for $3,399.99. The RTX 4090 is still the most powerful mobile GPU on the market, and by a very substantial margin. It's roughly equivalent to a desktop RTX 3090 GPU.Dell G-Series Gaming LaptopsDell G16 16\" QHD+ Intel Core i9-13900HX RTX 4060 Gaming LaptopDell has dropped the prices on the G16 16\" gaming laptops. Dells G-series laptops are great options for budget gamers. They offer excellent gaming performance equal to a comparably equipped Alienware laptop but at a much lower price point. They also have better build quality than Dell's Inspiron lineup, with nicer materials that include anodized aluminum, and an aggressive cooling design borrowed from Alienware laptops.Not all laptop GPUs are the same, even if they share the same name.There are two important tidbits that deserve mention concerning graphics cards found in laptops. First, mobile GPU variants are not as powerful as their desktop counterparts. For example, a mobile RTX 4060 doesn't perform as well as a desktop RTX 4060. The mobile versions are generally about one to two tiers lower in performance. Using the same example, the mobile RTX 4060 performs more similarly to a desktop RTX 4050.Second, not all laptops feature the same performance out of the same GPU. For example, the RTX 4060 found in the Alienware m16 will be more powerful than the RTX 4060 found in the Alienware x14. In order to roughly tell how good a GPU will be, you can look at the TGP rating. That's basically the amount of power supplied to the GPU. A higher TGP rating means more power will be delivered, equating to stronger performance, however the wattage consumption and heat generated will be higher. Here are the maximum TGP rates for the RTX 40 series graphics cards:Mobile RTX 4050: 115WMobile RTX 4060: 115WMobile RTX 4070: 115WMobile RTX 4080: 150WMobile RTX 4090: 150WDell just dropped the price of one of its best gaming monitors to the lowest price ever, better than even Black Friday or Cyber Monday. Right now you can pick up an Alienware AW3423DWF 34\" QD-OLED gaming monitor for only $552.49 after 15% off coupon code \"MONITORS15\". This is one of Alienware's highest end monitors, with a gorgeous QD OLED panel, WQHD resolution, and a respectable 165Hz refresh rate.Why Pick a Dell or Alienware Gaming PC?If you're in the market for a prebuilt gaming PC, Dell is one of best gaming brands we'd recommend. The Alienware gaming desktops offer a staggering array of options, all built into a custom chassis. Alienware gaming laptops in recent years have been redesigned to be thinner and lighter while still offering the same immense power under the hood. Consistent build quality, available inventory, frequent sales, and solid customer service are the main reasons why Dell is at the top of our buying list for gaming laptops and PCs.Some other resources you might be interested in:Best gaming laptop deals of 2024Best gaming PC deals of 2024Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

That\u0026#39;s impressive considering the fact that this laptop can be equipped with the most power NVIDIA GPU.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp id=\"m18-gaming-laptop\"\u003e\u003ch2 data-cy=\"title2\" data-toc-title=\"m18 Gaming Laptop\"\u003eAlienware m18 R2 RTX 4090 Gaming Laptop\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"209504\" data-cy=\"productcard-view-trigger\" catalogid=\"4f64bd10-97db-4185-a084-2c2cf81b5e76\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://zdcs.link/z3R2AV?object_uuid=98b36d52-5ba6-443e-bed8-b7a93baf201d\u0026amp;t=article\" title=\"Alienware m18 R2 18\u0026#34; Intel Core i9-14900HX RTX 4090 Gaming Laptop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Alienware m18 R2 18\u0026#34; Intel Core i9-14900HX RTX 4090 Gaming Laptop\" src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/21/alienwarem18r2-1729530280510.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=20\u0026amp;dpr=0.05\" data-cy=\"progressive-image\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"solo-product-name\"\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAlienware m18 R2 18\u0026#34; Intel Core i9-14900HX RTX 4090 Gaming Laptop\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv catalogid=\"4f64bd10-97db-4185-a084-2c2cf81b5e76\" id=\"209503\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"209503\" data-cy=\"productcard-view-trigger\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://zdcs.link/QxX6Wj?object_uuid=98b36d52-5ba6-443e-bed8-b7a93baf201d\u0026amp;t=article\" title=\"Alienware m18 R2 18\u0026#34; Intel Core i7-14700HX RTX 4070 Gaming Laptop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Alienware m18 R2 18\u0026#34; Intel Core i7-14700HX RTX 4070 Gaming Laptop\" src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/21/alienwarem18r2-1729530280510.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=20\u0026amp;dpr=0.05\" data-cy=\"progressive-image\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"solo-product-name\"\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAlienware m18 R2 18\u0026#34; Intel Core i7-14700HX RTX 4070 Gaming Laptop\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThe Alienware m18 is the biggest Alienware laptop you can buy with an imposing 18\u0026#34; 2560x1600 display and top-of-the-line components.

Dells G-series laptops are great options for budget gamers. They offer excellent gaming performance equal to a comparably equipped Alienware laptop but at a much lower price point. They also have better build quality than Dell\u0026#39;s Inspiron lineup, with nicer materials that include anodized aluminum, and an aggressive cooling design borrowed from Alienware laptops.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 data-cy=\"title3\"\u003eNot all laptop GPUs are the same, even if they share the same name.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThere are two important tidbits that deserve mention concerning graphics cards found in laptops. First, mobile GPU variants are not as powerful as their desktop counterparts. For example, a mobile RTX 4060 doesn\u0026#39;t perform as well as a desktop RTX 4060. The mobile versions are generally about one to two tiers lower in performance. Using the same example, the mobile RTX 4060 performs more similarly to a desktop RTX 4050.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eSecond, not all laptops feature the same performance out of the same GPU. For example, the RTX 4060 found in the Alienware m16 will be more powerful than the RTX 4060 found in the Alienware x14. In order to roughly tell how good a GPU will be, you can look at the TGP rating. That\u0026#39;s basically the amount of power supplied to the GPU. A higher TGP rating means more power will be delivered, equating to stronger performance, however the wattage consumption and heat generated will be higher. Here are the maximum TGP rates for the RTX 40 series graphics cards:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul data-cy=\"list\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eMobile RTX 4050: 115W\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMobile RTX 4060: 115W\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMobile RTX 4070: 115W\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMobile RTX 4080: 150W\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMobile RTX 4090: 150W\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eDell just dropped the price of one of its best gaming monitors to the lowest price ever, better than even Black Friday or Cyber Monday.
