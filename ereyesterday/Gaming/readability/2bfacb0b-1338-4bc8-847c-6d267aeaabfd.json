  "text": "Marvel's first family is growing!At CinemaCon in Las Vegas today, the Marvel Studios portion of Disney’s presentation featured the debut of brand new footage from The Fantastic Four: First Steps, including the first look anywhere of the Silver Surfer and a notable reveal about Sue Storm.The start of the footage shows a talk show, The Ted Gilbert Show, clearly modeled after a 1960s Ed Sullivan Show style series, with Mark Gatiss (Sherlock, Game of Thrones) as the host. Ted Gilbert recaps the story of the Fantastic Four – with more glimpses of the footage we’ve seen previously of the space trip that transformed them – as we get footage showing their widespread popularity amongst the public, with cheering crowds, children included. We see Ben (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), Johnny (Joseph Quinn) and Sue (Vanessa Kirby) in action, using their powers - though, amusingly, we still weren’t given any shots of Reed’s stretching power in action. Gilbert then introduces the foursome onstage, and they stand together, in costume, in the shot we saw ending the first trailer.Glimpses of the FF’s home life find more of the robot H.E.R.B.I.E. and Ben cooking together and Johnny chastising Reed (Pedro Pascal) and Sue for being late for dinner, leading to the big reveal about Sue, as Johnny is told his sister is pregnant. He then tells Sue she’ll be a great mom while teasing Reed he’ll be a terrible father.We then got our first shots of Shalla-Bal, the Silver Surfer (Julia Garner), in all her gleaming, metallic glory, announcing “Your planet is now marked for death.” We then see more shots of Galactus’ shadow over New York, like in the teaser (though not a full reveal of the character yet).The Fantastic Four: First Steps - Trailer 1 StillsReed is seen readying for a mission, walking away from camera in a 4-logo labeled space suit as someone asks him “Are we safe?” He turns back towards them and grimly responds, “I don’t know.”Shots of crowds running in panic across the city include a little girl stopping to retrieve an action figure of The Thing she’s dropped, but when she goes to pick it up, the giant shadow of Galactus falls over her.The final shot of the footage then shows the Silver Surfer flying towards the camera on her surfboard. The Fantastic Four: First Steps will be released on July 25, 2025!In This ArticleNot yet available for streaming.",
