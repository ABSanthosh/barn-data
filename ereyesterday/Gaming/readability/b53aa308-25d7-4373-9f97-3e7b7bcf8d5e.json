  "text": "Tony Hawk 3 + 4! Tomb Raider! More! Image credit: Eurogamer/Xbox July and the sizzle of summer are finally upon us. And as ever, a new calendar month means a fresh batch of Xbox Game Pass titles, which this time include the likes of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Little Nightmares 2. Microsoft has so far announced a grand total of nine titles joining the various tiers of its subscription service this month, with the first of those arriving today, 1st July. You can see everything coming - plus when, on what platform, and to what Game Pass tier - below: Little Nightmares 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC) - available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 1st July Rise of the Tomb Raider (Cloud, Console, and PC) - available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 1st July Legend of Mana (Console) – available with Game Pass Standard from 2nd July Trials of Mana (Console) – available with Game Pass Standard from 2nd July Ultimate Chicken Horse (Cloud, Console, and PC) – available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 3rd July The Ascent (Cloud, Console, and PC) – available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 8th July Minami Lane (Cloud, Console, and PC) – available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass from 9th July Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 (Cloud, Console, and PC) – available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass from 11th July High On Life (Cloud, Console, and PC) – available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 15th July It's a decent line-up, then, although Activision's long-awaited Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake will undoubtedly be the headline act for many people. But adorably sinister horror sequel Little Nightmares 2 is well worth your time if you're in the mood for some macabre chills, and that double-whammy of Square Enix's Mana series should keep fantasy RPG fans occupied. Beyond that, there's a spot of tomb raiding, some wholesome street-management action in Miami Lane, visually striking cyberpunk action in The Ascent, and more. As for departures, six games are leaving Xbox Game Pass on 15th July, so if you've been meaning to check out any of the following, you've only got a couple of weeks to do so: Flock (Cloud, Console, and PC) Mafia Definitive Edition (Cloud, Console, and PC) Magical Delicacy (Cloud, Console, and PC) Tchia (Cloud, Console, and PC) The Callisto Protocol (Cloud, Console, and PC) The Case of the Golden Idol (Cloud, Console, and PC) To keep playing the above titles after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to buy them - but subscribers do at least get a 20 percent discount. And for everything else in Microsoft's subscription service, check out Eurogamer's handy Xbox Game Pass guide.",
