But not every game was available on Game Pass, which put limits on which titles could be accessed.

But the company has to be sure that those expanded capabilities will hold up under pressure before rolling them out to Game Pass subscribers.Earlier this week, Xbox confirmed that as of November, players will be able buy or play Xbox games on Android via the Xbox app. And once the new streaming option becomes available, purchases on Android will immediately be available to stream no matter which devices players are using. As part of Epic Games' lawsuit win over Google, Microsoft will be able to sidestep Google Play and avoid giving the company a cut of its sales.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
