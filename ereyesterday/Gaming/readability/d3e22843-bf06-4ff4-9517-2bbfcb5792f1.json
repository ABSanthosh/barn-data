One of the highlights we found is a 41% markdown on the Toshiba 50\" Class C350 Series LED 4K UHD Smart Fire TV. Normally sold at a retail value of $319.99, those who purchase today can get the set for $189.99, saving a total of $130. Of the five screen sizes sold on the site, this is by far the best deal offered, though you can grab a 43\", a 55\", or a 65\" for heavily discounted prices right now as well.Get the Toshiba 50\" 4K TV for Only $189.99TOSHIBA 50-inch Class C350 Series LED 4K UHD Smart Fire TV with Alexa Voice RemoteThese TVs were released in 2023, so they're stocked full of all the modern bells and whistles you could hope for.

You'll also be glad to know we selected the previous 2021 model (now out of stock) of the Toshiba 50\" 4K TV as one of the top 50\" TVs out there, so we definitely can recommend this newer and improved version for 2024.Like any Fire TV, this smart device has all the streaming services and channels ready to go from your home screen.
