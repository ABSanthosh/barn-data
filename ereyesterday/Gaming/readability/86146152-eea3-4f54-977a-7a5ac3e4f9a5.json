Oh, and it gave us our first look at Clayface and Circe in the series! The footage begins with Amanda Waller talking to Rick Flagg Sr., saying he finds himself in the middle of an \"international incident.\" We are then introduced to some of the big players in the animated series - who are not human prisoners since the US congress said they could not use them - and they include The Bride, Doctor Phosphorus, The Weasel, Nina Mazursky, and G.I. Robot.As previously mentioned, we also get a look at some of the big bads our team will be facing off against like Clayface and Circe. — Max (@StreamOnMax) October 19, 2024 Creature Commandos obviously has a very Suicide Squad vibe, as a ragtag team of super individuals are being forced to work as a team for one goal. It also is very brutal, with some of the footage showing exploding heads, impaling, and more. James Gunn's Creature Commandos will arrive on Max on December 5, 2024, and it has a star-studded cast that includes Steve Agee, Maria Baklava, Anya Chalotra, Zoe Chao, Frank Grillo, Sean Gunn, David Harbour, Alan Tudyk, Indira Varma, and Viola Davis. Gunn also teased there will be some big guest stars, including Michael Rooker, Peter Serafinowicz, Linda Cardellini, and more.Creature Commandos will kick off the DCU's Chapter One: Gods and Monsters, which also includes Superman: Legacy and Peacemaker: Season 2. The show's first season will run for seven episodes, and a new one will drop each week.Gunn and members of the Creatures Commandos team were also at NYCC to share more about Creature Commandos, and we learned more about what we can expect.David Harbour, who plays Frankenstein, discussed the Frankenstein and the Bride story, saying he loves how Frankenstein's monster was being created to be a companion and, despite it being a familiar theme and story, he thinks people will be really surprised by the take in the show.\"You have this Frankenstein and the Bride story. I love the story of Frankenstein's monster being created to be a companion. It's a familiar theme, but it's a very original take. I think people will be really surprised by it.\" - David Harbour on Creature Commandos #NYCC pic.twitter.com/6j1jXXJ6x8— IGN (@IGN) October 19, 2024 Grillo, who plays Rick Flagg Sr., says he \"fell in love\" with this show and his character \"immediately.\" \"It's a character that's in my wheelhouse,\" Grillo continued. \"This troubled man who has to take care of all these maniacs.\" Flagg Sr. will have romances of kinds with both David Harbour's and Maria Bakalova's characters in Creature Commandos, and Gunn teased that there is a video of Grillo and Bakalova attempting to voice a sex scene in the recording booth. Apparently, the actors made out with their own hands and Gunn will release the behind-the-scenes footage with episode 2.\"I fell in love with it immediately. It's a character that's in my wheelhouse.
