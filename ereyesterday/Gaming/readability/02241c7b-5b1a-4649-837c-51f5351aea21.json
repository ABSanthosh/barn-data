  "text": "As we eagerly await the arrival of Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1 \u0026 2 Remastered, we are thrilled to unveil a treasure trove of details focusing on the Bonus Materials menu we’ve hinted at previously. In addition to the new materials that have been added, we’ve also restored and recreated (where possible) the Soul Reaver 2 Bonus Materials to HD and made them all accessible from the menu! This release is not just a remaster, it’s also a reminder of the collaboration between Crystal Dynamics, Aspyr, and the Legacy of Kain community. The Bonus Content honors the legacy of this iconic franchise and resurrects the haunting beauty that players have come to expect from the world of Nosgoth. Lore Reader: Maps and mysteries unveiled Dive into the “Lore of Nosgoth,” where brand-new maps are adorned with poetic descriptions of places and events. Created in collaboration with the Legacy of Kain Fandom leaders, key community members, and Crystal Dynamics artists, these maps offer an integrated perspective on the familiar, but previously disconnected, landscapes of Nosgoth. Toggle between the pure and corrupted versions of the map to see the transformation of the land over time and uncover secrets scattered throughout the map.  Artwork and renders: A visual delight The “Galleries” section is a visual feast, featuring a collection of both classic and newly crafted HD renders.  Relive the epic narrative through FMV cinematics from Soul Reaver 1 \u0026 2, now presented with even more detail.  This section also preserves the original credits, demo videos, and outtakes, celebrating the artistic achievements and behind-the-scenes efforts that brought Nosgoth to life. We’ve shared some unique pieces of concept art from the Crystal Dynamic’s archives that are sure to excite the imagination. Dark Chronicle: Relive the epic saga For those who cherish the narrative of the Legacy of Kain series, the “Dark Chronicle” section offers a concise, text-based version of both games’ scripts in their entirety. This feature is perfect for fans who want to relive their favorite moments or share iconic lines with friends. The Soul Reaver Lost Levels: A journey through what might have been Discover the “Soul Reaver Lost Levels” section, a unique addition to our Bonus Materials that showcases several areas that didn’t make the original game. Through the preservation efforts of Crystal Dynamics, Aspyr, and key community members like Ben Lincoln (who also created the fantastic fan-driven website https://thelostworlds.net/), you can explore four distinct areas: Undercity, Smokestack, Retreat, and Forges.  Each provides a glimpse into alternative visions of the original Soul Reaver.  You can explore the Lost Levels as Raziel, although you may find missing textures or areas that feel under construction.  Think of the Lost Levels as an interactive museum, an accessible copy of historic artifacts, preserved in their original state. Undercity: The human citadel features an extensive subterranean area that would have become accessible after Raziel’s second battle with Kain. The Undercity was the home of a vampire-worshipping human priestess and her followers. Defeating her would have granted Raziel the ability to possess the minds of most humans and vampires. Smokestack: After exiting the Undercity, Raziel could have traveled to the massive fortress of his final remaining brother, Turel. In Turel’s lair, Raziel would have earned an enhanced telekinetic ability that would allow him to traverse the giant Smokestack and use the giant turbine in the middle of the room to create an updraft, allowing him to fly to the top to reach Kain’s mountain retreat, high above Nosgoth’s landscape.  Retreat: Kain’s personal lair, perched on the mountaintops between Turel’s fortress and the Silenced Cathedral. With the Reaver’s power amplified by Kain’s soul, Raziel would then discover a bridge connected directly to the top of the Silenced Cathedral and use its titanic pipe organ to destroy every remaining vampire in Nosgoth. Forges: Soul Reaver was originally designed with six elemental enhancements for the Reaver. In addition to fire, Raziel would have discovered forges allowing him to imbue the weapon with sunlight, water, stone, sound, and spirit energy, using environmental sources scattered throughout the game world. Soul Reaver 1 \u0026 2 Soundtracks: An auditory legacy Lastly, immerse yourself in the haunting melodies of Nosgoth with the extended playlists of the soundtracks from both Soul Reaver 1 \u0026 2. Enjoy beloved tracks and discover new compositions, including the eerie “Priestess Encounter” and the mystical “Spirit Forge.” Join us on December 10 to explore the bonus materials and more in Legacy of Kain  Soul Reaver 1 \u0026 2 Remastered!  Pre-order now to ensure you’re one of the first to uncover the hidden depths of Nosgoth and experience the games like never before!
