This is easily done by selecting the GTA Online in the main menu and then following the prompts to migrate your character(s). This process is permanent, but there's no real reason you don't want to migrate your progress in either Online or Story Mode.New players picking up GTA Online for the first time can simply download the Enhanced Edition and create a new character. However, if you're a new player, you'll have to go through a long slog of required tasks and missions before you're able to partake in the Oscar Guzman missions.When you're in Los Santos, you can either go to MazeBank Foreclosures on your phone or wait for a call from Oscar Guzman. It's preferable to wait for Oscar to call you so he can properly explain what he wants you to do, but if you visit MazeBank Foreclosures, click on the red \"McKenzie Field Hangar\" box.Choosing to buy the McKenzie Field HangarFrom here, go to the northern side of Los Santos, find the property's blue icon, and elect to purchase the property for $1.475 million. If you wait for Oscar to call, he'll tell you to do the same thing, so you're buying the property regardless.After McKenzie Field Hangar is purchased, you'll receive another call from Oscar who asks you to go visit the property. This is quite a drive from downtown Los Santos, but you can simply reload your server to instantly go to the location.Once you arrive at the hangar, hop out inside and Oscar will greet you. He'll explain that he's happy you bought the property and goes over his plans for what you're going to do. After a brief conversation, you're led inside to the office where you can register as a CEO on the laptop on the desk. With that done, you can accept the first job in the Oscar Guzman Flies Again missions, which is called \"Up and Running.\"Speaking with Oscar Guzman at the hangarYou've now officially begun your first of six missions for Oscar Guzman in GTA Online. Up and Running doesn't take too long, but it can be difficult as a solo player, so if you have some friends or want to open up your party, that's recommended. However, all of the missions for Oscar Guzman can be completed solo. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com",
