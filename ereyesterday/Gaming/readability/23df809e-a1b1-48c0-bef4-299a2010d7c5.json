  "text": "Shoggoth to a great start. Image credit: Frogwares Frogwares' Kickstarter campaign for The Sinking City 2 is now live, and has smashed through its crowdfunding target in less than a day - raising over £140K at the time or writing. As part of its crowdfunding drive, Frogwares has shared new The Sinking City 2 details - confirming the Lovecratian sequel to be a standalone story featuring new characters and locations. It's once again set in 1920s America, but instead of revisting Oakmont, players'll this time be exploring the flooded streets and crumbling buildings of Arkham itself. As previously revealed, The Sinking City 2 - which is Frogwares' first Unreal Engine 5 game - marks a shift away from the deduction focus of its predecessor. It's a sequel firmly in survival horror territory, with combat and exploration said to be the core mechanics this time around - which is perhaps a gamble given combat has historically been Frogawares' achilles heel. The Sinking City 2 - Gameplay Reveal \u0026 Kickstarter Now Live! The Sinking City 2 gameplay reveal trailer.Watch on YouTube Investigation work does return, but now it's described as an \"optional yet highly useful tool\", that'll help players uncover secrets, gameplay bonuses, and lore. The Sinking City 2 is also set to feature a smaller map - explorable both on foot and by boat - that's aiming to provide a \"better flow and concentration of things to discover\". You'll find a few more details on The Sinking City 2's Kickstarter page, and there's a look at some pre-alpha gameplay in the trailer above. Frogwares is aiming to release The Sinking City 2 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S later this year. And if you want to get involved with its crowdfunding campaign - which it says will help \"essentially guarantee our team the time and resources needed to explore\" new features - there's still 29 days left before things come to a close. The Ukraine-based Frogwares successfully took a similar crowdfunding approach with 2023's Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, as it continued to adjust to life during Russia's ongoing invasion. \"This financial safety net proved invaluable to us,\" the studio writes in its latest Kickstarter campaign, \"so we need to do the same now with The Sinking City 2 as this game is vastly bigger and more complex.\"",
