As promised earlier this year, Resident Evil Re:Verse is no more. Capcom have burned down the game’s storefront listing, taken a shovel to its DLC pages, and now put a pitchfork through the servers. Run tell the peasantfolk that the beast is finally dead. When they confirmed the suspension of support, Capcom said that they released Re:Verse back in 2022 to celebrate the original game's 25th anniversary. The game peaked at 2080 concurrent players on Steam, which is not exactly Counter-Strike numbers, but Capcom feel nonetheless that \"Resident Evil Re:Verse has served its original, celebratory purpose admirably\". Ah, this reminds me of me telling my mother that I had an intimidating persona when nobody showed up for my 16th birthday party. RE:Verse was a six player third-person shooter featuring a cross-section of nods to older Resident Evils, including the ability to chug a potion and transform into a celebrity baddy such as Resident Evil 7’s chainshear-wielding scruffer Jack Baker. It was the latest in Capcom’s quixotic efforts to make a multiplayer Resi, a quest that has given us such wibbly fare as Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City, which Richard Cobbett summarised as “not so much bad as grindingly unenthusiastic”. I’m not aware of an all-timer multiplayer Resident Evil game but they were getting there with the co-op features for games like Resident Evil 5, and Resident Evil Outbreak – a multiplayer survival game set in Raccoon City – should have been a doozie. In Capcom’s defence, they released that back in primordial 2003, when online was a novelty, and online Japanese games especially had you communicating with the servers by means of a specially trained seagull. I’ve still got my seagull from the dial-up days. He’s running a major publisher now. I won’t tell you which one, but let’s just say that the guano rolls downhill at Ubisoft Inc. While Re:Verse is most assuredly dead - the fate of 70% of games that have online requirements, according to one study - Capcom continue to chase the tipsy T-viral daydream of Resident Evil multiplayer. According to the most recent round of Resident Evil Requiem developer interviews, they toyed with another online-focussed Resident Evil before moving ahead with Requiem’s premise of being stuck in a hotel with a stampeding hag.",
