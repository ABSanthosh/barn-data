  "text": "As part of free update for existing players. Image credit: Eurogamer/Rockstar Games Three years after the launch of Grand Theft Auto 5's Expanded \u0026 Enhanced edition on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, the game's next-gen features have - just as Rockstar promised last month - finally made the jump to PC in a free update for all existing users. From today, Grand Theft Auto 5 Legacy (as the original PC version is now being referred to) has been delisted from PC store fronts to make way for GTA 5 Enhanced. And as per Rockstar's announcement, this new edition introduces a range of features, including new vehicles, new ambient wildlife, and support for Rockstar's GTA+ subscription service. It also adds new graphics options, including the ray traced shadows and reflections first introduced on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, alongside other additions - such as ambient occlusion and global illumination - exclusive to PC. That's in addition to support for higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher framerates, as well as AMD FSR and Nvidia DLSS support - with Frame Generation support coming at a later date. Grand Theft Auto 5 'Next-Gen' Upgrades Analysis: PS5 vs PS4 vs Maxed-Out PC! Digital Foundry took at look at GTA 5's next-gen updates in 2022.Watch on YouTube Elsewhere, DualSense controller owners can now use its adaptive triggers during gameplay, and Rockstar is also touting faster loading times via SSD and DirectStorage, as well as enhanced audio - including Dolby Atmos, and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music. And for Grand Theft Auto Online players, the updated PC version gets kernel-based anti-cheat protections and proactive voice chat moderation, as well as the lies of new vehicles, Chameleon Paints, and high-performance mods from Hao's Special Works. All this comes with a higher set of minimum and recommended PC specifications, but anyone unable to meet those increased demands can still access Grand Theft Auto 5 Legacy via the game's launcher. Be aware, though, the two versions are considered entirely separate, meaning friends will all need to be using the same version if they want to play together. Additionally, it's necessary to migrate Story Mode and Online progress to the new edition. To coincide with the launch of GTA 5 Enchanced, Rockstar is discounting the game by 50 percent on Steam and the Epic store, bringing the price down to £14.99 until 20th March. All this PC activity comes as Rockstar prepares to release GTA 6 this autumn - although publisher Take-Two has hinted the PC version won't arrive until later. That tallies with recent claims by accessories company Corsair Gaming, which suggested the PC release isn't due until \"early 2026\".",
