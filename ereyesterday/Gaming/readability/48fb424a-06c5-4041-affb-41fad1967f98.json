  "text": "Image credit: Henry Driver We can probably all agree that planting trees is pretty much universally good, right? I can't really imagine a scenario where planting a tree is a bad thing, we need them to live after all. If you're not into planting trees you're probably an oil tycoon, or a squirrel with incredibly bad survival instincts. If you are, though, might I interest you in Treeplanter, a game whose name is exactly what it says on the tin? It was announced just yesterday, and looks quite, quite lovely. Treeplanter doesn't exactly appear to be a traditional game, more something in the vein of Mountain, where the priority is lovely, naturey vibes. Described as an \"interactive woodland\", you grow little landscapes and ecosystems where over time plant life grows, and animals flock to. It's the kind of thing I can imagine spending 15 minutes on at the end of a tough day to help recuperate. Treeplanter - Announcement Trailer Watch on YouTube Most appealing of all, though, is the fact that proceeds from every sale of the game will go straight to tree-planting charities to help grow actual trees. This isn't surprising given the person who made it, Henry Driver, is apparently a sixth-generation farmer alongside being a game developer. Talk about living up to your name! In particular I quite like the final line from the game's Steam page: \"Please keep in mind that this is a small game with no goals or challenges, created by Henry with help from his friends - it's all about creating small but beautiful dioramas, using the tools and items from the game alongside the influences of nature.\" I'm not big on traditional sim games myself, but this sounds up my alley. Treeplanter doesn't have a release date just yet but it is set to arrive sometime in 2025.",
