  "text": "Apple has a slew of products available beyond iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The tech giant has slowly begun to introduce various iPhone accessories over the last decade, such as Apple Watch, and these have proven to be a major success. Another major accessory we've seen from Apple is none other than AirPods. The market for wireless earbuds slowly began to grow popular in 2015, but nothing shook up the market more than the launch of AirPods. With many different models and product lines available, you might not remember each generation that Apple has released. Below, we've compiled every generation of Apple AirPods, so buckle up and prepare for a journey through this iconic device.How Many Apple AirPods Generations Have There Been?Apple has released a total of seven different Apple AirPods generations. The first model was released in 2016, with the latest arriving in 2024. We've included every AirPods release ever on this list, with the standard AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max all included.Every Apple AirPods Generation in Order of ReleaseApple AirPods (1st Generation) - December 13, 2016The Apple AirPods (1st Generation) were the pair that started it all. Despite bundling in wired Apple EarPods with all iPhone models, this marked Apple's first jump into the wireless earbud space. The AirPods were brilliantly easy to use thanks to the Apple W1 Chip, which granted users the ability to flip open the AirPods and seamlessly connect them to any Apple device. Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) - March 20, 2019While Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) looked just like the original pair on the outside, numerous changes were made internally that paved the way for a significant upgrade. Apple first replaced the W1 chip with the H1, a chip that allowed for quicker connectivity overall. Additionally, while the battery life remained unchanged, Hey Siri functionality was added for users to quickly access Apple's AI assistant. Apple AirPods Pro (1st Generation) - October 30, 2019The AirPods Pro marked Apple's first foray into the premium wireless earbud market. Instead of an open-ear design, AirPods Pro has silicone tips that go inside your ear, which opened the door for both higher quality sound and Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). Apple offered two ANC modes on AirPods Pro: Active Noise Cancellation \u0026 Transparency Mode. The latter allows for voices to enter and mix with the sound while keeping all other noises cancelled out.Apple AirPods Max - December 15, 2020In 2020, Apple released the AirPods Max, a brand-new take on Apple AirPods. This model has a complete over-ear design, which looks much closer to the Sony WH-1000MX5 or Bose QuietComfort 45. AirPods Max still offers the best sound quality to date on any AirPods model, with a great balance and quality bass performance. Apple did release an updated version of the AirPods Max in 2024, but the only change was a USB-C port.Apple Apple AirPods Max Wireless Over-Ear HeadphonesFeatures: Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, Spatial Audio, Digital Crown for Volume Control, Bluetooth Headphones for iPhoneApple AirPods (3rd Generation) - October 26, 2021Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) was a major shakeup in design compared to the last generation. This time, the design was much closer to Apple AirPods Pro, with the case much more rectangular, and the AirPods themselves having shorter stems. This generation also improved the battery life in a big way, with over six hours of additional listening time on Apple AirPods (3rd Generation).Apple AirPods (3rd Generation)Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) - September 23, 2022Three years after the release of AirPods Pro, Apple released AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) in 2022. This upgrade replaced the lightning port on the charging case with USB-C, increased water and dust resistance, and more. Sound quality was also much improved with this model, especially in regards to Active Noise Cancellation performance. Recently, Apple even added support for a clinically-validated hearing test to AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) that can gauge ear health and showcase listening habits to users.Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) with MagSafe Case (USB-C)Apple AirPods (4th Generation) - September 20, 2024The most recent AirPods model, Apple AirPods (4th Generation) marked the first time that Apple offered multiple models for one AirPods gen. You can choose between either the standard model or a model equipped with Active Noise Cancellation. A new design was made specifically to fit in as many user's ears as possible, with a solid upgrade in sound quality offered as well.AirPods 4 Active Noise CancellationWhen Are New Apple AirPods Coming Out?Right now, the next Apple AirPods launch we can expect is the next generation of Apple AirPods Pro. Since Apple chose not to reveal the new earbuds last Fall or alongside the iPhone 16e, it's likely that the reveal will be set for this Fall. Apple is set to release the iPhone 17 in September, so it's probably that any news regarding any next-gen AirPods Pro models will be released there.Originally posted: Mar 2, 2025 7:45 pm",
