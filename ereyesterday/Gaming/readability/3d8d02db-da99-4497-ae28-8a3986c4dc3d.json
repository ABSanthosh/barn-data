  "description": "Marvel Rivals has hit some major milestones since its launch a month ago, including reaching 20 million players. The Overwatch competitor features a huge roster, including the now beloved Jeff the Land Shark, and while NetEase has already confirmed some of the heroes being added in Season 1, there have also been almost a dozen leaked heroes as well. While it's unlikely that all of those heroes arrive in Season 1, it does seem possible that there could be even more than the ones officially confirmed. The new season will also include new team-ups, new maps, and a new battle pass, along with new cosmetic items in the shop. Here's everything we know about Marvel Rivals Season 1 so far. Marvel Rivals Season 1 Start DateWhile the start date of Marvel Rivals Season 1 hasn't been confirmed, Season 0 is set to end Thursday, January 9 at 10 PM PST / January 10 at 1 AM EST. Since this is the first new season since the launch of Marvel Rivals, it's unclear if Season 1 will start immediately or if there will be some server downtime, but it seems like January 10 is the most likely start date. When Season 1 kicks off, it will include a new battle pass, which should be longer than the Season 0 battle pass. Don't worry though, Marvel Rivals battle passes don't expire, so you can keep working on the Season 0 battle pass if you haven't finished. Marvel Rivals Season 1 Confirmed New HeroesSeveral new heroes have been officially confirmed as coming to Marvel Rivals, with NetEase teasing a trailer for January 6 featuring the first official look at the Fantastic Four. At the moment, it's not clear if all four will be added at the start of the season, but the tweet refers to them as a unit, \"Marvel's first family,\" so it seems all four will debut at the start of the season. That includes Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and Thing. While the exact classes of each character haven't been revealed yet, Thing seems like an obvious Vanguard (tank) and Human Torch may be a Duelist (DPS). Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman seem likely to provide at least one Strategist (support) between them, if not both, especially since most of Marvel Rivals' roster is made up of Duelists, but we will have to wait for official confirmation. Marvel Rivals Season 1 Leaked CharactersWhile it seems probable that the Fantastic Four are the only heroes added in Season 1, there have been a lot of leaked heroes for Marvel Rivals that could also join the roster in Season 1, perhaps as part of a mid-season update. These leaked heroes could also get added in future seasons or could potentially get scrapped entirely. Below is a list of the leaked heroes, coming from multiple leakers on Twitter, @MRivalsUpdates and @RivalsLeaks.Leaked heroes:AngelaBladeCaptain MarvelDeadpoolEmma FrostHit-MonkeyJean Grey (Phoenix)M.O.D.O.K.The HoodUltron (believed to be a Season 1 hero)Valkyrie Marvel Rivals Season 1 MapsNetEase hasn't confirmed new maps for Season 1 just yet, but there have been some leaks. Leaker @FumoLeaks found three locations believed to be coming in Season 1. The first two are Krakoa and Arakkoe, islands that the X-Men inhabit in some comic storylines, as well as a New York City map. Similar to other locations in Marvel Rivals, these might contain multiple maps for different game modes, the way that Wakanda features both payload and point capture maps already in Marvel Rivals. Leaker @XOX_Leak also tweeted \"New York = EMPIRE OF ETERNAL NIGHT.\" Based on some text from Cloak and Dagger's character bio and some dialogue they share with Spider-Man in match, Dracula has control of New York, which might influence the design of the maps. The same leaker also shared that Thebes, Egypt is also going to be a map in the future. Marvel Rivals Season 1 Team-UpsTeam-ups in Marvel Rivals are bonus abilities or buffs that are activated when the required characters are on the same team. Some of these bonuses are listed as seasonal boosts, so it's not yet clear if old team-ups will be replaced or if more team-ups are just being added, but leakers have found a number of potential team-ups ahead of official confirmation from NetEase. It's not clear if these team-ups are set for Season 1, especially since some of them include characters that have not been officially confirmed. This list comes from @XOX_Leak and likely isn't representative of all Season 1 new team-ups.Squirrel Girl X Rocket RacoonStorm X Human TorchWolverine X The Thing X HulkWolverine X PhoenixWolverine X Magik X Psylocke X Black Panther (potentially scrapped according to leakers)Blade X Cloak and Dagger X Moon KnightEmma Frost X MagnetoEmma Frost X Psylocke",
