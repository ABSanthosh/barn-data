  "text": "Darkness stirs in the swamps of Hawezar. Beginning January 21, the Tree of Whispers—a macabre yet essential presence in Sanctuary—finds itself under siege in Diablo IV’s Season of Witchcraft. This seventh season takes you deep into the haunting lore of Hawezar, uncovering the mysteries of the witches who guard the Tree and the sinister events that threaten its ancient balance. When power is stolen, truths are revealed, and bargains are broken. Nothing is left unscathed.  The Cries of the Tree of Whispers  Immense and enigmatic, the Tree of Whispers has stood for ages as both a guide and a reckoner. Hanging from its massive branches are severed heads brimming with knowledge—the ultimate price paid by those who once sought the Tree’s wisdom. These heads are bound to the Tree, fulfilling deals struck in exchange for power and secrets of the highest order.  But something—or someone—has disrupted this unyielding cycle. Severed Fugitive Heads, desperate for autonomy, have been stolen and scattered across Sanctuary. From this desecration arise the dreaded Headrotten—twisted monstrosities bursting with brambles, roots, and rot as they search for host bodies. These independent horrors take hold of the living, aiming to claw their way back to power. With the Tree’s influence waning, you must answer its call for vengeance. Vile forces are at play, and if balance is not restored, the repercussions for Sanctuary will be dire.  Meet the Witches of Hawezar  To aid your quest, you’ll join forces with the Witches of Hawezar, a guarded yet formidable trio bound to the Tree of Whispers. Each witch brings a distinct and potent expertise, reflecting their connection to the swamp and the Tree’s ancient powers.  Gelena: A stern leader who relies on magic tied to the psyche, mastering illusions and divination. She sees the unseen, but her strict adherence to rules keeps her grounded in chaos.   Caidin: A rogue hailing from Scosglen, balances dark humor with sinister powers. His swampborne skills create plagues and potions, but his chaotic nature is an unpredictable force of its own.   Ouna: The enigmatic youngest witch, straddles the boundary of life and death. Her eldritch magic embodies the eerie cycle of growth and decay, making her abilities both otherworldly and horrifying.   Together, Gelena, Caidin, and Ouna enlist your help to retrieve the Fugitive Heads. Yet their motives differ and their approaches clash, creating a tense alliance. Be cautious with your trust, for everything comes at a cost.  Witchcraft Powers Unleashed  Season of Witchcraft introduces an exciting new mechanic: Witchcraft Powers. Harness supernatural energy and tailor a playstyle from three distinct schools of magic:  Eldritch Magic (Fire \u0026 Shadow Damage)   Psyche Magic (Mind \u0026 Soul Manipulation)   Growth \u0026 Decay Magic (Damage Over Time \u0026 Healing)   Plus, discover rare Lost powers of Witchcraft unknown to both the Coven and the Tree. Each school of Witchcraft gives you the chance to experiment between new styles of power. Occult Gems, new Seasonal Legendary Gems, further amplify these Witchcraft abilities. Customize your gear and combat style with these powerful tools to ensure every spell carries a unique impact.  Headhunts and the Rise of the Headrotten Bosses  Seasonal gameplay ramps up with Headhunts, intense subzone events reminiscent of Helltide mechanics. The Tree of Whispers identifies areas teeming with Headrotten activity, calling players to purge Sanctuary of their rotting corruption.  Headrotten bosses guard these areas, each tied to a Fugitive Head and their lingering memories. Some are merely parasites, while others are rare Headed Headrotten Bosses, fully merged with their stolen hosts. These grotesque enemies wield devastating abilities, forcing you to strategize in order to claim victory and reap legendary rewards.   While completing Whisper bounties within Headhunts, keep a keen eye for any Rootholds. These seasonal dungeons have bonus challenges and rewards to aid your quest to support the Coven.  Even More New Features  Beyond the Witchcraft mechanics and Headhunts, Season of Witchcraft brings fan-requested updates and exciting seasonal rewards:  Armory Feature: Switch between saved loadouts with ease. Save Skill Points, Paragon Points, and gear sets for fast swapping between builds.   Seasonal Rewards \u0026 Legendaries: Gain access to new Uniques, Legendaries, and gameplay updates, including three new Runes and exclusive tiers within the Seasonal Journey. Progress through the tiers to unlock cosmetic upgrades like the coveted Raven Pet.   Coven’s Favor Battle Pass: Earn prestigious rewards by conquering Coven-inspired challenges tied to the seasonal theme.   Claim Balance from Chaos  Diablo IV: Season of Witchcraft is one of the most haunting journeys yet. By exploring the secrets of the Tree of Whispers and allying with the Witches of Hawezar, you will unravel a deeply engaging saga rife with moral complexity and danger lurking in every shadow.  Sanctuary awaits your bravery, Wanderer. The Tree calls for justice, and its whispers demand action. Will you answer?   Don’t miss the start of Season of Witchcraft, coming January 21.  Diablo® IV is the next-gen action RPG experience with endless evil to slaughter, countless abilities to master, nightmarish Dungeons and legendary loot. Embark on the campaign solo or with friends, meeting memorable characters throughout a beautifully dark open world and a gripping story. Dive into an expansive End Game where players can meet in towns to trade, team up to battle larger-than-life World Bosses, unlock robust character and loot customization, and uncover tons more action-packed activities to explore with cross-play and cross-progression on all available platforms. This is only the beginning for Diablo® IV, with new events, stories, Seasons, rewards, and more looming on the horizon. Battle.net® account required. Internet connection required.
