It's one of the better prices we've seen for a gaming PC equipped with this second generation RTX 40 series GPU. The RTX 4070 Super is the best graphics card for most people; it's not exorbitantly priced, and although 1440p is its sweet spot, this GPU is powerful enough to run games even at up to 4K resolution.MSI Aegis R RTX 4070 SUPER Gaming PC for $1399MSI Aegis R Intel Core i7-14700F RTX 4070 Super Gaming PC with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSDThis particular model is equipped with an Intel Core i7-14700F CPU, GeForce RTX 4070 Super 12GB GPU, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB NVMe SSD. The 14th-gen Intel Core i7-14700F Raptor Lake Refresh CPU boasts a max clock of 5.4GHz with 20 cores, 28 threads, and a 33MB cache and it's adequately cooled by a 120mm tower heatsink fan. If you plan to use this PC as a gaming rig, then an i7 is a much better value than an i9. Performance is nearly identical because games cannot utilize the extra cores that the i9 has. You're also not losing out compared to the disappointing new Intel Core Ultra desktop processors, which don't perform any better than the previous generation Raptor Lake models.The RTX 4070 Super video card is a significant improvement in performance over the 4070 (about 10-15% faster at 1440p according to our RTX 4070 Super review). In the review, Jacqueline Thomas writes \"The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is the graphics card we should have got back when Nvidia first released its 4000-series cards. Performance is significantly improved over the original RTX 4070, along with more VRAM that should make the graphics card a little bit more future-proof. If you are in the market for a GPU and you have a budget, this is the best graphics card on the market for you.\"For more discounts, check out the best gaming PC deals today.
