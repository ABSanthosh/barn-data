As part of the Walmart Black Friday Sale, you can get a GTRacing 55\"x24\" Gaming Desk for a mere $59.99 – and that includes free shipping. Although the retail price of $199.99 is a bit exaggerated (it usually hovers closer to about $100), this is still far and away the lowest price we've seen for a 55\" gaming desk. It has plenty of extra features you wouldn't expect at this price point, like carbon fiber styling and integrated LED accent lighting.GTRacing 55\" Gaming Desk for $59.99GTRacing 55\" RGB Gaming DeskGTRacing is a brand you may or may not heard of; it sells gaming chairs and desks at budget-friendly prices on Amazon and Walmart. This particular desk is a very popular model at Walmart. It features a steel frame that supports up to 300lbs and a 55\"x24\" MDF desktop surface that's wrapped in a water resistant carbon-fiber patterned skin. The desk features two cable grommets, one on either end, to route your cables. There's also an integrated LED accent lighting around the perimeter that can cycle through different colors and patterns. In terms of accessories, you get a large 24\"x24\" mousepad, as well as an under-desk headphone hook. A one-year warranty is also included. Seriously, for $60, you can't ask for more. You could get one of the best gaming desks of 2024 instead, but then you're paying up to 10x the cost.Looking for a matching gaming chair?GTRacing Gaming ChairWalmart has also discounted the GTRacing GT099 Series gaming chair to only $93.99. This is one of the most popular budget gaming chairs at Walmart with over 2,300 reviews giving it a 4.3/5 star rating. This sub-$100 gaming chair features PU leather upholstery, an adjustable headrest and lumbar pillow, up to 160 degrees of recline with a rocker toggle, and a weight limit of 300lbs. Sure, it's not as fancy as a Secretlab gaming chair, but it also costs 1/5 the price.Looking for more RGB bling for your gaming setup?Govee x Evangelion RGBIC Glide Wall Light (6PC + 2 Connectors)Govee x Evangelion RGBIC Glide Y Lights (5-Pack)Govee x Evangelion RGBIC Gaming Light BarsEarlier this year, Govee launched a new line of Evangelion-themed RGB LED lights. They're based on existing Govee products that have been meticulously designed to faithfully recreate the futuristic space-mecha vibe of the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime, from the color palette, patterns, shapes, and text to custom lighting presets that you won't find on the standard models. They do cost a premium compared to Govee's non-Evangelion-themed offerings, but right now, ahead of Black Friday, they're significantly discounted. There are several designs to choose from and they all look amazing. They'd make a pretty incredible holiday gift for anime and gamer fans.When Is Black Friday 2024?The actual date of Black Friday in 2024 falls on November 29 this year, but the deals season will begin a lot sooner than that. Leading up to the big event, retailers will begin to open deals online. This usually starts in the last week of October, just before Halloween. Each week leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to massive discounts on Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
