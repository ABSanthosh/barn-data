Now, with Season 14’s arrival, that’s easier than ever! Introducing a range of stealth-focused abilities, weapons and items, this Season completely revitalises your options for approaching other players and emergent enemies, and provides more opportunities for creating mischief out on the waves. Season 14 creeps on stage on October 17th, bringing with it 100 fresh levels of Seasonal Renown for players to climb and all the gold, Doubloons, Ancient Coins and cosmetic rewards associated with them! This update is now freely available for all players. To get started, all you need to do is make sure you’ve downloaded the latest version of the game and brace yourself for a Season of clandestine action.Sea of Thieves Season 14: Official Content Update VideoDuration 6:45The first two weapons of chaos arriving with Season 14 can both be added to your Armoury, though as you’ll discover, the Grapple Gun is less of a weapon and more of a traversal tool. Modelled after the harpoons found on your ships, this portable device has the ability to haul loot and enemies towards you or, if fired at a solid surface, haul you towards whatever you were aiming at. This allows you to zip around the islands of the Sea of Thieves faster than ever, as well as offering a helping hand to close the distance between you and any ship that looks in dire need of boarding. Just remember you’ll have a limited number of shots before you need to start looking for an Ammo Crate… Landing on the more traditional side of offensive capability is the blowpipe! Intended for stealthy applications, this weapon can be used to fire three different types of dart: the Poison Dart, which deals damage to enemies over time; the Black Powder Dart, which triggers a small explosion if it isn’t doused before the fuse burns down; and the Lure Dart, which glints like treasure to attract the attention of curious pirates and skeletons or other enemies in the area.Sea of Thieves Season 14: Official Launch TrailerDuration 0:56Of course, with a focus on the things you can do while remaining undetected, you may want to avoid conflict altogether. To that end, Season 14 also introduces tricks and tools to help you move through the world unnoticed. You can now crouch to move around much more quietly, and gain access to chest and barrel disguises that let you sneak into the midst of an unsuspecting crew. If you’re really well prepared, as the Season progresses you’ll also be able to lay down traps to damage your foes before you hide. Just don’t forget to eat an enchanted Merfruit first so a helpful mermaid doesn’t give you away… As always, new Seasonal content isn’t limited to tweaks to the sandbox; there are also a wide range of new cosmetics to be earned by completing Commendations and maxing out your Renown before the Season ends! For Season 14, you can get your hands on ship and clothing cosmetics highlighting your commitment to stealth and subterfuge with face-concealing masks, shadowy colour schemes and furtive vulpine motifs. While you’re earning all that Renown, you might also want to pick up the Season 14 Plunder Pass and the ability to unlock extra goodies. This latest optional Pass enables dedicated pirates to earn the full Inner Sanctum ship set including Collector’s Figurehead and Sails, a matching hat, belt and jacket, and the usual 750 extra Ancient Coins available to any Pass holder who reaches level 100 before the Season’s end.Sea of Thieves Season 14: Unlockable CosmeticsDuration 0:57For more immediate expansions to your cosmetics chests, the Pirate Emporium is also rolling out new stock for you to explore. The witch-inspired Coral Coven collection makes its debut, already comprising a complete ship set including Collector’s items, bundles of themed clothing and weapons, and even an adorable feline companion in the form of the Coral Coven Cat, all available to adopt now in return for Ancient Coins. Keeping the new moggy in good company, Skeleton Pets are back for the spooky season! Alongside the existing Alsatian, Cockatoo, Marmoset and Mau, the new Skeleton Fox and Owl are joining the team, but be sure to grab them quickly – they’ll only be available for a limited time before disappearing from shelves once again.Pirate Emporium Update - October 2024: Official Sea of ThievesDuration 1:09Season 14 offers players an entirely new way of approaching the world of Sea of Thieves, with a myriad of details to sink your teeth into. For a full look at absolutely everything bundled into the update, have a read of the latest release notes. Otherwise, it’s time to get sneaking! We look forward to not seeing you out on the waves…Related ArticlesCarousel Slide 1, 1 of 5, Current Item",
