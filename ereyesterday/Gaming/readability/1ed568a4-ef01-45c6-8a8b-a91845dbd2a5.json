It currently retails for $449 and most retailers have it marked down to $336 for Memorial Day, but Adorama has it even cheaper at $309 with free shipping, or 31% off. This is the lowest price I've seen for Sonos' best portable speaker. Adorama is an authorized Sonos reseller and a legitimate, established vendor with a superstore located in New York.Memorial Day Deal: Sonos Move 2 for $309Sonos Move 2The Move 2 is Sonos' biggest and best portable speaker. It's size allows it to house two tweeters, a mid-woofer, and three class-D digital amplifiers. This is a standalone speaker with a self-contained battery and can be carried around from room to room. The battery provides up to 24 hours of continuous playtime and a simple but effective docking station essentially turns it into a powered speaker. It is IP56 rated for weather resistance and has a built-in microphone so that it can accept voice commands and is compatible with smart assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.Alternative: Sonos Roam 2 for $134Sonos Roam 2The Sonos Roam 2 is much more compact than the Move 2. It weighs in at under one pound and is designed for both indoor and outdoor use thanks to an IP67-rated waterproof and dustproof housing. It houses one tweeter, one mid-woofer, and two class-H digital amplifers, so it's still able to pump out inpressively clean sound even at high volumes. The internal battery supplies the Roam 2 with nearly 10 hours of playtime, and it can be recharged over USB Type-C. It supports both Bluetooth and wireless connectivity and has a built-in microphone for voice control.Why Is Sonos So Popular?If you're looking for an easy solution to add great sound to your home, then you've probably already heard of Sonos. Sonos speakers are very easy to set up, don't take a large amount of space, and most importantly, offer distortion-free room-filling audio. We picked Sonos as our best soundbar of 2024.Sound Quality for Its SizeDespite the fact that Sonos products are compact and don't take up much space in your house, they offer surprisingly loud and distortion-free audio. They're definitely pricier than budget options, but the sound quality is more akin to audio products that cost hundreds more or take up much more space.Easy SetupSonos devices are usually simple plug and play. All you have to do is plug in a power cable (if even that's necessary) and one connection to your TV (if even that's necessary), download the Sonos app, and you're done. Generally a receiver isn't required; the soundbars are designed to plug right into your TV and the speakers are designed to work wirelessly. For something like a 5.1ch home theater setup, you don't have to deal with a mess of cables. Individual Sonos speakers can pair with your soundbar and be used as rear satellites, and the subwoofer is also wireless so it can be positioned virtually anywhere in your room.Communication Between DevicesPractically all Sonos speakers can communicate with each other. That means you can pair different Sonos speakers in different rooms for multi-room capability. Or you can pair two speakers for stereo output. Or you can pair speakers to your soundbar to be used as a 5.1ch setup. It's all seamlessly done through the app.More ResourcesThe best soundbars of 2024The best Bluetooth speakers of 2024The best bookshelf speakers of 2024The best PC speakers of 2024More Memorial Day sales are already liveSeveral retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Dell, and Wayfair have launched their sale early.
