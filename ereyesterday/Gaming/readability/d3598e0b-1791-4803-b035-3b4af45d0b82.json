  "text": "SummaryEmpowering Future Generations: Xbox promotes a welcoming and diverse gaming industry where women continue to lead and inspire the next wave of creators to push boundaries and innovate. Discover Games Shaped by Women Creators: Highlighting iconic games and franchises created by women developers, showcasing how their unique perspectives have shaped the gaming world we know today. Spotlighting Women Gaming Pioneers: Celebrating the groundbreaking contributions of women like Roberta Williams who have redefined gaming through their innovation in game design, storytelling, and development.  As we celebrate International Women’s Day, it’s essential to recognize the critical role women play and have played in shaping the gaming industry. Women have been at the forefront of pushing the industry forward since its earliest days. Their contributions have helped shape the way we play, tell stories, and connect with the digital world—contributions that deserve our recognition and celebration.   In celebration of this, we’re excited to feature the first two parts of an exclusive interview with Roberta Williams, one of the most influential women in gaming – we’ll be releasing more excerpts throughout the month. Roberta co-founded Sierra On-Line and created the iconic King’s Quest series, a groundbreaking achievement in storytelling and game design. From her pioneering work to the impact of other women like Kim Swift, who designed Portal, women have continually redefined the possibilities of gaming. These women, and many others, have not only created beloved games but have also paved the way for future generations of women to see themselves in the industry—whether as developers, writers, designers, or producers.  Women have been influential figures across all areas of the gaming world—from design and development to storytelling and production. As we continue to break down barriers and champion diverse perspectives, we’re proud to amplify the voices of those who have shaped the industry’s past and are shaping its future.   In our exclusive interview with Roberta, she reflects on her pioneering journey in the gaming industry and shares her insights into her love of mysteries, the creation of Laura Bow; one of the first heroines in gaming, advise for young women looking to get into gaming, and what inspired her to return with a new adventure, Colossal Cave. Her groundbreaking work in interactive storytelling has inspired generations of creators, and her thoughts on the past, present, and future of women in gaming offer invaluable perspectives on the road ahead. As we honor the accomplishments of women in gaming, let’s also look toward the future. The work being done today by women in this industry is setting the stage for a new generation of creators who will continue to push boundaries and inspire others. Let’s ensure that women’s voices are heard, celebrated, and given the platform they deserve—today and every day.  PLAY Discover Games Shaped by Women Creators  Celebrate International Women’s Day through the power of play.

Play Colossal Cave Today DISCOVER  Spotlighting Women Gaming Pioneers Marcella Churchill – Sr. Director of Brand at SEGA of America Marcella Churchill is a visionary leader in brand marketing with a track record of spearheading global brand campaigns at LucasArts, EA, Zynga, Discord, and now Sega of America. At Sega, she is redefining transmedia storytelling, transforming iconic franchises into multimedia powerhouses. She has played a key role in elevating Sonic the Hedgehog to new heights, leading brand marketing endeavors supporting blockbuster films, hit TV series, major brand partnerships, and best-selling games. Beyond Sonic, Marcella is driving the resurgence of beloved franchises like Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Persona, and Like a Dragon, expanding their reach and legacy. Passionate about innovation, she is dedicated to growing Sega’s global brand, crafting unforgettable fan experiences, and pushing the boundaries of brand marketing and gaming entertainment.  Q: You’ve seen incredible growth in the Sonic brand, from successful games to record-breaking movies. What do you think has been the key to Sonic’s ability to cross storytelling mediums and what’s next on the horizon for you and your team?   A: Sonic’s evolution from a beloved video game character to a full-fledged entertainment icon is a testament to the passion and dedication of our team. We’ve focused on staying true to the heart of Sonic—his energy, attitude, and sense of adventure—while expanding his storytelling across games, film, TV, comics, and beyond. By embracing a transmedia approach, we’ve introduced Sonic to new audiences while deepening the experience for longtime fans. The success of the films, alongside hit games like Sonic Frontiers and Sonic X Shadow Generations, has reinforced the strength of the franchise, and last year’s brand marketing campaign featuring the Year of Shadow was a significant moment, culminating in the movie release of ‘Sonic the Hedgehog 3’.  Looking ahead, we have a lot in store for Sonic fans. While we can’t reveal everything yet, our team is committed to delivering exciting new, unique experiences and pushing the brand further. Whether through innovative game projects, fresh storytelling opportunities, or unexpected collaborations, we’re focused on keeping Sonic’s momentum strong and continuing to surprise and delight fans worldwide.  Q: As a woman in a leadership role in gaming, how have you seen Marketing in the gaming industry evolve over the years and where do you see it going?   A: Marketing in the gaming industry has evolved significantly, shifting from traditional print and TV ads to digital-first, community-driven strategies. Early on, marketing was heavily reliant on big-budget campaigns and retail partnerships. Still, engagement has become more personalized, pervasive, and interactive with the rise of social media, influencers, live service models, and more opportunities to collaborate with brands through collaborations and lifestyle partnerships. Players now expect direct communication, behind-the-scenes access, and content tailored to their interests. Looking ahead, I see marketing continuing to blend data-driven insights with creative storytelling, lifestyle partnerships, leveraging user-generated content, and emerging platforms to foster deeper player engagement and brand loyalty.    Q: As a leader in the gaming industry, what advice would you give to young women aspiring to build a career in marketing and gaming and how can they best prepare for the future you see ahead?   A: My advice to young women aspiring to build a career in marketing and gaming is to stay curious, build a strong network, and embrace creativity and data-driven decision-making. The industry thrives on innovation, so developing a deep understanding of player communities, emerging technologies, and digital marketing trends will be key. Seek mentors, advocate for yourself, and don’t be afraid to take up space in rooms where you may be the only woman. As the industry evolves, staying adaptable and continuously learning will be essential for long-term success.  Wonder Stormbreaker – Head of Studio Marketing at Undead Labs As the Head of Studio Marketing at Undead Labs, Wonder Stormbreaker plays a crucial role in ensuring that the studio’s projects, particularly the State of Decay franchise, connect with audiences on a deep level. With a strong passion for storytelling and community engagement, Wonder’s work is centered around building immersive experiences for fans and amplifying Undead Labs’ voice in the gaming world. Whether through innovative marketing campaigns or leading the charge in social media outreach, Wonder is always thinking about how to bring players into the fold and create lasting relationships with the community.  Q: As Head of Studio Marketing, how do you approach creating authentic connections with fans and building a community around Undead Labs’ games?  A: One of my core values is integrity: be who you say you are and do what you say you’re going to do. That’s what players expect from us. We build strong relationships by delivering on what we’ve promised. To do that, we place a high value on players’ experiences and expectations. Trust is at the heart of strong relationships between studios and players.   Q: State of Decay has a passionate fanbase. What do you think has been the key to building that loyalty, and how do you keep the game’s community engaged over time?  A: It’s important to our studio culture that we never lose sight of the worth and power of an individual.   State of Decay’s popularity began as a grassroots movement. Personal touch is a priority for how we build community. I ask thorny questions: How do we make a larger, global audience feel connected and cared for? How do we automate what we do here to serve even more players, without depersonalization? We know we won’t always get the answers right on the first try, and frankly, I hate that. I would love to knock it out of the park the first time, every time. The important thing is that our players have evidence that we’re always improving their experience.  Q: Marketing in the gaming industry can be very dynamic and fast-paced. How do you stay ahead of trends, and what excites you most about the future of game marketing?  A: It’s important to think of games as one piece of the “entertainment-verse.” I have a theater and film background and often look to the film industry for clues about where we are headed, but really, it’s about how games fit into people’s lives when everything is vying for attention.  It’s easy to be swept into our own silos, even an Xbox silo. Right now, I’m working with the Turn 10 team on a few projects which is incredible for inspiration and new perspectives. I read industry newsletters like A16z’s speedrun and Naavik, as well as current event roundups like Mo News and Semafor. This may be surprising, but I avoid almost all social media. The firehose of micro-entertainment on social platforms can overwhelm the big picture, and the big picture is most interesting to me. That’s where vision flourishes.  Empowering Women Streamers with South of Midnight In South of Midnight, we step into the shoes of Hazel, a strong, rough-edged protagonist navigating a world inspired by the American Deep South. Tasked with fixing what’s broken, Hazel must adapt to a hostile environment that’s barely recognizable. This month, Team Xbox continues its commitment to empowering women protagonists and celebrating women in the gaming industry in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland). As part of this, Xbox is partnering with the creator agency Instinct3 on a campaign to support and elevate emerging women streamers for South of Midnight. This initiative offers smaller, up-and-coming streamers the chance to apply and receive early access codes for the game. Focused on those who may not yet have the reach of more established streamers, the campaign aims to shine a spotlight on women creators by sponsoring their streams and giving them a platform to grow.  In the spirit of empowering women, streamers will support each other through Twitch’s raid mechanics, directing viewers from one stream to the next. These streams and raids will kick off with South of Midnight Early Access on April 3. Details will be shared via Xbox Wire DACH, along with opportunities to win Game Pass codes.  The campaign application opens on International Women’s Day, March 8, and runs through the month. Selected streamers will receive Game Pass and game codes, joining our paid campaign for Early Access.  GIVE  Gaming with Impact   Rewards members in the United States can earn and donate points to organizations supporting women with Xbox.
