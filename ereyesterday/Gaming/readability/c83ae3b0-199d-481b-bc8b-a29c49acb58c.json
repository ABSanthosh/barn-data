Amazon is offering the LEGO Technic Planet Earth and Moon in Orbit 42179 for only $59.95, a savings of 20%. With this deal, you're paying about 11 cents per brick. This is the lowest price we've seen for this set and matches the best deal during Black Friday. Its interactive design makes it a wonderful kit for both adults and kids.LEGO Technic Planet Earth and Moon in Orbit 42179LEGO Technic Planet Earth and Moon in Orbit 42179The Planet Earth and Moon in Orbit 42179 set measures 9\" high, 12.5\" long, and 7\" wide. It's comprised of 526 pieces and is marketed for ages 10 and older. Technically speaking, this is a relatively simple build that can be completed in a few hours or less. And the fun's not over once you're done.What's really awesome about this set is the interactive nature of it. Once you're done, you can simply turn the handle to get four different types of movement: (1) the Earth rotates on its axis, (2) the sun rotates on its axis, (3) the moon orbits the Earth, and (4) the Earth orbits the sun. Not only is it cool to watch, but it's also an excellent learning tool for kids; on the technical side, they get to see how a crankshaft works. On the educational side, they get to see how the positions of the moon and sun relative to the Earth correspond to different months, seasons, and moon phases. It's definitely worth the modest asking price compared to many other LEGO sets that are essentially one-and-done after the build is completed.Retired LEGO sets that are still available at AmazonFor more LEGO news and deals, check out the recently retired LEGO sets of May, the best LEGO Star Wars sets to build, an upcoming LEGO Mario Kart set geared towards adults, and our recent LEGO River Steamboat in-house build.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
