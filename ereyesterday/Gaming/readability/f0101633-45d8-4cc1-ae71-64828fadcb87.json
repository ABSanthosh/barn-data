  "text": "We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.” -Kurt Vonnegut, Mother Night This is what the voters in the United States decided they wanted.  All the bad things that are going to come will have been fully endorsed by not just the electoral college, but by the popular vote.  It isn’t a quirk, it is a mandate. We don’t know exactly what will come, but what has been promised on the campaign trail, mass deportations, economically ruinous tariffs, the ending of Social Security and like government programs, and the further curtailing of women’s rights will end up hurting everybody if those are pursued as objectives.  It will certainly hurt people in the red states that went enthusiastically for Trump.  Our best hope is that some of this will become like the “infrastructure week” of Trump’s first term, which was always delayed. The flag in a time of distress The United States has been fully revealed as being no different than any other country.  Maybe we never were, but we were founded on the aspirational idea that we could be, that we should be.  That is all out the window.  We’re headed towards being nothing different than Russia or China.  There will continue to be a veneer of the rule of law, but it will now be fully bent to serve the ruling clique and those who went along publicly with things they knew were wrong.  There is nothing and nobody to stand in the way of that now.",
