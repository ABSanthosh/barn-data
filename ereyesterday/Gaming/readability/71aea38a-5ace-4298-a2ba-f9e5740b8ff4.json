Image credit: Eurogamer Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's \"spring\" arrival on PS5 has been known for a good few months now, but with the season of daffodils and egg box art now almost upon us, we might finally have a specific release date to chew on. According to ultra-reliable leaker Billbil-kun, The Great Circle comes to Sony's consoles on 17th April, with pre-orders set to open soon. Writing on Deallabs, Billbil-kun (who has an excellent track record with PlayStation leaks) claimed their \"recent investigations\" had revealed the Standard edition of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will launch for PS5 on 17th April. However, Microsoft is reportedly also releasing a Premium version - just as it did on Xbox and PC - granting two days early access, from 15th April. Billbil-kun says they were unable to confirm if a PS5 Collector's Edition is in the works. Billbil-kun claims The Great Circle's Standard and Premium editions will both be available as a physical release, with prices reportedly matching their Xbox equivalents. That means £69.99 / €79.99 / $69.99 USD for the Standard edition on PS5 and £99.99 / €109.99 / $99.99 for the Premium release. Pre-orders for both versions expected to go live on 25th March in Europe. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Review Eurogamer's review of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.Watch on YouTube \"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones,\" Eurogamer's Katharine Castle wrote in her five star review of The Great Circle last year, \"[this] is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames.\" And if you're somehow still on the fence after all the praise its received since its release, perhaps you might like to know we loved The Great Circle enough that it was named Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2024. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's PlayStation 5 release follows Microsoft's decision last year to bring select first-party Xbox releases to other platforms. And after a tentative first 12 months - which saw Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Pentiment, and Hi-fi Rush make the jump to either PS5 or Switch - 2025 looks to be a busy one. Microsoft has already confirmed the likes of Age of Empires 2, Age of Mythology Retold, Forza Horizon 5, Doom: The Dark Ages, and The Outer Worlds 2 are heading to PS5 - with Halo and Flight Simulator 2024 reportedly also on the way.",
