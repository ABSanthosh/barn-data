But we’re not yet to an off week.  We’re only three weeks in and things are still happening. Fantasy Critic League – Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games We left off last week with the standings as follows: The standings for week 2 Two games shipped and had scores, with Cyanbane also having the dubious honor of having the first counter pick to score which left him in negative points territory.  Meanwhile, in the projections Archey passed Potshot for first place for final projected score. Since then we have had some updates, as we got some dates for player picks. Doom: The Dark Ages [Picked by Hare Brained Schemes (p0tsh0t)] Release date changed from ‘2025’ to ‘Thursday, May 15, 2025’. South of Midnight [Picked by Play Forever Mwahahaha (Shintar)] Release date changed from ‘2025’ to ‘Tuesday, April 08, 2025’. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 [Picked by Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss)] Release date changed from ‘Spring 2025’ to ‘Thursday, April 24, 2025’. That is three more game launches nailed down, one each for Potshot, Shintar, and Bhagpuss. When it came to bids this week we also had four in play… two for games, two for counter picks, which were announced on Thursday at 17:00 Pacific time. Atomfall Release Date: 2025-03-27 Hype Factor: 29.7 Dune: Awakening (🎯 Counter Pick Bid) Release Date: Early 2025 Hype Factor: 12.1 The Alters Release Date: Q1 2025 Hype Factor: 15.1 Wonder Woman (🎯 Counter Pick Bid) Release Date: TBA Hype Factor: 0.2 Some Saturday at 17:00 the game bids were resolved with the following results: Atomfall Won by Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss) with a bid of $5 Rodent Entertainment (Arhanta)’s bid of $3 did not succeed: Publisher was outbid. The Alters Won by Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss) with a bid of $5 Rodent Entertainment (Arhanta)’s bid of $3 did not succeed: Publisher was outbid. Bhagpuss outbid Arhanta on both, committing $5.00 to Arhanta’s $3.00.  I am going to assume that at least one of those two bid once the titles in play were announced, but it doesn’t tell me who the original bidder was. When it comes to the counter picks, one went through and one was rejected. Wonder Woman Won by Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss) with a bid of $5 (🎯 Counter Pick) Dune: Awakening Rusty Shackleford (Shilgrod)’s bid of $5 did not succeed: No roster spots available. (🎯 Counter Pick) Bhagpuss committed himself to Wonder Woman as his counter pick, while Shilgrod tried to get out of the Outer Worlds 2 counter pick only to find that once you have a counter pick chosen there is no going back.  Sure, Outer Worlds 2 could bomb… or fail to get enough reviews… or fail to ship as it only has a “2025” release estimate… and still remain a good pick, but that is perhaps less of a sure thing than one might hope for. The week’s changes left us with the following standings: The standings for week 3 Dynasty Warriors: Origins rose a little bit in the scoring as more reviews came in, but not enough to change much on the table.  In fact, the projection for first place in the league fell back to Potshot, with Archey again projected for second place. As noted previously, the projections are pretty weak and may not at all reflect the reality of how things will look as the year moves on. But we will get some updates in scoring this coming week with three titles set to launch. Coming releases for Week 4 That will put Arhanta, Potshot, and myself on the scoreboard, with two more releases landing each week for the three weeks after that.  That may shake up the projections quite a bit.
