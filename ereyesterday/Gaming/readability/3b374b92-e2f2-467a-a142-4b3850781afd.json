Stars Reach – Continued Testing One of the big announcements over the last week or so was that if you have followed the Stars Reach Kickstarter campaign to get updates about its eventual plan then you could be invited to join in on the pre-alpha testing.  Granted, it required some effort on your part to get in: Take a screenshot that you’re following our Kickstarter page Post the Kickstarter page on social media and tag us. Send both to us. You get an invite to our next test! So when we hit Saturday and another four hour test, I was interested to see if a lot more people were playing.  The follower count on the campaign was closing in on 4K around then.  Did the ranks of testers swell?  It was hard to tell. What I did note was that, on logging in, there had not been a world reset, so I was back on the planet Pyromycis and the state it was left in from the previous test.  Structures were up on homesteads still. Arrival at the starting point It also meant that the savaging of the planet via resource gathering was still apparent, with holes and piles of tailings all over the nearby terrain.  It seems the first thing people do when landing there is to start churning up the landscape. The terrain is starting to look almost lunar And this was likely to get worse as part of the test was the new refinery skills. The Refinery skill tree branch has been added to the Mineralogy skill tree! Unlocking it grants access to the Refinery crafting station, where you can master the art of transmutation. With 400+ new recipes, you’ll be able to convert common resources into rarer materials and even create exclusive materials unavailable through other means. That was bound to get more holes dug in the terrain.  It gets better as you move away from the spawn point, though that holds its own hazards as the wildlife on Pyromycis.  I died a few times pretty quickly on straying from the initial area. The lack of a reset also meant that the anti-gravium element was still mined out on the planet, which is an essential ingredient for the grav mesh, the anti-gravity item that lets you fly briefly, which is essential in evading hostile mobs. It had been mentioned the last test I was in that some of the flora would yield the anti-gravium element if harvested, so I spent the first 25 minutes or so doing that.  I ended up with three mushrooms in the safe zone that would yield one or two every few minutes. Back to harvest again… please have something for me That was a bit competitive as well.  Others were doing the same, so it took a bit, but eventually I got my 10 and was able to contruct the grav mesh and get past the mobs that seemed to be deployed in a circle 300m in diameter around the spawn. Of course, once I got out in the field, I found somebody who had a homestead setup and dedicated to the very mushrooms I needed to harvest… I just couldn’t get there safely until I had the anti-gravium in the first place. Mushroom homestead I assume they will make a mint cornering the market once there is a market.  But I had the grav mesh and was free to roam.  I decided to explore instead of mine, at least to start off.  It was off to register more exploration nodes. Using the grav mesh to zip over to some nodes Determined to get Pyromycis fully explored, I decided I need to unlock the map.  But that requires 400 skill points in the ranger tree and I had spent 200 to get the grav mesh recipe and you only get 10 points per node.  But there are other ways to earn those points.  I chose to build a camp to help out. Building a camp has changed a bit as you now need to deploy them from a camp kit in your inventory.  Everybody gets three to start with and you can manufacture more. The camp kit Thinking I would be a bit clever, as you gain points when people use your camp, I chose to deploy mine where I found somebody idle on the corner of the map.  I set up the camp around them and began to earn some low effort ranger skill points. They were just sitting there… and remained in place for quite a while Also, there is apparently no idle timeout.  In pre-alpha I wouldn’t expect that I guess, but it is something to note. Anyway, that started racking up points for me and I soon had the map and was able to complete the survey. Survey complete Also, the map isn’t magic… and the lack of a compass does mean you have to keep an eye on your direction and orientation to make sure you’re moving towards a grid square with an unsurveyed node.   And, of course, there are hazards on the ground.  In trying to swoop in on a node I found myself facing the Harror, one of the boss mobs on Pyromycis. Ooops, better not hang about Also, once again, if they day night cycle were any shorter in the game it would start to feel like a disco. So I got that done, and got my trophy, which wasn’t a trophy but plans for a trophy that I had to build.  But to build it I needed copper and you can only assay for elements you have discovered and… so I decided maybe I needed to look into the whole refinery skill tree… the purpose of the test… so went to build a refinery at my camp only to find I needed plastic. But I knew you could make plastic if you had oil, and oil can be derived from shale because the servitors granted us fracking technology I guess.  Anyway, I went to go look for shale only to discover that it had mostly been mined out on Pyromycis.  What a surprise.  I did managed to find a bit of it through the assaying. Some shale deposits here That got me 9 units of shale and I needed 20 for the oil… so it was time to go find another planet.  Maybe the desert planet had shale.  It kind of looks like west Texas.  So I went back to the portal at the spawn point and went into space… which seemed kind of empty. I mean, space is mostly empty, right? I was impressed with player abilities at that moment, thinking we had literally mined out all the asteroids completely.  We’re like that. So I scooted over to one of the other clearly marked portals and went through to the temperate planet, Rodin IV I think, the first one we started on back in the day, only to find that the ground had disappeared. No ground for you! Yeah, space wasn’t completely empty, the terrain just stopped loading for me.  I think I have had the trifecta of pre-alpha events, a corrupted character, falling through the world, and failing to load the terrain. I mean, something was still there.  I didn’t fall through it.  But I also wasn’t standing on it either, I was falling but not falling when I ventured out onto it.  I was able to flit around with the grav mesh to explore a bit.  It was kind of neat to see.  But it wasn’t really playable. The spawn point suspended in thin air I wrote a bug report and logged off to see if the eternal first step of IT, turning it off and back on again, would work.  It did.  When I logged back in the land was restored to me. I farted around looking for shale, did not find any (Rodin IV has even less than Pyromycis) then went down the drones path on the combat skill tree… which turned out to greatly improve my ability to deal with most mobs.  Also, they set fire to things. Drone fire splash damage set the trees alight They are not, however, an “I win” button in all cases… especially with mobs that don’t take damage from fire.  Still, I was able to work through groups of skysharks and the like pretty handily. And then time ran out for me.  As we got past noon I had to leave the house and spend the rest of the day adulting, so I didn’t never quite got to refining, never found any copper, never built my trophy, and didn’t hear any of the follow up on the test afterwards.
