  "text": "It is all LOTRO all the time here now I guess.  Yesterday saw Standing Stone Games announce a gift to soothe player ire for how poorly handled the 64-bit server transfer process was… and remains. Lord of the Rings Online The statement from the company reads as follows: We want to thank you for your patience and support during our 64-bit server openings and character transfers, which you can read more about here. We still have some work to do, including opening transfers from previously-closed worlds to these new 64-bit servers, opening rotating weekly transfers between the various worlds, and opening a fourth 64-bit server based in the United States. However, we wanted to thank you for your patience so far by offering the following to all players: 50 Mithril Coins Lesser Elixir of Virtue (2500 Virtue XP) Pick-a-Mount Box Universal Ingredient Pack x20 Black Steel Key x5 Players can claim this free gift through May 18th 2025. To claim your gift, use the Coupon Code THANKYOU2025 in the “Redeem Code” field of the LOTRO Store inside of the game. This Coupon Code can be used once per account (1/Account). Please make sure to redeem this gift on the character you wish to receive the gifts. That is pretty nice, and particularly timely.  As I mentioned, I used a few mithril coins to get around Moria while I was down in the hole.  I was down to 6 in my wallet, so 50 more is a boon. The 64-bit ordeal package Some black steel keys are welcome as well.  I have been holding off on opening any of the lockboxes that have been littering my inventory so far, largely because I am advancing at a quick enough pace that they do not seem like a worthwhile investment at this time.  We’ll see how I feel once I get closer to Mordor. And who doesn’t love a mount?  I’ll take another.  I’m less impressed with the universal ingredient packs, mostly because I have a dozen or so already and all I ever craft are weapons, and once you get into legendary items you don’t really any call to craft those. All of which was a nice gesture which would leave me feeling good if all the 64-bit  server problems were over. Unfortunately, they are not.  There are new servers to bring online and the question of who gets to transfer to those, especially now that the original round of servers, like Glamdring where I landed, are feeling the strain of their popularity and are showing many of the performance issues that many transferred to escape.  Some more on that tomorrow. And we haven’t even gotten to the lost characters of the dead servers yet.  The whole transfer process went off the rails early and has not recovered.  And none of that was on last week’s updated roadmap.  Oy veh! Still, they’re trying and an acknowledgement goes some ways to calming people… so long as the servers end up not being overloaded.
