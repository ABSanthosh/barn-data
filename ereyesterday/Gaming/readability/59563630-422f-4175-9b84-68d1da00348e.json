  "text": "Kiting Cat is a block-puzzle sliding game where you push food together to make meals to serve to hungry little cats. Whenever I see a game that has a cooking element, I normally really want to dive in. That want almost doubles if the game itself also has something to do with cats. Kiting Cat is a cat-based cooking game where you play as an adorable chef cat who needs to push trays around a map to cook meals. I guess it makes sense that you, as a cat, don’t need to spend time actually cooking. Instead, there are a bunch of trays on wheels that you need to push. The roll until they hit a wall or run into little traction points on the floor. You can then move to another side of the tray and push it again. There are various ingredients and tools around each of the levels that you can push the trays into. The individual ingredients will disappear and go onto your tray, where tools like fire or knives will stay in the level and continue to cut or cook anything that runs over them. You can also push a tray into a tray to transfer something from one tray to another (which can be super funny). The cats in the level disappear once their order is fulfilled, thankfully freeing up space for more customers. The food that they want does become complex as levels continue, but since the orders are shown at the top of the screen, you can tell what order to get the ingredients and use the tools. Things like omelette and cake can take a few different interactions and combining objects that don’t go together can make a mess. You can reset the level at any time, and there is even a handy undo button. The bottom of the screen both shows how long you have taken to do the level and how many moves you have taken, however Kiting Cat doesn’t give you a ranking based on how you do, which means there is far less pressure. Kiting Cat is available now on the Nintendo eShop, PlayStation Store, and the Microsoft Store. It is slated for release on Steam in the future.
