  "text": "Nothing has been pitched yet, but Reynolds appears to have some exciting ideas.While nothing has yet been pitched to Marvel, Ryan Reynolds is reportedly in the \"early stages\" of trying to bring a Deadpool and X-Men movie to life.As reported by THR, Reynolds' idea for this ensemble film would feature Deadpool, but not as the main character. Instead, he would share the spotlight with three of four other X-Men characters. In fact, it is said Reynolds wants these other characters to take center stage so they can be \"used in unexpected ways.\"This film, which would be separate from the X-Men movie Hunger Games' writer Michael Lesslie is working on, is seemingly on a similar track as Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine. Reynolds is known for working on his ideas on his own for quite some time before pitching them to Marvel, and the early stages of what would become Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine saw the film as a low-budget road trip movie.This also isn't the first time we've heard Ryan Reynolds is working on an \"ensemble\" movie for Deadpool, but this does give us a bit more context as to what type of adventures the Merc With a Mouth may go on. As to which X-Men may be joining Deadpool, that is currently anyone's guess. However, Deadpool is no stranger to working alongside X-Men and has already had some members of the team and their enemies in his films, including Wolverine, Colossus, Sabertooth, Pyro, and even Channing Tatum's Gambit.
