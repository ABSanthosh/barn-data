  "text": "Welcome to the beginning of the end of The Endless.In The Sandman’s first season, Lord Morpheus (Tom Sturridge) escaped from 106 years of captivity and immediately got to work rebuilding his realm and reestablishing his place in the grand cosmology of powerful, god-like entities. So what does Morpheus (AKA Dream) do in season 2? He tears it all back down. In the wildly fantastical and wide-ranging six-episode volume 1 of the second and final season, Dream discovers that the only way to atone for past mistakes is to make some devastating choices. Though the story sometimes feels like it’s rushing to the conclusion that’s coming all too soon, the way this show continues to combine the imagination of old fairy tales with stories about deeply broken characters provides a lot to savor.In season 2, The Sandman develops into a twisted kind of family melodrama as Dream tries to settle some long-standing feuds. In season 1 we met three of the other Endless: the oddly cheery and down-to-earth Death (Kirby Howell-Baptiste), the perpetually miserable Despair (Donna Preston) and the mischievous, manipulative Desire (Mason Alexander Park). Season 2 begins with a family meeting called by the solemn Destiny (Adrian Lester), attended by the flighty youngest sibling Delirium (Esmé Creed-Miles). Absent, as always, is Destruction (Barry Sloane), who abandoned his realm and responsibilities eons ago. These characters are all very different in personality and purpose, and one of the big sources of tension in The Sandman – to its benefit – is the way these various embodiments of human nature struggle to coexist.Volume 1 (which is made up of six of the 12 episodes of season 2) is itself roughly divided into two halves. The first operates – quite well – in maximalist mode, as Dream plays host to a room full of angry gods and other mythological beings. After his old nemesis Lucifer (Gwendoline Christie) simultaneously blesses and curses him, the show swings between dark comedy and grotesque horror as a series of strange and often hideous-looking creatures arrive in Dream’s realm to make their offers and show off The Sandman’s impressive special effects. There’s a poignant side to all this bedlam too, given that this whole underworld adventure begins with an attempt by Dream to rescue an ex lover, Nada (Deborah Oyelade), the first of many old acquaintances he has to make apologies to in these episodes.There’s a poignant side to all this bedlamThis theme continues in the even more emotionally resonant second half of volume 1, as Dream reckons with the ways he has been unintentionally cruel to the people he believed he loves. When Delirium asks him to help her find Destruction, Dream soon realizes that the only way to find his brother may be reconciliation with another family member. This three-episode arc begins as a mystery, but it becomes more of a deep-dive into Dream’s complicated relationships as it progresses.Amid these larger stories the show’s primary writer, Allan Heinberg, boldly weaves in fragments of some of the better-known short stories from the comics, usually inserting them as flashbacks. (Want to see how and why Dream inspired Shakespeare to create A Midsummer Night’s Dream? That’s here in season 2.) Collectively, the six episodes of volume 1 are about Dream’s most significant unfinished business, accumulated over thousands of years of him coexisting with humans and deities. That’s what gives volume 1 its drive: The women he wronged, the creatures he irritated, the family members he disappointed… all of these mortals and immortals now expect Dream to atone. All the while, The Sandman is one of the more visually distinctive TV series on Netflix, with what must’ve been a large chunk of its budget going to creating strange-looking beasties and opulent kingdoms. This first half of season 2 includes a lot of scenes set in Dream’s own magnificent, mercurial castle, which its master can change to suit his moods and whims. Here, the screen is filled with spectacle when a host of supernatural beings – including Norse gods, hideous demons, and angels from the literal Heaven – descend on Dream’s home to make their case for becoming Hell’s new rulers. The images are properly overwhelming, immersing us in a place far removed from the mundane.The images are properly overwhelming, immersing us in a place far removed from the mundane.The frequent flashback sequences include scenes from the French Revolution and ancient Greece, giving a sense of how long the Endless have been meddling in human affairs. Even more than season 1, season 2’s first half is crammed with incidents, as Heinberg and company introduce all of the relevant characters and history that factor into The Sandman’s ending (which will show up on Netflix later this month). It’s effective, though: Fans of the comics may appreciate getting to see live-action versions of all the oddballs and ogres they remember from the page, while people who only know The Sandman from its first season are getting everything they need to understand the plot.The Sandman Season 2 First Look ImagesThe way this story is structured is very intentional on the part of the TV series’s creators, who skip about half of creator, executive producer, and accused sexual assailant Neil Gaiman’s comics in order to streamline all of their events into a tighter story that’s focused almost entirely on a simple arc: Dream’s return, Dream’s rebuild, Dream’s regrets, and Dream’s amends. Nevertheless, it is unusual for a show only in its second season to spend so much time setting up a farewell, given that its first only ran for 11 episodes. Given that the graphic novels have plenty of material that the show could’ve adapted into more episodes, it seems like a lot was left on the table.Sometimes the quickened pace and the abundance of action works well, and sometimes it doesn’t. A point of failure is when The Sandman unreasonably expects us to be deeply invested in some characters – like Nada, or Dream’s chauffeur Wanda (Indya Moore) – who we barely get much of a chance to know. That said, the richness of the world Gaiman created does mean that even the most minor characters – like Destruction’s wryly humorous dog, voiced by Steve Coogan – are uniquely entertaining. Nothing about this show feels bland or generic, so it’s at least making good use of the shortened time it has.As was the case with season 1, season 2 gets a lot of juice from showing how the Endless aren’t that different from us, lifespans aside. These powerful beings also worry that the world is sliding into chaos and mayhem and feel the need to change with the times, however glacially. Amid all the dazzling fantasy trappings, The Sandman effectively hits its emotional moments, especially when it shows how someone like Dream – a shaper of realities – can feel powerless. In one of the more touching moments in volume 1, a man who has been alive for over 12,000 years – since the time of the saber-toothed tiger – is killed in a dumb accident. When Death comes to collect him, she’s not that impressed by his longevity. She says he only lived a lifetime, “no more, no less.” The Sandman is at its best in scenes like these, which weave together the supernatural and the everyday, giving all these scattered stories a point. In this case, it’s the fact that whether you’re one of the Endless or an ordinary human mortal, you have to make the best of the time you have.VerdictNetflix’s lavish adaptation of the beloved comic book series The Sandman follows up a well-crafted season 1 with a first batch of season 2 episodes that feels a bit rushed as it compresses storylines in order to race to an ending. Still, whenever the Dream King and his bickering siblings work to settle old grudges and to make up for past mistakes, the show becomes exciting and moving. Watching Dream journey through multiple realms and eras, earthly and otherwise – while interacting with other supernatural beings who know what it’s like to live for thousands of years – lends some weight to this wildly imaginative fantasy-horror story.In This ArticleThe Sandman Season 2, Volume 1 ReviewgreatThe Sandman’s second and final season begins with six solid episodes, emphasizing the show’s fantastical and mythological side, with stories set in ancient Greece, Shakespearean England, the French Revolution, and the literal Biblical Hell.",
