Confusing nouns aside, the starting segments of the area are fairly linear. The key here is learning enemy patterns, as you'll encounter quite a few new foes while heading east.As a quick note, the walkthrough includes screenshots of map segments after exploring most of them, so don't worry if yours looks different. As mentioned in the intro, there are plenty of optional areas that you can safely skip for now.An overview of the first sprawling area of the Sky-high Tree (Front) region.The eastern path culminates on a lift that takes you underground. Make sure to activate the Miku Sol for a checkpoint, in case you need to backtrack at some point. Once you head to the lower level, you'll come across a strange NPC, who will grant you a useful combat skill.From here, you'll descend down a vertical path and be given two options--heading west, or heading east. If you just want to focus on the main path, which is what we're doing in this guide, head east. There are plenty of enemies here, as well as some new bouncing platforms. For the most part, however, you'll come across enemies you've already met in the starting area.Once you're on the western corner of the map, it's time to head upwards. We'll be using the Miku Sol checkpoint as a reference point. From it, follow the bouncing platforms while either killing or dodging the flying bugs and the flowers along the way. Once you reach the top, you'll once again have two paths to choose from. If you look at the map, the western path leads you straight to the beginning, where the lift is located. You can take down the barrier to create a shortcut and use the checkpoint again. Then, head back down from where you just came and take the other path.The eastern path will lead you through narrow tunnels filled with spiky enemies. Move slowly, taking them down one by one, and keep making your way up. Then, you'll get access to another D-Line, which turns you into the classic Pac-Man ball. The path is quite linear from here. Right at the end, you'll see a path to the right. Make sure to take it instead of going left to an optional area.Make sure to use the door to get to the back of the Sky-high Tree, which takes you to the lifts.From here, you'll see a door that prompts you to enter. Do so, and you'll be taken to the back area of the Sky-high tree. It's a fairly straightforward path, as you only have to use two lifts to get all the way up. One of them isn't accessible as of yet, and while there's a path that leads to the right side of the vertical area, you can ignore it for now.When in doubt, stick to the D-Line.At the top, activate the Miku Sol checkpoint. You'll now be in the Verdant Shadow Path. Head all the way east following the D-Line, and prepare for some acrobatics as you move upwards. The D-Line will pretty much set the path forward, so just stick with it until you're back outside. This is a larger area with quite a few enemies around, so take your steps slowly to avoid getting hit and falling. At the very top, the main path is to the left, but there's a checkpoint to the right that you should definitely pick up.Now, the key is to head to the left. The path is fairly linear, but there is an optional route that will take you upwards, albeit only momentarily, so you can go ahead and ignore it. Shortly after, you'll be back outside. Follow the paths until you start encountering the wooden structures, and make your way through them. The key here is to use the large vines for traversal up until you're in the eastern area. From there, just drop to the ground and continue moving to the left.The starting path toward the top of the Sky-high Tree.Use the vines again to get to a long wooden structure with a gap in the middle. Then, jump to the right side, and tackle any enemies you come across. This path leads you to another Miku Sol checkpoint, which you'll definitely need. This path is explained in detail in a separate guide, as there's a boss fight that leads to a second HP-Tank. In short, keep heading east and prepare for a boss encounter.After you're done, use the vine on the right side of the structure to get all the way to the top. Now, it's time to head to the very western corner of the area. Make sure to plan your jumps accordingly so you don't fall. You'll eventually come across an enemy gauntlet, which indicates that you're on the right path. After you're done, use the structures to move upwards, which will take you to the upper area.Use the vines as visual references to continue moving upwards.Thankfully, it's fairly straightforward from here. There's only one path to the right--if you come across a gargyole, which only seems to appear during the night, you can ignore it. Then, you'll come across Night Gale, which is a massive creature and a boss fight you'll have to deal with shortly.Night Gale is, actually, quite a straightforward fight. You got this.First, however, activate the Miku Sol checkpoint. Whenever you're ready, fight against Night Gale, who will reward you with the ability to dodge while in mid-air. With this, you can now follow the path to the right of the checkpoint.After the Night Gale fight, head to the right and follow the new path downwards.From there, use your new ability to avoid the spikes and grab the vines along the way as you head downwards. You'll then enter a similar area underneath. Once at the bottom, head all the way to the right, and you'll be greeted by the Torn Lands. Congrats on getting through the Sky-high Tree area!
