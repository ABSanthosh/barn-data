  "text": "For the first time ever, step into the wonderful world of Moomins on Xbox and Windows in Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley! The game is a story-rich musical adventure game for all ages about Snufkin restoring the valley and helping the quirky and memorable characters and critters who call it home. A series of hideous parks have cropped up in Moominvalley, disrupting the landscape and its harmonious nature. As Snufkin, you will distract police officers, pull out signs, and knock over misplaced statues as you vigorously try to restore nature and the inhabitants’ home while putting an end to the industrious Park Keeper’s plans. About the Moomins The Moomins, a series of charming and quirky characters, were created by the cherished illustrator and author Tove Jansson in 1945. Tove Jansson is recognised as possibly one of the most successful Finnish artists of all time and the Moomins started off in a series of books and a novel in Finland and then became known globally through a series of cartoon strips – some might recognise the books “Finn Family Moomintroll” or “Comet in Moominland”. Tove Jansson’s niece Sophia Jansson has explained that “the Moomin stories are essentially about the things that are the most important to anyone living anywhere – things like love, tolerance, respect, being part of a family, and belonging. Those things are the same no matter where you’re from, what your gender, race, religion, or sexuality.” Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley is a nostalgic yet innovative indie game that’s quintessentially Nordic, with an originally written story based on the original works, including the emotions and a melancholic atmosphere that Tove Jansson is famous for creating. Our world draws heavily on Tove’s excellent watercolor illustrations and adapts it to a video game setting to create a rich and beautiful environment for our players to discover. The game style takes a cue from traditional watercolor and painting techniques, and rather than adhering to them strictly, we’re creating something attuned to the medium to account for the large volume of content. We hope you will have a fantastic time in our story-book-come-to-life experience, and meet both new and old friends – You can pick up Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley on Xbox and Windows PC today.
