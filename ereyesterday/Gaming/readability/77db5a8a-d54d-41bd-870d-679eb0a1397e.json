This product is also sotcked in a US warehouse, so it ships free and arrives within about a week. This is a genuine Sony product, however keep in mind that this is probably an import model with a warranty that won't be honored in the United States. AliExpress makes up for it with a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days. The WH-1000XM5 is considered by many to be the best noise cancelling headphones under $400 and on par with the Bose QuietComfort Ultra and AirPods Max.Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise Cancelling Headphones for $221In our glowing Sony WH1000XM5 review, Kevin Lee wrote that \"The Sony WH-1000XM5 is hands down the best sounding and most impressive noise-canceling headphones around. They demand a high premium but the cost of audio excellence is well worth it with this pair of headphones.\"The prior generation Sony XM4 was already an outstanding headphone, but the XM5 features key improvements in noise cancellation and comfort. The XM5 has been fitted with a second processor and double the microphone count dedicated to filtering out ambient noise. The earcups have also been redesigned so that they fit more snugly on the ear, thus creating a better seal and as a result, more effective passive noise isolation. The noise cancelling is noticeably better than the XM4 and pretty much any other noise cancelling headset in its price range.The Sony WH-1000XM5 has also been updated with a noticeably sleeker redesign with a different style of headband adjustment. The band is wider than before for better weight distribution and the earcup padding is now made of a luxurious synthetic leather material that's softer and more comfortable. You can easily wear these headphones for hours. One small drawback, however, is that the XM5 can no longer be folded inward, only swivelled, so it's less compact.The Sony WH-1000XM5 retains the XM4's excellent battery life at over 30 hours on a single charge even with ANC activated. The XM5 also supports fast charging over USB Type-C. Best of all, at this price, the XM5 is considerably less expensive than its competitors like the Bose QuietComfort Ultra and the AirPods Max. If you're already in the market for a premium noise cancelling headphone, you should jump on this deal.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
