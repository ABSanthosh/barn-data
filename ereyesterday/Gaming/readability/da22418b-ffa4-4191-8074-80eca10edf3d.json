  "text": "Stealth Crossword needs you to help guide covert letter operatives into the correct puzzle positions to prevent international incidents. While I’m not especially into crossword puzzles, something about adding a touch of espionage makes the prospect of figuring out words a lot more interesting. In this game, you have access to all of the letters you may need to solve a puzzle. All you need to do is type a key and that corresponding letter will pop up in the various metallic underground bases you’ll be sneaking your way through. Once your letter appears, you’ll have to dodge the various letter guards (you can see their cone of vision flitting back and forth) to make your way to the right spot in each crossword puzzle. Solve all of them to move on to the next step in your mission. The game feels pretty straightforward at first. I managed to figure out the first stage without looking at most of the clues (which were conveniently laid out right on-screen). However, things get more complicated as you progress through each area, requiring you find computers with hidden information or locate other sources of intel that will help you figure out the right word to solve each puzzle. As you do so, an overarching plot starts to take shape over the course of the game as well. It’s not especially serious given the nature of the game, adding more fun to this already silly concept. Stealth Crossword is a delightfully clever take on crosswords that injects a little bit of tension and complexity to the mix. Having to sneak about without getting caught and find information that will help you figure out the clues makes the game a bit more playfully demanding than most crosswords, creating something fun and funny in the process. Stealth Crossword is available now (for free) on itch.io.
