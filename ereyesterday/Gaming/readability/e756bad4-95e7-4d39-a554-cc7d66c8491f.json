  "text": "Welcome to the world of MindsEye! We’re proud to give you a first look at our gameplay and cinematic trailers, both unveiled during State of Play.  MindsEye is our narrative-driven, single-player action-adventure thriller set in the not-too-distant future, in the fictional desert city of Redrock, where artificial intelligence and human greed collide to bring Earth to the precipice of collapse. It’s a compelling story, with strategic combat, high-octane driving, and endless entertainment. Our team at Build A Rocket Boy has worked passionately to create a game that will deliver players an exceptional experience this year. Introducing Jacob Diaz At the heart of MindsEye is Jacob Diaz, a former soldier who finds himself haunted by flashbacks of a covert mission that changed his life forever. Fitted with the mysterious neural implant, known as the MindsEye, Jacob is plagued by fragmented memories and is desperate to uncover the truth about his past. Jacob arrives in Redrock hoping to discover more about the company responsible for creating his implant. His quest for answers starts as a personal journey, but it quickly evolves into something much larger. Jacob isn’t the only one searching for the truth – and the forces working in the shadows may be more powerful and dangerous than he ever imagined. Along the way, he’ll meet a cast of supporting characters, each with their own motivations, secrets, and impact on his story. Some will help him; others may betray him. This emotional, action-packed story comes to life through incredibly detailed in-game cinematics, allowing you to see every nuance of Jacob’s emotions. A world shaped by technology and power Redrock is the backdrop of MindsEye, where advanced technology is now an inescapable part of daily life. AI, robotics, and neural implants have reshaped society, bringing both new opportunities and risks. As you progress through the story, you’ll see how technology has transformed the everyday life of its citizens. Automated systems manage many aspects of the city, and the lines between corporate power and government control have blurred – raising important questions about who’s really in charge. This world isn’t just a backdrop. It’s filled with stories, perspectives, and hidden truths waiting to be uncovered. As you progress, you’ll learn how to adapt and use these new technologies in your missions. Strategic combat and high-octane driving  MindsEye takes you into intense encounters – on foot, behind the wheel, and in the air – where every decision can mean the difference between survival and defeat. As Jacob Diaz, you’ll face a variety of enemies with distinct tactics and behaviors. To keep the advantage, you’ll need to think fast and use your surroundings to outmaneuver your opponents. Take cover, find the right vantage points, and turn environmental elements into tools to survive – whether it’s a well-timed gas canister explosion or using enemy weapons to your advantage.  Your enemies won’t hold back, working together to flush you out of cover, flank your position, or swarm you with sheer numbers. The combat system is designed to be fluid, dynamic, and rewarding for players who adapt their approach to each encounter. To even the odds, you can activate your companion drone to support as you progress through missions. But combat is only part of the action. MindsEye also delivers exhilarating high-speed chases that punctuate Jacob’s journey, pushing his driving skills to the limit. These sequences take you through diverse environments – from bustling cityscapes to remote industrial sites, trailer parks and deserts – immersing you in a world that feels alive and constantly in motion. Coming this year Without giving away too much more, the team at Build A Rocket Boy is buzzing with excitement about our game and we can’t wait to share it with you in Summer 2025!  MindsEye can be added today to your Wishlist on PlayStation 5, and this is just the beginning. We’ve got plenty more to reveal in the months ahead, so stay tuned for updates. Trending Stories",
