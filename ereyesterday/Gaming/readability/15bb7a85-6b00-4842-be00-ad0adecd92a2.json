  "text": "Mars Attracts combines the Mars Attacks IP with Rollercoaster Tycoon to create a very strange and captivating zoo management game. When I tried this at The Mix, I found it was a pretty interesting idea. Aliens want to capture people from different time periods and put them into a zoo for other aliens to look at. To make this more of a fulfilling attraction, aliens also can do experiments on the humans to see if they would make good rides. The feel of Mars Attracts is very much like any other zoo management style game. You can design your park, research new rides and attractions, hire different people to work jobs, see if aliens visiting are happy, etc.. There are a lot of different items to place and choose from, as well as tons of freedom when it comes to where you want to put stuff. You do need to place things like septic systems to plug into toilets and the like, making the game pretty in-depth when it comes to management. The unique parts of Mars Attracts is both the use of the IP and the fun experiments that you can do on your people. The humans that you collect are from different places at specific time periods. Instead of having different types of animals or monsters, this is what divides them. You can make their new zoo homes like where they came from so that they feel most at home. Inside each of their pens, you can also put research labs which can contain aliens that will do research and experiments on the people inside. These aren’t the most human at all, but the other aliens seem to really like watching and seeing exactly what happens! It’s also quite interesting to watch the animations and see what sort of rides they want to turn humans into. Mars Attracts is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can grab a demo from Steam and add it to your wishlist.
