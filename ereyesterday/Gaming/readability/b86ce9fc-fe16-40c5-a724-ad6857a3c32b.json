  "text": "IKEELYA sees you guiding sniper shots for money and then turning your financial gains into snappy designs for your apartment. Barry is an assassin, but he’s not really in love with his job. He’s honestly a bit miserable with his life. Now, his true passion seems to be interior design. He’s just moved to a new neighborhood and his barren apartment is getting him down. You can cheer him up by buying furniture and decorative items for his place, and the nicer things look, the better his mood gets. The thing is, Barry is only really good at making money by killing people, leading back into his miserable job to keep himself happy. The game, therefore, plays across two separate ways. In the sniping sections, you will be given a snapshot of the person you’re looking for. You’ll then have to pore over a live section of the city looking for the person in the picture so you can shoot them. If you do this well (shooting a lot of extra people is a bad idea), you’ll get paid better. This money can then be used in the apartment-decorating section. You can buy different pieces of furniture and items for your place to spruce it up. As I said, the nicer you decorate the place, the better Barry’s mood gets. If you do really well, you might even start desiging places for your neighbors. Just cross your fingers they don’t ask where the money comes from. IKEELYA is an interesting combination of genres I rarely see together while also forming a sharp criticism of the things we are willing to do for work so long as it gives us the money to be “happy” or to buy things. Doesn’t hurt that both gameplay modes in the game are a lot of fun, too. IKEELYA is available now (for whatever you wish to pay for it) on itch.io.
