  "text": "AbleGamers founder Mark Barlet denies claims. Image credit: AbleGamers Mark Barlet, founder of high-profile gaming accessibility charity AbleGamers, has been accused of fostering abuse at the non-profit for more than two decades. In a wide-ranging report published today by IGN, former colleagues claim Barlet used sexist, racist and misogynistic language in the workplace, including about other employees, and made comments offensive to other disabled people. One source claimed Barlet repeatedly referred to her as the company's HR representative, as she was the only woman in the business. The source claimed Barlet would then also make offensive remarks regarding her breasts in front of colleagues. Barlet, who left the charity last September following an investigation by an external law firm, denies all claims of abuse and harassment. \"After thoroughly being investigated by an independent third-party, it was determined that none of that was true,\" Barlet said in a statement. Other claims involve wasteful spending of the charity's funds by Barlet, involving first class air travel and extended hotel stays following business trips, and an expensive office charger for his Tesla. In response, Barlet said his travel was justified by company policies, his extended trips were to cover additional business meetings, and his Tesla charger was just a \"plug\". Regardless, it's claimed that an April 2024 investigation by external payroll and HR firm ADP advised AbleGamers' board to part ways with Barlet, after concerns over his spending. This advice was reportedly ignored, prompting multiple employees to file Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaints, prompting the latter invesigation that did then result in Barlet leaving the charity in September 2024 - albeit reportedly with a severance package. Since his departure, Barlet has started a new accessibility firm, AccessForge, while employees who spoke out about him claim they were subsequently forced out of AbleGamers by its board in retaliation. Meanwhile, employees still at AbleGamers claim they have been repeatedly dissuaded from sharing their experiences for IGN's report. It's alleged that the charity's Steven Spohn has told staff not to speak out, for fear of \"ruining the charity's reputation\". Neither Spohn or AbleGamers responded to IGN's requests for comment.",
