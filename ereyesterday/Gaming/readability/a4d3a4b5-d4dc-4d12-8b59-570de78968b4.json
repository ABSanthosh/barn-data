The EVE Online 2025 Roadmap Certainly for a new game, still growing and adding features and discovering its core audience, you might expect more.  A lot more. But for a title that is going to turn 22 this coming May?  A title that has perhaps seen its peak already and is now catering to an aging and slowly receding population?  A title from a company that has clearly puts its priorities into other titles?  Maybe predictable is good. I mean, all I ask from EverQuest is a few holidays and a Q4 expansion.  Why should I ask for more from EVE Online? So here is what we got, listed out in the now established pattern: Q1 – Update to the Winter expansion Q2 – Summer Expansion Q2 – EVE Fanfest Q2 – Capsuleer Day Event Q3 – Alliance Tournament Feeder Matches Q3 – Update to the Summer expansion Q4 – Winter Expansion Q4 – Alliance Tournament Q4 – Crimson Harvest Event Q4 – Winter Nexus Event Those are now the key milestones for any year, the other events that used to appear having all been relegated to promotional frames for sales on various items in the web and in-game store. If you had asked me to write a roadmap in advance for them, I would have written exactly the above.  In fact, one wag on Reddit predicted the 2026 roadmap and, as I commented on that post, no lies detected. EVE Online 2026 Roadmap Prediction You could copy and paste my list from above and it would match. In addition to my question above about whether or not I should just feel good that the same old plan will be rolling along for a soon to be 22 year old title, I will add that the whole thing is better than the 2024 roadmap which had a heavy focus on EVE Vanguard, The wee 2024 roadmap This announcement was accompanied by a Twitch stream and a press release. The stream is available to watch on YouTube now. I realize that the game leadership are not professional video personalities, but the lack of energy by the trio being interviewed seemed to tax even CCP Swift’s legendary enthusiasm.   CCP Berger felt the most engaged, only hampered by his need to express himself in English, which he does well, but always with a care that causes him to feel a bit wooden.  And the other two… I don’t know, maybe it was the half-asleep posture on the interview couch influencing my reaction… as somebody quipped, they looked like the “chair men of the bored.”  Then again, I don’t think I have ever seen CCP Rattati enthuse about anything in New Eden that wasn’t a first person shooter. All of which was not helped by the usual need for self-congratulation that permeates any senior member of CCP speaking, as if they feel they have to remind everybody how great everything is rather than feeling they could assume it was generally understood.  2024 was a great year and 2025 will be even better.   But at least they trotted out the Great Migration graphic again, something they haven’t posted anywhere or included in a new item, which assesses the re-arrangement of the Imperium including the Goonswarm Federation move from Delve to Tenerifis. The Great Migration Graphic Otherwise they did meander for a full hour, dropping the occasional bit of information here and there, but not much worth writing home about. The press release was more direct, if still vague, speaking of more was to customize sovereign space, more corporation goals, and an upcoming Freelance Project system, which is being spun as a player content generation tool but which I suspect is going to be more like a cross between corporation goals and the contract system.  The mention of responding to player feedback was amusing if you watched the Twitch stream chat where any number of players expressed opinions about content that went unremarked. Anyway, we won’t know what Freelance Projects really are until we get the dev blog… or, given how things went in 2024, until we get the patch notes when the feature has been pushed to production. Anyway, that is the roadmap CCP has for us for EVE Online in 2025.

here and there, but not much worth writing home about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe press release was more direct, if still vague, speaking of more was to customize sovereign space, more corporation goals, and an upcoming Freelance Project system, which is being spun as a player content generation tool but which I suspect is going to be more like a cross between corporation goals and the contract system.  The mention of responding to player feedback was amusing if you watched the Twitch stream chat where any number of players expressed opinions about content that went unremarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, we won’t know what Freelance Projects really are until we get the dev blog… or, given how things went in 2024, until we get the patch notes when the feature has been pushed to production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, that is the roadmap CCP has for us for \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e in
