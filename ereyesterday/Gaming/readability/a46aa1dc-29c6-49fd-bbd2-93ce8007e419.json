  "text": "Image credit: HP Just hours after we shared a huge deal on the HP Omen 45L with an RTX 4090, the manufacturer surprised us again with another deal that’s not likely to last long. Over on its official store, HP is offering a whopping 32% off a build-to-order PC with an NVIDIA RTX 4080 Super GPU and much, much more. That brings it from $2,180 down to $1,464 when using a handy voucher code. And, there’s even a 5070 Ti option, too. Here’s how to get yourself the savings. Save big on an RTX 4080 Super rig To get this deal, you’ll need to click ‘Customize and Buy’, and select the following options: the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super (with 16GB GDDR6X dedicated), Kingston Fury 32GB DDR5 (2 x 16GB) for RAM, and an 850W 80 Plus Gold Certified ATX power supply. Not only does that handily mean I don’t have to mention those in the specs, but that’s not all that’s of interest for PC gamers on the hunt for a new rig. This build also includes an Intel Core i5 (which, we acknowledge, isn’t the newest kid on the block by some measure) but it has a 512GB SSD and an aRGB air cooler, too, and we’re quite keen on the sleek case design, too. Once you’ve added everything to your basket, you’ll need the voucher code ‘LEVELUP20’ to slice an extra 20% off of the price. If you’re looking for a 50-series build, great news: You can grab a discount on one of those, too. Doing so will get you an RTX 5070 Ti rig for $1,648, a saving of 30% from the $2,370 it would cost normally. While you can experiment with build-to-order options all day long, we’d recommend picking the 5070 Ti (16GB GDDR7 dedicated) option, an Intel Core i7-14700F, and a black metal chassis with an 850W 80 Plus Gold certified ATX power supply. Doing so, and then dropping in that magic ‘LEVELUP20’ discount code, will net you that final price of $1,648 with free shipping.",
