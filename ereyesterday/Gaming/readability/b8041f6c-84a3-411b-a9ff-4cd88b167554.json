  "text": "\"This is needlessly convoluted.\" Image credit: Eurogamer/Nintendo Physical copies of OG Switch games upgraded for Nintendo Switch 2, like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Metroid Prime 4, will seemingly ship with original Switch 1 cartridges. That's according to a Nintendo support representative in the UK, who reportedly confirmed in writing that the Switch 2 \"enhanced\" editions themselves will have to be downloaded separately via \"download codes\" and then applied to the original version on the cart.

Nintendo Switch 2 Hands-On Preview: Mario Kart World Impressions \u0026 More!Watch on YouTube Whilst the exact question posed to the customer rep is not provided, Does It Play on X/Twitter tweeted an image of an email response allegedly taken from a customer services conversation that reportedly stated: \"Yes, we can confirm that the upgrades will be download codes. Thank you for your understanding\". According to a Nintendo UK Support Rep, Switch 2 Editions of physical games like Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Metroid Prime 4 contain a download code for the upgrade pack along with a Switch 1 version cart of the game https://t.co/SK5uo4Thyf pic.twitter.com/vRhUnxTvIX— Wario64 (@Wario64) April 5, 2025 As Wario64 rightly points out, this wouldn't be the first time a customer service rep unwittingly gave out inaccurate information - so we've reached out to Nintendo for confirmation - and there's nothing on the box art we've seen thus far that suggests a separate download is required. \"And it's weird they would be codes when Nintendo is pivoting to game key carts instead of download codes of retail games,\" Wario64 added. \"I know game key carts are different, I'm highlighting it because it shows Nintendo is offering that solution instead of download codes for Switch 2 games, so offering a code for the upgrade pack doesn't make sense (they could put the upgrade pack as a license on the cart).\" As a commenter points out, it all feels \"needlessly convoluted\", although others suggest it's \"part of the plan\". \"Pretty simple. If you resell the Switch 2 key cart, then the new person will have to purchase the upgrade pack. More money for Nintendo. Sounds like part of the plan,\" opined one. We'll try and clear things up as/when Nintendo comes back to us. ICYMI, Stateside Nintendo fans will have to wait a little bit longer before they can pre-order a Switch 2 after Nintendo of American confirmed that US preorders - which were scheduled to go live on 9th April - will now be delayed \"in order to assess the potential impact of [President Trump's] tariffs and evolving market conditions\". Eurogamer has confirmed with Nintendo that there are no current plans to adjust the ongoing pre-order process here in the UK. For more on the upcoming console, here's everything announced at the Switch 2 Direct, including pricing, games, and more.",
