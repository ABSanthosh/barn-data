  "description": "After a decade of anticipation from Dragon Age fans, the most-recent sequel, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, arrived last fall and was promptly labeled a disappointment by EA. Despite Dragon Age: Inquisition winning several game of the year awards 10 years earlier, The Veilguard simply wasn't as well-received among fans. Now, a new report is shedding light on The Veilguard's troubled development and why it failed.Bloomberg has offered a comprehensive look back at Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but perhaps the most surprising thing is how much of the story was already known. One of the most common refrains in the report is that BioWare was hamstrung by the initial plans to make The Veilguard a live-service title. Even switching back to a single-player game didn't allow the team to recapture the fully-realized stories and options that the previous titles had.The report also appears to confirm the account of former Dragon Age series lead writer David Gaider, who previously spoke about tension between the Dragon Age and Mass Effect teams at BioWare.
