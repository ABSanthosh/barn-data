  "text": "Last week CCP launched EVE: Galaxy Conquest, their so-called 4x mobile title. Certainly some EVE ships in there… Believe me, I want a New Eden based 4X conquest game… in the mold of Civilization or Stellaris or Masters of Orion.  I wrote in a Blog Banter about the potential for a Diplomacy knock-off set in EVE Online.  Hell, I’d even like a version of Sim City or RimWorld or Crusader Kings 3 in the setting of our favorite “love to read about it even if I hate to play it” space MMORPG. The size and scope and lore and player history of the game… books have been written about what the players have been up to… seems to beg for a meta version that allows you to slip into the role of SirMolle or Progodlegend or Vily or Norus, or Karttoon, or Gobbins, or Darius JOHNSON, or… dare I invoke him… The Mittani.  Don’t you want to be Asher Elias for at least a bit and command the forces of the Imperium? I mean, I just look at this Rixx Javix map and pine for a strategic game to occupy it. New Eden done Rixx Javix style Think of all the possibilities, the range of victory conditions for campaigns or scenarios?  You have achieved maximum “made you form” and have been able to claim the “won the ISK war” prize! How is this not already a thing?  How has there not been a licensing deal between Pearl Abyss and Paradox to make this?  (Oh yeah, the same reason as always, EVE Online isn’t at all popular in the wider scope of gaming so there is no money in that idea.) I feel like the one true message of the world is that we cannot have nice things. Anyway, when CCP announced EVE Galaxy Conquest, I had some serious hope that maybe, just maybe, we might get something in that vein.  I mean, the fact that the game was planned for iOS and Android was kind of a big red flag warning me not to put to much hope into the outcome… but still, somewhere deep in my heart I felt that CCP couldn’t fuck this up completely… could they? But no, any faith I had in CCP was misplaced.  Instead of New Eden Stellaris or Civilization or Crusader Kings, what we have here is a rip-off of the mobile app meta to such an extent that I just want to call it Clash of Clones. I mean, there are recognizable bits of New Eden in the game, but to say it abuses the lore like a rented mule would strike terror into the remaining population of mules up for rent, as they beat the lore into whatever shape they needed it to be with complete disregard for its health or well being. I put about three hours into the game before I started writing this (and a bit more as I did), so let me step through my experience. The game opens up by telling you that somehow Palpatine returned… wait, no, that was a different travesty… that somehow all the pirate factions got together and kicked the four empires out of the core of their space.  Now, banished to the periphery of New Eden, the empires are out recruiting rando passers by on street corners to form up and help them retake that space from the pirates. So you have been invited… in some general way… and get to choose which empire you will represent… unless all the good empires are taken and you’re stuck joining Amarr, as happened to me. You’re not going to get weird about the slave and religion thing, are you? Whatever server I was tossed onto… I wasn’t given a choice… only had space for Amarr.  Fine, I’ve been around for more than 18 years, I know the lore, I can play Amarr.  Armor tanks and lasers, pew pew pew! So I jump in and I have a little base and am introduced to my first minion whose name is Paladin Crusader, which is either the worst RNG name pick ever or somebody has a huge appreciation for the work of Douglas Adams. I was told this name would fit in But at least his name was made up of Amarr ship names, so that gave me some hope.  And then we created our first fleet and it was based on the Crow, a Caldari hull, and it became clear that the lore was not going to get in the way of anything going on. Honestly, this is just another situation in life where I was hindered rather than helped by being in any sort of possession of knowledge of the source material. After which I spent the new couple of hours just doing what the game told me to.  You need to upgrade this function to level 1, that will take 55 seconds.  You need to upgrade this other thing to level 2, which will take 2 minutes and 40 seconds.  Hey, this other thing needs to be level 3 now, that will take 10 minutes. This carried on and I got rewards and was handed resources which enabled me to keep upgrading this or doing that, all without any understanding of what was going on aside from the occasional point when I got ahead of the timers and found that I couldn’t do something because some ten minute upgrade had not yet completed. I got a new fleet commander and a new ship type… this time the Minmatar Bellicose.  I now have five different ship types and none of them are Amarr.  iIn fact, one is a Cruor, which is a Blood Raiders pirate faction ship.   I also picked up a secondary commander and the ability to set fleet formations. Time for promotions all around Fleet formations are a kind of rock, paper, scissors setup where each is strong against one and weak against another which affords a damage benefit. Fleet formations illustrated I guess they decided four was better than three because you would get the occasional wash… or maybe it was just more space efficient to have four options in the UI. Anyway, I had an offer to get an Amarr ship… if I spent some money. It is just 99 cents for a legendary dude! I opted just to carry on following instructions before I purchased anything.  There were a lot of things to do in the busy UI of the game. Next up, defeat some Guristas There was a lot of just tapping on things and plenty of winning… also, somewhere along the line I figured out how to change my display name from the default to something close to my usual name… though there was a 15 character limit, so I had to drop a vowel. Wilhelm Arcturs victorious or something I also started looking around the neighborhood.  A few people seemed to have picked a name as well, though a lot more were obviously just the default new commander name with a number string after it in their own language. A very international game! Meanwhile for me it was tapping and timers… and the game started pointing out to me that it had given me a few freebies to speed up those wait times and if I ran out of those, well there were more to be had in the cash shop. Somebody threw me a corp invite and I accepted it because… of course there was a task to complete that included joining a corp.  More rewards.  I started looking around, zooming out the map further, until I got the lay of the land for the game. The Galaxy Conquest map I am down there in Domain, the little greed dot.  In this vision of New Eden the periphery is high security, as that is where the empires retreated I guess, while the middle, where Jita is located, is null security.  Interesting that they chose to use the term “null sec” there, given that is EVE Online jargon, like 0.0, which often has to be explained to people.  I guess in the continuum of high and low, null is kind of obviously below low, but still. I won’t ask how Jita is doing in the middle of null sec.  Probably a lot more ships being blown up. But it was becoming more and more clear that not only was this game not EVE Online, or aimed at anybody who plays EVE Online, it was also not anything like a 4X style of game that would interest me. Instead it is just a hamster wheel tap fest with lots of cool down timers that you can pay to get around.  And the whole timer thing gets ramped up after you have been in the game for a certain amount of time. The Starter Bonus Zone I was in the “starter bonus” end of the game.  Once I got past the 72 hour mark all those timers would jump up considerably… and they were already getting up into the 15-20 minute range. Meanwhile, I really had no feeling that I was accomplishing anything and really wasn’t having much fun… and for somebody who has played MMORPGs for 25 years, so is clearly obsessed with “making numbers go up,” being unable to even tap into that aspect is an issue. There is probably a market for a game like this.  I mean, there was apparently a market for EVE Echoes, and that wasn’t any fun for me either. The upside is that it is free and does scale up to tablet sizes rather than just being a phone app that you can 2x bump to sort of fit your iPad screen… and it does try to be an EVE Online game. The downside is that the whole thing is a mish-mash of random bits of EVE Online laid over what feels like a pretty generic mobile title with all the usual aspects of such games… not that I am an expert in any way, but in my minor experience this outing is trying to fit into the mold of successful titles in the field through imitation and a thin veneer of story. I guess I hope it does well, if only because I wonder how many failures CCP can sustain at this point.  In a world where the company is all in on making an EVE Online based first person shooter… again… and an EVE Online knock-off crypto blockchain bullshit scam… again, in a world where EVE Online isn’t a popular franchise by any stretch of the imagination… at least success here seems remotely possible. Addendum: I played some more off and on over the weekend after I wrote this.  My corp changed leadership daily as whoever was the current leader failed to log in.  I also leveled up my base to the point where my new player bonus time started to run down while I was no longer logged in, so that is all gone now and wait times for everything are much longer. But most annoying is that my little base ended up hemmed in by other bases that were all fairly close so being able to do things like take a grid point of a certain level became very difficult to achieve because there simply were not options within range.  So if I wanted to do things to advance to the point where maybe I felt like I was doing something in the game that was helping me advance I was blocked.  I mean, I could always spend money to advance… but that is what these games are designed to drive you towards and, frankly, I was not invested enough in the game to hook up my credit card and start spending.

And then we created our first fleet and it was based on the Crow, a Caldari hull, and it became clear that the lore was not going to get in the way of anything going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly, this is just another situation in life where I was hindered rather than helped by being in any sort of possession of knowledge of the source material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter which I spent the new couple of hours just doing what the game told me to.  You need to upgrade this function to level 1, that will take 55 seconds.  You need to upgrade this other thing to level 2, which will take 2 minutes and 40 seconds.  Hey, this other thing needs to be level 3 now, that will take 10 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis carried on and I got rewards and was handed resources which enabled me to keep upgrading this or doing that, all without any understanding of what was going on aside from the occasional point when I got ahead of the timers and found that I couldn’t do something because some ten minute upgrade had not yet completed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got a new fleet commander and a new ship type… this time the Minmatar Bellicose.  I now have five different ship types and none of them are Amarr.  iIn fact, one is a Cruor, which is a Blood Raiders pirate faction ship.   I also picked up a secondary commander and the ability to set fleet formations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_124387\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

accepted it because… of course there was a task to complete that included joining a corp.  More rewards.  I started looking around, zooming out the map further, until I got the lay of the land for the

high security, as that is where the empires retreated I guess, while the middle, where Jita is located, is null security.  Interesting that they chose to use the term “null sec” there, given that is EVE Online jargon, like 0.0, which often has to be explained to people.  I guess in the continuum of high and low, null is kind of obviously below low, but still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won’t ask how Jita is doing in the middle of null sec.  Probably a lot more ships being blown up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was becoming more and more clear that not only was this game not \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e, or aimed at anybody who plays \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e, it was also not anything like a 4X style of game that would interest me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead it is just a hamster wheel tap fest with lots of cool down timers that you can pay to get around.  And the whole timer thing gets ramped up after you have been in the game for a certain amount of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_124406\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

id=\"caption-attachment-124406\"\u003eThe Starter Bonus Zone\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in the “starter bonus” end of the game.  Once I got past the 72 hour mark all those timers would jump up considerably… and they were already getting up into the 15-20 minute range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, I really had no feeling that I was accomplishing anything and really wasn’t having much fun… and for somebody who has played MMORPGs for 25 years, so is clearly obsessed with “making numbers go up,” being unable to even tap into that aspect is an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is probably a market for a game like this.  I mean, there was apparently a market for \u003cem\u003eEVE Echoes\u003c/em\u003e, and that wasn’t any fun for me either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe upside is that it is free and does scale up to tablet sizes rather than just being a phone app that you can 2x bump to sort of fit your iPad screen… and it does try to be an \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe downside is that the whole thing is a mish-mash of random bits of \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e laid over what feels like a pretty generic mobile title with all the usual aspects of such games… not that I am an expert in any way, but in my minor experience this outing is trying to fit into the mold of successful titles in the field through imitation and a thin veneer of story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I hope it does well, if only because I wonder how many failures CCP can sustain at this point.  In a world where the company is all in on making an \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e based first person shooter… again… and an E\u003cem\u003eVE Online\u003c/em\u003e knock-off crypto blockchain bullshit scam… again, in a world where \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e isn’t a popular franchise by any stretch of the imagination… at least success here seems remotely possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAddendum\u003c/strong\u003e: I played some more off and on over the weekend after I wrote this.  My corp changed leadership daily as whoever was the current leader failed to log in.  I also leveled up my base to the point where my new player bonus time started to run down while I was no longer logged in, so that is all gone now and wait times for everything are much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut most annoying is that my little base ended up hemmed in by other bases that were all fairly close so being able to do things like take a grid point of a certain level became very difficult to achieve because there simply were not options within range.  So if I wanted to do things to advance to the point where maybe I felt like I was doing something in the game that was helping me advance I was blocked.  I mean, I could always spend money to advance… but that is what these games are designed to drive you towards and, frankly, I was not invested enough in the game to hook up my credit card and start spending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCCP – \u003ca
