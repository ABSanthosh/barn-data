  "text": "Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Agatha All Along Episode 6, “Familiar by Thy Side.” Agatha All Along‘s latest installment prominently features Billy Maximoff/William Kaplan’s boyfriend Eddie – but is “Eddie” really another, major Marvel character? Did Agatha All Along just low-key introduce Hulkling to the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Who Is Hulkling in Marvel Comics Canon? Created by writer-artist team Allan Heinberg and Jim Cheung for the mid-2000s Young Avengers series, Hulkling is the superhero alter-ego of Theodore “Teddy” Altman. Despite his name, he’s not actually a “true” member of the Hulk family; instead, he’s a Kree-Skrull hybrid. Thanks to this unique heritage, Hulkling is an accomplished shapeshifter – imitating a teenaged version of Hulk is just a fraction of what he’s capable of – as well as being superhumanly strong and tough. Related: Agatha All Along: What Happened to Wanda’s Other Son? But Teddy’s extra-terrestrial origins and impressive powerset aren’t what he’s best known for. That honor belongs to his romance with another Young Avenger, Billy Kaplan/Wiccan. Together, the pair are arguably Marvel’s most high-profile queer item. They even tied the knot during the 2020 crossover event Empyre – becoming the publisher’s first LGBTQ+ married couple. So, understandably, plenty of Marvel fans are keen for Teddy/Hulking’s MCU debut! Is Hulkling in Agatha All Along Episode 6? Maybe, depending on whether Miles Gutierrez-Riley’s Eddie is the MCU version of Teddy. It’s impossible to say at this stage if that’s the case, although Billy Maximoff/William Kaplan‘s reference to Eddie’s biceps could conceivably be a nod to Teddy’s (admittedly much bigger) guns in the comics. Eddie’s also portrayed as an incredibly supportive boyfriend, which lines up with Hulkling’s comics characterization. Related: Will Agatha All Along Break Marvel’s Biggest TV Curse? That said, there’s at least one problem with the “Eddie is Hulkling” theory: “Eddie” isn’t typically a nickname for Theodore. This isn’t a huge hurdle per se; after all, the MCU isn’t above tweaking a love interest’s name (the Spider-Man flicks’ MJ is a prime example). But it is a potential clue that fans might have to wait a little longer for Hulkling’s live-action arrival! Agatha All Along is currently streaming on Disney+, with new episodes dropping Wednesdays.
