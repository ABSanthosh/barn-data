  "text": "Troubled skater was missing from announcement roster. Image credit: Activision Skater and former Jackass star Bam Margera will reportedly feature in Activision's upcoming Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake, despite being omitted from the publisher's previously released skater roster - supposedly thanks to a last-minute intervention by Tony Hawk himself. Margera made his series debut in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 back in 2001 and has appeared in all subsequent instalments. However, fans quickly noticed his absence when 3 + 4's skater line-up was unveiled earlier this month, with many speculating his omission may be related to the legal issues Margera has faced as a result of his struggles with drug and alcohol abuse. Now, though, it's been claimed Margera will appear in the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake after all - albeit as a last-minute addition at Tony Hawk's insistence. That's according to skating podcast The Nine Club co-host Roger Bagley, as spotted by VGC. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 - Reveal Trailer | PS5 \u0026 PS4 Games Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 official announcement trailer.Watch on YouTube \"Well, here's what happened,\" Bagley explained in a recent livestream. \"The game was already done. Tony called up Activision and was like, 'Hey, we're putting Bam in the thing', and they were like, 'Hey, we can't'. He goes, 'No, you're gonna do it', and basically made them fly Bam back out there to get body-scanned and everything else, and get him back in the game.\" Activision hasn't yet commented on the claims, but its currently confirmed skater roster - which includes classic skaters and new additions - is as follows: Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Eric Koston, Rodney Mullen, Jamie Thomas, Rune Glifberg, Bob Burnquist, Rayssa Leal, Chloe Covell, Jamie Foy, Zion Wright, and Yuto Horigome. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 launches for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC (via Steam, Battle.net and Microsoft Store) on 11th July. It's also coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.",
