  "description": "Great news, fans of suffering in company. Elden Ring Nightreign’s PC system requirements are upon us. If you have at least 30 GB of storage, 12 GB of RAM, a processor or graphics card from approximately this decade, and some willing or easily subjugated friends to serve as co-op partners, then you too will be able to savour the experience of getting your arse chewed off by a three-faced wolf made of swords and fireballs.

If you have at least 30 GB of storage, 12 GB of RAM, a processor or graphics card from approximately this decade, and some willing or easily subjugated friends to serve as co-op partners, then you too will be able to savour the experience of getting your arse chewed off by a three-faced wolf made of swords and fireballs. Those minimum specs, without further ado: Operating System - Windows 10 Processor - Intel Core 15-10600 or AMD Ryzen 5 5500 Memory - 12GB RAM Graphics - Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 3 GB or AMD Radeon RX 580 4 GB And here are some recommended PC specs, for you cosmopolitan elites who don’t enjoy getting your arse chewed off unless you can see all of your arse textures in pristine detail, with minimal lag. Goodness knows I need a steady frame rate when the Dark Souls Centipede Demon is eating my head. Could be a steady frame rate will even help you defeat that Centipede Demon, but come now, don’t be ridiculous. This is a From Software game. Nobody’s ever defeated a From Software boss. No, don't refer me to our Elden Ring guides section - it's a house of lies. The point of From Software games is to perish in despair. And leave messages describing random objects as dogs. Those recommended specs, anyway: Operating System - Windows 11 Processor - Intel Core 15-11500 or AMD Ryzen 5 5600 Memory - 16GB RAM Graphics - Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB or AMD Radeon RX Vega 56 8 GB You might be wondering why there are Dark Souls bosses in Nightreign. The answer is that Nightreign is sort of Elden Ring: Across The Fromverse, with creatures and characters from several previous games. It’s out on 30th May, and will probably be solid work. Personally, I dislike the idea of From making multiplayer a boxfront feature, but I'm consoled by Hidetaka Miyazaki recently swearing on his mum that the developers will carry on making singleplayer games.",
