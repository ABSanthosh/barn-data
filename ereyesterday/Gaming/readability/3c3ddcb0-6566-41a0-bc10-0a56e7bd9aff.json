  "description": "Total War: Warhammer 3 lets you challenge knights, sorcerers, behemoths, daemons, and everything in between. Now, a new DLC promises additional strategic layers as you conquer the known world. Here's our guide that discusses the Total War: Warhammer 3 - Omens of Destruction legendary lords.Total War: Warhammer 3 - Omens of Destruction legendary lords guideTotal War: Warhammer 3 - Omens of Destruction lets you choose from three legendary lords: Golgfag Maneater of the Ogre Kingdoms, Gorbad Ironclaw of the Greenskins, and Skulltaker of the forces of Khorne. You can purchase each leader separately or as part of a bundle. Moreover, a free-DLC--also known as free-LC--adds Arbaal the Undefeated.Our Total War: Warhammer 3 - Omens of Destruction legendary lords guide discusses what makes each general unique, as well as what you can expect if you choose them for your campaigns. Ogre Kingdoms: Golgfag ManeaterThe Ogre Kingdoms offer their services to the highest bidder, and Golgfag Maneater aims to capitalize on ongoing regional conflicts. You can see his perks below.Faction effects:Access to Mercenary Contracts; can be recruited by other factions.Can instantly travel to a client's settlement once per Mercenary Contract.Unable to make alliances with other factions.+5 melee attack when fighting a contract enemy.Attribute: Immune to psychology when fighting a contract enemy (all armies).Lord effects:+25% post-battle loot income.-20% upkeep for Maneater units (lord's army).Ability: Dead EyeDLC-only units:Legendary hero: Bragg the GutsmanGeneric lord: Ogre PaymasterGeneric hero: BruiserUnit: Blood VulturesUnit: ThundertuskUnit: YheteeUnit: Pigback RidersUnit: Golgfag's ManeatersGolgfag Maneater might be the best legendary lord in Omens of Destruction for those who want a more free-form way of experiencing the campaign. That's because you can accept contracts from other factions to take on their rivals. Objectives include winning battles, raiding territories, and undertaking hero actions. You may also aid the contracting party by handing over settlements that you've captured. In turn, you receive nifty rewards, such as gold, meat, and other bonuses.This makes Golgfag a viable option if you want to travel around, beating people up to earn more money and build up your armies. This is also complemented by a recent change that's part of a free update, which allows you to move your Ogre Camps to a new location. The only downside is that you're unable to enact alliances with anyone, so don't expect others to come to your rescue when you're in dire straits. Greenskins: Gorbad IronclawGorbad Ironclaw of the Greenskins is for players that want to make the most out of their unit compositions. He has the following quirks.Faction effects:Access to Da Plan, allowing you to come up with tactics in the thick of the fray.Improved rewards for completing a Waaagh!+15% income from razing settlements (all armies).-1 turn global recruitment duration (factionwide).Lord effects:-10% upkeep (lord's army).+100% leadership aura.Ability: Orcs Are Da BestArmy ability: Gorbad's Waaagh! (replaces Waaagh!)DLC-only units:Legendary hero: Snagla GrobspitGeneric lord: Savage Orc Great ShamanGeneric hero: Night Goblin Big BossUnit: Black Orcs - Axe and ShieldUnit: Arachnarok Spider FlingersUnit: Mangler SquigsUnit: Colossal SquigsUnit: Bolt ThrowaYou're going to love it when Da Plan comes together. Gorbad's special mechanic lets you unlock tactics as you complete objectives and win battles. In doing so, you'll be able to mix and match different unit types to gain buffs.Bonuses include offensive and defensive boosts, passive perks (i.e. flammable attacks), and more. This further incentivizes you to experiment with various army compositions, such as a combination of orc, goblin, spider, squig, and all types of monstrous creatures. Of course, there are times when an unlocked tactic might seem great on paper, but you're not that keen on using certain troops, too. Khorne: SkulltakerKhorne cares not from where the blood flows, just that it does. And few of the god's champions are as vicious in this endeavor than Skulltaker.Faction effects:Access to the Cloak of Skulls, granting bonuses when you defeat the generals of other factions.+2 hero capacity for Bloodreapers.The Daemons Are Reforged: +10% chance for Bloodletters to be restored after battle (all armies).-15% upkeep for Bloodletters and Exalted Bloodletters of Khorne.Lord effects:+10% campaign movement range.+100% campaign line-of-sight.Passive ability: Frenzy - For Bloodletters and Exalted Bloodletters (lord's army).Ability: Bloody OnslaughtDLC-only units:Legendary hero: Scyla AnfingrimmLegendary hero: Skarr BloodwrathGeneric lord: BloodspeakerUnit: Blood BeastsUnit: SlaughterbruteUnit: KhorngorsUnit: WrathmongersUnit: SkullreapersSkulltaker is a deadly combatant, eager to go toe to toe with his rivals to claim dominance in the Blood God's name. As his own name implies, Skulltaker earns rewards by viciously chopping off heads to adorn his Cloak of Skulls. Doing so grants powerful bonuses, including the ability to travel to the whereabouts of opposing faction lords, additional experience points, increased campaign movement range, and more.For veterans of other Total War titles, this resembles Achilles' Living Legend mechanic from A Total War Saga: Troy or Lu Bu's Greatest Warriors feature from Total War: Three Kingdoms. Find your opponents and give them a fitting end for the glory of the Blood God. Khorne: Arbaal the UndefeatedArbaal the Undefeated is a free legendary lord, also known as free DLC or free-LC. He just might be one of the best lords in Omens of Destruction since he's naturally available to all Total War: Warhammer 3 players.Faction effects:Access to the Challenges of Khorne, allowing you to partake in battles to gain Khorne's Favor.-10% upkeep for non-daemonic units.-50% construction costs and construction time for mortal military and defense buildings (factionwide).Lord effects:-1 turn global recruitment duration (lord's army).+10% weapon strength for non-daemonic units (lord's army).Passive ability: Hellblade - For Chaos Warriors, Chosen, Chaos Knights, and Skullcrushers of Khorne (lord's army).Ability: Gaze of KhorneArbaal the Undefeated's perks nudge you to focus more on mortal/human troops, as opposed to daemonic selections. Still, you're free to do as you please when it comes to your army composition, especially if you want to successfully complete the Challenges of Khorne.Similar to Skulltaker's Cloak of Skulls or Wulfrik's Monster Hunts, Arbaal roams the world in search of battles to prove that he's worthy of the Blood God's blessings. Winning these trials nets you rewards, including favor (i.e. gold), Khorne's Favor (faction buffs), and other passive gains.Another quirk of note is that Arbaal's moniker, the Undefeated, means that you should do your best to avoid losing a battle. If this unfortunate instance occurs, you'll be presented with a dilemma: Either you continue the campaign with a permanent diplomatic penalty with other Khornate factions or you end your campaign instantly. Of course, it's totally fine to continue your run, since you're likely to conquer everyone else around you anyway, so this concept just adds a bit of flavor to the overall experience. Just as well, you can reload a previous save so you can ensure that you actually win on your next attempt.That does it for our guide on the best Total War: Warhammer 3 - Omens of Destruction legendary lords. We hope these tips help you choose the ideal general for your future runs.",
