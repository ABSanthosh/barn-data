Glad somebody else got a quest turned in I spent four months getting from rolling up a few fresh characters to figure out who should take the trip, to stomping about in the black land.  I moved faster than the fellowship did.  I am not sure they had even gotten out the far side of Moria in the time it took me to get to Mordor.  Then again, they didn’t have the benefit of a giant dwarven public works project in Moria to help them along. Given all the side quest busy work, clean up, and murder for hire stuff I had to take care of along the way, I made pretty good time.  And don’t even get me started on how many times I was deep in Moria or out in Rohan when somebody would say, “Hey, could you go back to Rivendell and check in with Elrond?” and I would have to schlep back and find him to get some bit of trivia, a pat on the back, and a finger pointing back in the direction from which I arrived… and I wouldn’t swear to the pat on the back part. The Plan There was a method to my madness, which I mentioned off and on throughout the journey.  This was what I sketched out early on. Waste No XP Opportunity Since the goal was to get to Mordor, I tried to play in such a way as to optimize the advancement of levels.  I set my landscape difficulty up a notch to get a boost there, I equipped Dehrudh’s Stone for the first 64 levels, and I made sure to log in every day to at least use up the double xp/blue bar that VIP accounts get every morning. In support of the latter, because I couldn’t play a lot every single day (I was, in fact, traveling for 10 days out of the four months), I would sometimes save quests turn ins for the following day if I had used up the current days allotment.  I also made sure to do daily tasks.  That both helped with xp and with reputation and earning travel skills that my hunter could take advantage of so that those trips back to Rivendell didn’t eat up as much of my play time as they might have otherwise. Avoid Completionism Is that even a word?  Anyway, I can be a completionist at times, and all the more so in LOTRO where there are tons of deeds and quests in many zones.  You could spend a lot of time just tying up loose ends in most zones.  So I tried not to do that. That included the epic quest chain, the through line of the story.  I left more than half a dozen of the epic chains dangling, unfinished.  I couldn’t always do that.  Progressing beyond Moria does require you to, if not finish some of the epic chains, at least progress them to unlock the next layer of the story.  Things get complicated down the road with things like pre-siege, mid-siege, and post-siege Minas Tirith. No Freaking Crafting For whatever reason, as soon as I start fresh in LOTRO I end up with crafting material for various professions and I hate to waste it and the auction house is a debacle so I end up creating alts to handle all of that.  As part of the consolidation where I had to round up and transfer all of my characters to Glamdring, I ended up with knots of characters with interlocking trade skills from back in the day when you wouldn’t pick them ala carte. All of that crafting ended up being an anchor on advancement because there were suddenly so many alts to feed and advance and whatever.  None of that this time! Of course, I couldn’t quite swear off trade skills altogether.  I still collected all of those materials and stowed them in the shared storage.  I spent about 12,000 accumulated LOTRO Points on various things during the journey, but most of it was for share storage upgrades.  And I committed to forestry as a harvesting skill, so I have a lot of refined leather and wood in the bank in case I do want to go nuts on crafting. But aside from a couple of early items, crafting was not done and no time was spent on trying to advance any crafting alts. No Alts There is always a danger of me just wanting to play a few classes.  I started off in the first week playing three characters up to level 15 or so. Once I got seriously on the road to Mordor though, I did not spend time on alts.  Well, not much time.  I did spend a bit on a couple of characters who were close to level.  And I might have rolled up one new character.  But 99% of the time was on my main. Stay Geared Up This was a somewhat vague goal.  The quest chains keep you in okay gear, though some slots can go lacking for ages if you are skipping ahead rather than being a completionist.  My plan was leverage all those skirmish marks or faction tokens or even loot boxes.  SSG handed out some black steel keys for loot boxes as part of the “We screwed up the 64-bit server thing” apology. In the end though, there was no real need.  I was a little irked when I got to Minas Tirith and quest reward gear started coming with gem slots to fill (I know, not actually gem slots, but that is the analog to another titles), but most of the quests also handed you a box with the gems to insert… a situation that made me wonder why they bothered. But for the most part, the quest gear was sufficient.  SSG seems to have followed WoW down the “raiding should be the goal for everybody” path, a strange turn given they were discounting raiders as a small, but vocal, minority of the game’s population just a decade back.  So there were a whole bunch of out of reach gear enhancement for that group that I could safely ignore. And, of course, there were my legendary items.  I will have a whole post about the revamped system.  The new system is still problematic and non-intuitive, but it is much better than the original system where you had to constantly go back and reforge your item to keep it advancing. So that was it.  Move fast and kill things. Highlights The top five most impressive new things I saw… and by new, I mean after Moria. Minias Tirith – So big, so much detail Helm’s Deep – Really felt as described in the book The Black Gate – Again, very much from the book Isengard – A lot of work went into this, and Orthanc! Edoras – The mead hall of mead halls I was also reasonably fine with mounted combat… mostly because it was optional.  But the net result was I ended up with a faster horse for the wide open areas of the game.  I’m good with that. The top five least impressive new locations I saw on my run after Moria. Paths of the Dead – All that build up for that? The actual siege of Minas Tirith – Spent most of it sweeping up Dunharrow – It is just a bunch of tents Dunland – I mean, it is better than Mirkwood, but still Mordor – Something, something, the banality of evil Meanwhile, epic battles were not so epic for me.  They were quite obviously planned to be a pseudo Total War game you were expected to replay a bunch of times to unlock the cool bits in order to keep players busy between the irregular expansion schedule of the time.  But for a years later tourist experience they were not all that fun.
