  "text": "Members instructed to return to work. Image credit: SAG-AFTRA Days after announcing a \"tentative agreement\" had been reached with key video game companies, US actors union SAG-AFTRA has suspended its nearly year-long strike, instructing members to return to work on productions that fall under its Interactive Media Agreement. The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which represents around 160,000 members, announced a strike affecting all work under its Interactive Media Agreement - which includes video game voice acting and other roles - last July. The move came after the union failed to reach an agreement with major video game companies as it renegotiated the terms of the contract, despite more than 18 months of discussions. While SAG-AFTRA had successfully managed to negotiate on a variety of critical issues - including wages in-line with inflation, and job safety - sufficient protections against the exploitative use of AI remained a key sticking point. Back in March, eight months after the strike began, SAG-AFTRA said proposals from video game companies were still filled with \"alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to AI abuse\". Earlier this week, however, SAG-AFTRA announced it had finally reached a \"tentative agreement\" with companies including Activision, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Insomniac Games, and Warner Bros. that included the \"necessary AI guardrails\" it had been pushing for. And now, following that news, SAG-AFTRA national executive director \u0026 chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland has officially suspended the strike against the companies signatory to the Interactive Media Agreement, as of noon PT today. \"All SAG-AFTRA members are instructed to return to work on productions under the IMA,\" the union wrote in its announcement, \"including work promoting or publicising projects produced under the IMA. The SAG-AFTRA National Board will meet in special session tomorrow, 12th June, 2025, to consider the tentative agreement. If approved, it will be sent out for ratification by the union's membership in accordance with established policy.\" In a separate statement provided to Eurogamer, Audrey Cooling, spokesperson for the video game producers party to the Interactive Media Agreement, said, \"We are pleased to have reached a tentative contract agreement that reflects the important contributions of SAG-AFTRA-represented performers in video games. This agreement builds on three decades of successful partnership between the interactive entertainment industry and the union. It delivers historic wage increases of over 24 percent for performers, enhanced health and safety protections, and industry-leading AI provisions requiring transparency, consent and compensation for the use of digital replicas in games. We look forward to continuing to work with performers to create new and engaging entertainment experiences for billions of players throughout the world.\" Yesterday, UK actors union Equity applauded the \"tenacity and persistence\" of SAG-AFTRA members after news of the tentative agreement broke. Equity protested outside the BAFTA Games Awards in April, calling on the games industry to improve conditions for performers, including better pay and terms and conditions for their work, as well as AI protections.",
