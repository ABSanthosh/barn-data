  "text": "SummaryRavenswatch, a new action-roguelike, is out today on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One.Learn how we choose which heroes to include in our game.2 characters that must be played together will be added in early 2025. Fallen heroes, you are on the verge of a crucial battle against the Nightmares invading and corrupting your world! Today, we will talk about the fallen heroes of the Ravenswatch – and we even have some news about new, free heroes coming to the game soon. In Ravenswatch, you play as heroes inspired by old folk tales and legends, from Little Red Riding Hood to Sun Wukong. In each play session, you’ll embody these charismatic heroes and reveal their stories, run after run. You’ll explore open maps inspired by enchanted forests, One Thousand and One Nights, and Arthurian legend, filled with activities and dark foes. And along the way, help the inhabitants of the world of Reverie you come across! The Three Little Pigs need extra hands to build their houses, while Sinbad the Sailor finds himself in a tough spot and might need rescuing. Complete their quests to earn valuable rewards that will aid you in future battles. Available to play solo or with up to 4 players in co-op, this action-roguelike game is out today on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One! In Ravenswatch, players step into the shoes of fallen heroes drawn from timeless tales and legends, reimagined with a dark and devilish twist. Take Scarlet, our cursed version of Red Riding Hood, who transforms into a big bad wolf at night to hunt the Nightmares; or the Pied Piper, a musical tactician who commands swarms of rats in battle. From Beowulf wielding his mighty sword alongside his baby wyrm to Mélusine unleashing devastating magic water wisps, every hero offers a unique way to confront the Nightmares threatening Reverie! At the start of your experience, you’ll have a choice between Scarlet, The Pied Piper, Beowulf, and Snow Queen. But nine playable characters are available in total! Unlock them during your adventures and learn about the rest of the team. Some secrets are best uncovered in the heat of a battle! Who’s Fit for the Ravenswatch? When choosing a new hero, we must be careful and select a character who will fit in with the rest of the cast. Heroes are the cornerstone of the game’s design and are the most essential part of the core gameplay. In our approach, each playable character must be unique in how they are played, their physical appearance, and their personality. That’s why we have set imperatives to meet before considering adding a new hero to the Ravenswatch. Here are our four pillars: Gameplay-oriented: First and foremost, the goal with each of our heroes is to create a unique feeling when playing them. Whether ranged, melee or an atypical gameplay style, no hero plays the same. When adding new characters to the cast, they must always bring something new and fresh to the table. Worldwide notoriety: We are keen to add Heroes inspired by tales and legends from all over the world, but one of our imperatives is that they must be famous on a global scale. From our perspective, players will be more excited by a familiar figure than an unknown one. Additionally, we need to make it credible that they exist in the same universe. That’s why we tend to avoid stories that are too ancient, or too modern, with advanced technology. Exciting backstory: The essence of what the tales tell is a wonderful source of inspiration for character and gameplay design. We often use defining moments of a story (such as Grandma being eaten by a Wolf) or a specific object (like Aladdin’s genie lamp) as the starting point when creating a new Ravenswatch hero. Twisting the original tale is what makes rediscovering a character so exciting. Family photo: We love to see the cast posing next to each other, and there’s no greater feeling than to see the “family photo” of your creation in the end. Having a varied, diverse, and eclectic group of heroes is a priority! Much More to Come More updates are planned for Ravenswatch; you can learn more about our plans for the future on Twitter and Discord! Oh, and one last thing! Our first DLC will be free for everyone to enjoy, and will bring an inseparable duo into the ranks of the Ravenswatch! These two new heroes have distinct abilities and synergies. They’re also never one without the other, and will need to be played together in co-op to succeed! But that’s all we’re saying for now… So what are you waiting for? Grab your friends and join the Ravenswatch today! Ravenswatch Preorder Ravenswatch and get the Fairytales Skin Pack free. Once upon a time, before the corruption of the Nightmare, there were heroes of tales and legends. Wear their flamboyant costumes that hark back to a happier time. TALES GONE DARK Ravenswatch is a top-down roguelike action game in which you play as heroes of tales and legends that must slay hordes of nightmarish creatures in nerve-racking fights.

BANISH THE NIGHTMARE FROM REVERIE The Nightmare has invaded the world of dreams and is corrupting everything in its wake.
