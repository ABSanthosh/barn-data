  "description": "Novato police are on the lookout for a burglar who broke into the Novato Museum of Cat Antiquities last night. Detective Rosie was first on the scene. “Meow,” she said, when asked for a description of the burglar. The break in occurred shortly after 2:00 AM, and police were alerted when the burglar set off the museum’s security alarm. Police put out an APB and started a manhunt…although video surveillance suggests the suspect could be a canine. “Meow,” said Detective Rosie. If you or someone you know has information that leads to the arrest of the Novato Museum of Cat Antiquities burglar, Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC is offering a reward. Company founder and former Chief Feline Officer Tabs was a captain in the Canadian Cat Mounties before embarking upon his successful career as a kitty supermodel and entrepreneur, and the company continues to be a strong supporter of law enforcement. “Meow,” said Rosie again. Sooner or later, we’ll catch this criminal.
