  "text": "Bee Flowers is a calm puzzle game where you need to build paths so that your bee friend can make their way to flowers and home. I have played a lot of puzzle games in my time and always get excited when a new one pops up on Xbox. Bee Flowers is a puzzle game where you find yourself with a hexagon level full of paths and tiles to be moved. This bee wants to get from it’s starting stage to the beehive, crossing the paths of as many flowers as you can along the way. Bee Flowers does seem quite simple in concept, and you can easily read a lot of the controls on the side of the screen, but I did struggle at first with the lack of tutorial. There are small white lines on some of the tiles that have two directions that indicate what way the bee will move. When they cross that tile, when you hit start, the path changes. There was nothing to tell me that I could change that path manually when setting up the level, so I ended up using the hint system over and over, trying to figure out exactly what was wrong. It is satisfying when you do get the path correct in Bee Flowers, as your little bee is able to bring the flower shoots to life. These flower points actually cannot be swapped or rotated, and work as a good starting point when it comes to building the path around it, creating a good route for your bee to follow. This game is bite-sized (with 30 levels), but there is a lot of challenge as you continue through. Despite the challenge, I do like how cosy and calm the game feels, with birds chirping in the background and no real time limit to make you feel pressured. It’s just a relaxed game where you can help a little bee out on their adventure through a little bit of grasslands. Bee Flowers is available now on the Nintendo eShop, PlayStation Store, and the Microsoft Store.
