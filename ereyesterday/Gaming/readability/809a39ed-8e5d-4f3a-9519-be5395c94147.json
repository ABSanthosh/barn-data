  "text": "Tyrant's Blessing The Tyrant landed in Tyberia bearing promises of a paradise, without war, without suffering… and without death. All Tybe… DetailsThe Tyrant landed in Tyberia bearing promises of a paradise, without war, without suffering… and without death. All Tyberians had to do in order to enter his paradise was to simply die at the hands of his Dead Army. The war was over before it even began, with thousands perishing in the Tyrant's wake, only to be brought into his fold as undying thralls, bound by magic. The few living warriors left are scattered across the remnants of their homeland, tirelessly looking for a way to turn the tables on the tyrannical Tyrant. Lead a great Uprising, defeat the Dead Army, and drive the monstrous overlord back into the depths of the sea from whence he came. Tyrant's Blessing is a tactical turn-based game where your ability to plan, adapt, and strategize is more important than min-maxing your units or finding the sharpest sword in the hoard. Select battles every day, make challenging choices, and cleverly use the strengths of these rag-tag insurgents to defeat the undead hordes and maybe - just maybe - bring real life back to Tyberia. Every Day is a Battle for Survival Before you bring the battle to the Tyrant's doorstep, you'll have to make sure you live long enough to reclaim the Island. - Decide whether to fight, rescue the living from the Undying, or gather your strength. Every choice matters throughout every day of the Uprising. - As you fight your way across the face of Tyberia, face off against random encounters that force difficult decisions. Do you intervene and fight highwaymen, putting your warriors at risk? Do you try to save a child, risking valuable time and resources? Only your morals and ideals hold the answer. Every Battle is a Risk The Tyrant can’t be defeated without destroying an army's worth of the Undying. However, winning is more than simply whacking the enemy as hard as you can. - Analyze the fray and plan accordingly. Place warriors around the battlefield to gain strategic advantages. - Stay ever mindful of surroundings: kick up dust to make the enemies lose sight or hop over stones and dodge into bushes to avoid enemy attacks. - Mind the enemy: every attack is telegraphed, but take care, simply moving away leaves behind a shadow. This remnant of a character can still be attacked if there is no way to avoid it... - Knock the enemies out of the way and into obstacles, shield weaker heroes with ones that can tank damage, as well as chain powerful elemental attacks using the environment. Brute force works, but fight smarter, not harder. Every Risk is Another Day Each of your heroes has their own personality, properties, and abilities. Who will you choose to put in harm’s way? - Enlist twenty hallowed heroes, each with a distinct set of abilities that can dramatically alter the course of any battle. - But stay mindful: Not all heroes appear in a playthrough - and not everyone is guaranteed to make it to the finish line of this quest. - Pick the right team for the task. An assassin may thrive in confined spaces, while an archer will suffer in close quarters. Some heroes may even bring their pets along, who might provide just enough leverage to win a battle for the group. - We cannot afford to lose even a single hero to the undead tyrant! Seller:Freedom Games, LLC TouchArcade Rating:Unrated Compatibility:HD Universal Grabbed this and it’s kind of a fantasy take on Into the Breach with more of a story to connect it. It’s a bit rougher around the edges and not as clear (to me at least) on some of the movements / abilities available when playing. Seems like you have to understand that pre-match. But it probably comes with more playing time. Still enjoying it so far and probably will like it more as I learn. Staff Member Patreon Silver I was about to write the same thing. I can add that the game has a Mostly Positive rating on Steam (where the game sells for $19.99). When you say rough around the edges do you mean buggy or? Also it says not all of the characters may appear in a playthrough, is it rougelite at all or does it say that for replay-ability or because you’ll likely fail and need to try again? On sale for £1.99 might buy it considering I was interested last year. Surprised at the lack of comments with “fantasy into the breach” being thrown around for it. It’s maybe not as polished as Into the Breach. But it’s a good game and well worth £1.99 IMO. Share This Page",
