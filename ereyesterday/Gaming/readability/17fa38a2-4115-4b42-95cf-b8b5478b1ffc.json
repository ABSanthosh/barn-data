  "description": "Crisis between colleagues! Today, a special meeting of the Board of Directors of Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC was called to review a most disturbing matter â€” the repeated and inexplicable disappearance of Chief Feline Officer Rosieâ€™s crunchies. At various times over the past few weeks, Rosieâ€™s food bowl, which had been previously full, has become empty, and as you can imagine, this caused quite a corporate kerfuffle. The results of an internal investigation were inconclusive, but Rosie thinks she knows whoâ€™s doing itâ€¦ Since the official investigation was inconclusive, the board hasnâ€™t taken any action, but Rosieâ€™s suspicions have created a lot of tensionâ€¦ Unfortunately for Marnie, she has a lengthy record of snack theft, so her history isnâ€™t doing her any favors. Plus, she was captured on security footage early this morning in the vicinity of Rosieâ€™s food bowl. When asked about it by the company investigator, Marnie lawyered upâ€¦ I just hope this gets resolved soon because itâ€™s been bad for morale in the office. ðŸ™‚ Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 861 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
