The humans were under assault by the Locust, creatures who emerged from beneath the planet's surface and wiped out countless victims in their wake. Players stepped into the role of Marcus Fenix as he and his fellow Delta Squad soldiers were on the frontlines of the war with the Locust.Wrestler-turned-actor Dave Bautista has lobbied for years to play Marcus, and he does bear a strong resemblance to the character. Meanwhile, Gears of War designer Cliff Bleszinski has previously been adamant that Chris Pratt shouldn't play any role in the film.For nearly two decades, Gears of War has been an Xbox exclusive. However, Microsoft has announced that Gears of War: Reloaded is heading to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC this summer. The next game in the series is a prequel, Gears of War: E-Day, which is expected to arrive in 2026. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com",
