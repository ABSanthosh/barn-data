  "text": "SummaryNow available on Xbox Series X|S.Battle through the twisted lab of Section 13, blasting enemies with lead or lasers.Unlock perks with each run to survive longer next time. Get ready for precise, fast-paced action, ever-evolving challenges, and a dash of mystery. Section 13 is now live on Xbox Series X|S! A World of Secrets What exactly turned a top-tier facility into a paranormal creature-infested zoo? Section 13’s story takes inspiration from SCP-style lore, immersing you in a world of classified experiments, scientific anomalies, and monstrous boss creatures lurking in the depths. Playing as different S2P agents, you’ll not only uncover what happened to Section 13 but also piece together fragments of each character’s past, their connection to the facility, and the ties that bind them together. Precision Combat Meets Roguelite Mayhem At its core, Section 13 is all about precise twin-stick controls and fast, responsive combat. The action is quick and chaotic, rewarding sharp reflexes and strategic positioning. Thanks to procedurally generated map layouts and randomized encounters, no two sessions play out the same way. And when you inevitably fall? Embrace death as an opportunity. Every failure in Section 13 helps to build up permanent rewards such as new weapons, upgrades, and more that make your next run even stronger. Stay in the Light, Stay in Control With the facility’s power offline and lighting scarce, the Fear System introduces a new kind of threat: your own panic. Darkness isn’t just an aesthetic choice in Section 13—it’s a mechanic. Stay in the darkness too long, and you’ll enter a state of panic and accuracy takes a hit as your vision distorts, heart thumps louder, and the walls seem to close in. That’s not all, of course. You also take more damage, reload slower, and can’t regain HP. To shake off the panic, find a strong light source—not some flickering flashlight, but something bright enough to make your interior designer wince. Step into the glow and get back in control. Co-Op Mode: Team Up, Watch Your Fire Fighting through Section 13 alone is thrilling—but bringing a friend (or two) kicks up the action to another level. Teammates boost your firepower but co-op mode plays differently from solo mode, so you’ll need to think twice before spraying bullets. Online co-op is on the way, with couch co-op to follow. Here are some key  changes you’ll be able to find in the updates: All characters will be unlocked from the get-go. Friendly fire and ammo limits will be toggleable. Enemies will be even tougher! Key resources such as Medkits won’t be shared—anyone can grab them. No narrative progression will be unlocked. Whether you’re here for action or the intrigue, there’s always something waiting to be discovered. Are you ready to face the darkness and uncover the secrets of Section 13? Section 13 is a roguelite twin-stick shooter packed with action and challenges. As an Agent of the S2P Corporation, it’s up to you to investigate a crisis at the most top-secret facility of a company whose whole thing is keeping secrets. NOTE: Planned feature updates will bring online and couch co-op modes*, with optional friendly fire for maximum madness in the narrow corridors of Section 13! CONSPIRACIES TO UNCOVER When an Omega-level containment breach puts an off-the-books company black-site on lockdown, it’s up to expendable peons like you to get to the bottom of it. Literally. Step into the shoes of Agents Red, Boy Scout, Beaker, and Scalpel, as they fight to unearth the buried secrets of Section 13… and solve a few personal mysteries of their own. Collect data on paranormal entities running amok and find out what it all has to do with you. TENSE TWIN-STICK ACTION IN THE WEIRDEST WORKPLACE EVER As a Tier-1 paranormal containment facility, Section 13 is full of unique hazards, and it's up to you to overcome them with quick wits and reflexes. Time your dodge-rolls and reloads to stay one step ahead of a horde of hungry monsters. Back against the wall? Pop off with a special ability… or grab a melee weapon and smash your way out. But keep an eye on your Fear level, or risk a debilitating mid-mission panic attack! CUTTING-EDGE TOOLS TO MASTER Add some spice to every run with unlockable (and customizable) weapons, gameplay-altering Synaptic Enhancements, and of course, recreational genetic modification. (Some side effects may apply). Utilize special abilities and unique tactical items to outsmart pissed-off cryptids, navigate a series of shifting levels, and push deeper into the base with every attempt. Between deaths, you’ll also unlock persistent upgrades that change how you play and radically alter your chances of success. * Co-op modes will be added as feature updates (online co-op in June 2025 and couch co-op in September 2025). Online co-op will not support crossplay.",
