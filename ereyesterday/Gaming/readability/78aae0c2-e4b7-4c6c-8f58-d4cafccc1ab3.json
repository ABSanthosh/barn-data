To better understand the project's ambitions, you should watch this developer diary that Riot Games released in 2021. Noxy's post about Hytale's cancellation essentially admits that this was all too ambitious for the studio. That can be seen in the project's lengthy development timeline. The project has roots going all the way back to 2015, and Riot Games acquired Hypixel in 2020, yet no release was in sight.Noxy admits that \"it became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game,\" even after a complete overhaul of the game engine being used to make Hytale. Rather than reducing the scope or adjusting the development timeline to make the project a reality, Hypixel Studios and Riot decided to cancel the game entirely.Hypixel Studios will be shut down as a result, although Noxy says Hypixel's developers are being \"supported with generous severance and resources to help them find what’s next.\" As for the Hypixel server that Hytale is based on, Noxy's message explains that it is run separately from Hypixel Studios and will not be impacted by Hytale's cancellation.
