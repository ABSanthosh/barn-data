  "text": "From Star Wars Jedi director's new studio. Image credit: Larian Studios With Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian now off doing their own thing and making multiple games that aren't Baldur's Gate 4, BG IP owners Wizards of the Coast have just revealed something that might help fill that void. They've agreed to a publishing deal that'll see relatively new studio Giant Skull create a new game set in the D\u0026D universe. Giant Skull were founded by Stig Asmussen, director of stuff like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and God of War 3, back in March 2024, and said way back then that it'd be aiming to make \"gameplay-driven, story-immersed action-adventure games\". Well, they get points for sticking to that goal thus far. This WotC-published game they're working on (thanks, Gematsu) is an \"all-new, single-player action adventure title set in the world of Dungeons \u0026 Dragons\" that'll be coming to console and PC at some point between now and the end of time. \"Our talented and experienced team at Giant Skull is built on creativity and curiosity,\" Asmussen said in a press release, \"Our goal is to craft a rich new Dungeons \u0026 Dragons universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace.” \"In our time working together on God of War I got to see firsthand Stig’s artistry and expertise, and he and the Giant Skull team are the perfect fit for our new game,\" added Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro digital gaming president John Hight, \"Worldbuilding and storytelling is in our DNA, and this collaboration reflects our evolution and commitment to our Playing to Win Strategy, building a stronger presence in digital play. We look forward to revealing more about this brand-new Dungeons \u0026 Dragons game in the future.\" So, concrete details about the game and what it'll end up looking like are pretty scarce right now - as you'd expect for a thing that's only just tied the publishing knot. There's no indication of how it may or may not be tied to the BG games we've already gotten, or whether any of the characters BG3 famously inspired War and Peace-length fanfictions about will star in it. Given the fact it hasn't been declared an RPG, it could well turn out to have very little in common with BG3, aside from the obvious D\u0026D connection. We'll just have to wait, ponder our orbs like those coastal wizards, and see.",
