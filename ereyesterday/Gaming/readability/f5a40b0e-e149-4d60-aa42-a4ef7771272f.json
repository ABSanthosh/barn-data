  "text": "Tyler Colp is a games writer at Polygon specializing in criticism and reporting about extraordinary players and communities.While the rest of us wait for Elden Ring Nightreign to come out, YouTuber chickensandwich420 has pledged to spend every day until then fighting one of the hardest bosses without taking a single hit.A few days after FromSoftware announced the multiplayer spin-off at The Game Awards in December, chickensandwich420 set their sights on Messmer, a brutal snake-man introduced in the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. It’s already one of the harder fights in an especially hard expansion, but chickensandwich420 committed to taking him down flawlessly. Not only are they doing it on new game plus seven (read: nightmare difficulty), they’re doing it with a different weapon every day.The catch is that FromSoft didn’t give Nightreign a release date more specific than 2025, which means chickensandwich420 might be doing this for a while. But we’re also talking about the same person who spent 117 days dueling a boss in the original game until the expansion was released. They know what they signed up for.They’re currently on day 25 and taking suggestions for what weapon to use in the comments. On day 10 last month, someone made them do the fight with a sword that is supposed to suck until you solve a puzzle with it. That video is a solid minute longer than the rest as chickensandwich420 chips away Messmer’s health with what is essentially a rock. It could be worse: Eventually, someone is going to suggest fighting him with a bouquet.Chickensandwich420 said in their day 1 video that if Nightreign isn’t out by June, they will swap to other FromSoft games. Messmer is tough, but there are certainly worse bosses out there, and I don’t expect chickensandwich420 to make the challenge any easier. History has taught us that FromSoft challenge runners don’t give up and definitely don’t lower the stakes.",
