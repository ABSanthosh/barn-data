Right now you can get an HP Omen 17\" RTX 4070 gaming laptop for only $1199.99 with free shipping after you apply a 20% off coupon code \"LEVELUP20\" in cart. You don't need to pay an exorbitant sum for the latest and greatest Nvidia Blackwell GPU to get great gaming performance from a laptop. The RTX 4070 is a generation old, but it's still an excellent GPU that actually goes toe to toe with its RTX 5070 successor.HP Omen 17 RTX 4070 Gaming Laptop for $1199.99HP Omen 17 AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS RTX 4070 Gaming Laptop (16GB/1TB)The HP Omen 17 gaming laptop is equipped with a 17.3\" 2560x1440 240Hz IPS display, AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS CPU, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, 16GB of DDR5-5600MHz RAM, and a 1TB SSD. It weighs in at about 6.5 pounds. The AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS boasts a max boost clock of 5.1GHz with 8 cores and 16 threads. This processor isn't as power hungry as the more performance oriented HX-series CPUs but it's still capable enough that you probably won't notice any difference in gaming performance, especially at 1440p, and your battery life will last a little bit longer.The mobile RTX 4070 GPU is relatively similar in performance to the RTX 5070 GPU, within a margin of about 5%-10% in favor of the RTX 5070 in most games. That's actually a very good stat for the RTX 4070 considering the fact that an RTX 5070 equipped laptop runs for at least $1,500. If you want a significantly better performing Nvidia GPU, you'll have to pick up an RTX 5070 Ti laptop, but that will also run you closer to $2,000.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
