  "text": "We’ve come so far, and there’s still so much ahead of us. Apex Legends From the Rift rewinds the clock with the new nostalgic LTM Launch Royale, takes you to the original World’s Edge, revives Lifeline to new limits, and rekindles that first drop feeling from season one. It all starts November 5, 2024, including support for PlayStation 5 Pro when the console launches November 7. Let’s launch royale It’s 2019, Apex Legends has just launched, Kings Canyon is the wild frontier, and battle royales were never the same. This new LTM drops you right into that original experience, complete with original everything: weapons, Legends, abilities, ruleset, and map. Conquer Launch Royale Challenges to unlock Legends and earn rewards like Apex Packs and more. Evo Armor and Ability Upgrades? Nope, not here. Just a blast from the past for those who were here on day zero and a brand-new experience for those who missed out. There’s never been a better time to jump in and see where Legends were born. Lifeline revived “We’re in this together. Memba that.” Lifeline’s habit of getting caught up in chaotic events may have caught up with her, but she’s always got your back. It’s the Ajay Che you know and love, now fully revived, recharged, and ready to drop directly into the action with her aggressive new kit: Combat Glide: Hold Jump mid-air to use to D.O.C. to briefly glide, and deploy D.O.C. to revive teammates, leaving Lifeline free to defend. D.O.C. Heal Drone: D.O.C. heals nearby allies. D.O.C. can be assigned to follow allies once deployed. D.O.C. Halo: throw D.O.C. to activate Halo Shield System. All players inside use Health \u0026 Shield consumables faster. Good support never surrenders to the sidelines. And this Lifeline? She’s not just saving lives—she’s fighting her way to the Champions Podium. Rift Relics Forming from the unstable Rift in the sky, Rift Relics disrupt our reality to bring enviable items from seemingly nowhere. Pick up the EPG-1 Launcher with splash damage and rocket-jumping capabilities, and unleash exotic Hop-Ups like Lifesteal, which heals with every hit. If survival is more your gameplan, then lookout for the new survival item: Boost Kits. Rift Relics will spontaneously appear across many rounds in each match. But be quick. They’re easy to spot for allies and enemies alike. Whoever gets there first will reap the rewards by destroying the Rift Relic and have their presence announced to the surrounding area. Then it’s all fun and games until the Ring starts—objects from the rift may be more stable than they appear. Support Class Perks Our next class gets a set of perks. Legends in the Support class will now have their own duo of perks to select from to amplify their areas of expertise: Heal Expert and Revive Expert. There are no bad choices here—just go with your gut and heal it later. Heal Expert Move at full walk speed while healing Healing amount from small meds is doubled Revive Expert 25% faster revives and grant health regen on a successful revive Banner Crafting and ally Death Boxes now spawn a Mobile Respawn Beacon (which Support Legends will be able to spot inside) Support Legends will maintain access to their extended supply bins, but some updates will be made to their upgrades, and banner crafting will now be accessible to all Legends. New universal melee: Raptor’s Claw Up the ante with the new Raptor’s Claw. This universal melee cosmetic can be used by any and all Legends to add some flare while you’re taking down the enemy. Grab the latest addition to your collection in the Void Mercenary Store until January 7, 2025. After acquiring this karambit-style weapon, you can then unlock the Crystal Chamber Death Box, as well as 5 other deadly variants and their matching Death Boxes.  Play Apex Legends for free* now on PS5 and PS4, now with support for PlayStation 5 Pro when the console launches November 7. *Applicable platform account and platform subscription (sold separately) may be required. A persistent internet connection and EA account required. Age restrictions apply. Includes in-game purchases. Trending Stories",
