  "text": "Embark on Dead by Daylight‘s new Chapter Doomed Course, which introduces a new Killer – The Houndmaster, and a new Survivor – Taurie Cain. Beyond the arrival of these characters, Doomed Course delves deeper into the dark and mysterious lore of Dead by Daylight, expanding on the connection between our world and The Entity’s Realms. We’ve got you covered with a deep dive into each character’s backstory, detailing how one of the most brutal and merciless Killers and one of the morally darkest Survivors ultimately wound up in The Fog. Merciless As The Sea Before she became The Houndmaster, Portia Maye had a chance at an ordinary life. Warmed by her father’s love and fueled by the promise of adventure, her early years were largely spent at sea. Unfortunately, the course of her life was forever altered when the depraved pirate Mad Molak set upon her father’s vessel Nightsdream and slaughtered nearly all aboard. Kept alive as a celestial navigator, Portia descended into darkness, allured by the siren’s song of cold revenge. It was there she altered the course of her life, steering her father’s ship into the dreaded Dragon’s Tooth and plunging her tormentors into the depths. By some stroke of fortune – or perhaps the opposite – she emerged as the lone survivor. That is, until she came across her loyal puppy Snug. It’s interesting to consider that Portia, at one point in time, represented the quintessential survivor. Not only did she survive the harrowing slaughter of the Nightsdream massacre, but she also survived years marooned on the Dragon’s Tooth. Alas, every waking thought revolved around revenge, and her bloodlust burned hotter with each passing year. It didn’t help that the Dragon’s Tooth, unbeknownst to Portia, was a Bleed – an otherworldly intersection between Realms. Think of Bleeds like melding colors on a palette, as elements from two dimensions converge into one. “That’s the one thing about entering a Bleed,” explains Lead Narrative Director Jessi Thind. “If it doesn’t kill you, it drives you mad.” Her descent into madness ran concurrent to her mastery of violence, culminating in a Killer whose merciless nature surpassed Molak himself. By the time she tracked him down and enacted her vengeance, her role in The Entity’s realm was long cemented. Before long, the only remaining vestige of her humanity was tethered to Snug, her lone companion and relentless protector; their bond is expressed in The Houndmaster’s Power, which utilizes Snug’s ability to track and grab hold of Survivors. For The Black Talon Raised as a member of the Black Talon organization – a subsect of the nefarious Black Vale, Taurie Cain spent her life seeking to uncover The Entity’s secrets. Upon discovering a Bleed, Taurie’s parents ventured within to further their research. Unfortunately, tragedy struck, the worst of which was averted after Taurie entered the Bleed after them. From that moment on, Taurie pledged her devotion to the malevolent cause, quickly rising through the Black Talon’s ranks. While some Survivors like Haddie Kaur and Elodie Rakoto have crossed paths with the Black Vale’s disciples, Taurie seemed to seek out the darkness, believing The Entity to be the key to transcending mortal existence. “Having grown up as a member of the Black Talon, Taurie genuinely believes her actions to be for the betterment of humanity,” explains Thind. “However, as she rose through the ranks, things got darker and darker. Eventually, Taurie reached a point of no return and had to make a life-altering decision.” Her journey led her to a pivotal moment. Tasked with the ritualistic killing of a man named Jordan Rois – stepbrother of Survivor Haddie Kaur and constant thorn in the Talon’s side – Taurie raised her knife for the plunging strike. And yet, she faltered. A crucial decision, and one of the last ones made before her arrival to The Fog. It was there she would discover that everything she believed was true. Her jubilation quickly turned to horror when she realized that all her years of devotion had led to a perpetual cycle of pain and suffering. Though such a revelation might shatter a lesser will, Taurie remained steadfast in her belief that her true purpose has yet to be defined. “Her devotion to the Vale may actually prove beneficial in The Fog, as she maintains belief everything is part of the plan,” continues Thind. “Taurie is determined to continue along the path until The Entity finally recognizes her as a disciple – a Killer.” It raises an interesting question – why did The Entity bring Taurie into its Realm as a Survivor in the first place? “For reasons yet to be understood, The Entity feeds on emotions,” explains Thind. “We can interpret that The Entity took Taurie for a reason, and perhaps it sensed a benefit to having one person who simply won’t get along with many of her fellow Survivors. Taurie doesn’t understand why she’s trapped with people who never believed in the first place, and that naturally builds resentment. There’s conflict there – anger, confusion, and mistrust – and that’s something The Entity would feed off.” Despite whatever conflict may arise, Taurie will do what she must to thrive in her new environment. Her Perks emphasize quickly breaking away from teammates and drawing the Killer’s attention, gritting her teeth through pain and using it to her advantage. It’s curious that Portia and Taurie both spent time in the Bleeds, with the latter proving largely unaffected. Perhaps under different circumstances, their roles within The Entity’s Realm might have been reversed. However, once a course is set, deviation is not an option – especially when the destination is shrouded in Fog… Embark on Dead by Daylight’s Doomed Course, featuring The Houndmaster and Taurie Cain, available today in the Xbox Store.
