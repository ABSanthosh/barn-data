  "text": "Hi everyone! Today, we are thrilled to announce Death Note Killer Within, a brand new online social deduction game for up to 10 players where you can play as iconic characters from the Death Note franchise. The key to this game is the Death Note, for the human whose name is written in this note shall die! But beware, this deadly note lies hidden among you and the other players, setting the stage for a thrilling game of strategy and deception. Play as Kira and judge other players with the Death Note or play as L and gather clues to arrest the killer. Get ready to uncover the truth and outsmart your opponents to win.   Death Note Killer Within is coming to both PS5 and PS4 on November 5, and is included in the PlayStation Plus Monthly Games lineup for November.  Game overview In Death Note Killer Within, there are four unique player roles: Kira, Kira Follower, L, and the Investigator. Players can select their desired role at the start of the game, but depending on various selection factors, the system will assign each player a final role based on availability. Players will be split into two teams: team Kira and Kira Follower, whose primary objective is to eliminate L, or team L and the Investigators, whose goal is to arrest Kira.  The game progresses through two main phases: a cycle of Action Phase, where players can gather clues and complete their respective tasks, and a Meeting Phase, where players come together to discuss and attempt to arrest Kira based on suspicious behaviors during the Action Phase.  If L is eliminated during the Action Phase, team Kira wins. However, if Kira is arrested during the Meeting Phase, the Death Note will be disposed of and Team L wins. Alternatively, by completing various objectives during the Action Phase, players can contribute to leveling up their team Progress gauge and the first team to max out their Progress gauge will win the game. Player roles If you are “Kira”, you will start with the Death Note and use it to eliminate NPCs and other players. However, to judge a player, you need an ID with the player’s real name. You can obtain this by staying close to a target for a short amount of time, but don’t act too suspicious or you will be questioned during the Meeting Phase. As a “Kira Follower”, your job is to steal Investigators’ IDs and work secretly together with Kira, communicating privately with a Transceiver. In addition, the Death Note can be transferred between Kira and a Kira Follower so even you can become the next Kira! Make the transfer at the right time to deceive other players. “Investigators” play an important role in identifying the real Kira as they gather clues to support the deduction. Be aware of suspicious players who get too close to you as your ID might get stolen if they are Kira or a Kira Follower. Investigators also carry out objectives such as asking NPCs for testimonials, which helps reveal information about Kira.  If you become “L”, unlike normal investigators, he has special actions that enable him to obtain valuable information during the Action Phase, such as commanding other players to investigate and setting up surveillance cameras. L can also facilitate discussion in the Meeting Phase to narrow down suspicious players. Strategically use your special actions to take one step closer in uncovering the truth and arrest Kira. To win, you must work together Death Note Killer Within encourages players to work together as a team to accomplish their goals. Each of the four roles has its own gameplay characteristics. Depending on your assigned role, a wide range of strategies can be formulated, and each randomized scenario develops into a high-stakes game of tactics. For example, the Death Note can be transferred between Kira and Kira Follower, allowing them to misdirect investigators. L can narrow down suspects by giving instructions during the Action Phase and guiding discussions during the Meeting Phase to efficiently advance his team’s deductions. Investigate and deceive in style Customize your game avatar with hats, glasses, masks and various accessories to stand out from the crowd. But that’s not all, you can even choose a custom nameplate and select special animations to be displayed during key moments in the game. Let’s get the deduction party started! Death Note Killer Within is coming to both PS5 and PS4 on November 5, 2024 and will support both online cross-play and voice chat. Invite your friends and challenge each other in different roles to see who has the wits to successfully deceive other players and win the game. On launch day, the game will also be available to PlayStation Plus members as part of November’s Monthly Games, so be sure to check it out!  Trending Stories",
