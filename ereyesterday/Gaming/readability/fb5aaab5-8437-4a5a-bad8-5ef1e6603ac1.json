  "text": "Infernax is an impressive, bloody action game that keeps itself fresh not just with multiple play paths, but fun rewards for creative play. I’ve alreadyhad some great things to say about this game and its gloomy, guts-filled world. It’s a solid action game with some challenging platforming and gross monster design. Not only that, but your decisions throughout the world can drastically alter the way you “save” it from the demonic forces that are infringing upon it. Let’s just say that your rule could be significantly worse depending on how you want to behave in the world. SIGNIFICANTLY. What I really enjoyed about the game (and what pulled me back in for a rare third and fourth playthrough) was the addition of all kinds of secrets, unlocks, and new modes that made the game fresh and fun again. Depending on how good or evil you want to play the game, you can unlock some character names to use at the start of the game that can give you a jet pack, infinite mana for your magic, or enough experience and lives to make yourself overpowered out of the gate. There’s also plenty of unlockable characters you get for different endings or from putting in some not-so-secret codes. Maxime Gunn gives our hero a machine gun that the undead are definitely not equipped to deal with. Finally, there’s a fantastic co-op mode that lets you bring a buddy along to stomp monsters together. While I love me a good horror action game, I rarely play them through multiple times in a row and feel they’re fresh each time. Infernax pulled me back in for multiple playthroughs with some great new characters, cheats, and unlocks based on doing some silly things throughout the game (I need to nap less, I guess). It’s rare that I play something that feels this rewarding multiple times, so if you still haven’t tried this one, I continue to highly recommend grabbing it.
