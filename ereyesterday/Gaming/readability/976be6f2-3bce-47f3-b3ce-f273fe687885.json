This is a great, compact screwdriver for anyone who tinkers with small electronics and deals with dozens of tiny screws, but wants something stronger than one of those \"mini precision\" screwdrivers.Update: Another $6 price drop compared to last week.40% Off Hoto 3.6V 4Nm Electric Driver for $29.99Also Clip the 25% Off Coupon on the Product PageHoto 3.6V 4Nm Electric ScrewdriverHoto sells a few electric screwdriver models, and this is their most powerful model. Most of their electric screwdrivers are very small - about the thickness of a pen flashlight - and deliver about 0.2Nm-0.5Nm of max torque. This particular model feels heftier - about the thickness of a regular flashlight - and delivers up to 4Nm of max torque. It also has a higher rotational speed of 220RPM (vs 150RPM on the smaller models) and a far bigger 1,500MaH battery (vs 300mAh or less on the smaller models). It's more versatile since it will handle bigger and tougher jobs, however that means it's also powerful enough to strip screws, so you'll have to be more careful.Although this screwdriver isn't the smallest, it's still compact and weighs in at just over half a pound. It fits neatly in the provided aluminum box, which also houses a selection of 12 different bits. In case you lose any and need replacements, the screwdriver is compatible with standard sized bits. There's even a handy LED ring to illuminate whatever it is you're driving and it will recharge over USB Type-C.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
