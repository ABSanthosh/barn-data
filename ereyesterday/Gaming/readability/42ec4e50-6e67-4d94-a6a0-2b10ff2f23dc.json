Amazon has the Iniu 10,000mAh Power Bank with up to 45W of Power Delivery and a USB Type-C cable lanyard for only $13.49 after you apply promo code \"YJZEHJ8O\". This particular model has about 18,000 reviews on Amazon with a 4.6 star average.Iniu 10,000mAh 45W USB Power Bank for $13.49 Iniu 10,000mAh 45W USB Power Bank with Detachable USB Type-C Cable LanyardThis Iniu power bank boasts a 10,000mAh, or 37Whr battery capacity. If you factor in 80% power efficiency, here are the approximate number of times you can fully recharge each gaming handheld:Nintendo Switch (16Whr) about 1.9 timesSteam Deck (40Whr) about 0.75 timesApple iPhone 16 (14Whr) about 2.1 timesApple iPhone 16 Plus (18Whr) about 1.6 timesThe Iniu power bank has three output ports: two USB Type-C ports capable of up to 45W of Power Delivery and one USB Type-A port. The 45W of Power Delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch (18W) and Steam Deck (40W) at their fastest rate. It's also a solid choice for charging your Apple iPhone 16, since ChargerLAB has shown that the maximum charging rate caps at about 30W, even for the Pro Max model.This power bank also includes a 60W USB Type-C cable that stows away as a handy and durable little lanyard. This is arguably more useful than a built-in cable where one end is permanently attached to the power bank, because it can be detached and used with other devices as well.What about the new Nintendo Switch 2?The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, and while you’ll obviously be able to take it on the go, Nintendo is only claiming a minimum of 2 hours of battery life in intense games. That’s definitely enough for a morning commute, but if you want your Nintendo Switch 2 to last through longer flights or even just away from a wall outlet, you’re going to need a solid power bank. Check out our favorite power banks for the Switch 2, although I would say the Iniu power bank in this article is a solid choice in case the Switch 2 ends up being able to accept a more powerful charging output than the 18W Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
