Alongside $92.4 million internationally, Captain America: Brave New World is looking at an estimated $192.4 million global weekend.According to Deadline, Captain America: Brave New World had a production budget of $180 million, and has a break-even point of around $425 million global box office.To put Captain America: Brave New World’s early days performance into context, it’s secured the fourth-best Presidents Day launch on record, behind three other superhero movies: Black Panther ($242 million); Deadpool ($152 million); and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania ($120 million). Every MCU Movie Tier ListEvery MCU Movie Tier ListCaptain America: Brave New World’s opening haul comes amid poor reviews. IGN’s Captain America: Brave New World review returned a 5/10. We said: “Captain America: Brave New World feels neither brave, nor all that new, falling short of strong performances from Anthony Mackie, Harrison Ford, and Carl Lumbly.”All eyes are on Captain America: Brave New World to see if it has enough staying power to reverse a negative trend for Marvel Cinematic Universe movies (apart from last year’s hugely successful Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine), and build momentum going into Thunderbolts* in May, and The Fantastic Four: First Steps in July.Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
