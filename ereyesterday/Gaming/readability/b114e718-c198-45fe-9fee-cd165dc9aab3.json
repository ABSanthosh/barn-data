While the series will center around a new Slayer, Gellar would feature as a recurring character. In addition, Academy Award winner Chloé Zhao, known for her films Nomadland and Eternals, is in talks to direct and executive produce the reboot. Nora Zuckerman and Lila Zuckerman, meanwhile, will write and serve as showrunners to the show. Original series creator Joss Whedon is not involved in the reboot.While Whedon was in charge of the original run of Buffy the Vampire Slayer as well as the movie the TV show was based on, he was accused of creating a toxic work environment during production of the TV show as well as its spinoff, Angel. No word yet on the plot details for the reboot other than the focus on a new Slayer and that it could feature Gellar reprising her role as Buffy.The series centered on Buffy Summers, a high school Slayer chosen by fate to battle demons, vampires, and other supernatural entities. She was joined in her fight by her friends Willow Rosenberg and Xander Harris, as well as a Watcher named Rupert Giles.Buffy the Vampire Slayer ran from 1997 to 2003 over seven season. A spinoff titled Angel was also produced at this time, and the series was officially continued through a series of canon comic books.Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.In This Article",
