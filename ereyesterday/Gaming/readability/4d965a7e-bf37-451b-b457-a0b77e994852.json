Through playtests, designers like Jeremy Crawford are able to see how audiences engage with these new mechanics, and are able to make adjustments before these additions are canonized in core books. Supplements like Planescape and Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything were publicly playtested as Unearthed Arcana. The playtests have also been used to trial big edition updates D\u0026D 2024, which Wizards of the Coast released through Unearthed Arcana in June 2023 and received over half a million feedback responses. The 2024 Artificer release, however, is the first time the supplemental materials for the updated edition have been playtested in this format. The Artificer class, which was created in 2019 for fifth edition, is a class which melds magic and science, using “ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects.” A large source of conflict from players surrounding this updated edition is its supposed backwards compatibility with the original fifth edition. Earlier this year, the D\u0026D Beyond virtual tabletop faced serious challenges integrating updated rulesets with older ones. Though the updated Player’s Handbook and Dungeon Master’s Guide has been met with general praise, independent designers have worked to fill the gaps Wizards of the Coast left in D\u0026D 2024, creating products like Subclasses Revivified.This new iteration of Unearthed Arcana signals that the team at D\u0026D is looking to build on the momentum of what Wizard’s vice president of franchise and product Jess Lanzillo called “an unprecedented print run.” It’s unclear how long these playtests will run, how many D\u0026D is planning on conducting, or what their final iterations might look like. Unearthed Arcana: The Artificer is available now on D\u0026D Beyond, with the feedback survey opening on December 24.",
