In lieu of that, here are the games we're all allegedly clicking on this weekend. BrendanA little bit of the foots-on-ball, I think. Rematch is the only multiplayer game in a while that has forcefully grabbed my attention. Imagine liking a sport! Madness. EdwinThis weekend I'm doing some reading around on the subject of generative AI, having reached a point in my coverage of such things that I feel the need to actually educate myself and do a proper Take. It may or may not be publishable, we'll see. Apart from that, I recently stumbled on \"abandoned arena shooter\" hate.net, which seems interesting. GrahamGraham has succumbed to Weakness Of The Body. JamesThis week I've been struck by a completely unprompted desire to play DayZ again. On my first attempt I ran through fields for 25 kilometers, went into an airfield, and was shot dead by someone I couldn't see. Sniff, it's just like how I remember it. JeremyI've noticed a certain emptiness in my life lately, that unyielding feeling that can only occur when I go for too long without engaging in a proper JRPG. I've had Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age on my Steam Deck for ages - perhaps it's time to finally go back to Ivalice and see what this update did to the original game, the best Final Fantasy that is secretly just a piece of reskinned Star Wars fanfiction. Balthier and Fran, I can feel them calling to me! MarkI transported a big box along the motorway yesterday. At one point, I got stuck in a surprisingly narrow gap between two slip-road barriers and caused a massive traffic jam. I promise I'll play games that aren't based around truck simulation soon, but it's a full phase at this point. Anyway, it's not a video game, but I'm also planning to watch Breaking Bad sequel movie thing El Camino this weekend. Maybe I'll keep my fingers on my mouse and keyboard, pretending that Aaron Paul's a not-quite GTA protagonist that's less cool than Wei Shen. Shen being the best not-quite GTA protagonist of all-time. Oh no, now I fancy firing Sleeping Dogs up. NicDogtide for me. Dogtide for thee? I can't make those sort of decisions for you, I'm afraid. OllieI'll be continuing to fail to get better at Rematch, most likely. Spliced with more Trackmania Cups Of The Day, and perhaps a bit of Clair Obscur and Elden Ring. For some reason in this playthrough of Elden Ring, the part that's pissed me off the most was this random-ass dungeon at the beginning of Liurnia, with nothing important about it at all. But the step-up in enemy level scaling made those Omens and Imps really fucking irritating. But you, reader dear, what are you playing this weekend?...",
