  "text": "Full Metal Schoolgirl is an exhilarating action-shooting game in which machine girls, armed and mechanized from head to toe, storm a giant exploitative corporation and wreak havoc with non-stop shooting and slashing. Two cyborg high school girls rise up to destroy Meternal Jobz, an evil corporation that rules over Japan in a not-so-distant future. The game releases on October 23. The player becomes stronger through trial and error The battle takes place in a 100-story skyscraper. Standing in your way are the working dead, corporate slaves who have been turned into cyborgs and forced to continue working even after their death. The floor layout and security systems, including traps, change every time you attempt to advance, so you’ll have to go through tons of trial and error as you make your way to the top floor. The machine girl can instantly transform her arms into weapons and wield them with ease. She gradually becomes stronger as she acquires more powerful weapons and modification programs (MODs). She can use firearms such as Gatling guns and shotguns, or melee weapons such as chainsaws and blades. Choose the right weapons according to the situation. If you get a game over, you’ll lose your weapons and equipment and will have to start over from the first floor. However, you can use the materials and rewards you obtained from defeating enemies, as well as the money you earn from your livestream(?!), to perform enhancement modifications and improve the basic performance of your Machine Girl. There are over 100 types of weapons and equipment. Power up your machine girl and player skill to destroy the president who awaits you on the top floor. “You there! Have you ever wanted to become a machine? Have you ever wanted to be reborn as a cute, lively girl? Have you ever wanted to become a famous streamer and make money? Have you ever been dissatisfied with your company and wanted to cause a ruckus at the office or factory? I’m sure you have, right? Full Metal Schoolgirl will make all your wishes come true. A huge exploitative corporation doesn’t give its employees days off and forces them to work even after they die. The only ones who can save them are the machine girls, fully armed from head to toe. This intense game takes place in the skyscraper of an evil corporation, where you engage in close -quarters combat in confined spaces. Fire guns, slice enemies into pieces with chainsaws, and destroy everything in sight. Fulfill your desires and relieve stress—that’s Full Metal Schoolgirl.” – Nobuyuki Okajima, Producer, Full Metal Schoolgirl A wardrobe of cosmetic DLC options Pre-orders for the digital version will begin on the PlayStation Store tomorrow.
