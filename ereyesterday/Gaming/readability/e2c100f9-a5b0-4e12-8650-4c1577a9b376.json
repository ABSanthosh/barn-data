  "text": "I will state up front, for those new here, that I harbor no small amount of resentment about legendary items and how they were initially implemented and carried on in LOTRO. In concept the idea was a pretty simple, even compelling, on the surface.  You were going to get an item… usually a weapon, but there was a whole deal about off hand weapons and shields and what if I am a hunter and I do both melee and ranged attacks or I am a runekeeper so I just haul around this funny looking rock or I am literally a bear so now what… that you would keep FOREVER… though they wavered on that a couple of times and there was an era when you would toss your family heirloom for a new one… and that item would grow with you. Because that is what heroes do!  They have a magic sword, or a spear and magic helmet, or a special black arrow, or a funny looking magical rock, that goes with them on their adventures, their constant companion fit to their very need. Sting! Glamdring! Anduril! Even Pegail’s father’s sword that got lost in the Lone Lands!  Every hero has one! He does go on about this sword And you are, after all, a hero!  All those NPCs say so, right?  And having that one weapon that you could engrave with a special name was supposed to make you feel more heroic. What Turbine did instead was expose the inherent flaws in a level based progression system where you constantly need to upgrade your gear as you move forward so you can keep slaying the next flavor or bear, boar, wolf, or orc. I am sure that there were a lot of options for them on the whiteboard.  They could have given your item its own talent tree.  They could have given you skills that improved your ability to wield the item as you leveled up. (Probably a different talent tree.)  They could have had the damn thing just scale with you the way heirloom gear in WoW did.  There wasn’t just one possible path here.  The destiny of the idea was not set in stone. What they did was go with what I think of as the “Bedazzler” option where you would get your weapon and then tart it up with studs and rhinestones and glitter to your liking… and then continue to need to do so every 30-90 minutes of game play forever after. I could have been okay with the rhinestones approach I suppose, if there wasn’t also the constant reforging requirement.  Your item would level up, you would get a message, and you would have to go back to the bedazzler NPC to reforge it… because otherwise it would stop progressing, a mortal sin in a genre where progression is everything. This is what I ended up calling the “needy baby” aspect of legendary items, the seemingly constant requirement to tend to them, to go back to a camp that had the right NPC so you could get it updated.  Then it was back to the grind. The annoyance of legendary items… and the pain of questing in Mirkwood… basically limited me to Moria for about a dozen years. The whole thing also broke a bunch of crafting options… who needs a weapon smith if everybody has a forever weapon… as well as squandering a possible horizontal progression path.  It is one of those things where I am not sure what I would have done in Turbine’s place, but the problems they took on with their choices were pretty obvious up front. Anyway, all of this got a big revamp a couple of years back, which itself was rife with controversy.  Fortunately for me by the time the 64-bit servers had shown up that had all settled down. I will say, up front… or as up front as I can be this far down… that the new system is better.  I will attest to that where ever you want. It doesn’t solve any of the wider game problems.  Nobody needs a weapon smith after level 45 still.  And some of the UI aspects of it are bizarre to say the least.  The choice to leave in all the UI for the old legendary item system seems just crazy. This is still here, on the menu, yet does nothing for new LIs Seriously, there is an entry on the main game menu for a system that isn’t even functional… because the new system is completely different. I have to allow for SSG being a small company, so they can’t do everything that somebody like Blizzard can.  But it still feels like they could have done a database operation to refund everybody’s legendary, replacing it with some stuff for the new system, rather than just leaving the old legendaries in game yet unusable. It was suggested that they needed to leave it there for returning players.  But if there is one thing SSG has demonstrated they don’t care about, it is returning players.  On August 31st they are drawing a line where anybody not active and paying attention is going to have characters left behind on 32-bit servers.  And, as noted, they could have done any number of things to seal off the old system rather than leaving it and its UI in game and useless. That doesn’t even get into how poorly the game guides you if you are a returning player.  I logged in my level 95 hunter, who had been wrecked by the Curse of the Valar level boost, and even knowing how the new system worked getting myself from obsolete items to the new set was a chore that involved using the wiki to find stuff. You can get past all of that.  It isn’t the end of the world.  It is just a half-assed job… though there is a bit of the Turbine heritage in doing things in a half-assed way.  LOTRO is an amazing accomplishment, a monument beyond compare, something that will likely never be achieved again in my lifetime… but there are a lot of rough edges. So what of the new system? Well, it retains the “bedazzler” model of tarting up your legendary weapon, but does so in a slightly more coherent way.  It also only makes you go back to reforge your items every 5-10 levels, depending on where you are in the level curve.  There is a whole table on the LOTRO wiki devoted to when to reforge, which you should glance at once in a while because the game itself won’t tell you. It won’t tell you directly in any case.  You’ll notice that mobs will start being tougher and tougher to kill as you level up.  That is the sign.  But it can be subtle.  I reforged at 91 then skipped up to level 106 where every mob was taking a lot of effort.  Then I reforged and landscape mobs were easy again. The various items you glue onto your weapon/rock/paw are focused on skills and attributes, so if you know what you want to emphasize you can find what you want.  The rest of us will just Google something like “red line hunter build” and copy what one of the few LOTRO fan sites left says… though SSG is about to break minstrels and hunters again, so there will soon be more out of date information about that on the web. The thing is that at lower levels at least… and my experience now stops at level 110… your legendary makes you a bit overpowered for at overland level content if you just expend the most minimal effort in keeping your weapon reforged and your shiny bits up to date.  Every once in a while there is a big reforge and you need to update all the items glued to your weapon, which means going back to the Elrond’s shop in Rivendell and buying the level 91 or 101 or 106 version of whatever you had before. You can also upgrade those items along the way.  I did so diligently for a stretch, but then found that just the base reforge and items were fine for what I was doing. My main issue with the new system is that it throws so much uneeded stuff at you and it isn’t really clear if you should just vendor all the junk… which I ended up doing in the end… or hang on to it for some other purpose. You get to a point where every key quest has some related items for you… and they are always for your class at least, I will give SSG that. A pity I needed level 106 items And for extra special quests you will get a token or other currency for the shop in Rivendell… which take up inventory space rather than going into your currency window, though given how crowded the currency window gets after level 100, maybe that was a choice… which can be used to buy extra special versions of the stuff you have slotted for a minor boost. The thing is you are constantly being handed stuff and most of it is of no value to you except as vendor trash… though it can take you a bit to figure that out. A word of mastery For example, you will end up with lots of class relevant but not perhaps useful to your build items which, as far as I can tell, you should just vendor.  But it says at the bottom that it disenchants into ancient script, which is the currency you need for that shop in Rivendell… so a hung on to a bunch of it while I tried to figure out how disenchanting was done. As far as I can tell, at some point past the gates of Mordor, where I stopped, that becomes a thing you can do.  But from level 46 to 110+ there does not appear to be any such mechanism and if you try to hold onto all the stuff thrown at you… well, you’re going to need a bigger bank. And then there the essences that get thrown into the mix.  You end up with piles of these too. What is your essence? Again, having just played from level 1 to 110, it seems like you do not have any use for these until you’re in Gondor and you start getting gear with slots to fill. Essence slots… though I am replacing them… You might suggest that the essences are not really part of legendary items, being that they seem to be for gear slots… except, of course, you get them as rewards for your legendary experience.  So the delivery mechanism is tied to the whole system. And while we’re on the topic of legendary experience rewards, I want to express my exasperation at whoever decided that a single row, horizontal scroll window that goes from 1 to 100. Seriously, who thought this was a good idea? A solution for redeeming a series of items over time is a problem that has been solved multiple times in much better ways. I have a screen shot of the Need for Speed World daily rewards UI, something that had to span 180 days for the gem hunt reward, but almost any other title with daily rewards over more than a few days managed to discover that combining both horizontal and vertical aspects to the UI helped out a ton. Anyway, I’ve been on about bad UI choices in LOTRO since launch, so I’ll just say this wasn’t their worst idea… but it was still pretty bad.  (Also, the fact that only one claim button is active at a time, so you have to scroll not to the one with the bright pink, easy to spot bar but possibly one way off to the left if you let them build up… again… bad.) I know, gripe gripe gripe.  I will say that a lot of the choices made prove that SSG sees long term players with a character or five at level cap are their target demographic and not new players. That said, the whole thing is much more casual friendly than the old system.  You can, if you just reforge and re-populate out dated rhinestones at the critical reforge points, pretty much ignore everything else.  That will keep you going for solo overland content. Sure, it helps if you focus on the key attributes for your class and pick key skills to boost, but it feels like you can just set a pattern as you set out and just keep upgrading it.  I just focused on a couple of key skills plus agility and crit and watched the DPS of my bow go up and up when I remembered to reforge. My bow after the level 106 reforge Going above and beyond that seems to required only if you’re raiding or doing other group content. This is in contrast to the old system where there was a lot of random drop, non-obvious nonsense to deal with and you could gimp yourself with poor choices. Overall, an decent and useful system hindered by its UI and assumptions… but that applies to so much of LOTRO that it might as well be their brand.  It did simplify things for casuals, which is a huge plus and really what was needed, while leaving most of the depth for people who want/need to maximally optimize their character.",

date information about that on the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing is that at lower levels at least… and my experience now stops at level 110… your legendary makes you a bit overpowered for at overland level content if you just expend the most minimal effort in keeping your weapon reforged and your shiny bits up to date.  Every once in a while there is a big reforge and you need to update all the items glued to your weapon, which means going back to the Elrond’s shop in Rivendell and buying the level 91 or 101 or 106 version of whatever you had before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also upgrade those items along the way.  I did so diligently for a stretch, but then found that just the base reforge and items were fine for what I was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy main issue with the new system is that it throws so much uneeded stuff at you and it isn’t really clear if you should just vendor all the junk… which I ended up doing in the end… or hang on to it for some other purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou get to a point where every key quest has some related items for you… and they are always for your class at least, I will give SSG that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_136634\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

to required only if you’re raiding or doing other group content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is in contrast to the old system where there was a lot of random drop, non-obvious nonsense to deal with and you could gimp yourself with poor choices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, an decent and useful system hindered by its UI and assumptions… but that applies to so much of \u003cem\u003eLOTRO\u003c/em\u003e that it might as well be their brand.  It did simplify things for casuals, which is a huge plus and really what was needed, while leaving most of the depth for people who want/need to maximally optimize their character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
