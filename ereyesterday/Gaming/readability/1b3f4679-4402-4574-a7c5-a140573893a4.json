  "text": "The Asphalt series is kicking off its 20 year anniversary, and celebrating two decades of spectacular races with a season full of surprises! Since its first start on the track with Asphalt GT, back in 2005, the Asphalt series has been constantly at the frontline of arcade racing for 20 years! Over the course of 9 main line titles, including 12 spin-offs and adaptations, we’ve helped define the meaning of speed alongside our fans, who have gone behind the wheels of over 1,000 cars through the series. It’s been a wild ride and, this year, we want to take some time to celebrate 20 years of racing alongside our fans and across the entire franchise, including both Asphalt Legends and Asphalt 8: Airborne! Asphalt Legends will be the first to kick off the celebrations and is gearing up for a whole season of celebration, including devising some special surprises that will both bring nostalgia and something radically new to the racetrack. Anniversary Track Our first new track of the year will teleport you through time, as we visit some iconic locations for our series’ long-time fans – all contained within a single race. Coming straight from memory lane, we’ll warm things up with an updated version of San Diego Harbor. Our fans will definitely be able to recognize its layout as it is one of the main tracks of Asphalt 8! We’ve brought it back to life and taken advantage of our more powerful engine to also give it a more cinematic feel, as you’ll now find yourself riding down a rained down and overcast San Diego. Then, we’ll take a further step back in time and race down the LA river, which was also featured in Asphalt 6 \u0026 7. A brand new re-imagining of Sunny LA, bringing all the level of detail (and water effects!) that we could only dream of creating back in the day. It’s definitely a more niche call-out for our fans, but it really comes to show how far we’ve come! And of course, we’d be remiss not to include one of our players’ favorite tracks from Asphalt Legends: Cairo! We’ve also slightly altered the time of day on this one from our usual version, to give it a slightly different air and feel, and it’s the perfect capstone for our travel through time. A unique challenge for the team, not only did we have to rebuild all three of these tracks from scratch to take advantage of Asphalt Legends’ more powerful engine, but we also had to devise the technology which allows us to switch between such drastically different environments mid-race. This one-of-a-kind track will offer a medley of fan-favorites, as racers will teleport seamlessly from track to track while chasing their own nostalgia. Season of Celebration The entire season will be a celebration of Asphalt’s legacy, and will be jam-packed with amazing events, such as an all-new Drive Syndicate! It’s our star event of the year, as it offers a new chapter in the story of the Drive Syndicate, and features the most powerful cars of the year! This edition will feature the new Arash Imperium, whose speed will do more than just turn heads. We’re really pulling all the stops for this one – our team created a fantastically intricate series of events that will feature 20 cars for players to chase after and collect for their garages, featuring some powerful new additions alongside some fan-favorite classics. And don’t miss out on joining our community celebrations either, as we’ll have special editions of our ACE Challenges, pitting the best of the best against one another in some live races and rewards, and daily redeemable codes that will feature free goodies for you to claim during the anniversary! Get the Best with Game Pass Of course, you can complete the victory lap by claiming even more rewards with your Game Pass! Just make sure to link your Asphalt account to your Xbox account with an active Game Pass subscription and you’ll be able to claim the following rewards from July 30 to August 28: Unlock the Acura NSX GT3 Evo for free. 10 Card packs. 500,000 Credits.
