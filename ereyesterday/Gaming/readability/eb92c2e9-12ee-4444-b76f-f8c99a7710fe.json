  "text": "Toymaker: Threads of Joy is a management game where you are running a little toy shop where you create plushies for the customer. These toys are primarily plushies created using patterns, stuffing, and fabric. You can open your shop and see what customers come inside, figuring out what they want and how you can help them out. Sometimes, customers know exactly what they want in Toymaker: Threads of Joy. Other times, they are more vague and can give you sort of hints as to what they’d like. You will need to watch your supplies, as these are limited and you’ll need to purchase more at the end of each day by checking out other local shops. So, it’s important to work within your supply limit while also giving your customer what they want. When it comes to making your toys, you can pick out the pattern and the color of the fabric before cutting it out and then using the sewing machine to sew it together. This feels very tactile as you speed up the machine and move around the pattern. From there, you can pick stuffing and cram it in your new toy, but putting in too much will cause the plushie to explode! You will also be able to add any accessories and then price your plushie. If it’s one the customer likes, they will purchase it. If not, you can place it in your shop window and hope someone else will come along. The shops also have different items and accessories, which can upgrade the toys you make. Toymaker: Threads of Joy feels like a really fun game, though I only got to play a demo at Indie Dev Day, I really was interested in playing more. It seems like, in the later parts of the game, you can unlock more locations to explore and even take classes to increase your ability to create the toys that you sell. Toymaker: Threads of Joy is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can add it to your Steam Wishlist.
