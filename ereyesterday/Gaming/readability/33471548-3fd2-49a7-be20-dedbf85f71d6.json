  "text": "The day has arrived, there is a new splash screen… well, that has been there for a few days now… and the update is complete so the Revenant expansion is the new reality in EVE Online. EVE Revenant has arrived Over at Massively OP they did the math and declared Revenant the 50th expansion for the game.  And if you look at the Wikipedia entry, there are 50 names on a list.  But if you go to the EVE Uni Wiki and look at the content of some of those expansions… well, I’d say it was more like 50 named updates.  CCP has been somewhat erratic over the last decade as to what constitutes an expansion. To celebrate the expansion, there is an array of login rewards, 14 days worth, which includes one of the new skills introduced with Revenant. Revenant login rewards In addition, there is the usual 7 days of free Omega time, though with a bit of a twist… They are giving you 10 PLEX and then offering 7 days of Omega for 10 PLEX.  I am sure somebody did some calculation that assured them that making people do two steps to claim the time would make a line go up somewhere. Your New Eden Store Goodies Also, today is Tuesday, so if you go Omega then there might be a free 15K skill point vial in the store as well.  AND, if it has been more than 30 days since you last logged in, you will also get an additional 7 days of Omega, so you can collect all 14 days of the login rewards.  (On my one Alpha account I plan to just hold out for seven days before I activate it, as once you do all past login rewards for Omega become available.) Edit: And Twitch drops!  Must not forget about the Twitch drops!  CCP loves Twitch drops! What are we getting with the Revenant expansion?  On the one hand, I feel like it isn’t very much relative to the past few expansions… I guess CCP had to spend all summer finishing Equinox…  and yet it is more than I want to try and cover in a single opening post.  So, as is my usual pattern for these days, these are the highlights with links below. Mercenary Dens These are deployable structures that can be anchored at Skyhooks… the Equinox custom’s office replacement that are required for all the new supply dynamics of null sec… but only on temperate planets and only one per Skyhook.  They earn bonds (encrypted infomorphs I guess, but like ESS bonds, you have to turn them in) that you need to redeem in Zarzakh.  That earns you LP I guess that can be used to buy the new ships and weapons.  Also, the blueprints are in Zarzakh and there are skills you’ll need to train to use them, and at some future date there will be escalations associated with them that can earn you more Zarzakh goodies. As noted above, CCP was so confident in their Zarzakh plan that they gave us the new Mercenary Den Management skill with the first day’s login rewards.  But, no gift is ever really free, and for this one it turned out I needed another skill before I could use it. Criminal Connections… how did I not have that? Since I don’t go to Zarzakh, I suspect that my main interaction with Mercenary Dens will be shooting them, as they will generate kill mails, though they have their own reinforcement timer.  Also, at least in the Imperium, friendly dens will be allowed so people can farm the bonds and get the new stuff… so maybe I won’t even see kill mails. My level of interest: Negligible until I get to shoot one Zarzakh Ships The expansion brings with it two new ships, so at least there is something out there to stir up the meta and be way too expensive for a while and to celebrate when the first one dies.  Then we’ll discover they are either way underpowered, and people will ignore them, or they will be way overpowered and CCP will need to nerf them. Both ships, like many pirate faction hulls, require skills and accrue benefits from two of the empire factions.  In this case, these are Caldari/Minmata hybrids. The first ship is a destroyer called the Tholos. The Tholos arrives I won’t go into the fittings, but the overall traits give you a sense of what it is about. Caldari Destroyer bonuses:  7.5% bonus to Shield Booster amount Minmatar Destroyer bonuses: 5% bonus to ship Stasis Webifier resistance Role Bonus: 150% bonus to Small Projectile Turret and Rocket damage can fit one Small Breacher Pod Launcher can fit Covert Ops Cloaking Device 100% reduction in Cloaking Devices CPU requirement cloak reactivation delay reduced to 15 seconds immune to all cargo scanners A covert ops webbing destroyer that can fit the new Breacher Pod weapons system, which I will get to soon. Then there is the Cenotaph, which is a hybrid Caldari/Minmata battlecruiser. Here comes the Cenotaph Caldari Battlecruiser bonuses (per skill level): 7.5% bonus to Shield Booster amount Minmatar Battlecruiser bonuses (per skill level): 5% bonus to ship Stasis Webifier resistance Role Bonus: 100% bonus to Medium Projectile Turret and Heavy Assault Missile damage 50% bonus to Command Burst area of effect range 25% bonus to Medium Projectile Turret optimal range and falloff and Missile velocity can fit one Medium Breacher Pod Launcher can fit Covert Ops Cloaking Device 100% reduction in Cloaking Devices CPU requirement cloak reactivation delay reduced to 15 seconds immune to all cargo scanners As with the Thalos, the Cenotaph is covert ops ready, which I guess means it can be bridged by a black ops battleship, and it will be the vehicle for the medium Breacher Pod weapons system. My level of interest: Unlikely to ever fly one, but look forward to shooting one Breacher Pods – DOTS Come to New Eden This is a new, short range weapons system (6km max range for the small, 12km for the medium) that applied damage over time to a target.  But, in order to make it both useful and not completely OP there are a bunch of details around how it applies, so I am just going to quote CCP. Revenant brings an exciting brand-new weapon system and the first instance of a damage over time effect in EVE Online! Breacher Pod Launchers come in two sizes, small and medium, and can only be fitted on the new deathless ships – the Tholos and Cenotaph. Breacher Pod Launchers do not consume a launcher or turret hardpoint, and fire SCARAB breacher pods at their targets. If a breacher pod hits a ship, then it’ll apply a damage over time effect. The Scarab Breacher pods are similar to missiles, they will not affect their target unless they actually reach and hit, and can be killed with smartbombs before they arrive. Breacher Pods can only be used on player ships and NPCs, they cannot be used against targets such as capsules, structures, stargates etc. The damage over time effect from breacher pods does not use signature radius or tracking like other weapon systems in the game, instead, they apply damage every second based on the targets total hitpoints (raw Shield, Armor and Hull HP combined) or a flat damage cap number, whichever one of those two is lower. This means that a ship with incredibly high hitpoints like a Titan will always take the flat damage cap, but a ship with low hitpoints like a Corvette would always take the % HP damage instead. The damage over time effect lasts between 50 and 75 seconds depending on the users skill level, and once hit, it will not clear until a player leaves the solarsystem or docks up. It can continue doing damage while the player is in warp or while the player is tethered. The damage over time effect also completely ignores resistances, which means the effect will apply full damage to ships which have used modules like the Assault Damage Control and the Emergency damage Control. It also can apply damage to Rorquals and ships under the effect of the PANIC module. A player ship can only be affected by one damage over time effect at once. Getting hit with additional breacher pods will just add another effect which will take over when the previous one expires. Much like Command Bursts, if two players shoot the same target with breacher pods, then the player who has the strongest breacher pod effect will deal damage to the target, and the other one will remain inert unless the stronger effect expires. So there we go.  I look forward to dying horrible to this new weapons system at some future date. My level of interest: Just waiting to get hit by one SKINR Updates File this under “work left undone for Equinox.”   CCP, having flopped on the SKINR launch, the whole thing being expensive, inconvenient, and taxed into uselessness, is back for another pass to try and make this something players like. For Equinox we’re getting: Quality of life updates Making the Paragon hub less of a nightmare to use as a buyer Making the Paragon hub less of a nightmare to use as a seller Some new SKIN design capabilities A randomizer option Some SKINR related login rewards A brief window during which it will only take half of forever to sequence a SKIN Yet another skill to make the fees and taxes less onerous They also put an expert system in the store to get you the new brand skills… but for 50 PLEX to try out another billion ISK in skills I am not going to buy… probably not going to happen. My level of interest: I could start a Lime Green brand… but I won’t Still Trying to Make Corporation Projects a Thing There are some improvements here… even some good ones.  But, aside from my experimenting a bit with my high sec alt corp, I have had zero interaction with corporation projects, even though I know KarmaFleet has run quite a few.  They were just never for anything I did. My level of interest: Might ramp up if I see a project being used I guess New Ship Information Window CCP is going to roll the dice and see if they can change something and make it better, this time going after the ship information window. The Cenotaph example of the new info window I will have to see this one in play, but when they highlight making something “more immersive” there is often a side effect of making it more annoying to use.  We shall see.  But this is what they say we’ll be getting: Ship Display: The selected ship is always at the forefront of this design. A player can take in a 360° look at the hull in all its glory. Compact Mode: The window can now be re-sized to be smaller than the previous version. This allows a player to maximize information density without sacrificing usability. Immersive Additions: In-universe information on the ship’s designer and attributed quotes related to the hull have been added to flesh out its place in New Eden. Overview Tab: The Traits and Description tabs have been combined along with the previous header information to create the Overview tab. This provides all the most basic information for the ship in one place. In addition, you can view accrued killmarks for your ship within this tab. Attribute Tab: The information within this tab has been reorganized to help players navigate it more easily. In addition, derived values such as EHP and align time are displayed here to help provide context to related attributes. Skills Tab: The Skill Requirements and Masteries tabs have been combined. Any skill a player might need to fly a ship effectively can be found here. Fittings Tab: A shortcut has been added which opens the Fitting window in simulation mode, showing the ship and its applied fitting. Variations Tab: Variants within this tab now have links that open that hull within the Ship Tree. SKINs Tab: Players are now able to preview and apply SKINs directly from this tab. In addition, a shortcut has been added to open that ship’s SKINR Paragon Hub page. My level of interest: Might be heading straight for compact mode if CCP messes this up Module and Booster Icon Rework Some other graphical updates to try and make the impenetrable EVE UI… more penetrable I guess. The following module types have been given unique icons to help differentiate them: Heat Sinks, Gyrostabilizers, Entropic Radiation Sinks, and Magnetic Field Stabilizers Capacitor Rechargers, Capacitor Flux Coils, and Capacitor Power Relays Shield Rechargers, Shield Flux Coils, and Shield Power Relays All biochemical materials now have unique icons. The icons match the color and tier of the booster that they relate to. My level of interest: I’ll end up getting used to whatever they do… and I tend to use list mode in any case Glorified Mutaplasmids and Mutaplasmid Residue I just have to quote this one. All abyssal modules can now be reprocessed into mutaplasmid residue – this means that modules that you mutate that don’t have the results that you were hoping for or aren’t able to sell are still useful! Mutaplasmid residue can then be used in new blueprints found in regular abyssal content and from CONCORD Rogue Analysis Beacons to create 169 new, improved, glorified abyssal mutaplasmids, which are more powerful versions of the existing mutaplasmids found in the game. Just Keep Rolling! My level of interest: Seems okay, but I don’t really do abyssals Ship Balancing CCP is doling out nerfs for some… literally using the word “nerf” now… and buffs for others. The simplified list of winners and losers: Got Buffed Absolution Harbinger Navy Issue Myrmidon Navy Issue Stabber Fleet Issue Got Nerfed Cyclone Fleet Issue Exequror Navy Issue Vargur Details are in the expansion notes linked below, but I expect that ENI and CFI doctrines will be getting a revamp. My level of interest: I have only ever flown the CFI, and only once, and that went pop Pochven CCP is fiddling with the ISK printing machine that is Pochven.  Probably due.  People don’t seem upset about it, so it probably isn’t enough.  We’ll see. My level of interest: I only go to Pochven for structure fights Nullsec Combat Anomaly Graphics and Gameplay Overhaul I am just going to past this in from the notes. Several Combat Anomaly sites in nullsec have been renovated. All variations of the Forsaken Sanctums, Sanctums, Havens, Patrol and Horde sites have had full art and asset renovations Over 100 different nullsec anomaly sites now have an objectives panel. So you can now easily see what wave you are on and how many NPCs remain at a glance! Several NPC groups now warp in instead of spawning in place where appropriate. Since volumetric clouds are part of the graphical updates, please note that they can potentially impact performance when multi-boxing. To mitigate this, we’ve added a setting that disables clouds when low shader quality is selected. 4 new relic sites have been added in rogue drone nullsec, allowing intrepid explorers the opportunity to find and discover ancient salvage materials and other valuable rewards. My level of interest: I like the objective panel, but Foresaken Hubs… the only ones I run… will remain the same as they have been since I came to null sec in 2011 I guess… and I don’t live in Dronelands, so that last bullet does not apply to me Station Atmosphere Update A new controller has been added that plays atmo for the station based on race. New atmo plays on Amarr, Gallente, Caldari and Minmatar small, medium and large stations. My level of interest: I am require by law to ask “EVE has sound?” at any such mention So there we go.  I guess there is some meat on the bones of Revenant.  There is also an expansions highlight video, if that is your thing. CCP also did a live stream to talk about the new expansion titled Revenant in Focus which I will link at the end of the post, in case you want to hear them try to sell us on what they were going to give us anyway. The director’s chat talking heads One of my observations from this is that CCP Rattati was, among other things, absolutely not in focus, which I declared in chat to be a pretty blatant metaphor.  A metaphor for what is an exercise left to the reader.

\u003cem\u003eEquinox\u003c/em\u003e…  and yet it is more than I want to try and cover in a single opening post.  So, as is my usual pattern for these days, these are the highlights with links

bonds, you have to turn them in) that you need to redeem in Zarzakh.  That earns you LP I guess that can be used to buy the new ships and weapons.  Also, the blueprints are in Zarzakh and there are skills you’ll need to train to use them, and at some future date there will be escalations associated with them that can earn you more Zarzakh goodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs noted above, CCP was so confident in their Zarzakh plan that they gave us the new Mercenary Den Management skill with the first day’s login rewards.  But, no gift is ever really free, and for this one it turned out I

Breacher Pod Launchers come in two sizes, small and medium, and can only be fitted on the new deathless ships – the Tholos and Cenotaph. Breacher Pod Launchers do not consume a launcher or turret hardpoint, and fire SCARAB breacher pods at their targets. If a breacher pod hits a ship, then it’ll apply a damage over time effect. The Scarab Breacher pods are similar to missiles, they will not affect their target unless they actually reach and hit, and can be killed with smartbombs before they arrive. Breacher Pods can only be used on player ships and NPCs, they cannot be used against targets such as capsules, structures, stargates etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe damage over time effect from breacher pods does not use signature radius or tracking like other weapon systems in the game, instead, they apply damage every second based on the targets total hitpoints (raw Shield, Armor and Hull HP combined) or a flat damage cap number, whichever one of those two is \u003cb\u003elower\u003c/b\u003e. This means that a ship with incredibly high hitpoints like a Titan will always take the flat damage cap, but a ship with low hitpoints like a Corvette would always take the % HP damage instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe damage over time effect lasts between 50 and 75 seconds depending on the users skill level, and once hit, it will not clear until a player leaves the solarsystem or docks up. It can continue doing damage while the player is in warp or while the player is tethered. The damage over time effect also completely ignores resistances, which means the effect will apply full damage to ships which have used modules like the Assault Damage Control and the Emergency damage Control. It also can apply damage to Rorquals and ships under the effect of the PANIC module.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA player ship can only be affected by one damage over time effect at once. Getting hit with additional breacher pods will just add another effect which will take over when the previous one expires. Much like Command Bursts, if two players shoot the same target with breacher pods, then the player who has the strongest breacher pod effect will deal damage to the target, and the other one will remain inert unless the stronger effect expires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo there we go.  I look forward to dying horrible to this new weapons system at some future
