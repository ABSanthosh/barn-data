Lord of the Rings Online I remain a little mystified by SSG’s feigned surprise at the popularity of the transfer option.  They themselves explicitly stated that the new 64-bit servers would deliver an improved gaming experience… an important consideration given that server lag has been a large and unresolved problem for a few years now… with at least the implication that the life of the old 32-bit servers would not be forever.  The statement in the FAQ was vague at best. Whatever, I have some characters who have crossed the great divide and have arrived on Glamdring.  So, as the title says, now what?  Why did I bother since I have been rolling along so far with freshly rolled characters? A good question.  One of the characters I transferred over was a level 52 hunter.  If I am up to speed on the hunter mechanics I could just pick up with him and be into Moria and past all of the initial content. And I might do that.  But for the moment I am enjoying getting back into the game in some very familiar areas.  That option is open to me should I want it though.  I also have a late 40s champion, and late 30s guardian… who had the same name as my level 1 guardian, so I deleted the level 1 and gave the transferee the name… and a couple other characters.  Six in all were transferred, bringing my total on Glamdring up to 9 characters after deleting the level 1. So I have options. What I actually had in mind when transferring the lot over from Landroval was their crafting skills.  Whenever I played these guys… and honestly, I’ve had so many generations of characters at this point it is all a blur… I went all in on crafting so they have most of the key production skills covered up through level 50 or so. Crafting Supreme Bows, weapons, jewelry, armor, these guys can make it all. As an added bonus, I also got the shared storage tab from my Landroval characters.  I was not sure how that would work out and the SSG FAQ about transfers isn’t exactly specific about it.  But since I had not upgraded any storage on Glamdring, I just got what was on Landroval. And that shared storage is loaded with crafting material.  Granted, it is often the WRONG crafting material, since somewhere along the line they revised the materials needed from many recipes.  Some of those items I can process back into something useful, others I cannot.  I had, for example, a pile of bow staves stored away for making bows and… those look to all be vendor bait now.  No way to reprocess them.  Wooden weapon hafts though… those I can reprocess. My idea was that I could keep whatever character I run forward with away from crafting… except for harvesting, I’ll do that… and supplied with at least a constant stream of upgraded weapons.  I am bad at upgrading gear.  I went forever before replacing the carrot on a stick in my trinket slot back in WoW.  But I always have my eyes open for a weapon upgrade, my theory being that you don’t need great armor if the mob is dead already. One thing that did surprise me in a good way was the merged wallet.  Somewhere along the way they changed it so that you share much of your currency with your characters on the same server, so I suddenly had some more stuff to spend. The wallet on my fresh hunter I am not sure what some of those even do, but this might encourage me to go check out a couple other old servers where I have characters stashed away to merge them into Glamdring.  Might as well put all my resources behind one effort. The skirmish marks and medallions will come in handy later as you can buy gear upgrades with them.  I want to say that I have never been much on the whole skirmish thing, but look at all those marks I earned.  Apparently I was at least a bit into it at one point.  I will save those for later, once I out-run my ability to craft gear upgrades. I actually did the skirmish intro before the transfer went through, so was already remembering the usefulness of marks.  Now I have a pile to work with. Meanwhile, out in the world I made it through the quests around Bree, headed into the Old Forest, did a bit there… enough to progress the epic storyline… and met up with old Tom Bombadil who sighed at my arrival with a “you? again?” look on his face before agreeing to once again see me off to The Great Barrow. Sure it is a pretty good barrow, but is it really a “great” barrow That went pretty fast… though, again, with a good bow most of the mobs dropped in a couple of shots.  Soon I was to the final guy and then Bombadil, sensing his cue, showed up to rescue me for what he no doubt hoped was the last time and brought me back to his house. Bombadil waiting impatiently at the far end of the chamber Then it was back to Bree for the “sorry, Strider has left” segment, then the very strange bit where you speak with Gandalf and he teleports you to Rivendell.  That quest wasn’t always there, and it still seems strange to me.  Sure, go talk to Elrond and meet some of the fellowship, that is cool.  But you can’t really do much as the whole area around the place is above level. So I did what I could, got the stable master point, then recalled back to Bree where I picked up the epic quest chain again which takes you to my most favorite zone… or the zone I have probably spent the most time in, the Lone Lands.  It was time to visit that inn of ill repute and get stuck into the usual suspects. There it is, beyond the detail line of the draw distance, that famous inn How fast can I burn through those quests?",

segment, then the very strange bit where you speak with Gandalf and he teleports you to Rivendell.  That quest wasn’t always there, and it still seems strange to me.  Sure, go talk to Elrond and meet some of the fellowship, that is cool.  But you can’t really do much as the whole area around the place is above level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I did what I could, got the stable master point, then recalled back to Bree where I picked up the epic quest chain again which takes you to my most favorite zone… or the zone I have probably spent the most time in, the Lone Lands.  It was time to
