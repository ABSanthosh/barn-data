We’re highlighting the exemplary work from studio powerhouses the world over across 19 categories. All help shine a light on the creatives whose hard work and exceptional craft has made this year’s gaming experiences so vibrant: amazing gameplay, memorable characters, exceptional art direction, unforgettable soundtracks, and much more. The selections in each category are extensive, and you’ve further choice via the write-in option in each to add a title that, for you, best represents that category this year. As ever, the only votes counted in these awards are those cast by you, the players. Those games earning the majority votes by polls close will be recognised with Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum PS Blog trophies when we reveal the results in a few weeks.   As ever, there are some guidelines regards the categories and their nominees: Best PS5 Game category is defined as games that have been newly released this calendar year, rather than previously released titles with new updates. As with the majority of the other categories, Best Multiplayer Experience focuses on titles released in 2024. Best Ongoing Game focuses on titles that have seen new, large-scale content or game-changing updates launch over this past year. Best Rerelease refers to games that have been upgraded, ported, or remastered but are otherwise similar to their original game.  This category does not include full-scale remakes of older titles, which are eligible in other categories. Cut off for inclusion in this year’s nominees list was November 30. Titles releasing after this date aren’t eligible for inclusion, but will be eligible for nomination and voting in next year’s Awards. If a title won a Platinum Trophy in the Most Anticipated category any previous year, it won’t be eligible for inclusion this year to allow other titles a chance to shine. As such, Grand Theft Auto VI in The Most Anticipated Game of 2025 and Beyond category – as it earned a Platinum in that category in the 2023’s Awards. So, cast your vote in the polls below to support your favorite games and developers. Don’t delay though: voting closes next Friday, December 13 at 23.59pm PT. So scroll below and get clicking.
