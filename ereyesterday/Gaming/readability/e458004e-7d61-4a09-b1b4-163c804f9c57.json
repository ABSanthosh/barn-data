  "text": "Image credit: Obsidian The Outer Worlds 2, the upcoming sci-fi FPS by Obsidian Entertainment will now be sold at $70 dollars, rather than the planned $80. This follows a statement by Microsoft confirming the U-turn earlier today. Those who have already purchased the game at the $80 price point on Steam will have the purchase refunded and re-bought at the lower figure. On Battle.net, those who pre-ordered the game will have their orders cancelled and refunded, and will have to re-buy the game. Those on Xbox and PlayStation will have the difference refunded in the upcoming days. This announcement was made on The Outer Worlds official social media accounts, with a cute in-universe statement and graphic. On the official Obsidian website, further explanation on how the price change will affect those who've already spent money has been provided. The Outer Worlds 2 - Official Gameplay Trailer Watch the gameplay trailer for The Outer Worlds here!Watch on YouTube The statement reads: \"We have received your SOS via skip drone about the pricing. As an organization devoted to making sure that corporations do not go unfettered, we have worked it out with [REDACTED] to revise the price of The Outer Worlds 2. While this will not bring peace to the galaxy, or even your local colony, we assure you all that we are here to fight for all colonies in every way that we can.\" The $80 price point for new games is a contentious topic. On one hand, with the cost of video game development increasing, many within the industry have stated price hikes may become the norm, such as former Sony PlayStation Exec Shuhei Yoshida. The other side of this coin lies with the consumer. Current economic conditions have lowered the disposable income available to gamers. As such, the concept of paying more for a single video game has proven to be distasteful for many. Many of the largest games this year have been smaller, cheaper indie titles like Peak. It's worth noting that some big publishers in the video game industry have yet to push a price increase across its catalogue. Back in May, EA stated it would not be increasing the cost of its games \"at this point\". For those excited about The Outer Worlds 2, it's a nice bit of news, and some extra cash in their pocket.
