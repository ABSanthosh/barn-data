Fantasy Critic League – Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games We left off with the week four scoreboard looking like this, with a few people at the top of the list with a single release. The standings for Week 4 One title does not a season make… unless it is a very good title I guess.  But since the last post there were some updates. Up front, two titles that were picked for 2025… are not going to release in 2025.  Those are: Football Manager 2025 [Picked by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane)] Estimated release date changed from ‘March 2025’ to ‘Cancelled’. Wonder Woman [Picked by Rusty Shackleford (Shilgrod), Counter Picked by Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss)] Note added: ‘Jason Schreier has reported this was rebooted in 2024 and is years from releasing’. For Football Manager 2025, which Sega publicly cancelled last week, Fantasy Critic League has suggested that the league manager should remove the title as it is ineligible under the current league rules and no points will count and it can no longer be counter-picked. Football Manager 2025 is in bright orange with warnings I have chosen to do that, and will do so on Monday, so at that time Cyanbane will have a fresh empty slot to fill.  I was going to just let Cyanbane drop the title, but the warning I got at least implied that might not be possible.  Hazard of the league.  The only other option offered was to alter the league rules in such a way that would remove the title, so I have chosen the most simple alternative. Then there is Wonder Woman, which was not cancelled, but which got the above news about the title being rebooted in development.  So it could technically ship this year, but most likely won’t.  Because the title has been counter picked, the owner cannot drop it so it looks like Bhagpuss chose wisely for his counter pick. There were also some new scores announced. Sid Meier’s Civilization VII [Picked by TAGN HQ (Wilhelm)] Now has a score of 81.9 Kingdom Come: Deliverance II [Picked by Slightly Scuffed Studios (Kluwes)] Now has a score of 89.0 As noted, Civilization VII does not even ship until Tuesday, having only been released as Advanced Access last week, but reviews were already being published and tallied.  Those will go into play once the game ships.  Kingdom Come: Deliverance II however, both put up a score and was one of the titles to ship in week 5.  The titles that shipped were: Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has released! Rift of the NecroDancer has released! Both of those titles were picked by Kluews of Slightly Scuffed Studios, making them the first person with two titles on the board… both with strong scores, which elevated them into first place. The standings for Week 5 Potshot is still projected to be the eventual winner, but a lot of titles have to ship before that feels anything more than ephemeral. Finally, there were only two bids in play this week. Mouse: P.I. For Hire Won by TAGN HQ (Wilhelm) with a bid of $6 Killing Floor 3 Won by Slightly Scuffed Studios (Kluwes) with a bid of $3 Dropped game ‘Lies of P: Untitled First DLC’ conditionally Mouse: P.I. For Hire became the 7th of my 9 possible picks for this year, while Kluwes swapped out Lies of P: Untitled First DLC for Killing Floor 3 as a conditional bid. Coming up next week there is only one release on the board.  Civilization VII will release, giving me my second title.  That, if I am lucky, may vault me into third place.  But the reviews are not all in and over on Steam the title is showing up as “mixed” with only 51% of the over 9,000 reviews being positive.  EuroGamer was scathing in their two star review.  That might not be a good omen. Coming Releases for Week 6 and beyond After that we will have to wait a week before two more titles hit their release date. So it goes.
