  "text": "It’s time to pack your whip, don your hat and embark on a journey in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, available in early access today for Xbox Series X|S consoles and Game Pass. While life’s greatest adventures rarely come with a manual, a little guidance here and there is often welcomed. As such, the Wire team has assembled some handy, spoiler-free tips, tricks and pointers to get you started on your escapades. Sights, Camera, Action The greatest mysteries and perplexing puzzles require documentation, and that rings true throughout Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, in which snapping photos is key. Once you’ve arrived in the Vatican, you’re given the opportunity to purchase a camera, a tool that comes in extremely handy during Indy’s escapades, not just to progress the story, but to gain experience that’ll unlock new perks and skills. Virtual Tourism When you’re in an area that contains a historical artefact or point of interest, a camera prompt will appear on the screen. Take that as a sign to stop and absorb your surroundings, and look for notable design, artefacts or items to get a quick snap of. Doing this contributes to your Adventure Points, which – when combined with the various knowledge books that you’ll find or purchase throughout the world, can be spent on upgrading your skills, everything from melee abilities to stamina capacity. These will come in super handy if you’re enjoying being creative with the vast range of melee options on display. Helping The Locals As you navigate through lively streets in several locations, you’ll hear the mumblings of NPCs discussing notable landmarks, or people that they’d like a visual reminder of. Pay close attention, as capturing photos of those places and characters and handing them back to the characters who mentioned wanting that visual can rack up those Adventure Points. Never Be Empty-Handed While Indy can and will use just about anything he can get his hands on as a weapon- shovels, dustpans, wooden spoons, flyswatters, hammers… sometimes you’ll find yourself… empty handed. Not really though! While your trusty revolver doesn’t have a silencer, it does have a quiet mode, by pressing X while your handgun is drawn, Indy will flip the grip, allowing for an effective pistol whip. A word of warning, he can only thwack a fascist a handful of times before the gun will get bent out of shape. Fortunately, you can fix it right up with those Repair Kits you’ll be finding all over the place. It’s Ok To Walk Away (for now) Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s levels are densely packed with secrets, puzzles, and treasure, and it’s well worth your time to chase down all the Mysteries, Discoveries, and Fieldwork you encounter, both for the rewards they yield, and the fact that they’re just plain fun to do. While players will usually find everything they need to open containers such as locked chests close at hand, along the way, intrepid explorers are likely to run into locked doors, dead ends, or other mechanisms they just can’t figure out in the moment. In those cases, our counterintuitive advice: keep moving. Often times, following the main thread of a story will result in new areas becoming accessible, doors opening, etc. Additionally, areas teeming with enemies become much more welcoming as Indy collects disguises allowing him to fit in where his trademark fedora makes him stand out. Even better, characters will let you know when you should tidy up loose ends in an area, so until that point, just go with the flow without fear of missing out. Brawn Over Brains While Indy’s (and therefore your) brain is certainly his strongest weapon, sometimes direct application of force is the best bet. In your travels, you may find little padlocked wooden boxes scattered. Don’t bother looking for a key when a hammer will do; if the reticle turns red, try smashing instead! Likewise, a sledgehammer is not only an effective weapon, it can also take down a fragile wall – so keep an eye out for crumbling masonry whenever you happen upon one. We hope our guidance proves helpful as you begin your own adventure in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, available in early access today.
