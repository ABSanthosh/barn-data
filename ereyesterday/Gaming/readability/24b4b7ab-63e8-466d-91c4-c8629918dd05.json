  "text": "Dogman95 is a ridiculous five to ten-minute dungeon crawler that packs almost every second with gags and jokes. The brave Dogmen have been sent into the labyrinth for as long as Dogmen have existed. Why? Largely to see what has happened to the other Dogmen who’ve been sent down there. Although apparently there IS a mission from your divine goddess, the Dogmaiden, to be found if you poke around long enough and don’t eat your rations too quickly. Given there’s only a handful of rooms in the labyrinth, though, your food stores should hold out, right? And if all of your foes turn away from you when you bark at them. Armed with a sword you don’t use and a powerful BARK that lets you interact with everyone and everything, you set off down there hoping to find your missing allies and whatever the heck the Goddess wants. This adventure will be extremely brief even if you’re not quite sure what you’re doing, but in that brevity comes so many funny moments and silly events that that no second is wasted. If you like totally ridiculous things, this game is absolutely full of moments that will crack you up. It excelled at blindsiding me with new jokes every few moments. It’s so much fun that I hate how much this article is basically boiling down to: it is very funny and I don’t want to explain much of it as it will ruin the fun. Dogman95 is so funny and short that I really don’t want to mess it up for you. Just look at the screenshots and decide if seeing a battle screen with three BARK commands for a dog knight seems funny to you and then go play it in your browser. I guarantee you weren’t going to have more fun with those five minutes doing anything else you’d planned to do today. Dogman95 is available now (for free) on itch.io.
