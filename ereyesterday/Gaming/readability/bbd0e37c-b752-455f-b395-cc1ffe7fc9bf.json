Patrick tried to get more info on the nature of the cameo, but Sandler stopped short of offering specifics.\"I've known Eminem for a long time and he's a great guy,\" Sandler said. \"And he came in and was funny as hell and was just — I think we just hung out a day with Eminem, and we just shot and shot and it was insane. He said a million things we can use and a million things where we're glad we have them on tape.\" Funny enough, this isn't even the first Sandler film to have Eminem show up. The rapper previously made a particularly standout appearance in Sandler's 2009 movie Funny People. \"He said a million things we can use and a million things where we're glad we have them on tape.\" Sandler also confirmed that golfing legend Jack Nicklaus will appear in the film, in addition to a number of other famous golfers that he didn't reveal. Patrick went on to tell Sandler that he heard a rumor that the film was aiming for a March or April release, possibly to coincede with the Masters Tournament. Sander said that wasn't true, and while he doesn't know \"100%,\" he targeted \"around July,\" revealing that it had just finished filming that day.\"Not July 4th, but we're trying to get it done in time for July,\" he said. \"You never know what's going to happen.\"We first learned that Happy Gilmore 2 was in the works back in March before Netflix announced in May that it had officially order the sequel. Arriving nearly 30 years after the first film, it's being directed by Kyle Newacheck from a script by Sandler and Tim Herlihy. Ben Stiller, Christopher McDonald, Julie Bowen, and Dennis Dugan will all join Sandler in reprising their roles in the sequel.For more on Sandler, check out our review of his latest Netflix stand-up special, Love You, which we called \"silly, sentimental, and another third-act slam dunk for Adam Sandler.\"Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.
