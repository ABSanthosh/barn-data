  "description": "Are you curious about how to reach the Inventor in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach? This NPC is relaxing all by his lonesome on an island, far from the rest of civilization. Oh, and trying to get to him is no mean feat due to the environmental hazards along the way.How to reach the Inventor in Death Stranding 2 - Inventor unlock and rewards guideThe Inventor can be found in Australia. Just like other NPCs in the game, he heads his own base/settlement, though he also happens to be an optional unlock. You won't be heading to his location early on as part of the main story, but you could opt to connect his abode to the Chiral Network to earn rewards. Inventor location, hazards, and what to bringTo unlock the Death Stranding 2 Inventor NPC, you must first be aware of his location and the items that he needs. First off, the Inventor himself resides on an island near the Mine North of F1:It's due north of West Fort Knot.The mine is actually where you get to activate the Monorail for the first time as part of a mission.The island is surrounded entirely by tar. That means your vehicle and cargo will sink, as will Sam if you're not careful.Moreover, the Inventor won't automatically want to be connected to the Chiral Network. Instead, you have to bring lost cargo that belongs to him--i.e. the item tag should say \"Inventor.\" These items can be found via the following methods:Like other lost cargo, you could find some left behind on the ground.You may check MULE Postboxes that might have this type of loot.You can take a look at the shared cargo screen in facilities. Some players may have left these wares inside. You can deliver these yourself to earn some extra likes. Option 1: Cross the tar seaIn any case, it's time to reach the Inventor in Death Stranding 2. The first method, which is actually the safest and quickest, involves crossing the tar sea. Now, you don't actually want to drive across the dark pool of gunk immediately, as that will cause your vehicle to sink.Instead, you must use the Odradek scanner to reveal safe sections in the area. These places have a yellow outline, which denotes that you can traverse them without sinking. Option 2: Zip across via the MonorailAnother method involves the use of the Monorail that you just unlocked, but this does require you to bring a bunch of materials such as chiral crystals, special alloys, and resins. Walk over to a Monorail junction/terminal and check how much of each resource is needed. You could donate all of them on your own or you could ask other players to help by requesting aid.Once the Monorail junctions have been fully repaired, you should see a prompt to traverse via zipline. You can just carry the Inventor's goods on your back or use a Floating Carrier. Then, once you're just above the Inventor's island, press the button to jump back down on the ground. Option 3: Build structures that help you get acrossThe third option you can use to reach the Death Stranding 2 Inventor requires the use of various contraptions. These can only be unlocked once you've progressed further into the campaign, specifically upon connecting the F2 South Distribution Facility. This nets you the PCC Level 2 item, which lets you build higher-tier structures.We recommend the Jump Ramp for this, as it allows you to leap high up into the air. This is best done while on foot or while driving the Tri-Cruiser--the Pickup Off-Roader is a bit too heavy. How to unlock the Inventor's rewardsOnce the island base is connected to the Chiral Network, you should continue increasing your reputation to earn more rewards from the Inventor. The best way of doing this is by doing delivery runs from West Fort Knot back to the Inventor's settlement--i.e. take delivery orders or grab shared cargo from other players.These are the goodies that you can unlock:Level 1 - Otter HeadLevel 2 - Stun BombLevel 3 - Remote Stun BombLevel 4 - Bola Stun GunLevel 5 - Inventor Hologram and Otter Hood backpack patchAs you can see, the Inventor's wares can really help you on your journey. The Otter Head, if equipped, improves your swimming capabilities in case you find yourself submerged in deep water. The other gear pieces, meanwhile, offer new ways to incapacitate your foes.That's everything you need to know about the Inventor in Death Stranding 2. If you'd like to learn about other mechanics in the game, we suggest heading over to our beginner's guide.Humanity yearns to be interconnected once more, and it's up to you to deliver the goods. If you need more help, then we've got you covered in our Death Stranding 2 guides hub.",
