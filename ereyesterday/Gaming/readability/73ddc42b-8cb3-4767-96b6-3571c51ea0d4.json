  "text": "The Gaze of Gaea is a weapon that was added to Vampire Survivors with patch 1.13. It looks like a green stag’s head, is capable of defanging enemies (making them deal no damage to the player), and you can evolve it into the Embrace of Gaea, which is an even more powerful defensive tool. However, the Gaze of Gaea can be a bit tricky to get and evolve.In this Vampire Survivors guide, we’ll walk you through how to unlock the Gaze of Gaea for any future runs and how to evolve it into the Embrace of Gaea.How to unlock the Gaze of Gaea in Vampire SurvivorsImage: poncle via PolygonBefore you’re able to unlock the Gaze of Gaea in Vampire Survivors, you first need to unlock The Coop, a horizontal map similar to the library that’s filled to the brim with chickens. To do this, you’ll need to pick up and eat 500 Floor Chickens over the course of your Vampire Survivors career.If you’ve been playing for a long time, you’ve almost certainly done this, and will just need to load into a map, find a chicken, eat it, and then quit. You should then get a prompt saying you’ve unlocked The Coop in the post-match screen. If you’re new to Vampire Survivors, however, this is probably going to take you a while to unlock. Just play the game normally and you’ll eventually get 500 Floor Chickens and unlock the level.Once you’ve unlocked The Coop, you need to load into the map and not kill any chickens for about a minute. This is obviously easier said than done, as you don’t have any control of your weaponry in Vampire Survivors. The simplest way to fix this problem is to select a character that doesn’t have any lethal weapons and then skip any level ups you can until the level ends.There are multiple characters across the DLCs that you could use for this, but we recommend Gallo, a relatively early playable character in Vampire Survivors that starts with the Clock Lancet. Once you load into the map, just avoid any roaming chickens until the screen starts to zoom in on you and you’re killed by a green stag that resembles the Gaze of Gaea. The timer on the map doesn’t start until you kill a chicken, so you won’t be able to track it by looking at your screen. Once you’re killed and the run ends, you’ll unlock the Gae of Gaea for any future runs.How to evolve the Gaze of Gaea in Vampire SurvivorsImage: poncle via PolygonYou can evolve the Gaze of Gaea by acquiring it on your run, leveling it up to level 8, and pairing it with the Parm Aegis passive item — which increases the invulnerability timer after you take a hit.The simplest way to evolve the Gaze of Gaea for the first time is to start back on The Coop. Pick a character that starts with a good, reliable area clearing weapon like the Whip, and kill some chickens. As you progress through the map’s timer and waves of enemies, the fences to the right will eventually disappear, and you’ll find a Parm Aegis on the ground that you can pick up.Once you have the Gaze of Gaea and the Parm Aegis, upgrade the Gaze of Gaea to level 8, wait for the timer to pass 10 minutes, and kill an elite enemy to grab a chest. You’ll then pull the Embrace of Gaea from the chest and unlock Gazebo, a chicken hero that starts with the Gaze of Gaea.The Embrace of Gaea functions similarly to the Gaze of Gaea, but it attacks in a radial circle and is able to deal retaliatory damage to enemies.",
