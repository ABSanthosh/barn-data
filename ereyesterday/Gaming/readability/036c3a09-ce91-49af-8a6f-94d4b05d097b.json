Anyway, you would think this move would have been easy.  We just moved from 1DQ1-A in Delve to UALX-3 in Tenerifis last fall.  Given that I still have boxes I haven’t unpacked from our last real life move in 2007, you might think I should have been ready to go. My Archon jumping towards our new home You would be wrong. Well, not completely wrong.  I did end up jettisoning a lot of stuff during the long march from Delve to Tenerifis.  I shipped a lot of stuff to Jita to sell and shipped a lot more stuff, including stripped and repackaged ships, off to Tenerifis via the hauling services.  I spent a lot of ISK… a lot of ISK for me at least… shipping stuff, though I recouped all of that and more by selling a lot of it in Jita. But then I settled in to the Keepstar in UALX-3, re-fit and re-rigged ships I had broken down, set up my planetary industry in a system some jumps away, put an Ishtar ratting alt over in another out of the way system because we were there to stay, right?  RIGHT? So it was time to consolidate everything again into one place and move it. That meant going out and collecting my last bits of PI and shutting down those operations. Turning of my planetary industry I got all those done and the support ships and remaining PI materials hauled back to UALX-3 where I was hoping to sell it off… but everybody else had the same idea and the PI market tanked. The move wasn’t that long.  Last time around, coming from Delve, we had six capital jumps with a regional gate crossing in the middle, so it took a while as things had to pile up on once side of the region gate, then there would be a crossing operation, then you could proceed once you had gotten your stuff across. Going from UALX-3 to C-J6MT was just four capital jumps… three if you had a jump freighter. The trip from Tenerifis to Insmother In what was undoubtedly a “penny wise, pound foolish” move, rather than spending another billion ISK on shipping charges, I spent 9.2 billion ISK on a jump freighter, the Amarr Ark, because I kind of wanted to control my own destiny in moving stuff. The new jump freighter at a mid point As I said before, the one side benefit is that jump freighters hold their value, so I could probably get my purchase price back out of it.  In fact, I was lucky I put my order in for it as soon as the move was announced, as there was a run on jump freighters soon thereafter, everybody having experienced a move last fall. That said, having the jump freighter is probably what made the move seem more difficult.  Rather than just stacking stuff up and making shipping contracts and letting somebody else do the moving, I actually picked up all of my stuff from four character and jumped it all to myself. Actually, the items, the stuff rattling around loose like ships modules and ammo and PI and random bits and pieces… I found a full set of mid-grade amulets when going through stuff… were not so bad.  That you can just pile in the jump freighter until it is full, then when a cyno op goes up, do the three jumps… because haulers do not accrue much jump fatigue… and off you go, jump, wait two minutes, jump, wait three minutes, jump and you’re there. The only drawback was in consolidating all the stuff from all four characters into one hangar pushed me over an item limit I did not previously know existed. Shelf space is a metaphor… but it all is, isn’t it? I had to go stash stuff back in various haulers, ammo in the hoarder, PI in the Epithal, and so on until I got below that threshold and could repackage some items that were not stacking. It was the ships that became the big pain.  The ones that were still packaged or that I could bear to repackage again and lose the rigs once more, those could also be tossed in the back of the jump freighter. The rest had to be hauled in the hangars of capital ships… of which I have three, and Apostle, an Archon, and a Ninazu.  They can haul a reasonable number of smaller ships, but when you get to battleships those take up enough space that you can get one in there and a couple of small ships and your full. And those capitals… they have to make all four jumps to go the distance at which point you’re at the 5 hour blue timer cap which means there is a 30 minute wait between jumps.  At one point I jumped the Archon back to the jump before UALX-3 then just shuttle subcaps to it because it turned out to be just two gates and a jump bridge. I waited for subcap fleets that were going to fly the full 18 gates between the ends of the chain without jumps or jump fatigue in order to move battleships and a couple of battlecruisers. A subcap move op at an Ansiblex That saved me some jump fuel and waiting around for jump fatigue timers to run down.  The route doesn’t take all that long.  You just have to stick together and warp as a group because hostiles know the route and are hanging around waiting for stragglers to pick off. A Damnation command ship over a lava planet So I did a number of those ops… pretty much every time one was available I got two characters in fleet and traveling with a group. The worst was just stuff I forgot.  I would do something like fill up the jump freighter, then strip and repackage a couple of ships to fill out the load, the forget about modules I stripped. I ended up sending out a blockade runner to go pick up some loose yet valuable stuff, then slipped back to one of the cyno chain systems and had a black ops battleship hop over. A black ops conduit jump with a blockade runner The black ops can do what is called a conduit jump, which takes it and any covert ops capable ship… which includes blockade runners… with it when it jumps. But after about a week of doing this for a while daily, I think I have everything moved to Insmother.  Well, everything I had in Tenerifis in any case. Now it is more waiting.  I want to set up shop, but we haven’t held the region long enough to start setting up infrastructure like jump bridges and the like.  That will come soon enough.  Then I will have to figure out where to setup PI again and where I might put my Ishtar ratting alt and all of that sort of thing. Empty PI slots waiting for new planets Until then I think my next post about the war and its results will have to look into who ended up living where.  I’ll get to that soon enough.",

so I could probably get my purchase price back out of it.  In fact, I was lucky I put my order in for it as soon as the move was announced, as there was a run on jump freighters soon thereafter, everybody having experienced a move last fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, having the jump freighter is probably what made the move seem more difficult.  Rather than just stacking stuff up and making shipping contracts and letting somebody else do the moving, I actually picked up all of my stuff from four character and jumped it all to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, the items, the stuff rattling around loose like ships modules and ammo and PI and random bits and pieces… I found a full set of mid-grade amulets when going through stuff… were not so bad.  That you can just pile in the jump freighter until it is full, then when a cyno op goes up, do the three jumps… because haulers do not accrue much jump fatigue… and off you go, jump, wait two minutes, jump, wait three minutes, jump and you’re there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only drawback was in consolidating all the stuff from all four characters into one hangar pushed me over an item limit I did not previously know existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_136566\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca
