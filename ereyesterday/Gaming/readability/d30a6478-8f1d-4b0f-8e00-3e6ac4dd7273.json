  "text": "Big discounts on Blue Prince, KCD2, Monster Hunter Wilds, and more. Image credit: Raw Fury I like to think I’m immune to sales like this, then Fanatical drops its Level Up Sale and my wishlist instantly turns into a shopping cart. And it's not just filler, either. These are standout games, including recent releases, with discounts deep enough to make me forget (briefly) about my backlog. Not only that, but this actually feels like a sale made for people who play games, not just hoard them. Big-budget RPGs, story-rich indies, custom bundles, it's all here. Plus, spend over £15/$15 and you'll get an extra select game thrown in for free. Fanatical Level Up Sale - My Top Picks For starters, and for very good reason, there's GOTY contender Blue Prince. Completely different vibe, entirely worth it in every way. Strategy, puzzles, weird horror undertones, and rooms that literally shift while you explore them. It’s the kind of game that doesn't explain much but still keeps you hooked. It also happens to be one of the cheapest things in the sale, which makes it dangerously easy to justify. That's how you end up buying it at 1 am because it's \"basically free.\" Plus, use our exclusive code BLUE8 to get it an extra 8% discount (22% off in total). That's valid until 3PM, on April 20th. Oddworld Complete Collection - £1 / $1 Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - £40.19 / $46.89 Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - £42.49 / $50.99 Monster Hunter Wilds - £47.99 / $55.99 Elden Ring: Nightreign (Pre-order) - £30.79 / $35.19 Blue Prince- £19.74 / $23.45 (Use Code BLUE8) There's also Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which is already getting a lot of my attention. I've missed this kind of pulpy, globe-trotting adventure, and it looks like someone finally gave Indy the budget he deserves. The game leans into puzzles, action, and dramatic hat-grabbing with exactly the sort of confidence you want from an ageing archaeologist who still refuses to retire. It's on a Fanatical \"Star Deals\", which means there's limited time remaining to grab the best discount possible. Monster Hunter Wilds is another great pick to consider. I didn't think I needed another Monster Hunter in my life, and then Capcom showed off that ridiculous shifting ecosystem and I folded like a cheap camp tent. It's already got that expensive-looking polish, and the Premium Deluxe version is on sale. I know I'm just buying it early so I can pretend I’ll have time to play it properly, but still. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is also in the discount mix, and I still can't believe how much I'm looking forward to a game that proudly describes itself as historically accurate. The original was janky in all the right ways, and this sequel looks like it might actually work out of the box. I went for the Gold version because I have no impulse control, and at 33% off it felt justifiable. Probably.",
