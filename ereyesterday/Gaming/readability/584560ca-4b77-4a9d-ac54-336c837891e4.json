  "text": "Death to collabs all the same, though Image credit: Blizzard Earlier this month Blizzard outlined their plans for Diablo 4 across 2025 that, notably, teased the action game would be getting a few collabs. They didn't mention what said collabs would be, just that they exist, to which I said \"ugh\", because, well, ugh, why does everything have to have collabs these days? The annoying thing is that Blizzard kind of nailed it with the first one, which just so happens to be with the iconic dark fantasy series Berserk. Yes, the same Berserk that is essentially half the reason we have Dark Souls, why Cloud has his giant buster sword, and why the dark knight role exists in Final Fantasy as a whole. The official Diablo Twitter (or Ex, or whatever) shared an animated teaser showing a very bald and bearded man wearing Berserk protagonist Guts' armour, swinging around his iconic sword too, but it didn't show off all that much more than that. My guess is that it'll be a cosmetic you can unlock at the very least, but perhaps there'll be some gameplay ramifications too. I'll still never be sold on collabs like these in games, they just feel like a cheap way to get people excited about Brand or Intellectual Property in a way that feels disingenuous. At the very least, Blizzard wasn't lying when they said that the collabs will feature \"universes that complement its dark themes.\" There's also no word on when the collab might be arriving in game, but it should be coming by July, as it's a part of the game's upcoming eighth season, Belial's Return. That kicks off April 29th, so you've got plenty of time to watch the beautiful original anime (and subsequently fulfill your destiny of complaining that the only animated follow-up it got were mediocre 3D efforts), and not so much time to read the original manga. Still worth a shot, I suppose.",
