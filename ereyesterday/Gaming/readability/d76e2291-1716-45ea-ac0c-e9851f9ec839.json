  "text": "The ultimate controller for streaming games on Luna.Amazon's Luna service has been around for a few years now, yet it still somehow flies under the radar despite boasting a robust catalog of games. With game streaming becoming more popular in 2025, it's a good time for people to start checking the service out. If you do plan to jump in and check out Amazon Luna game streaming, you'll want to grab the official Luna wireless controller. This is hands down the best way to play games on Amazon Luna as it provides a direct connection and has built-in Alexa integration. Amazon has the Luna controller on sale for $30 off the regular price as an early deal for Prime Day 2025, so hop on this great offer while it lasts.You can also choose to bundle the controller with a one-month free trial of Luna+ with the offer we've highlighted further down below. So if you've been wanting to try out the Amazon game streaming service for yourself, you can now do so at no extra cost.Early Prime Day Sale on the Luna Wireless ControllerAmazon Luna Wireless ControllerThe Luna Wireless controller is the perfect companion for playing games on its game streaming service, Amazon Luna. Similar to the defunct Google Stadia service, Amazon Luna allows you to purchase and stream games across a variety of devices including TV, streaming boxes and sticks, PC, Mac, and mobile devices.What makes the Luna controller a must-have is that it connects directly to Amazon's servers over Cloud Direct (Wi-Fi, basically), reducing latency by up to 30 milliseconds when compared to a standard Bluetooth connection. This is ideal for first-person shooters and competitive titles where every second matters.Since the controller connects directly to the game over the cloud, you can pause your game on one screen and move to another device seamlessly without skipping a beat. The Luna controller also features Alexa built-in, so you can ask Amazon's AI assistant to launch any game on the service for you hands-free.Aside from the Luna streaming service, the Luna controller also works as a standard Bluetooth controller. So, you can connect it to PC, Mac, phones, tablets, and more, to play games locally.What Is Amazon Luna+?Luna+ is a video game subscription service that allows you to access a rotating library of more than 100 titles to stream on demand across a variety of devices. It's similar to something like Xbox Game Pass, but without the option to download games locally.Since all you need to access Luna+ is Wi-Fi, you can pick up and play games instantly. Depending on your connection, games stream up to 1080p at 60fps. And, you don't need to purchase a separate device to play, since Luna+ is available on devices you already own like your mobile phone, tablet, PC, Mac, select smart TVs, and Amazon Fire TV devices. Includes 1-month Luna+ SubscriptionAmazon Luna Controller BundleIf you haven't tried Luna+ yet, you can score a free month with the Luna controller as part of a limited-time bundle using the deal above. And, Amazon Prime or Luna+ subscribers can also enjoy up to 80% off select games as part of Amazon's Luna Summer Games Sale, which ends July 11.Matthew Adler has written for IGN since 2019 covering all things gaming, tech, tabletop games, and more.
