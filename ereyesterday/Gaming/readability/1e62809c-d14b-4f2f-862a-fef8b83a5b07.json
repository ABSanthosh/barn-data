A beta version of the streaming feature will begin to rollout with the update before the day is out (a European release starts Wednesday) and will be available to those subscribed to the highest PlayStation Plus tier. It’ll allow PlayStation Portal owners to enjoy a catalog of more than 120 games regardless of if they have a PS5.PlayStation Portal update adds PS5 Cloud Streaming Beta starting today.PlayStation Portal streaming supports up to 1080p at 60fps depending on the game you’re playing and your streaming environment. PlayStation Plus Cloud storage is also supported, meaning you’ll be able to save your progress on your handheld and then jump back in, right where you left off, on your PS5. The cloud streaming beta will also support DualSense features such as haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, speakers, and the PlayStation Portal’s on-screen touch-pad.Once the beta is live, Premium subscribers with a strong enough internet connection can find the option to try out streaming for themselves in the quick menu’s settings option. From there, they’ll need to select “Cloud Streaming (Beta)” and then simply turn the feature on. This will add a new streaming option on the PlayStation Portal’s home screen.As PlayStation Portal’s foray into full-on streaming features kicks off with today’s beta test, Sony acknowledges that there is still work to be done. Some elements that aren’t available quite yet include game trials, streaming for purchased PlayStation Store titles, party voice chat and game invites for some games, the create button, 3D audio, and in-game commerce. Beta players who hop in today will also be limited to PS5 titles, and it’s unclear when PS3 and PS4 titles will arrive.In addition to cloud streaming support, today’s update comes with audio enhancements that include lower audio levels when the volume is set to minimum. Settings for PlayStation Link, Sony’s wireless audio technology, can also now be accessed in the PlayStation Portal settings menu. These aren’t quite as game-changing as cloud streaming, but they are still features that further refine a piece of hardware that fans have latched onto since its launch arrived late last year.So far, the PlayStation Portal has allowed players to use Remote Play to enjoy their favorite PS5 games over Wi-Fi. Sony said in February that the device managed to exceed its expectations, and even without cloud streaming features, we’ve found plenty to love, too. In our 8/10 review, we called the PlayStation Portal “the best PlayStation 5 Remote Play solution available.” If you’ve already picked one up or plan on grabbing one for the holidays, you can check out our list of its best accessories.Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
