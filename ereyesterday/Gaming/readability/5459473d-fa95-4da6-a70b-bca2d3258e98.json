  "text": "SummaryCapture monsters and level them up.Use their abilities to find secrets.Explore the open ocean and take down bosses. In Synth Beasts, you take on the role of a failed experiment – a “Synth” – who escapes from its creators’ lab on a mysterious island. While exploring the surrounding archipelago, you encounter other Synths. However, these are far from friendly, and you are forced to defeat them in battle. Upon victory, you unlock them as playable characters, gaining access to their unique abilities for both combat and world exploration. Using your Synths in combat earns them experience points, allowing them to level up. Each Synth has five levels of progression, with unique bonuses that set them apart. As your Synth’s level increases, it becomes more challenging to earn additional experience, so make sure to frequently swap between them to maximize your team’s potential and unlock more abilities! For example, the “Psitek” Synth can light torches right from the start. Then, once it reaches level three, it gains the ability to destroy projectiles with its fire slash – an invaluable skill for certain dungeons. However, beyond that, most of its level-up bonuses focus on enhancing combat. Because of this, it might be better to switch to another Synth in order to unlock new abilities without needing as many experience points! Early in the game, you’ll gain access to a boat once used by the scientists and it’s yours for the taking! The Genesis Archipelago is teeming with small islands to explore hiding bonuses like extra hearts, stat-boosting items, and currency to spend in shops. If you’re not the type to comb through every corner of the map, you can skip ahead to the main islands and confront the scientists directly to take down their sketchy operations. While the main islands feature boss Synths, many optional islands also be their home. Capturing all 40-plus Synths will be no small feat, but each and every corner of the Genesis Archipelago holds valuable rewards for those who seek them! Explore the Genesis Archipelago, liberate the Synth Beasts, and put an end to the scientists’ sinister experiments! Synth Beasts launches in 2025 on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and the Microsoft Store.",
