  "text": "I have a long tradition of posts about Lord of the Rings Online and the oddities of the game and its UI, starting way back with my review of the champion skill icons back in 2009… or maybe before.  Every time I come back to the game I am reminded that it was put together in a time where maybe WoW hadn’t completely determined the UI design meta, but was also built on top of Turbine’s past ventures, and thus inherited a bunch of quirks. Lord of the Rings Online I am not going to get on to my usual hobby horse of the UI on a 3440×1440 monitor… I’ll save that for another post… but instead run through things I imagine you’ll see no matter the resolution.  I have a list, because of course I do. Tab Targeting Tab targeting is a pretty well established feature in MMORPGs.  Some people love it, some people hate it, but it is a thing and it is one of the conventions that LOTRO attempts to adhere to.  But some days… it is just strange. Here is my usual situation.  I am out in some ruins, because Middle-earth is strewn from end to end with ruins, with one hostile mob visible straight in front of me and I will hit the tab key, because mouse clicking is for suckers, or so I am told and the game will target… some mob out of my direct line of sight off to the left of my screen. If I am not careful or not paying close attention, I will have already started an attack and only notice when my hunter fires an arrow 90 degrees off of my expected aim point. I expect this issue is more pronounced with a ranged class like the hunter, but even when I do notice it hasn’t highlighted my expected target, I do find that I sometimes have to cycle through to get to my intended victim. So I’ll tab and it will be the mob not visible to me off to the left… it usually picks left to start, except when it decides to start from the right… so I will hit tab again and target some mob behind a wall I didn’t even know what there and which I cannot possibly shoot because I do not have line of sight.  I hit tab again and find myself targeting some way below level critter… a field hare or some such… in the brush between the target and myself.  So I hit tab again and, if I am lucky and if there are no other mobs on the field, I’ll get my guy. But Eru Ilvutar help me if there are mobs all around and I tab mid fight to get a jump on an aggro mod hitting me with ranged.  That is when I most often see my arrow sailing off screen to the left to invite somebody new to the party. It is one of those things that seems to work better on other titles in the genre. EVADE! This one is likely just me.  LOTRO puts up floating damage and sometimes emphasizes the effect of your attacks with a word thrown into the mix, like “devastated” or some such.  But when they throw up the word “evade” or “evaded” my mind grinds its proverbial gears in reaction. Wait, what? This is because I have been trained by other titles… primarily WoW, but somebody else does this too I think… that a mob “evading” means it is bugged, can’t get to you, or is otherwise not able to be engaged. That reaction is so ingrained that my brain does this almost every time the word pops… which actually surprised me a bit, as I wasn’t sure my brain was able to keep up that well.  But then “evade” shows up and there it is. We Only Have Five Colors… and White… is White a Color? At some point in the past LOTRO joined the pack and put colors on the in-game map to show you where quest objectives are located.  I know this makes some people grumpy and they start saying “read the MF’ing quest text you lazy SOBs!”  But honestly, the quest text can be pretty vague at times, or reference things you might not understand because the person who wrote the text knows the quest intimately, with context that you’ll likely never have, while the poor noob in the game is left going “wut?” So we got markers on the map, with a color for each quest. Six quests in, we’re covered The problem is that somebody decided that five colors, plus white, was enough.  However, if you go into some of the zones… thinking about the Lone Lands or Evendim here… you can get more that six quests queued up.  And every quest after six… is just white. This is like the joke about counting on one hand, right? This is, of course, a problem only in zones where they load you up with quests at a hub, and maybe that is something that gets better in later expansions.  But for me, who has never been past Mirkwood… it can be a thing when you get several adjacent but not overlapping white areas on the map.  Not exactly a blocker, but I do keep thinking “there are more colors in the spectrum.” Progression of Deeds as you Level Up I mentioned this earlier in the week.  When you first start out in Archet or the Shire and you get your first deed, it is pretty neat and you only need, say, 20 spiders in the Shire to get a cool title, and 40 to get the advanced deed finished with the rewards that come with that. But as you move on that first number increases, and the advanced deed is always double, so you end up needing to grind a lot of mobs.  Not so bad when it advances to 40 or even 60, but you end up with 90 and 100 as your starting point and then you need a lot of mobs. Do you think I am made of tomb robbers? Now, this doesn’t go past 100, so 300 mobs total seems to be the cap, and in each expansion the initial ones drop down to 60 to start, so you only need 180 total, but you get setup so nicely back at the start with a 20 mob first run it feels like a bit of a rug pull.  Things will never be that easy again. Mouse Over Info on the First Try This might be another “just me” thing, but when I am out in the wild and mouse over a mob… this gives you some info about whether or not it is a quest objective or part of a deed you’re working on… the tool tip pops up then goes away in half a second, which is about half a second too fast for me to read the tool tip. Now, part of that is because tool tips are part of the UI that doesn’t scale… yeah, I’ll get to that another day… but it is so consistent that I am sure it isn’t because I am not mousing over the mob squarely.  I feel solid on this because the SECOND time I mouse over, the tool tip pops and stays up just fine. The Relationship with Water You can swim in LOTRO.  In fact, back in the day Evendim used to be the “swim to all the places” zone before Turbine discovered boats… and some connection to reality… so I do not, for example, ever worry about there being an under water zone, mariner class or not.  And then the game puts a quest in the water. Really? Down there? Technically, there is little in the way of me collecting the wreckage from the bottom of the river, but it does seem strange to make be float there and pretend my arms are long enough to reach.  And there are places in Annuminas where my arms must be several yards long to grab those coins or urns… and strong, as those urns are huge. Plus, we all look ridiculous swimming. Hanging out in the river Just don’t do that to us, okay? Loot Queuing I like that you don’t have to go loot every corpse.  That is a plus in my book, especially since I am playing through as a hunter so my kills are often a distance from me… if I am doing it right.  Still, there are some silly bits, like drops that trigger a quest. Oh my, those pile up I get it, since it is not yet in your inventory it is not yet yours, so the game doesn’t do any processing on it.  You might forget to claim the item or go ahead and delete it sight unseen. Also, the pending loot doesn’t grab the items you harvest.  You still have to interact with that window every time you chop some wood or mine some metal.  And that was what was getting to me.  Deep in the settings there is an “always loot all” option that is not selected by default.  Clicking that sends everything to your bags, saves a click when harvesting, and gets that pending loot icon out of your UI. Yes, we then get into inventory management problems… though the pending loot window does too, as it needs to put everything, all at the same time, in an open spot before it will stack them… but at least that is something we should all be used to by now. That Damn X Key! I will grant you, up front, that this is a very solvable issue.  The problem is even knowing it is an issue to be solved.  There is a feature in the game called Tagetet Lock-On mode that, when activated, forces your character to face your currently targeted mob.  I sort of see why that might be useful, but I prefer not to give up control of my character. The problem is that the toggle for it is bound by default to the X key and I cannot tell you how many times I have been in the midst of a multi-mob encounter and have accidentally hit the X key they tab targeted to try and get to the next mob only to end up, as noted above, facing some mob off stage left or something and I am suddenly not facing the danger and I cannot fix that with the movement keys and so I am tab targeting through trying to get back on course…  it can be a mess. Also, it always happens at the worst possible time.  I had it happen in the Weathertop epic quest line encounter where I was facing away from the main opponent and couldn’t face him to shoot and was trying to move to fix this but the mob I was locked on was also moving… it was a mess and I didn’t undo the actual problem until the fight was over. So just know, you can unbind that from the X key.  It is literally the very last keybind on the list, but it is there. Oh my stop that now! Unbinding that can save a life, quite possibly your own!",

you up with quests at a hub, and maybe that is something that gets better in later expansions.  But for me, who has never been past Mirkwood… it can be a thing when you get several adjacent but not overlapping white areas on the map.  Not exactly a blocker, but I do keep thinking “there are more colors in the spectrum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eProgression of Deeds as you Level Up\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentioned this earlier in the week.  When you first start out in Archet or the Shire and you get your first deed, it is pretty neat and you only need, say, 20 spiders in the Shire to get a cool title, and 40 to get the advanced deed finished with the rewards that come with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as you move on that first number increases, and the advanced deed is always double, so you end up needing to grind a lot of mobs.  Not so bad when it advances to 40 or even 60, but you end up with 90 and 100 as your starting point and then you need a lot of mobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_133495\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

need 180 total, but you get setup so nicely back at the start with a 20 mob first run it feels like a bit of a rug pull.  Things will never be that easy again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMouse Over Info on the First Try\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis might be another “just me” thing, but when I am out in the wild and mouse over a mob… this gives you some info about whether or not it is a quest objective or part of a deed you’re working on… the tool tip pops up then goes away in half a second, which is about half a second too fast for me to read the tool tip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, part of that is because tool tips are part of the UI that doesn’t scale… yeah, I’ll get to that another day… but it is so consistent that I am sure it isn’t because I am not mousing over the mob squarely.  I feel solid on this because the SECOND time I mouse over, the tool tip pops and stays up just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Relationship with Water\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can swim in \u003cem\u003eLOTRO\u003c/em\u003e.  In fact, back in the day Evendim used to be the “swim to all the places” zone before Turbine discovered boats… and some connection to reality… so I do not, for example, ever worry about there being an under water zone, mariner class or not.  And then the game puts a quest in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv

processing on it.  You might forget to claim the item or go ahead and delete it sight unseen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, the pending loot doesn’t grab the items you harvest.  You still have to interact with that window every time you chop some wood or mine some metal.  And that was what was getting to me.  Deep in the settings there is an “always loot all” option that is not selected by default.  Clicking that sends everything to your bags, saves a click when harvesting, and gets that pending loot icon out of your UI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, we then get into inventory management problems… though the pending loot window does too, as it needs to put everything, all at the same time, in an open spot before it will stack them… but at least that is something we should all be used to by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThat Damn X Key!\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will grant you, up front, that this is a very solvable issue.  The problem is even knowing it is an issue to be solved.  There is a feature in the game called Tagetet Lock-On mode that, when activated, forces your character to face your currently targeted mob.  I sort of see why that might be useful, but I prefer not to give up control of my character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is that the toggle for it is bound by default to the X key and I cannot tell you how many times I have been in the midst of a multi-mob encounter and have accidentally hit the X key they tab targeted to try and get to the next mob only to end up, as noted above, facing some mob off stage left or something and I am suddenly not facing the danger and I cannot fix that with the movement keys and so I am tab targeting through trying to get back on course…  it can be a mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, it always happens at the worst possible time.  I had it happen in the Weathertop epic quest line encounter where I was facing away from the main opponent and couldn’t face him to shoot and was trying to move to fix this but the mob I was locked on was also moving… it was a mess and I didn’t undo the actual problem until the fight was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo just know, you can unbind that from the X key.  It is literally the very last keybind on the list, but it is there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv
