  "text": "CASSETTE BOY explores the idea that things don’t exist when you aren’t looking at them, turning this concept into a puzzling game. In this Game Boy inspired puzzle RPG, you are taken on a very mysterious quest designed around the idea that you are not able to see some things due to your perspective. If something you are looking at becomes hidden behind something else, sometimes it just stops existing altogether. Sometimes this can be true, but other times, like with yourself, you might just need to look at things from a different perspective. After traveling around your town and following a strange orb-thing that has interesting questions, you will find that not everything is how it seems. Even the game itself goes from a 2D game to a 3D game, completely changing the perspective once you get used to the 2D version that you have been exploring and discovering. CASSETTE BOY is also a very humorous game that makes you really think about where you are going and how exactly you are looking at. Make the wrong move and you can sometimes make something disappear. You actually take a giant sword, making you somewhat of a hero, and you now need to travel around trying to figure out what to really do next. The world feels good to explore, but at the same time, it’s clear where you need to go next as well. I got the chance to play a bit of the game during New Game Plus, where I was surprised when the world shifted and captivated by the strange mysterious questions being proposed to me. It felt like a new kind of puzzle game that was wrapped in surprises, with a lot to discover and play through. The world felt very familiar at first to Game Boy titles, but the shift in perspective added a new twist. CASSETTE BOY is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can grab a demo and add it to your wishlist on Steam.
