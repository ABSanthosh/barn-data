  "text": "SummaryVerdansk has been meticulously reconstructed to provide an amazing Battle Royale experience for up to 150 players.This Battle Royale experience contains adjusted movement mechanics paired with the signature gameplay from the original Call of Duty: Warzone.Season 03 of Call of Duty: Warzone drops on April 3, 2025. This is something special. See, I didn’t get acquainted with Call of Duty: Warzone until recently, so I missed out on the initial launch of Verdansk back in March 2020, an iconic Battle Royale map that was released at a time when so many of us needed a place to play together online. For many of you, this is a return home – to where it all started. But for those of us, like me, who may have missed out on it the first time, we can rejoin the fray and discover what makes this map so special for so many people when it launches as part of Season 03 of Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3, 2025. So, for us newcomers who are coming at this “new” map for the first time, I’ll cover some of the key things you need to know about Verdansk, the modes you can expect to play, iconic locations we should check out, and a deep dive into some of the new quality of life features that will be rolling out with Season 03. What’s the Big Deal? The iconic Verdansk map is back and has been meticulously reconstructed to provide an amazing Battle Royale experience for up to 150 players, mixing the iconic gunplay of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, adjusted movement mechanics, and the captivating, signature Warzone gameplay we’ve come to know and love. Consulting the official Call of Duty Blog, some key areas newcomers should get acquainted with early on include the Lumber, Military Base, and the Train Station. That’s due to their sheer variety of engagement opportunities, like navigating through the maze of barracks looking for loot, hiding between pallets of timber, or battling across sky bridges above train tracks; these all sound like key areas we should check out to get a feel for Verdansk’s variety. You can find a full breakdown on many of the POIs here along with some suggested approaches to each of these key zones. I’m sure my first couple of forays into these zones is going to be a challenge – many returning players likely have their favorite nooks and crannies on lockdown. But Verdansk was highly regarded for a reason. Even if I may stumble my first time exploring Train Station or Lumber, you can bet I’m going to be looking for ways to establish my own foothold in these “new” areas on repeated visits. The official Call of Duty Blog also highlights that popular fan-favorite hot-drops will return, including the top of Dam, the roof of Hospital, the Superstore, and the remote Karst River Quarry. We’re told these are key spots to hit up if you’re looking to quickly get into battle and it feels like this is likely to be the case again — might be worth prioritizing these areas on your first drops into Verdansk if you’re looking for a fight. Personally, I’m a bit more cautious. You can find me looting on the outskirts avoiding these areas, at least until I’ve built up some confidence in the map’s layout. Check out the interactive Call of Duty: Warzone Tac-Map on CallofDuty.com to investigate these areas further. There has also been  fine tuning to bring movement more in line with what players experienced in the early days of Call of Duty: Warzone. Season 03 will fine-tune player movement by slightly scaling back some of the speed increases introduced with Black Ops 6‘s Omnimovement system, bringing it more in line with the early days of Call of Duty: Warzone. We’ll also get access to the Heli along with four ground vehicles – Cargo Truck, Light Tactical Vehicle (LTV), Polaris RZR Pro R 4, and All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) — rebalanced in the spirit of the original iteration, with more rapid acceleration and handling. Alongside that, Circle Collapse mechanics (seeing a creeping cloud of acrid gas) will feature Loadout Drops at the second and fifth circles, like the original. A Retro Refresh If you’re wondering why all the loot is floating above ground – don’t worry, that’s completely normal. Floating loot makes a return to Warzone in what is being deemed as a “retro refresh” of how it initially behaved. Also, Lethal and Tactical Equipment have been adjusted to be closer to what was formerly available. Here’s a breakdown: Field Upgrades: Munitions Box, Heartbeat Sensor, Deployable Cover, P.D.S. (Decontamination Station), Trophy System, Loadout Drop Marker (Grenade and Crate), Armor Box, , Recon Drone. Killstreaks: UAV, Advanced UAV, Precision Airstrike, Cluster Strike, Bunker Buster. Equipment: Flash Bang, Smoke Grenade, Concussion Grenade, Decoy Grenade, Snapshot Grenade, Stim, Frag Grenade, Semtex Grenade, C4, Spring Mine, Molotov, Throwing Knife, Combat Axe. You can look forward to additional content becoming available within these equipment types at mid-season and across future seasons as well. Get a full rundown on all the equipment here on CallofDuty.com. Attend Bootcamp Newer players can check out an updated version of Call of Duty: Warzone Bootcamp to refine their skills across Verdansk. While waiting for your squad to assemble – or if you want to earn some quick XP by completing missions and earning rewards – drop into a Resurgence-sized section of the map, like the Karst River Quarry, and take down bots of varying skill levels. Progression is limited in this mode (results will not count against your stats) but expect to receive about half of the normal XP compared to standard Battle Royale. This is definitely an area I’m looking forward to checking out myself once Verdansk drops on April 3. Getting a feel for some of its key zones, and taking out some bots to build my confidence, seems like the perfect way to be introduced to this map – and collecting a bit of XP and earning rewards along the way is a nice bonus. You can get more details on Bootcamp here. New Game Modes Not everything old is new again – there is some new stuff coming in Season 03 for all types of players, with a wide variety of new Game Modes. Battle Royale Casual: This mode has 148 players, including 28 humans and 120 bots, ideal for warming up, or a less intense experience. Battle Royale Ranked Play: Available mid-season, this competitive mode lets 150 players in trios showcase their skills and earn rewards. Plunder Quads: This mode includes 100 players in 20-minute matches. The objective is to collect the highest amount of in-game money. Call of Duty: Warzone Bootcamp: This training mode includes 44 players, comprised of 12 humans and 32 bots, in 15-minute matches. It is intended to assist newer players or those seeking to improve their skills. Resurgence: This mode will be available on Rebirth Island during the launch window and includes 44 players in 15-minute matches. The objective is to survive and redeploy fallen teammates. Look for mid-season to introduce additional modes, including the LTM: High Trip with resurgence potential, a special narrator on comms, and gameplay boosts. Full details can be found here on CallofDuty.com. Additional Quality of Life Improvements for All Players Season 03 isn’t just about the return to Verdansk, although that is a big part of it. There will also be several additional gameplay enhancements coming to the game. Check out the Call of Duty: Warzone Patch Notes for more information on these and other improvements. Squad Redeploy at Buy Stations: Got multiple Squadmates ready to return but only a moment to buy them back? Select “Redeploy All” at the Buy Station to bring everyone back with sufficient funds. If short on cash, choose specific players to rejoin the match. Weapon Inspect to View Attachments: When you acquire a weapon from ground loot, a fallen enemy, or a Loadout Drop, you can now view a list of the attached Attachments at any time by inspecting it. During the inspection, the icon and name of each Attachment are displayed in the bottom-right corner of the screen. This feature can be toggled on or off in the Settings \u003e Interface \u003e Gameplay HUD Menu. Prioritize Favorite Loadout in Gunsmith: Once you have completed your preferred Loadout in the Call of Duty: Warzone Gunsmith and designated it as Favorite within the Loadout Options, the selected Loadout will be prioritized and positioned at the top of the list. Tac Map Zoom and Centering Settings: The new Tac-Map settings under “Map Assist” provide various control options: Auto Zoom \u0026 Center, Auto Center, Zoom \u0026 Center Once, Center Once, and Off. These options offer you different ways to manage your map during the match. Detailed Death Recap Widget: When you’re eliminated in a match, you see your opponent and a brief HUD message about how they defeated you. The Death Recap will now include more details on gameplay elements used by the attacker. Current and new recaps cover: Throughout the season, this feature will roll out additional gameplay tracking elements, helping you better understand how you were defeated in combat – and prepare for your next encounter. List of attackers with their name, weapon, damage and hits (this appears currently in Call of Duty: Warzone). Affected by Live Ping: If the enemy had you pinged via line-of-sight. Affected by UAV: If the enemy had you pinged in the minimap via a UAV, UAV Tower (if available), or Advanced UAV. Affected by Unsuppressed Weapon: If firing your weapon revealed your location on the minimap to nearby enemies. Updated Squad Widget (Field Upgrades): In Duos, Trios, or Quads, quickly check the Squad Widget in the bottom-left HUD to see your teammates’ Armor Plates, Gas Mask, Killstreak, and Field Upgrade (or a white dot if none) — this will be more efficient than asking over comms. Ping Duration Settings: You can now control how long pings stay on your screen, with options to make them disappear quickly or remain longer. Play the Return to Verdansk Event On April 3, 2025, you can unlock free rewards in the Return to Verdansk Event that include the infamous Kali Sticks Melee Weapon, and if you’re lucky you can potentially unlock a special Verdansk-themed Operator Skin for Caine as the ultimate reward! Learn more here. There will be six weapons available to unlock within Season 03 including the Kali Sticks — as new players let’s be sure to check out additional  Verdansk-era originals: the Kilo 141 Assault Rifle (Call of Duty: Warzone download \u0026 launch reward), CR-56 AMAX Assault Rifle (Battle Pass Reward), and the HDR Sniper Rifle (Battle Pass Reward). All-up, there will be a variety of quality-of-life updates for Call of Duty: Warzone like Squad Redeploys at Buy Stations, attachment descriptions at Weapon Inspects, detailed Death recaps, and later in the season, a HUD flag so you know when your Loadout is available to buy. Naturally, there are plenty more revelations, Easter Eggs, and hidden clues to uncover that will be fun for newcomers and veterans alike in Verdansk once it launches April 3, 2025, for Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC, Battle.net, and with Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta).
