  "text": "There had been a build up all week for today’s coalition update.  Rather than the usual weekly fireside, this was being promoted as a State of the Goonion. State of the Goonion – May 24, 2025 A State of the Goonion address tends to be short and heralds a major event, usually set to commence immediately after it ends.  The usual announcement it war, that move ops are set to commence, and that everybody needs to pack up and be ready to head out to a deployment destination. Or, sometimes it can be something else.  The last State of the Goonion announced our intention to leave Delve and move all of our stuff to UALX-3 in Tenerifis, which would become our new home. So the question was, what would we be hearing today? Leadership seemed more interested than usual in promoting the meeting, with multiple pings going out daily, each with a linked meme or video. The hype was stirring up enough attention that there started to be speculation over on r/eve, with most people thinking we were going to attack PanFam, the coalition we moved to Tenerifis to cozy up to.  This would align with The Initiative deploying to attack Fraternity and their Winter Coalition allies in the north.  All the major coalitions are no longer automatically blue to each other now, with The Initiative resetting everybody back at the start of the year and PanFam and Winter Coalition following along with a pinky promise to reset as well. There was a spread of opinions.  The “Grrr Goons” crowd, who fixate on the idea that only the Imperium has agency in null sec, so any problems are because of us, allowed that we might attack PanFam, but we’ll end up doing nothing and coming home without any change in the status quo. The wags pointed out that, for the first time in almost a decade, we’re in a position to once more invade Delve, a cherished Goon tradition.  But, as it turns out, we’re going to a place even further back in the history of Goons.  We’re headed to Insmother. Insmother is the home of the system C-J6MT, of which The Mittani said back in 2012: In our darkest hour, only one alliance reached out to us amidst the hate and persecution of the opening days of the Great War. Where every wretched honorpubbie pointed fingers and demanded that we be purged from the game ~for the good of EVE~, Red Alliance – at the time Death, Nync, and Mactep – offered us succor. They gave us a place in Insmother, making C-J6 the second sacred goon homeland after S-U8A4. That isn’t just Mittens being dramatic.  The first chapter Andrew Groen’s Empires of EVE Vol. I is The War For Insmother and the Siege of C-J6MT.   That was chosen to set the stage for the tale of null sec, a story that is still being written as volume III is under way.  So we are once again moving through history. This time around we are there to evict Pandemic Horde and their allies from the region. The transcript from the State of The Goonion, which was broadcast over INN Twitch and posted to the forums, so is pretty much public knowledge at this point: When I took over this coalition, we came into a situation that was much more dire than many of you imagined. We had no idea how much money we were making, but we knew we were broke. The first thing I did was request our team build the tools to show us our income. When the tool came in, it reported that the entire alliance was making four to six billion a day in ratting taxes. This was our income. Many of you might be shocked because that’s what you make in a day. When I first spoke to you as alliance leader, I told you there was no place for those who didn’t want to lose a titan, that we were going to be aggressive, that we would attack, and then the cold reality hit me. The only thing that was aggressive was our debt. Our taxes were generating enough money to SRP a single Titan every forty days. So we set about rebuilding. We invested in you. Our belief was that we could make money by you guys making money. We became the Bank of Goonswarm. Our team rebuilt us from the ground up, and we strove every day to put us in a place where my vision could be realized. We stared across the Gulf at an enemy who had vastly more wealth than us, enough wealth to make Solomon blush. When the entire game attacked us, we came together and we defeated them, but at great cost, and we waited for them to attack again. They were so far ahead, so why wouldn’t they? We thought perhaps they didn’t know this information, but then we had a high level defector. He posted our logs. They had known all along that we were making. 5 billion is a day from ratting taxes. They posted it to Reddit. They crowed. Their rental empires hummed. They controlled the safest and largest space in the game. They had every advantage an alliance could have, except one. There’s a coward at the top of Pandemic Horde. We know that their leader had his confidence shattered after World War Bee. We know he has told his people that their plan is to wait for us to attack their space that they can defend. They have squandered the last five years. At time, they attacked the new coalition, we deployed to defend them. They particularly focused on Brave Newbies because they wanted to break them off and have them join up. Then Brave decided to join us instead, the people who had defended them. The enemy was incensed. How could they not join the group who had attacked them? Goons then announced we would attack Horde in Catch. Our war machine was not ready, but we were at least closer. I was tired of waiting. You were tired of waiting. Our team prepared to fight for every inch of ground. Instead, their leaders sent out a message that they would take the space back after they left, they wouldn’t fight. Once again, they ran away. Once again, the most powerful and wealthy alliance of the game fell back with nary a fight. Instead, they focused their entire might on attacking Brave Newbies. Then we announced the move that shocked the game, that we would relocate closer to them. We again attacked them in Curse, and once again, they fell back. They sent propaganda pings about killing a Brave fort. I’m here today to announce we will attack them again. Are we on par with them? No. My team tells me that we should wait another year, that we will be close then, but our enemies have had every advantage of it over us for the last five years, and not once have they taken it. I’ve seen weakness spread throughout an alliance. I’ve seen an instability squandered. Perhaps they were right. They can wait half a decade while they attack groups a tenth their size and call it glory. But we have waited as long as we can. We might be closer in a year, but we are ready now. I know that you have the desire for blood. The same one that I have. We play EVE to fight, and so, we will attack Horde in the region of Insmother and we will drive them out. This is their last bastion of space outside the drone lands. They will either fight us or be trapped in the drones and we will have jump bridges to their doorsteps. I cannot force them to do anything, but I can tell you that we will attack. We are going to be dropping a Keepstar as we speak. We will move tomorrow. We will move everything. Prepare your dreads, prepare your supers, prepare your titans. I made a promise to you that we will push them until they’re against the wall and we will fulfill that promise. I need every one of you with me. Every single one of you has been part of this rebirth as much as I have, and now we take the fight to them. Fleets were formed up and there were over 3,000 people on Mumble during the address.  I got my first ship to the first staging point.  We will be heading further forward tomorrow.   PH attempted to interdict and kill the Keepstar we were attempting to drop, but were baited on a decoy, leading to premature announcements of “your keeptar just died” even as the dread bomb that dropped on the freighter was counter dropped and cleaned up. The actual hauler deployed the Keepstar without issue. Memes were forthcoming immediately over on r/eve. Now, as the sides form up, the question is what will the fight be like? Will PH and its allies fight for the region, or will they keep to their strategy since the end of World War Bee of denying Goons a fight in the hope that they will get bored and go away, most recently demonstrated when the Imperium took swathes of Catch and Tenerifis as well as all of Impass and Immensea? Will we get a “PAPI reform!” moment where Fraternity, which is engaged with The Initiative currently, announces that Winter Coalition will aid PH? Whatever happens, we have a summer campaign under way.",
