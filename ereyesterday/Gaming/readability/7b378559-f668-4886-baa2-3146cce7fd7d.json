  "text": "I have clearly returned to Middle-earth.  But a return always makes me reflect on past runs at a game, and there are few titles I have taken as many runs at as Lord of the Rings Online. Since LOTRO launched after I started the blog, my history with the game is documented… somewhat.  I wrote a bit more chaotically back in the early days and was a lot more likely to bounce around on topics rather than follow an arc of engagement with a game. Also, while I try to tag and categorize posts, the early days were also somewhat chaotic on that front, and with over 500 posts now under the Lord of the Rings Online category (go look on the side bar) sometimes picking out an era that I want to go back to can be a chore. Things you learn as time goes along. Fortunately, as time has gone along I have improved with my tags, such that I could pretty easily pull out the posts related to my last run at the game, which was during the first Legendary Server era. We’ll just stick with Legendary I think This was, as the early posts in this series indicate, not a “classic” server, there being no practical way to roll back to that… and, frankly, the words of J. Allen Brack probably apply better to this than they did to WoW Classic.   I was fine not going all the way back to the state of LOTRO in 2007, at which point it was barely finished and content petered out somewhere around level 40. Like launch day EverQuest II, it is a time to remember, but maybe not a time to return to. So here was the arc of my time with the game back in 2018 and the first legendary server run.  The idea kicked off pretty well and the initial server, Anor, was overwhelmed so they had to roll up a second server, Ithil. Once the servers were up, off I went, digging into the initial 1-50 content.

Mar 14, 2019 – Moria Beckons March 18, 2019 – Fiddling About in Eregion And then I ran out of steam.  Moria, legendary items, the EverQuest 20th anniversary events, our group rolling up a new Minecraft server, and the looming presence of WoW Classic… which had been announced by then, even if we didn’t have a launch date yet, were all conspiring to keep me from remaining engaged with Middle-earth. Since then I have take a couple short stabs at the game, the last one back in 2023.  But this year’s run, with the launch of the 64-bit servers, looks like it might carry me at least to Moria again.  I have an eye on Mordor as a destination, but there are still many obstacles to get past.",
