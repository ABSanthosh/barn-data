Metal Eden will probably scratch that itch, the next game from the devs behind the quite violent and flashy Ruiner, given that it's out May 6th. That's still about a month away though, so you could always try out the free demo that dropped today offering a small taste of its sci-fi shooter. Read more",

  "text": "Time to learn how to speedrun Image credit: Reikon Games Right, Doom: The Dark Ages is still a month away, but I'm guessing there's some of you that could do with a bit of boomer shooting to fill the gap in the meantime. Metal Eden will probably scratch that itch, the next game from the devs behind the quite violent and flashy Ruiner, given that it's out May 6th. That's still about a month away though, so you could always try out the free demo that dropped today offering a small taste of its sci-fi shooter. The demo seems like a pretty beefy one too, you can try out the first two missions of the game. It should be noted that this doesn't appear to be a \"save data carries over to the main game\" kind of demo, but Metal Eden seems like the kind of game you'll want to replay to get better and better at anyway. Which, funnily enough, is kind of the point, as over on Steam Reikon Games shared that it's hosting a speedrun challenge of the game in partnership with speedrun.com. METAL EDEN | Demo Trailer Watch on YouTube Honestly, if you're good at making like Sonic the Hedgehog, you genuinely might want to give it a go. As long as you've submitted your run by April 15th, you'll be in with a chance to win a share of a $1000 prize pool. You will need to come somewhere within the top three to get some of that share, so good luck if you do give it a go. I love a game that features parkour, or at least movement like it. I'm still chasing the thrill of games like Mirror's Edge and Titanfall 2, so Metal Eden seems like it's worth a quick punt at least. Doubt I'll make it into the top three in best times though.",
