  "text": "Star Wars through a John Le Carre prism -My Andor season one summary, 2022 Binge Watch Summary Post This really could have been a two paragraph entry on another Binge Watching post.  From enough distance, Andor was just another show we watched and enjoyed. Star Wars – Andor But because it is Star Wars… and, in an unusual turn for the Disney era, actually pretty well received Star Wars installment… it has caused a bunch of discourse about Star Wars, what it is, what it should be, and where it has gone wrong since its unlikely birth back in 1977. One of the more appealing takes to me was one I read over on Blue Sky by David Roberts that says one of the key elements of the 1977 original was its somewhat unfinished nature when it came to telling the story. The circumstances of the production meant that a lot of the setting was left mostly unstated, covered only with passing references that gave a hint about the context of the wider universe.  I’ll pull one quote out of the thread to illustrate: It gives the feeling that you really are witnessing a tiny little slice, a tiny episode, in what is a real, ongoing, vast universe, with its own history. It does this, again, by *not* explaining. By *not* showing. By leaving 95% of what it discusses \u0026 references to your imagination. This was not at all deliberate, but because pulling the film together was such a tight process that Lucas was forced to focus on what was critical and leave other ambitions aside.  The tight story telling with, for the time, unprecedented special effects, and the masterful editing job done by his then wife Marcia Lucas, left a lean story where the the parts… and there were some pretty low quality parts on the acting front for sure… yielded up a whole greater than the mere sum of them. And I like that theory.  It explains why, as things went forwards and Lucas was able to control more and more of the movies, things degraded, starting with (my opinion) Return of the Jedi and manifesting itself fully in the prequel trilogy where Lucas bogs us down in trade negotiations, Jar Jar’s origin story, pod racing, the politics of the Jedi Council, and the parliamentary procedures of the Old Republic. I am not convinced it is 100% spot on.  I think a large part of the appeal of the original Star Wars was the classic voyage of discovery trope, which is what I call it, where you follow somebody who is learning about what is happening on screen at the same time you are learning about it there in your seat as you watch.  This is what powered a lot of tales like The Matrix and Harry Potter… or even Twilight if you want… some young person discovering a world beyond their knowledge… and then going on to become the chosen one or what ever in the inevitable hero’s journey arc. Still, I like the idea and it both contributes to the myths we’ve built about the original and explains nicely how Disney has totally betrayed the original, the pinnacle of which was the Han Solo movie which was succinctly summed up as answering a bunch of questions nobody was asking.  Nobody, for example, cared about his last name the way nobody asked how Napoleon Solo got his last name… or his first name for that matter.  Making that a thing was a waste of run time. Somehow this discussion jumped out of the cesspit of the inevitable politics discussion where some proto-Nazi influencer declares that the original Star Wars film was politically neutral and now whatever the latest thing is has ruined that neutrality by being political in a way that makes them feel uncomfortable in their beliefs because, if they had to come out and admit it, if they were in the actual galaxy far, far away they would be Vader fan boys and out echoing the talking points of Palpatine’s press secretary. Because, of course, Andor is political.  But so was the original Star Wars unless you were too young and/or oblivious to figure it out.  It seemed pretty clearly so when I was 12… putting one side in spiffy uniforms and jack boots is always a tell people… and George Lucas has said it was meant to be. However, when you force somebody to reconcile their core beliefs and their favorite childhood movie, cognitive dissonance is not an uncommon result. This has led to any number of dumb threads about keeping politics out of entertainment as well as the inevitable attempts to force the analogy.  Is Mon Mothma actually Nancy Pelosi?  Is Dedra Meero really Kristi Noem?  Besides being insults to both Mon Mothma and Dedra Meero, it assumes everything must be a literal translation of reality, which brings me back to reading Animal Farm in high school and arguing over exactly which pig mapped onto which Soviet era figure and what part of the book aligned with which political event, all of which was an exercise in ignoring the forest to discuss the relevance of specific trees in the context of some other forest… or something.  I was young and had plenty of time to waste on such things.  I am now content to let the analogy wash over me, to take it in with needing to map it point for point on some version of the real world. So yes, politics is there in Star Wars.  It always has been.  But if you think it is always has to be calling out specific people, you’ve lost the thread and should just stop.  This is why we can’t have nice analogies and metaphors.  People are too fixated on exact pattern matching. Anyway, back to Andor, because in that model I described above where Lucas or Disney are trying to explain things to the point that it ruins the magic and gains us nothing, Andor stands out as the exception.  And Andor is a double whammy on that front.  Andor is an explainer series for Rogue One, which itself was a movie put together pretty much to answer the question, “Exactly how many Bothans died to bring the rebellion that information?” And yet these to forays into answering questions that didn’t need answers have turned into arguably the best live action installments in the post-Disney Star Wars extended universe.  I’ll grant you the first season… and maybe the second… of The Mandalorian is in the running, but the rest of the live action stuff has disappointed and even later seasons of Mando fell into the explainer model, when they weren’t being used to launch new spin-off shows.  And if it were not for Baby Yoda I am not sure how many would feel about the series.  My wife is all in on Grogu and little else. I won’t get into the animated stuff, save to say that it serves as evidence in yet another never ending battle in the Star Wars fandom, which is whether it is a children’s property or something for adults, which has its tentacles into everything from “is animation only for kids?” to “you cannot be taken seriously as an adult if you like Star Wars” and a million things in between. Andor has been call been called “Star Wars for adults,” a phrase that rips right into that conflict above and makes some people angry.  Andor and Rogue One have both been praised for their gritty reality in showing that the rebellion wasn’t all happy thoughts and good guys being nice and playing by the rules.  One of the reasons to pluck Cassian Andor from Rogue One and crank out two seasons of back story about him and the rebellion is because he is committed and ruthless and does what is necessary to further the cause so there is a story to be told in how he was radicalized and became part of the rebel alliance. All of which this many words might leave you asking in a semi-exasperated tone of voice, “Yes, but was it any good?” It was good.  Very good.  I enjoyed it quite a bit. I liked season two more than season one.  The first season felt a bit too mired in origin story things, the dreaded answering of questions nobody was asking and filling in details that really were not all that interesting. But then season two made some of those efforts in season one pay off, so I ended up appreciating season one all the more so.  At least me memory of it.  I probably need to go back and watch it again.  Still, as an example, I don’t know if season one needed to spend as much time in an Imperial electric floor prison as it did.  Sure, it was relevant and gave us another glimpse of the empire.  But when, in the last episode of season two, you see one of the notable Imperial characters has ended up in a cell, feet bare, looking absolutely dejected, you at least get a “I know what that means!” moment of resolution. Together the two seasons give a good feel for the early resistance, the finance and organization and recruitment as well as the Empire’s side of things, cracking down on anybody standing up to them and, as always, the need to build the Death Star. There is a scene in the first episode of the second season when a special and secret committee meets under Director Krennic about undermining a specific world in order to seize resources required for the Death Star… where seizing means environmental impact that will make the world uninhabitable… that rang so true to the Wannsee Conference vibe that I went and watched the BBC/HBO production Conspiracy that is a dramatic re-enactment to see if I was really getting on base.  I was… in a small way, but it was there, and no doubt deliberately so.  Again, politics is always there, but not confined to reflecting specifically reflecting our own time, at least not always in the first degree. The show does suffer from some limitations.  If you’ve seen Rogue One you know how everything has to line up, who has to die, or at least disappear from the narrative, who has to survive, and where key players have to be at the start of the movie for which this was all a prequel.  A prequel to a prequel.  So starting in episode eight you can see everybody being shuffled and moved to their positions.  You know some people are in no danger of dying because they still have roles to play and others only have space in the series. I have also heard some complain that, in a Stars Wars setting you’re supposed to get some aliens as main characters, and the lack of that… there is some alien window dressing and you get a Mon Calamari with a speaking part on Yavin, but that is about it… yoinks the key fantasy element that some find an essential part of any story based in the Star Wars universe.  And, given the Empire, at least in the expanded universe, was extremely xenophobic, thus driving all the interesting aliens to the rebellion, it does seem a bit of a miss.  I asked my wife about the alien aspect and she too was quite aware that aliens seemed largely to be in the background or used as props at best. Also, not enough on the space travel or pew pew front for her. Finally, while I realize Saw Gerrera is in a bunch of the animated stuff, but they really didn’t do a lot to establish him in the series.  But he had to be there because he is in Rogue One and we had to set all that up.  (Also I thought his name was Saul Gerrera for a bit, but that was probably more on how Diego Luna says his name.) But for me those were all minor flaws which did not detract from my enjoying the series. I will also applaud Disney+ for not dribbling the season two out an episode a week over a three month stretch.  Instead they dropped three episode story arcs once a week.  One a week isn’t enough for me and after three months I will have lost any thread anchored in early episodes.  But three a week was enough to keep us invested and up on what happened.  It was good. In fact, it was all good enough that I wish there was going to be more of it.  There had been a plan at one point for as many as five seasons.  But the high quality work they did on the show cost a lot.  The two seasons together ran to about $650 million.  And sure, that got us twenty plus hours of Star Wars.  But it also means that each season cost about as much as doing a full blow Star Wars theatrical release, only there was no billion dollar world wide box office take to pay that back, just some more subscriptions to Disney+. So it goes.  I guess that is why they keep doing the animated series.  The budget can’t be anywhere close to what live action costs.  So we’re probably a long ways from anything that is both live action Star Wars and worth watching. All of which is a pretty rambling path to say something was pretty good.  Not perfect, but worthwhile.  And, of course, having finished it up, we had to watch Rogue One again.  It is the last Star Wars film I purchased on physical media… it being the last one worth bothering with. Then, on watching that we’ll have to watch Episode IV: A New Hope… or as we call it at our house, Star Wars. And how does Andor sit with you?",

first episode of the second season when a special and secret committee meets under Director Krennic about undermining a specific world in order to seize resources required for the Death Star… where seizing means environmental impact that will make the world uninhabitable… that rang so true to the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wannsee_Conference\"\u003eWannsee Conference\u003c/a\u003e vibe that I went and watched the BBC/HBO production \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_(2001_film)\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eConspiracy\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e that is a dramatic re-enactment to see if I was really getting on base.  I was… in a small way, but it was there, and no doubt deliberately so.  Again, politics is always there, but not confined to reflecting specifically reflecting our own time, at least not always in the first degree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe show does suffer from some limitations.  If you’ve seen \u003cem\u003eRogue One\u003c/em\u003e you know how everything has to line up, who has to die, or at least disappear from the narrative, who has to survive, and where key players have to be at the start of the movie for which this was all a prequel.  A prequel to a prequel.  So starting in episode eight you can see everybody being shuffled and moved to their positions.  You know some people are in no danger of dying because they still have roles to play and others only have space in the series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have also heard some complain that, in a \u003cem\u003eStars Wars\u003c/em\u003e setting you’re supposed to get some aliens as main characters, and the lack of that… there is some alien window dressing and you get a Mon Calamari with a speaking part on Yavin, but that is about it… yoinks the key fantasy element that some find an essential part of any story based in the Star Wars universe.  And, given the Empire, at least in the expanded universe, was extremely xenophobic, thus driving all the interesting aliens to the rebellion, it does seem a bit of a miss.  I asked my wife about the alien aspect and she too was quite aware that aliens seemed largely to be in the background or used as props at best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, not enough on the space travel or pew pew front for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, while I realize Saw Gerrera is in a bunch of the animated stuff, but they really didn’t do a lot to establish him in the series.  But he had to be there because he is in \u003cem\u003eRogue One\u003c/em\u003e and we had to set all that up.  (Also I thought his name was Saul Gerrera for a bit, but that was probably more on how Diego Luna says his name.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for me those were all minor flaws which did not detract from my enjoying the series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will also applaud Disney+ for not dribbling the season two out an episode a week over a three month stretch.  Instead they dropped three episode story arcs once a week.  One a week isn’t enough for me and after three months I will have lost any thread anchored in early episodes.  But three a week was enough to keep us invested and up on what happened.  It was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, it was all good enough that I wish there was going to be more of it.  There had been a plan at one point for as many as five seasons.  But the high quality work they did on the show cost a lot.  The two seasons together ran to about $650 million.  And sure, that got us twenty plus hours of \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e.  But it also means that each season cost about as much as doing a full blow \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e theatrical release, only there was no billion dollar world wide box office take to pay that back, just some more subscriptions to Disney+.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it goes.  I guess that is why they keep doing the animated series.  The budget can’t be anywhere close to what live action costs.  So we’re probably a long ways from anything that is both live action \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e and worth watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of which is a pretty rambling path to say something was pretty good.  Not perfect, but worthwhile.  And, of course, having finished it up, we had to watch \u003cem\u003eRogue One\u003c/em\u003e again.  It is the last Star Wars film I purchased on physical media… it being the last one worth bothering with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, on watching that we’ll have to watch \u003cem\u003eEpisode IV: A New Hope\u003c/em\u003e… or as we call it at our house, \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how does \u003cem\u003eAndor\u003c/em\u003e sit with you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
