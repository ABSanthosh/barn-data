In 2023, GTA fans got their first official look at Grand Theft Auto 6 in the form of a teaser trailer.We already knew some details about GTA 6 before that, thanks to an unprecedented leak of the game in 2022. But the game’s first trailer blew the lid off. It’s full of street-level chaos, including illegal street races, convenience-store robberies, gator wrangling, and general Florida Man weirdness. The trailer also shows its dual protagonists getting up to all sorts of low-level crime.Since then, Rockstar Games has rolled out a second trailer that reveals even more about the game’s characters, setting, and story. Suffice it to say, GTA 6 looks like an expansive, visually stunning modern crime romp through Rockstar’s stylized version of southern Florida.Here’s everything we know about Grand Theft Auto 6 so far.When is GTA 6’s release date?After initially planning a fall 2025 launch, Rockstar delayed Grand Theft Auto 6 to 2026 — and even gave the next GTA a firm May 26, 2026 release date on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.“With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception,” Rockstar said in a statement announcing the new release date. “We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.”While GTA 6 is now targeting a spring 2026 release, Rockstar is famous for delaying its biggest games in the name of polish. Its last major release, Red Dead Redemption 2, was publicly delayed three times. And back in 2013, Grand Theft Auto 5 saw a significant delay, slipping from its original spring release date to its ultimate September 2013 launch. In other words, even if Rockstar gives us a release date, history tells us that nothing is set in stone and that the studio will delay GTA 6 if it decides it needs to.When does the GTA 6 trailer come out?Rockstar released the first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer in December 2023, in response to a leak. Enjoy the chaotic South Florida vibes, which are set to Tom Petty’s “Love Is a Long Road.”GTA 6’s reveal trailer has racked up more than a quarter-billion views since its debut. Grand Theft Auto fans were left wanting more, obviously resulting in widespread speculation about the arrival of a second trailer. Which took about 18 months to arrive…Trailer 2 for GTA 6 was released in May 2025. Released with far less fanfare, the stealth-dropped second GTA 6 trailer quickly went on to break records, racking up more than 75 million views in a single day.Grand Theft Auto 6’s second trailer gives us a longer look at the two playable protagonists’ background and love life, and the activities — the criminal, fun, and mundane — that they’ll get up to. This time, the GTA 6 action is set to the Pointer Sisters’ “Hot Together” with a little bit of Wang Chung’s “Everybody Have Fun Tonight” and Tammy Wynette’s “Talkin’ to Myself Again” peppered in to give you a taste of the soundtrack’s breadth.Where does GTA 6 take place?Grand Theft Auto 6 will be set in Vice City, Leonida, GTA’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. Vice City was previously explored in 2002’s Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and its 2006 prequel, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories. Those entries were set during the mid-1980s, but GTA 6 will tell a current-day, Bonnie and Clyde-inspired story featuring two leads named Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos. Lucia will be the GTA series’ first playable female protagonist in a mainline game.Beyond the metropolitan Vice City, GTA 6 will also feature a variety of locations, including the Leonida Keys, the Everglades-like Grassrivers region, the dilapidated tourist town of Port Gellhorn, and industrial city of Ambrosia.Who are Jason and Lucia, the stars of GTA 6?Image: Rockstar GamesJason works for Leonida drug runners and “grew up around grifters and crooks,” according to Rockstar’s GTA 6 website. A former army vet, Jason seeks an easy life and is pursuing a new path in the story of the next Grand Theft Auto.Lucia is Jason’s partner and a former inmate at Leonida Penitentiary. She hails from Liberty City — GTA’s version of New York — and grew up a fighter, according to Rockstar. They mean that literally; we see Lucia doing some kickboxing in GTA 6’s second trailer, and it’s not simply for physical fitness reasons.According to Rockstar’s character bios, Jason and Lucia will find themselves “in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive” after “an easy score goes wrong.”Grand Theft Auto 6’s supporting cast includes:Brian Heder, a veteran drug smuggler/beach bum who is Jason’s landlord and bossCal Hampton, a laid back friend of Jason’s who also works in the drug trade with BrianBoobie Ike, a “Vice City legend” who works in legitimate businesses, including real estate, a strip club, and a recording studioDre’Quan Priest, head of Only Raw Records and partner of BoobieReal Dimez, the hip hop duo/social media mavens — known as Bae-Luxe and Roxy — signed to Dre’Quan’s labelRaul Bautista, a cunning bank robber who is pulling jobs of increasingly high stakesHow long has GTA 6 been in development?Reportedly since 2014, though Rockstar did not officially acknowledge the game’s existence until February 2022.What platforms will GTA 6 be released on?GTA publisher Take-Two Interactive announced that Grand Theft Auto 6 will come to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2026. A PC version has not been announced. That’s not uncommon for Grand Theft Auto games, though; the series has had staggered releases on consoles and PC, and the lack of an announced PC version certainly doesn’t rule one out at this point.In May 2024, at a tech conference, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick addressed the question (albeit indirectly) about a PC port of GTA 6, saying “the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone, near as I could tell.”“Rockstar has an approach to platforms we’ve seen before, and they will make more announcements in due time,” Zelnick added. “I do believe that the right strategy for our business is to be where the consumer is, and historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, [on] any platform that makes sense, over time.”There’s another potential platform coming that could be home to Grand Theft Auto 6: Nintendo Switch 2. Rockstar has embraced the Switch with releases like L.A. Noire, Red Dead Redemption, and Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition, so don’t rule out an eventual release of GTA 6 on Switch 2.How much will GTA 6 cost?Image: Rockstar GamesRockstar and publisher Take-Two haven’t announced a price point, but it seems likely that Grand Theft Auto 6 will carry — at minimum — a $69.99 price point, increasingly the standard for AAA video games with big budgets. But with publishers like Nintendo and Microsoft bumping prices for their games up to $80, don’t be surprised if Rockstar and publisher Take-Two charge that (or more) for GTA 6.Is GTA 6 going to cost $100?Speculation that Grand Theft Auto 6 could cost, at a base level, $100 appears to come from a report from Epyllion analyst Matthew Ball. In his presentation The State of Video Gaming in 2025, Ball said that “some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-100, breaking the $70 barrier” and effectively raising the price going forward of many video games. (As previously mentioned, that’s already happened.)Ball’s presentation garnered a lot of buzz on social media, even though he never said GTA 6 will cost $100, just that some game makers would certainly like to see that happen. The situation is not unlike earlier comments from Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick, which were misinterpreted to imply that GTA 6 could cost up to $150 or be priced by the hour.Of course, there may be higher-priced premium or collector’s edition versions of GTA 6 that cost more than the increasingly industry-standard buy-in price of $69.99. When Rockstar launched Red Dead Redemption 2 in 2018, it released a standard $59.99 version of the game alongside a $79.99 special edition and a $99.99 ultimate edition. The game maker could follow a similar pricing scheme for GTA 6, but the real windfall will come after the game’s release, in the form of game subscriptions and sales of premium currencies.Hold your horses (and your pre-orders) until Rockstar makes the price of GTA 6 official.What happens to Grand Theft Auto Online when GTA 6 comes out?Rockstar hasn’t said, but given the massive popularity of GTA Online, which is also sold as a stand-alone experience, it will likely continue. Rockstar may have more grand ambitions for an online mode for GTA 6, and it may run two versions of the online experience for each game. The future of GTA Online is one of the biggest open questions — not to mention Rockstar’s trickiest needle to thread — when it comes to discussing GTA 6. Rockstar may very well keep those plans under wraps for the foreseeable future.What happened with the big GTA 6 leak?Image: Rockstar GamesIn 2022, more than 90 videos of the in-development version of Grand Theft Auto 6 were published online at the message board GTAForums. The hacker responsible claimed to have accessed the videos — some 50 minutes in total footage — directly from Rockstar Games’ internal Slack.Those leaks show police chases, robberies, gunplay, open-world driving, a crowded nightclub scene, and conversations with full voice acting. The game footage was clearly not intended to be shown publicly, with debug programming elements visible on-screen at the time.One of the longer videos showed the female player character robbing a diner, as well as threatening staff and customers, who react in fear to having a gun pulled on them. Then she and her male accomplice get in a shootout with police before jumping in the police patrol car and driving off.",

When Rockstar launched \u003cem\u003eRed Dead Redemption 2\u003c/em\u003e in 2018, it released a standard $59.99 version of the game alongside \u003ca href=\"https://www.polygon.com/deals/2018/10/18/17991532/red-dead-redemption-2-pre-order-special-ultimate-collectors-edition-bundle-comparison\"\u003ea $79.99 special edition and a $99.99 ultimate edition\u003c/a\u003e. The game maker could follow a similar pricing scheme for \u003cem\u003eGTA 6\u003c/em\u003e, but the real windfall will come after the game’s release, in the form of game subscriptions and sales of premium currencies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHold your horses (and your pre-orders) until Rockstar makes the price of \u003cem\u003eGTA 6\u003c/em\u003e official.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp id=\"fohS9A\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat happens to \u003cem\u003eGrand Theft Auto Online\u003c/em\u003e when \u003cem\u003eGTA 6\u003c/em\u003e comes out?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eRockstar hasn’t said, but given the massive popularity of \u003cem\u003eGTA Online\u003c/em\u003e, which is also sold as a stand-alone experience, it will likely continue. Rockstar may have more grand ambitions for an online mode for \u003cem\u003eGTA 6\u003c/em\u003e, and it may run two versions of the online experience for each game.
