  "text": "Forward on to Mordor!  The next stop is Dunland, which I glimpsed briefly when I was chasing down one of the quests for The Huntsman back in Enedwaith. My first look at Dunland At first glace… it looked a lot like Enedwaith… which looks a lot like Eregion in places, which looks like the North Downs… I get it, the art team can only do so much and at least it isn’t Minecraft where every forest biome ends up looking the same. I’m just hoping this doesn’t come back to haunt me in Dunland. That was one zone over, so doesn’t count, right? But along the way in Enedwaith… specifically, when I hit level 65… I started getting updates pushing me on to the next stage of the epic quest.  There was something about meeting up with Butterbar back in Bree on the list. There were also a pair of summons to Rivedell, the first coming from Pethelen, who I guess is Elrond’s personal secretary or chief of staff or some such. Middle-earth.com email service is very reliable, but not secure I guess This always kills me, the summons back to some past location like running around Middle-earth was a thing you could just do.  I mean, the first third of The Fellowship of the Ring was framed by the struggle of just getting to Rivendell in the first place.  But now some high elf functionary sends me a message while I am practically in Dunland to drop everything and get back there.  Say what? I know, video game logic, suspension of disbelief, narrative device needs, and the requirement to hold players by the hand because the won’t read the quest text… but still! This was followed up by a message from Elrond himself… again, like one of the main leaders of the elves in Middle-earth knows me and has time to bang out a message to me. Elrond figures out his own email account Once again, I pictured an elf lord using a smart phone, which got me to go to Google Gemini to try and get it to generate an amusing name for whatever phone he would pick.  Instead, when I ask what smartphone Elrond would use, it gave me a both earnest and extremely superficial treatment of the whole idea: General Considerations for Elrond’s Smartphone: Minimal Bloatware: Elrond would likely prefer a clean and efficient operating system without unnecessary pre-installed applications. Strong Security Features: Given his wisdom and the importance of the information he might possess, robust security would be paramount. Excellent Battery Life: While modern charging technology is convenient, a phone with good battery life would be practical for someone potentially engaged in long journeys or important meetings. Elegant Design: As a noble and respected figure, Elrond might appreciate a phone with a sophisticated and understated aesthetic. Ultimately, the best smartphone for Elrond would likely be one that balances performance, reliability, security, and ease of use, without being overly flashy or distracting from more important matters. He would likely choose a tool that serves its purpose efficiently and effectively, much like the wise counsel he offered throughout the ages. That was just the summary bit.  There was a lot more.  Eventually, when pressed, it coughed up “Elrondroid” as its best answer.  Lame.  Also, that is an operating system, not a phone.  Plus, “Rivencell” was right there for the taking! But I digress. First, Pethelen is all “Get back to Rivendell, Elrond needs you!” while Elrond is more, “I hear Dunland is nice this time of year” which was confusing enough, arriving two minutes apart in the middle of a fight with somebody’s dead father.  But all of this reminded me that I was kind of letting the side down on the epic quest front.  Those were starting to pile up in the old quest log. Quest log headings… Now, on the one hand, my stated purpose is to get to Mordor and, in furtherance of that, I have been quite willing to pass over all sorts of quests and other story building moments… plus crafting, skirmishes, holidays, monster play, and whatever else… in order to not get bogged down.  I want to keep moving forward. On the other hand, I was now in… for me… uncharted territory and did have something of a desire to experience things along the way… and the epic quest line often contain critical bits of color.  I mean, what would volume one be without finding out the truth about the slowest NPC in Middle-earth, Sara Oakheart and her damn stick. So I was convinced that I should loop back to Rivendell to find out what was going on… also, as a hunter in good standing I have a skill that sends me straight there.  No need to spend time navigating the inter-regional hub and spoke stable master transit network.  Off I went. Of course, it is still a tiresome hoof across Rivendell Valley itself, but whatever.  I got in there, spoke to Pethelen, who was waiting for me out in front of the Last Homely House (Barcaloungers in every room!) and sent me off to talk with Elrond and his sons Degas and Renoir, who were all keen to get the Dunedain band back together to help Aragron, all under the label of “The Grey Company,” which sounded more than a bit familiar to me. I am right for the job I guess So the plan was to gather Aragorns school mates, but first I had to go meet Elrond in the library where he WAS NOT STANDING WHERE HE HAS ALWAYS been before… sorry, habits… and began telling me about the selection of the rangers of the north who he wants to group up.  That starts with him describing Radanir, who he says is somewhere in the Trollshaws, but who is actually standing RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF US. I mean, he certainly is close! So as I am standing there wondering if Elrond has lost his marbles (and how Radanir smuggled a goddam tree into the room) when he disappears and I realize that the game is giving me a visual so I can identify these guys… just in case there isn’t a burning golden ring over their heads I guess? I mean, I appreciate the effort in trying to jar my brain into recognizing this crew, but they look like a pack of preppers from back woods Idaho, all wearing green cloaks and scowls.  I couldn’t pick one from another, except by posture… because there is Candaith, laying on the ground at his tent, just like in the Lone Lands. Candaith in his classic pose Plus, I’ve seen some of these guys recently.  I just left Halbarad back in Edenwaith.  He was standing in the middle of Lhanuch as bold as brass with the aforementioned great big flaming ring over his head. Looking pissed as always So when Elrond is telling me to get to Esteldin to find him, I am all… but… uh… erm… Yes, I know, I’ve done gotten things out of order… though I didn’t get the message from Elrond until after I had seen Halbarad there. Eventually Elrond gets to the end of his list and I agree to go find Aragorn’s militia buddies, starting with Radanir, who is just one direct ride away via stablemaster according to Elrond. But, of course, he is not.  Also, I am pretty sure I saw him too in Enedwaith.  I think I saw all of these guys there.  Again, out of order questing.  Radanir is off somewhere deep in the Trollshaws, so I ride on out to find him, happy that I am way over level so nothing in the zone is interested in tangling with me.  I just have to get him to come along with me to the Grey Company. Except, of course, he has some task for me.  They all have tasks for me.  They can’t just go to Aragorn or hand off to somebody else, they need me to wrap up their business.  For this round I need to go kill a guy and clean up a mess.  So I go do that.  Once done, I get back to him and he sends me off to Candaith in the Lone Lands. Candaith, still laid out in front of his tent, he can’t quite go yet either.  He’s left his luggage somewhere and can I go grab it for him.  That is fortunately just up the hill.  Piece of cake. He sends me to Saeradan’s cabin to talk to him.  He wants some supplies for the trip and could I please ride on down to Bree to pick them up.  There is, of course, an incident, but I get it done. He sends me off to find Halros in The Shire.  He sends me riding across the zone, but at least I get to pick up a couple of the stable master locations along the way.  Then he is all “should I stay or should I go now?” and, so far as I can tell, choosing either for him ends up with the same result, so I said “Go.” [I later read that your choice effects a later epic quest in Gondor… but what happens if you don’t do the quest at all?] He pointed me to Halbarad in Esteldin, so I am sure he’s just in his office and I can knock that out quickly.  But I get there, talk to his lieutenant out in front of his office who tells me that he is not there at the moment.  I mean, I knew that, but still.  He is out in the east of the downs, so I am off to find him. He is in an instance and is half way through the job when I show up.  That prompts him, in the usual ranger of the north way, to decide it is break time because he can let the new guy clean up.  So I roam a maze of an instance where my job is, among other things, to deface a a statue of the Witch-King. Ah, there it is… deep in the maze That satisfies Halbarad, who is off to Rivendell.  I have to check in with his aide-de-camp one more time before being sent on my way to Evendim to check in with Calenglad, who is at least gung-ho to clear out Evendim before he goes to the muster in Rivendell. Ready to kill! However, he tires out after a bit and eventually I have to clean up again.  Then we have to have a long talk with his girlfriend about how he is packing up to go to Aragorn.  She’ll wait for him, but only because she is an elf, and thus immortal, so she is, like Elrond, good at passing the time. Then there was a run through Forochel that was mercifully quick and Lothrandir was soon on his way to Rivendell. Which left me with Corunir in Angmar.  But I was nearly there.  Then I go there and found out that I needed to complete a skirmish to wrap this up and I was a bit salty about that. I was level 67 as we did this, so a bit over leveled so there wasn’t much chance of me being defeated.  But a skirmish scales to your level… and I hadn’t done a skirmish since the tutorial and my soldier was a complete base model with no skills… so it was not a fun experience as I was defeated multiple times, though at least it just respawns you back in the skirmish to pick up where you left off.  So I brute forced that until we got to the end. The time has come to get out of here Then, done with the rounding up of the Grey Company, of whom I was already a full honorary member as noted above, it was back to Rivendell where I had to check in with Elrond, his assistant, his daughter, some guy near the stables, and then with each member of the company one by one, starting with Halbarad. Halbarad at the Rivendell stables The whole company also found some fancy new duds to put on, making them the Dark Grey Company. Checking in with each they all had a little story to tell, ending with Candaith, who actually got up to speak to me this time. Candaith’s legs do work! Candaith’s tale involved going into a special session which, as with Moria, puts you in another character, screws up your UI, and turns on world chat, as if just looking for ways to piss you off.  I wasn’t going to do that again and dumped out of the session immediately.  I want to play my character with the UI adjusted so I can use it, not learn some other class. Checking back with the quest, it does say you can run the session or “read the shortened account” which is contained in a book just out of sight off to the left of Candaith. You should do this Given that the shortened account is medium length paragraph, I recommend that. Then we were off… to Eregion… where we had to fart around while the company tracked down old friends then stopped to get some matching grey company jewelry made, which involved me hunting down all the supplies in yet another maze of an instance all while keeping the whole party from getting in over their heads yet again. Golodir! What did I say about not wandering off! We eventually moved from Eregion to Enedwaith, where I had Halbarad visible in two camps a few minutes apart, and where, on arriving in the zone, the whole company collapsed with exhaustion and decided I needed to go do more fetching and carrying.  That put me at chapter 9 of Vol. III, Book 2. At about that point I decided I have moved the epic quest line forward far enough.  There were a few decent rewards along the way.  Halbarad got me a nice new hat for my troubles.  But they were going to have to find their own way to Gondor or where ever they are headed.  All I know is that everybody talks about the war effort, but most seem pretty lackadaisical about actually doing something. I was going to do something.  I was going back to Dunland to see what the White Hand was up to.  Probably more trade negotiations, but we’ll see.

Google Gemini to try and get it to generate an amusing name for whatever phone he would pick.  Instead, when I ask what smartphone Elrond would use, it gave me a both earnest and extremely superficial treatment of the whole idea:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGeneral Considerations for Elrond’s

without unnecessary pre-installed applications.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStrong Security Features:\u003c/strong\u003e Given his wisdom and the importance of the information he might possess, robust security would be paramount.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExcellent Battery Life:\u003c/strong\u003e While modern charging technology is convenient, a phone with good battery life would be practical for someone potentially engaged in long journeys or important meetings.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eElegant Design:\u003c/strong\u003e As a noble and respected figure, Elrond might appreciate a phone with a sophisticated and understated aesthetic.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the best smartphone for Elrond would likely be one that balances performance, reliability, security, and ease of use, without being overly flashy or distracting from more important matters. He would likely choose a tool that serves its purpose efficiently and effectively, much like the wise counsel he offered throughout the ages.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was just the summary bit.  There was a lot more.  Eventually, when pressed, it coughed up “Elrondroid” as its best answer.  Lame.  Also, that is an operating system, not a phone.  Plus, “Rivencell” was right there for the taking!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I digress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, Pethelen is all “Get back to Rivendell, Elrond needs you!” while Elrond is more, “I hear Dunland is nice this time of year” which was confusing enough, arriving two minutes apart in the middle of a fight with somebody’s dead father.  But all of this reminded me that I was kind of letting the side down on the epic quest front.  Those were starting to pile up in the old quest log.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_134259\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

one hand, my stated purpose is to get to Mordor and, in furtherance of that, I have been quite willing to pass over all sorts of quests and other story building moments… plus crafting, skirmishes, holidays, monster play, and whatever else… in order to not get bogged down.  I want to keep moving forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, I was now in… for me… uncharted territory and did have something of a desire to experience things along the way… and the epic quest line often contain critical bits of color.  I mean, what would volume one be without finding out the truth about the slowest NPC in Middle-earth, \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/there-is-something-about-sara/\"\u003eSara Oakheart and her damn

straight there.  No need to spend time navigating the inter-regional hub and spoke stable master transit network.  Off I went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, it is still a tiresome hoof across Rivendell Valley itself, but whatever.  I got in there, spoke to Pethelen, who was waiting for me out in front of the Last Homely House (Barcaloungers in every room!) and sent me off to talk with Elrond and his sons Degas and Renoir, who were all keen to get the Dunedain band back together to help Aragron, all under the label of “The Grey Company,” which sounded more than a bit familiar to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_134171\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

erm…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I know, I’ve done gotten things out of order… though I didn’t get the message from Elrond until after I had seen Halbarad there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually Elrond gets to the end of his list and I agree to go find Aragorn’s militia buddies, starting with Radanir, who is just one direct ride away via stablemaster according to Elrond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, of course, he is not.  Also, I am pretty sure I saw him too in Enedwaith.  I think I saw all of these guys there.  Again, out of order questing.  Radanir is off somewhere deep in the Trollshaws, so I ride on out to find him, happy that I am way over level so nothing in the zone is interested in tangling with me.  I just have to get him to come along with me to the Grey Company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept, of course, he has some task for me.  They all have tasks for me.  They can’t just go to Aragorn or hand off to somebody else, they need me to wrap up their business.  For this round I need to go kill a guy and clean up a mess.  So I go do that.  Once done, I get back to him and he sends me off to Candaith in the Lone Lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCandaith, still laid out in front of his tent, he can’t quite go yet either.  He’s left his luggage somewhere and can I go grab it for him.  That is fortunately just up the hill.  Piece of cake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sends me to Saeradan’s cabin to talk to him.  He wants some supplies for the trip and could I please ride on down to Bree to pick them up.  There is, of course, an incident, but I get it done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sends me off to find Halros in The Shire.  He sends me riding across the zone, but at least I get to pick up a couple of the stable master locations along the way.  Then he is all “should I stay or should I go now?” and, so far as I can tell, choosing either for him ends up with the same result, so I said “Go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[I later read that your choice effects a later epic quest in Gondor… but what happens if you don’t do the quest at all?]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed me to Halbarad in Esteldin, so I am sure he’s just in his office and I can knock that out quickly.  But I get there, talk to his lieutenant out in front of his office who tells me that he is not there at the moment.  I mean, I knew that, but still.  He is out in the east of the downs, so I am off to find him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is in an instance and is half way through the job when I show up.  That prompts him, in the usual ranger of the north way, to decide it is break time because he can let the new guy clean up.  So I roam a maze of an instance where my job is, among other things, to deface a a statue of the Witch-King.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_134273\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca
