  "description": "Last year Harris, that dastardly lothario, won the annual Novato pumpkin growing contest, which came as a huge shock to Rosie because she thinks heâ€™s mentally inferior. While that may be true, Harris has figured out how to grow big pumpkins. This year, Rosie isnâ€™t holding back. Sheâ€™s put a lot of time and scientific work into maximizing her pumpkin yields. She also read a bunch of books on botany and interviewed all the top minds in the field. Hopefully she can reclaim the crown that Tabs once had. ðŸ˜¸ Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 836 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
