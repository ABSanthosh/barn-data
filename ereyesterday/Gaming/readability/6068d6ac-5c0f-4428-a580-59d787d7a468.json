Stars Reach – Continued Testing I guess the post-campaign pledges apply to stretch goals it seems, as the funding level has crossed over the $750K make as I write this and I have a note that we will have different shield types at launch: Redirect Shield: Catches a single incoming projectile, holds it, and lets the player manually aim and release it in any direction. Only protects from one shot at a time and drains capacitor based on the projectile’s power. Absorption Shield: Converts incoming damage into energy stored in the capacitor, which can be released as a powerful explosion. The more damage absorbed, the bigger the blast. Excess energy or time causes bleed-off or failure. Phase Shield: Temporarily shifts the player into another phase where incoming projectiles pass through harmlessly. While phased, the player cannot interact with the world. Moving through objects may be possible, but risky. I have generally moderated my enthusiasm on the stretch goals as they were all things the team planned to do anyway.  So now they have to get that done before launch.  Eh… At least they did pass the 5K backer mark so Princess Leia hairstyles will be available to all.  Social rewards achieved… even if I wasn’t quite sure what some of that mean. You can rolls, and you get rolls… There was a bit of discussion about how strong the last the 48 hours or so of the campaign would be, whether it would be a U-shaped funding cycle like some of the campaigns of a decade or so back, or if it would be flatter following a trend that was suggested.  Maybe somewhere in between?  Again, something from Kicktraq. The campaign arc, dollars and pledge count I still think there is an argument for a shorter campaign in there somewhere, especially with six negative dollar days on the record.  I am also unconvinced of the efficacy of just talking about plans and vision and not really adding anything to the pre-alpha that would have a real impact on user experience.  Seasons and some changes in mob variety didn’t seem like much to hang one’s hat upon. But if the campaign and been compressed to two weeks… maybe people would have gotten off the fence earlier.  The last four days look like pretty typical for the hold outs who don’t like to jump on the bandwagon too soon.  And if you were going to let pledges carry on after the campaign… I don’t know. That, however, is just me looking for how things might have been done better.  The campaign hits its goal, made $750K, enough to scare up some more real investors, which was the point of the exercise, so op success. Congratulations to the team!  You got my $75.  Now when do I get a spaceship?
