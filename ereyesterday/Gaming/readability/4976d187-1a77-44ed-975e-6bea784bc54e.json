  "description": "Thank you for being a friend. Guess who just discovered The Golden Girls? When sheâ€™s not doing science, Rosieâ€™s been watching reruns of one of my favorite shows ever. Now sheâ€™s trying to get Marnie into her little Golden Girls gang because Rosieâ€™s obsessed with them. Marnieâ€™s kinda into it, but to be honest, I donâ€™t really think she knows whatâ€™s going on. ðŸ˜¹ Rosie is Sophia, and Marnie is Rose from St. Olaf (obviously). To complete the group, Rosie has been trying to find a good Dorothy and Blanche. She put something up on Nextdoor this morning, but she doesnâ€™t have a lot of faith in the cats in the neighborhood. Do you happen to know any cats or dogs whoâ€™d fit the bill?
