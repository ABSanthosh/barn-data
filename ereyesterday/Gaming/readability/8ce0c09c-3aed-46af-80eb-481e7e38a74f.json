One day, she was getting some light awards buzz for roles in indie roles on the festival circuit; the next, she was headlining major films and strutting down red carpets in designer fashion. Now, for another career milestone: As the top-billed star of Marvel’s Thunderbolts*, Pugh continues to solidify her place as one of the most successful actors of her generation.If you’ve been paying attention, Pugh’s rise to A-lister status was painstakingly earned. Before her career-making role in the cult thriller Midsommar — which led to parts in major projects like Little Women and multiple MCU installments — she paid her dues with a series of lesser-known movies. Of the bunch, one of the most overlooked and underrated is the horror flick Malevolent, a Netflix original that landed quietly in 2018 but is worth revisiting as Pugh leads a ragtag team to save the Marvel universe on movie screens across the world this weekend.In Malevolent, Pugh plays Angela, part of a team of phony ghost hunters whose scam runs its course when they’re lured to an actual haunted house. While the group’s scheme mostly relies on technological trickery, Angela appears to have some actual, latent psychic powers. Director Olaf de Fleur reveals these within its first few minutes, showing the world through her eyes as objects mysteriously move and ghosts jump out at her from the shadows (the first of many jump scares Malevolent has in store).Image: Netflix/courtesy Everett CollectionPugh plays all this with surprising coolness, even as the horror amps up in the film’s final act. There’s an impressive stoicism to her performance: she’s calm and collected, with a clear hint of sadness just below the surface. She doesn’t shriek once, at the most letting out a gasp when she comes face to face with one of Malevolent’s many deformed ghosts. This type of subtle performance has become a cornerstone of Pugh’s career. You can see the same approach in movies like Midsommar and Dune: Part Two, where she’s able to establish complex characters with just a few sparse lines of dialogue and a soulful look into the camera. It’s a talent that dates at least back to Malevolent, where Pugh conveys more with a simple facial expression than most actors can with an entire monologue. During the movie’s few happy moments, the camera will sometimes linger on Pugh’s smile for one second too long as it falls away to reveal the despair underneath.That’s also a stylistic choice for Malevolent, as de Fleur makes a habit of holding each shot for an extra second or two, imbuing the movie with a sense of dread that never breaks. He also constructs some impressive shots, including an opening scene in which the camera is framed through the perspective of a young girl. Her father has hired the group to communicate with his dead wife, but as the scene plays out, you can’t see anyone’s faces until they crouch down to speak to the girl directly.Image: Netflix/courtesy Everett CollectionWhile there are plenty of reasons to praise Malevolent — the synthy soundtrack is eerie without sounding like a Stranger Things imitation, and some of the practical effects are downright terrifying — it’s also far from a perfect movie. Not all the characters get quite enough development for their eventual deaths to resonate, and as the film reaches a somewhat hectic climax, it can be hard to follow the action. De Fleur’s insistence on building mood over noisy jump scares also limits Malevolent’s effectiveness as a horror film. Because sometimes, you really do need the main character to scream bloody murder when the moment calls for it.At this point in Pugh’s career, it seems unlikely she’ll ever wind up in another low-budget Netflix horror movie, and that makes Malevolent’s existence all the more special. She may not approach the role in typical scream queen fashion, but her skills as an actor more than make up for it. All the building blocks of a remarkable career are on display here, from her subtle, inward performance to a tangible coolness under pressure she is able to evoke. In the years since, Pugh’s added a few more tricks to her repertoire (you wouldn’t know it from Malevolent, but she’s also hilarious). And yet, even in this imperfect, scary horror flick from 2018, there’s no doubt that Florence Pugh was a movie star in the making.",
