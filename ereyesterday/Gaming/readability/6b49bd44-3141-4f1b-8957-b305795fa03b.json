Right now you can pick one up for just $79.99 on Amazon as well as other retailers. The Google Streamer is one of the best Android-based 4K streaming devices out there right now. It's also much more affordable than other similar options like the Apple TV, Roku Ultra, and Nvidia Shield TV Pro while offering up-to-date features like smart hub functionality and Thread compatibitility.20% Off the Google Streamer 4K (2024)Google Streamer 4KThe Google Streamer 4K was released in September of 2024. It is the successor to the Chromecast 4K, but improves upon it in nearly all aspects. For starters, Google claims that the new processor is up to 22% faster, with double the memory (2GB) and quadruple the onboard storage (32GB). Both high-speed 802.11ac WiFI and gigabit ethernet connectivity options are available. The Google Streamer 4K is now powered via a USB Type-C port, which makes it easier to track down a power brick if you lose the included one, and if you happen to misplace the newly redesigned remote, there's a handy remote-finder button right on the main unit's body.Like other top-shelf models, the Google Streamer 4K can stream at up to 4K resolution in HDR, including Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HDR10+ formats. Although the Google Streamer 4K is equpped with an HDMI 2.1 port, it's limited to 4K @ 60fps. It also supports Dolby Atmos for spatial audio if you pair it with Atmos-compatible speakers like the Sonos Arc. The Steamer can also control your smart home devices and it functions as both a Thread border router and Matter hub.The Google Streamer 4K is comparable to the Apple TV or Roku Ultra but at a lower price point. The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max is less expensive, but the Android TV is a cleaner and more intuitive UI with no annoying Amazon ads. The only obviously superior option (on the streaming side) is the Nvidia Shield TV Pro, but it retails for $200. Throw in bonus smart home functionality and Matter and Thead compatiblity and the Google Streamer 4K is definitely a killer package.Which streaming services should I sign up for?If you want to test out a streaming service for free before you decide to go all-in, we've compiled a list of our favorite platforms that are currently offering free trials.
