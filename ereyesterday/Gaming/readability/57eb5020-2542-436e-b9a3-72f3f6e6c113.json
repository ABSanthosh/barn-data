  "text": "This year marks the 10th anniversary of the release of the Until Dawn game, and I’m thrilled to share with you the world premiere of the trailer for Until Dawn the movie, coming to theaters. PlayStation Productions and Sony Pictures have been working closely with director/producer David F. Sandberg (Annabelle: Creation, Lights Out) and writer/producer Gary Dauberman (It, Annabelle series, The Nun series) to translate Until Dawn to the big screen. In making that transition, we wanted to honor the spirit of the Until Dawn game – especially the idea of decisions with branching paths and deadly consequences – while adapting it in a way that maximizes both the entertainment and terror for moviegoers. Though the movie’s story is set in the same world as the game, it was important to us that the movie wasn’t just a retelling. Instead, the film will feature fresh characters in a new, original story. If you’ve played the game, you know not everything is what it seems. With the movie we wanted to keep the audience guessing until the end. We can’t wait for fans to discover how the events of the movie connect to the Until Dawn game. Peter Stormare, whom you know as Dr. Hill in the game, is one of those key connecting links. The film will delve into his character’s involvement in the events of the game, raising questions for fans to explore. Given Peter’s role spanning both projects, it’s only fitting he introduce the first Until Dawn movie trailer to the world: “I have been lucky to be part of Until Dawn since the original, incredible, super terrifying game, and that’s why I’m so excited to be part of this film, because the whole thing is a love letter to horror, and it completely honors the spirit of the game. The movie is going to be full of fresh characters and victims in a brand-new story, loaded with twists. So whether you’re a longtime fan or you’re discovering it for the first time, get ready for Until Dawn like you’ve never seen it before.” – Peter Stormare Now, enjoy the world premiere of the trailer, and keep checking back, as there will be plenty more updates between now and when Until Dawn hits theaters later this year.
