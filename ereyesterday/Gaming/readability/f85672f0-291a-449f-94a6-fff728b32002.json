Don't mind if I do Image credit: Overhype Studios There's no better news than \"game that hasn't had an update in years just received one\", and this week that applies to Battle Brothers. Despite first releasing eight years ago - almost to the day, its eighth anniversary is in a couple of days time on March 24th - and not receiving a new update in two years, developer Overhype Studios has come back to the game not just with some fixes, but with some new content too. First, the new stuff. There's a couple of new legendary locations that you can explore now, the first one being a place called Abandoned Village. A simple name, but this one is apparently good for mid-game mercenary companies, and can apparently be found by \"simply exploring the world.\" Overhype is keeping quiet about the second one, noting that it's \"more difficult\" and that you'll only find it after conquering the first one. Both will net you the opportunity to round up some new loot and legendary items too. Unfortunately, you'll need to start a completely new campaign in order to access the new content, which might be a bit of an extra pain for those of you that are prone to modding the game. The announcement post for the update explicitly notes that \"most mods will not work anymore until they've been updated by their authors\". Steam typically automatically updates your games in the background, so you'll either have to disable your mods and wait until they're compatible with the new update, or revert to the previous version of the game (Overhype's update post has details on how you can do that). In terms of fixes, there's a whole bunch that have been implemented that were \"accumulated over the last year\", from simple ones to typos, to rare bugs like one would occur when killing a Lindwurm via its tail with a poison-coated weapon. You can read the update post for the full list. Probably also worth noting that the game is currently 70% off on Steam right now, so not a bad time to jump in.",
