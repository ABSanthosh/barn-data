Secret Wars is about is about beginnings.”Marvel Cinematic Universe: Every Upcoming Movie and TV ShowFeige clarified that the MCU’s first X-Men movie, to be directed by Thunderbolts’ Jake Schreier, will be a “reset,” not a “reboot” of the MCU.“Reboot is a scary word,” Feige said. “Reboot can mean a lot of things to a lot of people. Reset, singular timeline — we’re thinking along those lines. … X-Men is where that will happen next.”The X-Men movie will recast the iconic mutants and return the franchise’s focus to being on the young mutants attending Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters.“They have been a place to tell stories about young people who feel different and who feel Other and who feel like they don’t belong,” Feige said. “That’s the universal story of mutants, and that is where we’re going.”Which actors would you like to see play the X-Men in the new film?
