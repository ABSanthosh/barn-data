  "text": "Go hands-on with Nightdive's remaster this Thursday.Nighdive Studios seems to have quietly announced a The Thing: Remastered release date of December 5, 2024.It’s a launch plan that will see the survival horror reimagining arriving later this week if the release date promised in a recent Xbox Wire post is accurate. The post, which was published late last week, specifically covers new Xbox game releases from December 2 through December 6, mentioning titles such as The Thaumaturge, Marvel Rivals, and early access for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Considering Nightdive has yet to announce a proper date and its official Steam page still says launch is simply “coming soon,” The Thing: Remastered’s inclusion should raise some eyebrows.The Thing: Remastered appears to have a release date of December 5, 2024.Nightdive announced its latest remaster at IGN Live in June of this year, promising to deliver a bone-chilling upgrade for the classic 2002 adaptation before 2024 came to a close. A post from the studio’s X/Twitter account promised that the release date is in December earlier today but did not clarify whether the December 5 date shown in the Xbox Wire post is accurate. If it is, then we shouldn’t have to wait much longer before the full experience is available for everyone to play for themselves. In addition to Xbox One and Xbox Series X | S, The Thing: Remastered is currently set to come to PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.Nightdive has made a name for itself as an experienced remaster studio throughout the last few years. Other titles in its catalog include remasters for the Turok trilogy, Star Wars: Dark Forces, System Shock, Shadow Man, and more. The Thing: Remastered promises a suite of additions to help bring the original experience to modern platforms. These include dynamic lighting, up to 144fps, 4K resolution, antialiasing, and other general gameplay improvements.While we wait for Nightdive to share more about its plans for The Thing: Remastered, you can read about PO’ed: Definitive Edition, another one of its projects that launched earlier this year. You can also read up on why we think remakes and remasters are great for gamers, and the top 10 Konami games we think deserve a fresh coat of paint.Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
