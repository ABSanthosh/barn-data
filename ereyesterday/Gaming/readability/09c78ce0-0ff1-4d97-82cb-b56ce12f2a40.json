The Anker Zolo 10,000mAh 30W USB Power Bank is back down to only $15.59, a 40% discount from its original $26 price. This is an excellent deal for an Anker-branded 10,000mAh power bank that can fast charge a Nintendo Switch console at its maximum rate. The Zolo is compact, can completely recharge a Switch console more than once, and has a couple of unique nifty features, like a built-in USB cable and a discrete digital display. Plus, it's decked out in a rare pastel blue, pink, and white color schemes.Anker Zolo 10,000mAh USB Power Bank for $15.59Anker Zolo 10,000mAh 30W USB Power BankThere are two reasons why this power bank is a great battery backup for your Nintendo Switch console: capacity and charging rate. A 10,000mAh (37Whr) power bank can charge a Nintendo Switch OLED from completely empty to full about 1.9 times. Provided you fully charge your Switch from the get-go, that nearly triples your total playtime. At the same time, a 10,000mAh power bank still maintains a pretty small footprint; for example, this particular model is about the size of an iPhone and weighs under 8oz. The Anker Zolo power bank also boasts a 30W charging output over USB Type-C. The Nintendo Switch console accepts a maximum charging rate of 18W. That means this power bank will be able to charge your Switch at the same rate as the official Nintendo charger.The Zolo has a built-in USB cable, however it's not retractable. Instead, you plug it into itself so that it forms a secure loop that's strong enough to be used like a lanyard. I have this power bank myself and I can tell you the loop is quite sturdy. There's also a separate USB Type-C port that be used for either input or output. Finally, there's a simple digital display that shows you the remaining battery charge as a percentage.TSA-ApprovedNote that the TSA requires all power banks to be brought in carry-on bags; power banks are not allowed in check-in regardless of capacity. The Anker power bank's 10,000mAh capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh carry-on limit, so it can be brought onto planes. It's also low-profile enough that no one will take notice in the first place. If a TSA official actually does take the initiative to test the wattage on your power bank, you're well in the clear.For more options, check out our picks for the best power banks of 2024.
