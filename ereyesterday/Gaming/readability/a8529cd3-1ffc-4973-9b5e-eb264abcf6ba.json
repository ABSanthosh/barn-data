  "text": "With both the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, the visual experience on Sony’s console is incredible, especially when paired with the right TV for gaming. Playing games at 4K resolution and 60fps on that new PS5 Pro is fantastic, but to really get in the game, you need the audio experience to match. You’ll do justice in a home theater setup with the proper 7.1 speakers or a great soundbar, but you probably don’t want to be rattling your walls at all times. That doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice sound quality because the best gaming headsets can be just as good, if not better.Here, I’ve rounded up my recommendations for the best PS5 headsets you can buy now. I’ve also split my picks into several categories to make the choice easier for you since prices vary and each headset emphasizes different features and qualities that may matter more to you than others. For example, the Pulse Elite is one of the best picks for PS5 since it’s a Sony first-party product that features some nice platform integration. But if you’re willing to spend more for pure audio quality, the Audeze Maxwell is an easy choice. And if you want to ditch having something clamping over your head, the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds elevate earbuds to the headset levels of performance. TL;DR - These Are the Best PS5 HeadsetsIt's worth noting that from now until June 11 is Sony's PS5 Days of Play sale, which features several deals on hardware and games. This includes accessories like headsets and controllers; unfortunately, it does not include the Pulse Elite or Pulse 3D headsets. However, you can get deep discounts on the Pulse Explore gaming earbuds, the Sony InZone H9 headset, and the InZone noise-cancelling earbuds, all of which we have reviewed and gave high marks. When it comes to our picks, you may notice some crossover in our best overall gaming headsets roundup since many of them have PS5-specific models that take advantage of the console’s specific features. There are also a few first-party options that make the most of the PS5 with features like Tempest 3D spatial audio and further customization that’s native to the platform. Regardless of what you choose to pick up, you’ll end up with something great, which I can attest to since I have first-hand experience with every product I recommend. Everything from sound quality and comfort to ease-of-use and feature set are all factors in deciding which headsets get my stamp of approval. Below, you can read my detailed explanations behind each pick to help you decide which one is right for you. As new headsets come out and I test more of them, I’ll update this list to make sure you’re looking at the top picks. If you're looking for discounts on the best PS5 accessories, check out our picks for the best PS5 deals.This guide contains contributions by Danielle Abraham.1. SteelSeries Arctis Nova ProBest Overall PS5 HeadsetSteelSeries Arctis Nova ProMultiple connectivity options, a hot-swappable battery, excellent sound, and hybrid active noise canceling make this a hard-to-top headset.Connectivity2.4 GHz wireless, Bluetooth, wiredBattery life18-22 hours (per battery)Fully featured with ANC, base station, etcSwappable battery system is innovativeIt seems like everywhere you look for headset recommendations, you’ll come across someone singing the praises of the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro – us included. It’s the current top pick in our overall best gaming headset roundup and it’s also tremendous when using it on the PS5. You still get all the great features with some new technology including active noise cancellation and improved audio all around. Using a hybrid noise-canceling system with four mics, you can drown out harsh noises from outside your room to the ambient hum of loud fans. But it's the full compatiblity with the PS5’s Tempest 3D audio that give it the edge, which is one of console-specific perks you should expect from a top-end headset such as this one.Most importantly, the Nova Pro offers some fantastic sound quality out of the box with bold and balanced audio for those PlayStation-exclusive single-player cinematic experiences. Its positional audio is great as well, so it's easier to hear enemy footsteps around the corner or gauge the distance of action happening in a competitive shooter like Call of Duty Warzone or Apex Legends.The Arctis Nova Pro represents the biggest design shift since the start of the Arctis lineup. Its telescoping arms on its adjustable headband better accommodate larger head sizes and proper fitment. The earcups are also slimmer and sleeker, giving off less of a gaming headset vibe and more of a look akin to wireless headphones without sacrificing the comfort SteelSeries headsets are known for. And one of our favorite features remains intact with a few upgrades: the hot-swappable rechargeable battery system. This means that when the battery runs low during a gaming session, you can quickly change it out without having to plug in, giving you wireless freedom indefinitely.The Arctis Nova Pro is one of the best headsets you can buy right now, regardless of platform but especially for PS5. It’s well-rounded with uniquely robust features, great sound quality for gaming, and comfort to keep you going. Take our word for it – in our Arctis Nova Pro headset review, it earned a rare 10 for all the aforementioned reasons and more.2. PlayStation Pulse EliteBest First-Party PS5 HeadsetPlayStation Pulse EliteGreat sound, a unique look, and multipoint connectivity all come with this headset made with the PS5 in mind.ConnectivityWired, Bluetooth, PlayStation LinkUnique design won’t appeal to allThe PlayStation Pulse Elite wireless headset turned out to be an absolute beast when we reviewed it, which didn’t come as much of a surprise considering its more affordable counterpart, the Pulse 3D, was already a fantastic headset. It has some versatility with Bluetooth connectivity, but when connected to the PS5 with the USB dongle, you can access EQ settings and 3D audio natively. Additionally, you’re able to get audio feeds from both the PS5 and a Bluetooth device simultaneously. With a sleek unibody design, its on-device controls are easy to use since it’s easy to distinguish each button.But at the end of the day, it’s all about audio quality, and the Pulse Elite delivers on that front. The planar magnetic audio drivers help minimize distortion and provide tremendous sound quality that’ll get the most out of your games. There’s strong bass that doesn’t overpower other frequencies, and playing games at loud volumes doesn’t sound harsh when it comes to the mids and highs. Especially when you use the right EQ settings, the Pulse Elite sounds tuned just right for each game. Sony's own Tempest 3D audio is the cherry on top, and a single-player game that takes advantage of this feature gives the experience of an immersive soundstage few headsets can pull off right.For $150, you’re getting a lot for your money. It’s priced well below other high-end headsets, yet performs on par with many of them. It’s also packed with several extra features that make the most of the PS5 as a platform. For all that and more, the Pulse Elite is one of the best PS5 headsets you can get today.3. PlayStation Pulse 3DBest PS5 Headset for 3D AudioPlayStation Pulse 3DDesigned for the PS5 but compatible with many other devices, this affordable headset offers Tempest 3D positional audio for detailed, immersive sound.ConnectivityUSB dongle, 3.5mm jackAffordable for official Sony gearBase level sound quality is greatThe official PlayStation headset that launched alongside the PS5, the Sony Pulse 3D was specifically designed to show off the console’s next-gen audio capabilities. Even several years removed from its release, it still does that very well, particularly when it comes to the PS5’s Tempest 3D AudioTech, the virtual surround sound system designed to enhance positional audio feedback – think enemy fire coming from a certain height and direction, or an NPC talking to you from behind.Even without that 3D audio, our review of the Sony Pulse 3D revealed it to performing headset with a wide soundstage alongside solid overall sound quality. The rounded, well-padded leatherette ear cups are wider than they look, although they can get a tad warm after continuous use. It’s lightweight, too, and the slick white-black color scheme perfectly fits the PS5 hardware. However, I do find the headset to clamp a bit tighter than most, so that's one thing to take note of.A pair of noise-canceling microphones are built into the headset’s ear cups. They work fine and audio comes through loud and clear, though they struggle to completely isolate and eliminate background noise. For the most part, that won’t be a problem. Also, remember to charge this headset at the end of the day or have a very long USB-C cable to plug it in mid-session since it's battery life is on the shorter end.The Pulse 3D headset is an incredible value at $100, giving you a great option for PS5 audio with all the Sony-specific bells and whistles you'd want if you're not willing to shell out the extra money for the Pulse Elite.4. Audeze MaxwellBest High-End PS5 HeadsetAudeze MaxwellThe Audeze Maxwell is a high-end wireless gaming headset from one of the best headphone manufacturers on the planet.ConnectivityUSB-A / USB-C, Bluetooth 5.3, 3.5mm wiredDrivers90mm planar magneticMax battery life80+ hoursTop-notch audio experienceLeans on the heavier sideAlthough our overall top pick is the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro with the Pulse Elite not too far behind, I still find the Audeze Maxwell worth its price tag and a surefire recommendation for those who want the absolute best audio quality. It sports a sleek, non-descript design akin to many audiophile-style pairs of headphones and performs just like one as well. Sometimes I need to break away from the misconception that wired is always better for sound quality, especially when the Audeze Maxwell proved me wrong.Its 90mm planar magnetic drivers jump out from the spec sheet – and while bigger drivers doesn’t always mean better, this is one case in which the audio experience matches the boastful driver size. Overall clarity, balance across frequencies, and a rich natural audio profile make this high-end headset stand out from the rest of the pack. While the aforementioned headsets on this list are fantastic in their own right, especially for their robust features, it’s hard to compete with the Audeze Maxwell purely in the audio department.That said, while the Maxwell is comfortable, it does land on the heavier side of gaming headsets. It’s built like a tank, but if you’re okay with that, then it’s more of a non-issue. When you get a great mix of sound quality, battery life, and features such as a mic with pinpoint noise isolation, it’s easy to justify its high price. I praised it for all that and more in my Audeze Maxwell review where it earned a 9 on our scoring scale.5. Turtle Beach Stealth 500Best Budget PS5 HeadsetTurtle Beach Stealth 500The Turtle Beach Stealth 500 is a wireless gaming headset for under $100, and you can't beat that value.Connectivity2.4GHz, Bluetooth 5.2Durable and flexible buildGreat sound quality for its priceBulky design with messy button layoutYears of solid headsets proves that Turtle Beach knows what it's doing, and its high-end offerings have been competitive options for a while now. But as I go down the pricing hierarchy, there are still impressive headsets like the Stealth 500 that punches above its weight. Although it’s quite bulky in its physical build, I find the Stealth 500 to be smartly designed with a super flexible headband that's durable and lightweight, which also translates to solid comfort that’s easy on the ears.What's most important is sound quality, and what you get from the Stealth 500 is nothing to scoff at. While it may struggle in higher frequencies, which tend to sound a bit crunchy at louder volumes, its strong bass and clear mids make games sound full without coming across as artificial. With the Swarm II software’s Signature Sound profile, you’ll be set without having to fiddle with too many settings. Its positional audio was great as well, which I sussed out while playing ranked matches of Counter-Strike 2, so you don’t really need to shell out the big bucks to get that kind of advantage in competitive games on PS5.Even at this price point, you get Bluetooth capabilities and can swap between devices with the press of a button. While the mic isn’t anything to boast about, it’s serviceable and can be customized in the software as well. It’s no surprise that there are compromises that need to be made in budget-level headsets, but it gets the essentials right, which earned it an 8 in my Stealth 500 review.6. HyperX Cloud IIIBest Wired PS5 HeadsetHyperX Cloud IIIWith great comfort, sound quality, microphone clarity, and durability, the Cloud III is one of HyperX's best headsets.ConnectivityWired (3.5mm), USB-A / USB-CDrivers53mm Angles DriversExtremely durable and flexibleDense earpads for premium-grade comfortGreat sound and mic quality, especially in its price rangeMay clamp a little too tightNo matter which version of the HyperX Cloud headset you go with, you get a quality product. If you’re running on a budget and want to get the most bang for your buck, I always recommend the wired HyperX Cloud III, which can often be found below its $100 base price. It punches above its weight with impressive sound and mic quality and great comfort. Plus, it’s built like a brick house so it’s not going to fall apart through years of use.Out of the box, the Cloud III impressed me with its build and durability – its aluminum frame can be flexed and contorted in any which direction without ever feeling like it’s going to break. Stretching the headset out to fit on your head is super easy and you can toss them on your desk without worrying about damaging them. It's built for comfort as well with dense foam earpads wrapped in a leatherette (just be aware it tends to get a bit sweaty), although its clamp force may be a bit much for some.At the end of the day, it’s all about sound quality and the Cloud III handles various frequencies wonderfully. In my Cloud III headset review, I felt comfortable tracking enemy footsteps while playing a ton of Valorant and enjoyed the balanced audio in Final Fantasy XIV, which this more budget-friendly headset handled gracefully. Assuming you’re on a budget, you probably don’t want to spend extra on a decent microphone – luckily, the mic clarity on the Cloud III was equally as impressive. While there is a wireless version of the Cloud III available, the wired model presents some of the best value and performance. Something like the Beyerdynamic MMX 300 Pro is a current analog favorite, but since you're plugging into the DualSense when you're using a wired headset on PS5, it somewhat limits what you can get out of said headset. Thus, the Cloud III strikes the better value proposition.7. Alienware Pro HeadsetBest Noise-Canceling PS5 HeadsetAlienware Pro HeadsetDefying its own brand tradition, Alienware went with a super-sleek design for the Pro headset and brings great sound quality as well as great ANC and comfort.ConnectivityBluetooth, USB-C dongle, USB wiredDrivers50mm Graphene-CoatedMax battery life70 hours (35 hours with ANC)Sleek, non-descript designANC and mic ANC both work excellentlySoftware support isn't greatOver the years, Alienware's forte has been custom built PCs and has explored gaming peripherals since. It rethought its design philosophy and came out with the Pro headset earlier this year with great success, as I detail in my Alienware Pro headset review. I love its slim and sleek design (somewhat matching the design philosophy of Sony's PS5 products), which also makes it easily double-up as a casual everyday pair of headphones, and that really makes its active noise-canceling features sing.As a gaming headset, it brings booming bass to support all the other frequencies so PS5 games are going to have a powerful low-end to give a proper cinematic experience, but it's also tuned to be fit for competitive games as well. When it comes to comfort, its memory foam earbuds get the job done even though they don't look impressive at first glance. The flexible headband lets the Alienware Pro headset clamp easily on my head to help it stay comfortable for several hours of play.If you're looking for good ANC above all else, I can easily recommend the Alienware Pro headset since it's very good at drowning out ambient noise and retains solid battery life even though ANC tends to drain battery rapidly. That good ANC extends to the microphone as well, so while the overall microphone quality isn't that impressive, it's fantastic at isolating your voice.8. Turtle Beach Atlas AirBest Open-Back PS5 HeadsetTurtle Beach Atlas AirThe Turtle Beach Atlas Air is a high-end open-back PC gaming headset that is extremely comfortable, and sounds good to boot.ConnectivityBluetooth, USB dongle, 3.5mm jackUnique, ultra comfortable lightweight designExcellent audio performanceIf the name wasn’t a dead giveaway, our hands-on review of the Turtle Beach Atlas Air confirmed it is a well-cushioned, surprisingly lightweight headset you’ll be happy to have on your noggin for hours. The earcups are stuffed with memory foam and are are almost \"floating\" for multidirectional movement to limit pressure and improve weight distribution. The headband is made of super flexible mesh with an adjustable velcro strap, aiding in the feathery feel. If that’s not enough to convince you this is one of the comfiest headsets out there, the open-back design provides more airflow and breathability, ideal for gaming marathons.Turtle Beach makes it simple to connect the Atlas Air to the PS5, with an option for a wired or wireless link, including a USB dongle for a low latency connection. Buttons on the earcups also make it easy to switch between different connectivity modes. Beyond being great for the PS5, this versatile option is one of the best gaming headsets for PC, as well. Plus, when using it wirelessly, the 50 hours of battery life is a massive boon, so recharging is less of a hassle. Perhaps most important is how the Turtle Beach Atlas Air sounds, and it doesn’t disappoint. The open-back design makes for a more natural sound and better directional audio, though you’ll have to deal with some leakage. The 40mm drivers support 24-bit audio with booming lows and crisp highs that put other gaming headsets to shame. It’s also chock full of features to tweak your sound like Waves 3D Audio, 10-Band EQs, and even \"Superhuman Hearing.\" However, not all these features will be available on the PS5.Rounding out this absolutely stunning gaming headset is a highly capable unidirectional detachable boom mic that’ll keep you coming across clear to teammates. It’s hard not to fall for this light, flexible, great-sounding headset.9. SteelSeries Arctis GameBudsBest PS5 EarbudsSteelSeries Arctis GameBudsSteelSeries built the Arctis GameBuds for gaming and deliver booming audio with solid battery life low-latency thanks to its 2.4GHz dongle.ConnectivityBluetooth, 2.4GHz USB-C dongleDrivers10mm Neodymium MagneticBetter battery life than most earbudsControls, software, and ANC add valueA few features are hard to get workingGaming earbuds are a fairly recent trend with the notable peripheral companies like Razer, Asus, and PlayStation making their own that are suited for games. It's tough because of the limited driver size and battery life, earbuds tend to make sacrifices in one way or another. But the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds are so impressive because of how uncompromising these little rounded buds are.On top of having solid foundations of sound quality, battery life, and long-term comfort, SteelSeries has one of the most robust software suites, which is easily controllable through a mobile app. This takes out the inconvenience of having to flip through PS5 menus to customize the earbuds, while also letting you access its 100+ custom-tuned EQ profiles easily. Although there are a few minor inconveniences with how some of its quality-of-life features work (autoplay when taking it on and off, connecting through Bluetooth reliably), the GameBuds do all the important things extremely well. While you should definitely use these as your primary earbuds to listen to music on your phone, they really shine in games with the kind of bold audio experience you expect from a headset. For all that and more, I gave a 9 to the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds in my review, and they'll pair nicely with your PS5.At $160, these have cheaper base price than the Razer Hammerheads I previously recommended. While I still think the Hammerheads have a very slight edge in sound quality, it's the battery life, software support, and overall comfort that make the GameBuds the best all around.PS5 Headsets FAQHow do you determine sound quality on a gaming headset?There are ways to extract audio data from a headset to get a look at how they handle various frequencies, like artificial ear and audio analyzing software, but that alone won’t be able to tell you what the actual audio experience is like. Admittedly, it can be quite abstract to have someone describe what games, music, or movies sound like. Paying attention to descriptors like distortion, drowning, cleanliness, or balance when talking about frequencies are common ways to explain the sound quality of a device, and at some point you need to trust the reviewer’s trained ear.There’s also the factor of driver size, the actual hardware that delivers the audio. Generally, bigger drivers means better potential for cleaner and bolder sound, but again, that alone isn’t going to determine whether or not a headset sounds good. Quality can also come down to spatial or positional audio which gives the impression of sound effects having distance and direction – it’s important for competitive settings but can make for audio more suited for cinematic games.As I talk about further down, the PS5 in particular has embraced 3D audio in a way other platforms have not. It may seem like a gimmick at first glance, but when done right, it can give you a genuinely immersive experience – not just for direction and distance, but also verticality in the sound design. This gives headsets like the Pulse Elite and Pulse 3D an advantage when picking out the best PS5 headset since 3D audio definitely affects how good games can sound.What makes gaming headsets different from headphones?Gaming headsets tend to pack additional features that support the actual gaming experience, some of which may be gimmicky, but many that I would call essential. Not everyone wants to have a standalone microphone, for example, but the key feature that separates a headset from headphones is a built-in microphone. While most headset mics are passable in terms of clarity that can suffice for in-game communication, some go the extra mile to provide better clarity or mitigate ambient noise spilling through.Good gaming headsets are generally tuned to pick up on certain sound effects and have a more intimate sound profile since you’re an active participant in the experience rather than a passive observer (especially in competitive games). When it comes to wireless capabilities, most gaming headsets come with 2.4GHz USB dongles for the lowest latency possible – something that wireless headphones rarely include. As you’ll see in the next section, software suites for USB-based headsets (wireless or otherwise) have gotten sophisticated and sometimes offer a level of customization for specific gaming scenarios.Should I go wired or wireless for a gaming headset?Of course, it depends on your needs. On PC, I still gravitate towards wired headsets and headphones since I tend to prefer the sound profiles of a properly-tuned analog audio device (I also tend to forget about charging devices until it’s too late, but that’s a me-problem). However, battery life and latency of modern gaming headsets have come so far that you rarely, if ever, see them being issues on the latest releases. Good software suites and apps can also help you get more out of your headset by letting you customize EQ settings or swap sound profiles for certain games.Wireless headsets are also sometimes capable of multi-device connectivity and simultaneous Bluetooth, which makes them versatile and opens them up to more use-cases (especially swapping to a mobile connection within seconds). Even though they tend to be more expensive, there’s a lot of upside to going with a wireless gaming headset, just be sure you know what you’ll be getting out of it.On PS5, you're better going off with a wireless headset, though. Since 3.5mm analog wired audio devices have to go through the DualSense controller's, there's an upper limit to how good they can sound. Don't get it twisted, though – headsets and headphones can still sound great when fed through the DualSense, but it'll be diminishing returns when using audiophile-type gear. After all, the console experience is best when free of wires.Is 3D audio worth it?Made specifically for the PS5, Tempest 3D AudioTech to simulate 360-degree audio in supported PS5 games. That means you can tell the direction the audio is coming from, be it a helicopter overhead or enemy fire coming from whichever direction, it's an experiential marvel more so than an advantage. It’s similar to Windows Sonic on the Xbox Series X/S, but Sony has embraced it to greater extent and its implementation on the PS5 is a really neat perk. And to boot, plenty of the best PS5 headsets support Sony’s 3D audio, including the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P, Sony Pulse 3D, and PlayStation Pulse Elite wireless headset.The Sony Pulse 3D does a good job showing off the PS5’s next-gen 3D audio tech, whereby noises and sounds are emulated to appear in a 360-degree space around your ears, and even expressing a greater level of verticality to positional sound in some instances. It’s straightforward to set up, comfortable, and surprisingly affordable for an official PlayStation headset, and a great choice if you want to see exactly what the PS5’s 3D audio can do.Do you need a Bluetooth adapter for your PS5?If you're hoping to connect wireless headphones and headsets to your PS5, you will need a compatible Bluetooth adapter. The PS5 does not currently support direct pairing with any Bluetooth headphones for audio output. However, when it comes to latency, you're best served using headsets with 2.4GHz dongles, which all our recommended headsets come with.What is PlayStation Link? PlayStation Link is Sony’s latest wireless connectivity standard that provides a lightning-fast connection, lossless audio, and ultra-low latency with easy switching between different devices. The PlayStation Portal is the only gaming device with the technology built-in. So, you’ll need the PS Link USB dongle when using the PS5, PS5 Slim, PS5 Pro, and PC. Still, at the moment, only a couple of Sony’s peripherals have this technology, including the PlayStation Pulse Elite wireless headset in this guide.Originally posted: May 30, 2025 10:30 pm",

And one of our favorite features remains intact with a few upgrades: the hot-swappable rechargeable battery system.

It has some versatility with Bluetooth connectivity, but when connected to the PS5 with the USB dongle, you can access EQ settings and 3D audio natively. Additionally, you’re able to get audio feeds from both the PS5 and a Bluetooth device simultaneously.

The planar magnetic audio drivers help minimize distortion and provide tremendous sound quality that’ll get the most out of your games. There’s strong bass that doesn’t overpower other frequencies, and playing games at loud volumes doesn’t sound harsh when it comes to the mids and highs. Especially when you use the right EQ settings, the Pulse Elite sounds tuned just right for each game. Sony\u0026#39;s own Tempest 3D audio is the cherry on top, and a single-player game that takes advantage of this feature gives the experience of an immersive soundstage few headsets can pull off right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eFor $150, you’re getting a lot for your money.

The rounded, well-padded leatherette ear cups are wider than they look, although they can get a tad warm after continuous use.

But as I go down the pricing hierarchy, there are still impressive headsets like the Stealth 500 that punches above its weight. Although it’s quite bulky in its physical build, I find the Stealth 500 to be smartly designed with a super flexible headband that\u0026#39;s durable and lightweight, which also translates to solid comfort that’s easy on the ears.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s most important is sound quality, and what you get from the Stealth 500 is nothing to scoff at. While it may struggle in higher frequencies, which tend to sound a bit crunchy at louder volumes, its strong bass and clear mids make games sound full without coming across as artificial. With the Swarm II software’s Signature Sound profile, you’ll be set without having to fiddle with too many settings. Its positional audio was great as well, which I sussed out while playing ranked matches of Counter-Strike 2, so you don’t really need to shell out the big bucks to get that kind of advantage in competitive games on PS5.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eEven at this price point, you get Bluetooth capabilities and can swap between devices with the press of a button.

Stretching the headset out to fit on your head is super easy and you can toss them on your desk without worrying about damaging them. It\u0026#39;s built for comfort as well with dense foam earpads wrapped in a leatherette (just be aware it tends to get a bit sweaty), although its clamp force may be a bit much for some.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eAt the end of the day, it’s all about sound quality and the Cloud III handles various frequencies wonderfully. \u003ca href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyperx-cloud-iii-gaming-headset-review-built-different/1100-6514777/\" data-cy=\"styled-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eIn my Cloud III headset review\u003c/a\u003e, I felt comfortable tracking enemy footsteps while playing a ton of Valorant and enjoyed the balanced audio in Final Fantasy XIV, which this more \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-budget-gaming-headset\"\u003ebudget-friendly headset\u003c/a\u003e handled gracefully.

It\u0026#39;s tough because of the limited driver size and battery life, earbuds tend to make sacrifices in one way or another. But the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds  are so impressive because of how uncompromising these little rounded buds are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eOn top of having solid foundations of sound quality, battery life, and long-term comfort, SteelSeries has one of the most robust software suites, which is easily controllable through a mobile app. This takes out the inconvenience of having to flip through PS5 menus to customize the earbuds, while also letting you access its 100+ custom-tuned EQ profiles easily. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eAlthough there are a few minor inconveniences with how some of its quality-of-life features work (autoplay when taking it on and off, connecting through Bluetooth reliably), the GameBuds do all the important things extremely well. While you should definitely use these as your primary earbuds to listen to music on your phone, they really shine in games with the kind of bold audio experience you expect from a headset. For all that and more, I gave a 9 to the \u003ca data-cy=\"styled-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/steelseries-arctis-gamebuds-gaming-earbuds-review\"\u003eSteelSeries Arctis GameBuds in my review\u003c/a\u003e, and they\u0026#39;ll pair nicely with your PS5.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eAt $160, these have cheaper base price than the Razer Hammerheads I previously recommended. While I still think the Hammerheads have a very slight edge in sound quality, it\u0026#39;s the battery life, software support, and overall comfort that make the GameBuds the best all around.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp id=\"faq\"\u003e\u003ch2 data-cy=\"title2\" data-toc-title=\"FAQ\"\u003ePS5 Headsets FAQ\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 data-cy=\"title3\"\u003eHow do you determine sound quality on a gaming headset?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThere are ways to extract audio data from a headset to get a look at how they handle various frequencies, like artificial ear and audio analyzing software, but that alone won’t be able to tell you what the actual audio experience is like. Admittedly, it can be quite abstract to have someone describe what games, music, or movies sound like. Paying attention to descriptors like distortion, drowning, cleanliness, or balance when talking about frequencies are common ways to explain the sound quality of a device, and at some point you need to trust the reviewer’s trained ear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThere’s also the factor of driver size, the actual hardware that delivers the audio. Generally, bigger drivers means better potential for cleaner and bolder sound, but again, that alone isn’t going to determine whether or not a headset sounds good. Quality can also come down to spatial or positional audio which gives the impression of sound effects having distance and direction – it’s important for competitive settings but can make for audio more suited for cinematic games.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eAs I talk about further down, the PS5 in particular has embraced 3D audio in a way other platforms have not. It may seem like a gimmick at first glance, but when done right, it can give you a genuinely immersive experience – not just for direction and distance, but also verticality in the sound design. This gives headsets like the Pulse Elite and Pulse 3D an advantage when picking out the best PS5 headset since 3D audio definitely affects how good games can sound.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 data-cy=\"title3\"\u003eWhat makes gaming headsets different from headphones?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eGaming headsets tend to pack additional features that support the actual gaming experience, some of which may be gimmicky, but many that I would call essential. Not everyone wants to have a standalone microphone, for example, but the key feature that separates a headset from headphones is a built-in microphone. While most headset mics are passable in terms of clarity that can suffice for in-game communication, some go the extra mile to provide better clarity or mitigate ambient noise spilling through.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eGood gaming headsets are generally tuned to pick up on certain sound effects and have a more intimate sound profile since you’re an active participant in the experience rather than a passive observer (especially in competitive games). When it comes to wireless capabilities, most gaming headsets come with 2.4GHz USB dongles for the lowest latency possible – something that wireless headphones rarely include. As you’ll see in the next section, software suites for USB-based headsets (wireless or otherwise) have gotten sophisticated and sometimes offer a level of customization for specific gaming scenarios.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 data-cy=\"title3\"\u003eShould I go wired or wireless for a gaming headset?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eOf course, it depends on your needs. On PC, I still gravitate towards wired headsets and headphones since I tend to prefer the sound profiles of a properly-tuned analog audio device (I also tend to forget about charging devices until it’s too late, but that’s a me-problem). However, battery life and latency of modern gaming headsets have come so far that you rarely, if ever, see them being issues on the latest releases. Good software suites and apps can also help you get more out of your headset by letting you customize EQ settings or swap sound profiles for certain games.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eWireless headsets are also sometimes capable of multi-device connectivity and simultaneous Bluetooth, which makes them versatile and opens them up to more use-cases (especially swapping to a mobile connection within seconds). Even though they tend to be more expensive, there’s a lot of upside to going with a wireless gaming headset, just be sure you know what you’ll be getting out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eOn PS5, you\u0026#39;re better going off with a wireless headset, though. Since 3.5mm analog wired audio devices have to go through the DualSense controller\u0026#39;s, there\u0026#39;s an upper limit to how good they can sound. Don\u0026#39;t get it twisted, though – headsets and headphones can still sound great when fed through the DualSense, but it\u0026#39;ll be diminishing returns when using audiophile-type gear. After all, the console experience is best when free of wires.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 data-cy=\"title3\"\u003eIs 3D audio worth it?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eMade specifically for the PS5, Tempest 3D AudioTech to simulate 360-degree audio in supported PS5 games. That means you can tell the direction the audio is coming from, be it a helicopter overhead or enemy fire coming from whichever direction, it\u0026#39;s an experiential marvel more so than an advantage. It’s similar to Windows Sonic on the Xbox Series X/S, but Sony has embraced it to greater extent and its implementation on the PS5 is a really neat perk. And to boot, plenty of the best PS5 headsets support Sony’s 3D audio, including the \u003ca href=\"https://zdcs.link/7LMMD?_ga=549648315.1689878480\u0026amp;object_uuid=e3d195d6-e88c-4d34-8680-d6e4d1b44e87\u0026amp;t=article\" data-cy=\"styled-link\" data-aps-asin=\"B0B8Q9FGMD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://zdcs.link/nPEbD?_ga=549648315.1689878480\u0026amp;object_uuid=e3d195d6-e88c-4d34-8680-d6e4d1b44e87\u0026amp;t=article\" data-cy=\"styled-link\" data-aps-asin=\"B08FC6QLKN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eSony Pulse 3D\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://zdcs.link/q7o7q?_ga=549648315.1689878480\u0026amp;object_uuid=e3d195d6-e88c-4d34-8680-d6e4d1b44e87\u0026amp;t=article\" data-cy=\"styled-link\" data-aps-asin=\"B0CMDH9M5W\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cu\u003ePlayStation Pulse Elite wireless headset\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003eThe Sony Pulse 3D does a good job showing off the PS5’s next-gen 3D audio tech, whereby noises and sounds are emulated to appear in a 360-degree space around your ears, and even expressing a greater level of verticality to positional sound in some instances.

The PS5 does not currently support direct pairing with any Bluetooth headphones for audio output. However, when it comes to latency, you\u0026#39;re best served using headsets with 2.4GHz dongles, which all our recommended headsets come with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 data-cy=\"title3\"\u003eWhat is PlayStation Link? \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp data-cy=\"paragraph\"\u003ePlayStation Link is Sony’s latest wireless connectivity standard that provides a lightning-fast connection, lossless audio, and ultra-low latency with easy switching between different devices.
