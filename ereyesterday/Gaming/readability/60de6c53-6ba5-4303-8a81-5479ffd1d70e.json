Whenever it went in, the Keepstar was setup by yesterday afternoon my time and the pings started going out for move ops to the new front line location. In the heart of northwest Insmother The system lays astride key routes through the region and puts us within capital jump range of most of the region. The distance between C-J6MT and our last staging in Scalding Pass was not that big.  The two are just under 4.1 lightyears apart, easy jump range for capitals, with titan bridges for subcaps going along. The jump to the new staging system We are also just a few gates from EFM-C4 and the path into Etherium Reach, should we want to visit again. The move ops were of the simple, do it yourself style that the Imperium has favored in recent times.  For capital ships, a fleet is setup with a cyno lit at the destination.  You join the fleet, undock, jump to the cyno, and dock back up again; move complete! I packed up my Apostle on my main and my Archon on my alt, putting my subcaps in the hangar bays and spare items in the cargo, determined not to leave anything behind like before… I leave a trail of litter behind me at times… including implant clones.  Then I joined the fleet and undocked with the other capital ships and made my jump. Undocking from the bright red X2 Keepstar I suspect that the Keepstar was only freshly deployed because when I landed it only had the default SKIN on it.  Nobody had applied any colors to it.  But it did have a name. Will PanFam believe us? Later, when I showed up with a third character, somebody had applied some SKINR touches to the structure to make it stand out.  Nobody wants to see the default texture on a Keepstar or a titan. The Keepstar in C-J6MT In addition to moving between the two staging Keepstars, it was also an opportunity for people to get back from places where they might have had to log off mid-fight or for other reasons.  Real life will get in the way and even the simple-ish Keepstar shoot on Monday had a couple thousand pilots in motion between multiple systems.  So they got rides home as well. As I noted back at the start of the invasion, for old goons the region of Insmother and the system of C-J6MT is a place with history, the foundation of the Red Alliance defense back in 2006 and the place where Goonswarm learned to fight from the Russians.  Many alliances have held the system since… Red Alliance has come and gone multiple times… but according to DOTLAN, this is the first time Goonswarm has owned the system. Right now, with PanFam mostly ceding the region to us, we are unlike to find battles and glory like those of the old Red Alliance days.  But we still have a region to finish conquering, with systems to take and plenty of structures to blow up.  So the war goes on, such that it is.",

to get back from places where they might have had to log off mid-fight or for other reasons.  Real life will get in the way and even the simple-ish Keepstar shoot on Monday had a couple thousand pilots in motion between multiple systems.  So they got rides home as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I noted \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/05/24/the-imperium-announces-an-invasion-of-insmother/\"\u003eback at the start of the invasion\u003c/a\u003e, for old goons the region of Insmother and the system of C-J6MT is a place with history, the foundation of the Red Alliance defense back in 2006 and the place where Goonswarm learned to fight from the Russians.  Many alliances have held the system since… Red Alliance has come and gone multiple times… but \u003ca href=\"https://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/C-J6MT\"\u003eaccording to DOTLAN\u003c/a\u003e, this is the first time Goonswarm has owned the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, with PanFam mostly ceding the region to us, we are unlike to find battles and glory like those of the old Red Alliance days.  But we still have a region to finish conquering, with systems to take and plenty of structures to blow up.  So the war goes on, such that it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
