  "text": "There weren't quite 61 indies, but there were a lot of them Image credit: insertdisc5 The Six One Indie Showcase is a bit of a new kid on the block when it comes to video game presentations, but it's certainly working hard to justify itself. Early today the latest showcase was held showing off a huge range of indies, 48 in total, some of them being brand new reveals, others smaller showcases. There's honestly too many showcases around these days, to see a show with a lot of games that made me go \"oh I'm going to put that on my wishlist\" is a treat. So, here's just a few I think you should check out, because I'm just one freelancer on the night shift and I can't do them all, but I'd like you to take a look anyway. First up was a proper reveal of Truth Scrapper, the next games from the dev behind In Stars and Time. This one's a scrapbooking visual novel where your memories reset every day, but there's a mystery that you need to solve. Did I mention there's toxic lesbians? Instant winner. Truth Scrapper Trailer | Six One Indie Showcase: May 2025 Watch on YouTube I've had my eye on Artis Impact for a little while now, an incredibly stylish pixelart turn-based RPG set in a world overrun by AI. Sounds a bit too relatable right now, but I'm still in. 1000 Deaths is a \"gravity-bending 3D platformer where your choices matter\", and also a game that looks like graphics card box art from the '90s and 2000s. To be clear, this is the highest of compliments I can hand out. Okay, this one isn't a game per se, but it does also involve the number 1000. Last year's seminal 1000xRESIST is getting a ridiculously gorgeous looking vinyl set that comes in two versions - one with one set of sisters, one with another. The recent fanzine for the game (which you can download for free on itch.io) is getting a physical edition too! Then we've got Forbidden Solitaire, a \"card-slashing horror game about unearthing the contents of a cryptic 1995 CD-ROM that should have never existed.\" This one's for the card game weirdos (I am card game weirdos). Jump the Track mixes choice based visual novels with pachinko, following an ambitious slacker called Sam who doesn't understand why we're supposed to spend our lives working awful jobs while the rich get to live it up. I think you just need to watch the trailer for GlitchSPANKR, I think any approach I take to explaining it will get it wrong. And then there's Kidbash: Super Legend, a very charming and nostalgic-looking roguelike action-platformer set in a \"world of forgotten game characters as a hero with no memory of his past.\" The Six One Indie Showcase really did just have what looked like banger after banger, it'll be worth your time to go and watch the full thing and get wishlisting anything else that catches your eye.",
