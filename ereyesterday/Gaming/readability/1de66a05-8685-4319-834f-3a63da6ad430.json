I am not saying they cannot blow their own horn, but when that alone starts to extend out to Beethoven’s 9th symphony duration of a performance, you might not be on the right track. Anyway, they do cover a lot and there is a lot to think about and write about.  But the stunner for me, the lede that was buried in the announcements in my biased opinion, was the stated plan to start working on the in-game map again. The map! Everybody sing the map song! I love the current in-game map and I hate the current in-game map. I love it because it is pretty impressive and it does, if you know how to manipulate it, display useful information… or at least semi-informative trivia.  The location of my current fleet members in space… useful.  An accounting of every system in New Eden I have visited, how many times I have been there, and the date/time of my last visit… kind of cool trivia, but perhaps not directly valuable to the key questions a map should help you answer, which are “where am I?” and “how do I get to where I want to go?” I hate it because it doesn’t answer those two questions.  It is an attempt to recreate the actual shape of New Eden in a 2D window with every star positioned at exactly the right location relative to all of the others.  The fidelity of its representation of New Eden is beyond dispute. But if I want to see what system is two gates over I go to DOTLAN because it is a logical representation of systems and connections that dispenses with the idea of exact physical relationship between stars and just tells you that T51Z-2 is next door to 1DQ1-A, that there is a gate between the two, who owns each system and their general relationship to the rest of the systems in the Delve region when it comes to travel by gate. When you use DOTLAN to plan travel by jump drive ships, where distance does matter, it uses a flat map that actually represents the distance between stars because that data point is valuable and can impact your planning.  You the planner might route you through a hostile system, but you can see what other systems are available and re-route accordingly. I wrote a whole post two years back, Five New Eden Maps Better Than Either EVE Online In Game Map, where I listed out no fewer that fourteen different third party maps of New Eden that were more useful than the in-game maps, because I made fifth place a ten-way tie because I wanted to give credit to any map that was more useful.  And I am sure I missed some. And you’ll note I say “either” in-game map, because CCP has TWO in-game maps.  I still use the original one, mostly out of habit, but also because the “new” one was less feature rich at its launch, so I never made the cut over. But I could cut over to the new map if I wanted to.  The problem is that both maps were built on the same foundation, the idea that the in-game map must be an accurate representation of the physical space of New Eden.  So, for a new player who hasn’t found DOTLAN yet, they are equally as bad.  They are basically the same problem in two slightly different graphical style. One refreshing bit of the keynote was when they said, point blank, that they do not introduce new players to the map at any point during the tutorial or career agent missions because it is just a big screen of unusable data. So they are going to start trying to fix that with the Legion expansion they announced yesterday.  The first step will be to make the UI around the map easier to navigate.  Right now there is a panel that comes up that you can hide and lose if you’re not careful with a bunch of categories and radio buttons that can represent a bunch of different data views laid down over the map, not all of which are clearly explained or have much relevance to a new player. Making that better is good.  I applaud that.  The actual map view is still an unusable mess where one often cannot tell which stars are connected by gates directly, especially if they are in a cluster of stars… the lines all merge and overlap and are generally just a jumble… but at least you’ll know what the map is trying to show you. But they also teased us with a potential future view of the map, a logical view that no doubt owes a lot to DOTLAN and other fan created maps and tools. (This is visible on the video here.) The Future of the In-Game Map Anyway, I am happy to see that they have the map on their list of things to do once more and that they seemed to have finally learned the lessons of the last map update so that they are not going to just recreate all the issues of the first map once more.  We’re not going to get this all with Legion, but they are on their way to a better map. CCP has put up the keynote address on YouTube if you want to watch. Now to hope that they get the EVE Legion keynote and panels up on YouTube so I don’t have to dig through them, because they were all going on while I was still asleep.",
