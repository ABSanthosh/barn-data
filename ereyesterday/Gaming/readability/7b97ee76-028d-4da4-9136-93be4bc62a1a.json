From Delve to the east Anyway, I have spent a week fretting and trying to get ready, but my impatience to be done is already showing.  Stuff is going on… it just hasn’t made its way down to me yet. Action in Delve and Beyond The most obvious thing is that Delve has been very active.  The MER for October will likely show a noticeable increase in losses as PanFam,Fraternity, and others have put in effort to grab the careless moving their stuff around the region… or worse, those trying to YOLO all the way to UALX-3 on their own.  Hot spots on the trail tend to be around the regional gate between 49-U6U in Querious and 4-07MU in Catch.  There is a ping almost daily detailing where somebody decided to gate their capital between those two systems and got caught by hostiles. And there is a ping almost every day where somebody accepts a fleet invite from Sven Bauer or somebody like them, is warped off tether via fleet warp, and ganked in some far corner of the system.  It has been something of a blood bath at times. Also, all jump beacons have been turned off because we’re so bad we can’t stop jumping to them even though they are all named “loss mail generator” and the bads camp them and wait for us to jump to them. On the flip side of that, if you want some easy to reach combat, home defense fleets have been popping up often to drive the rascals out of our space. Harpies undock for Home Defense (Also, as an aside, that red patch on the front of that Harpy SKIN could very easily be turned into a shark’s mouth… the CCP art team should get on that.) I got into a few fleets in one afternoon and got in on a couple of kills on each.  It can be frustrating at times because the bads are there to gank and not to fight, so you have to catch up to them and pin them down… but that is why we have interdiction bubbles in null sec.  The right bubble means a sudden toe to toe brawl. Sometimes, when important things are going on, we chase the bads into the NPC stations in Delve then bubble them in until some jump freighters or other ops have made it to their destination. Bubbling bads into NPC Delve since 2012 There is just a lot going on in Delve right now. Progress so Far In the “make myself feel a little bit better” column, I have accomplished a few things. I have managed to get all my stuff in Delve consolidated in the Keepstar in 1DQ1-A.  Go me. I repackages a bunch of ships, repackaged the modules, and set four shipping contracts to get them sent either to Jita… for ships no longer in doctrine… or UALX-3. Otherwise, as of this writing I have exactly three ships so far in our new stager… and two were moved there in a fleet op on the first day of the announcement.  The third is an Astero that I flew in on an alt while hunting for Crimson Harvest sites.  He got in the neighborhood and I figured why not just carry on. Market Crash Because we’re leaving a lot of things have turned into a fire sale.  I’ve pulled my latest batch of PI off the market and have not bothered to restart any of my PI farms.  Prices on bulky commodities like that have all taken a big dip and are unlikely to get better any time soon.  Everybody is keen to clear their stock and the buyers know it.  Sell orders are chasing buy orders down and down. I still have to go out and collect the last bits of PI sitting on my planets, then shut all those down.  I am not going to keep PI going in Delve if we’re living in Tenerifis. But my income for the month is going to be pretty minimal.  The PI was sustaining my modest lifestyle and now that will be disrupted for quite a stretch. Avoidance I wandered into Amarr high sec while doing some of the Crimson Harvest sites… more on that in another post… and ended up going through all the crap I have in the Domain region and putting it up on the market at fire sale prices to just get that off of my assets list. Won’t somebody buy my Vivid Hemorphite So that is off my list of things I was never going to do but suddenly found inspiration for.  This was all part of me learning that region-wide buy orders are a bad idea.  The light missiles for 5 ISK each all went pretty fast… I think I had 1 ISK buy orders in mission hubs back in the day… which makes me wonder how expensive light missiles are these days.  5 ISK used to feel a bit greedy.  I don’t know. Frustrations The biggest problem for me is that I am split between not knowing how I am going to move the stuff I have and being impatient to get going.  I just want to start getting stuff to the new place, but all the move ops this past week have been focused on getting things to 1DQ. Well, all the move ops for line members, anyway.  I’ve been out to cover dozens of jump freighters landing in UALX. Freight landing at our new staging And I know there is an order to things.  GSOL and other groups have to get there first and get things ready.  But I look at all the ships I have sitting around that are a bit too valuable just to trash or reprocess… and I get a bit overwhelmed. Whoever put this view into the UI clearly wanted to make me anxious Going through these hulls assembles a history of my time in Delve… in my brain at least.  There are left over ECM burst interceptors (once excellent for padding ones kill board and used heavily in the early stages of World War Bee), a Stratios from that time we cloaky camped CO2 in Impass, the Prospect from when I thought I have the time/patience for gas harvesting (I have neither and never found a single gas site), the Sin from the first iteration of Stupid Idiot Fleet, a Scythe Fleet Issue that was undocked exactly once to try and go rob space banks with Asher back when that was first a thing.  Oh, and the boosting Damnation I flew at the first battle of M2-XFE. My Damnation in the orange of another explosion at M2-XFE To hell with Marie Kondo, this all manages to bring my joy and anxiety at the same time!  I have this same problem when I try to clear out my bookshelf or closet.  I become hung up in the history of the things there rather than any current or future utility or value. Also, I clearly don’t lose enough ships. As noted above I concluded pretty quickly that I was going to need to just repackage a bunch of this ships and just buy new rigs at the far end, so I started trying to use our shipping services… however they are slammed with requests so that three out of the four contracts look like they will expire unfulfilled.  You put in a 7 day timer for the service to pick up your contract and one expired already and two more are a few hours from it.  Too many people trying to ship stuff. I can always try again.  The stuff isn’t going anywhere.  It was suggested that we not ship stuff to Jita because too many of us are going that.  But I don’t need a half dozen Megathron hulls in UALX.  That doctrine isn’t coming back any time soon. Of course, some of the anxiety about this is built upon my early experiences with null sec move ops, where I quickly learned I needed to be in the first move op or I was on my own.  The coalition is a lot better about that now, but even as recently as the last GEF deployment, when I was away for a week I came back to find myself having to YOLO some ships back from hostile space as I had missed one stage of the move op. That means every time I miss a move op, I start wondering if that will be the last.  I moved my two Delve capitals forward, accrued a bunch of jump fatigue, then saw a ping to move expensive pods to the new staging and had to pass because my timers would have either held everybody up or found me left behind.  Will there be another such op?  I don’t know. I have two capitals moved from Delve to Querious and waiting to gate into catch to carry on, and one capital sitting in Catch, only now there is an incursion in the middle of the route which shuts down all cyno traffic… I can’t even get on the trail of tears.  It has been delayed until that has been taken care of. So it goes.  It is hard to sit on my hands and wait.",

inspiration for.  This was all part of me learning that region-wide buy orders are a bad idea.  The light missiles for 5 ISK each all went pretty fast… I think I had 1 ISK buy orders in mission hubs back in the day… which makes me wonder how expensive light missiles are these days.  5 ISK used to feel a bit greedy.  I don’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFrustrations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest problem for me is that I am split between not knowing how I am going to move the stuff I have and being impatient to get going.  I just want to start getting stuff to the new place, but all the move ops this past week have been focused on getting things to 1DQ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, all the

hell with Marie Kondo, this all manages to bring my joy and anxiety at the same time!  I have this same problem when I try to clear out my bookshelf or closet.  I become hung up in the history of the things there rather than any current or future utility or value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, I clearly don’t lose enough ships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs noted above I concluded pretty quickly that I was going to need to just repackage a bunch of this ships and just buy new rigs at the far end, so I started trying to use our shipping services… however they are slammed with requests so that three out of the four contracts look like they will expire unfulfilled.  You put in a 7 day timer for the service to pick up your contract and one expired already and two more are a few hours from it.  Too many people trying to ship stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can always try again.  The stuff isn’t going anywhere.  It was suggested that we not ship stuff to Jita because too many of us are going that.  But I don’t need a half dozen Megathron hulls in UALX.  That doctrine isn’t coming back any time soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, some of the anxiety about this is built upon my early experiences with null sec move ops, where I quickly learned I needed to be in the first move op or I was on my own.  The coalition is a lot better about that now, but even as recently as the last GEF deployment, when I was away for a week I came back to find myself having to YOLO some ships back from hostile space as I had missed one stage of the move op.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat means every time I miss a move op, I start wondering if that will be the last.  I moved my two Delve capitals forward, accrued a bunch of jump fatigue, then saw a ping to move expensive pods to the new staging and had to pass because my timers would have either held everybody up or found me left behind.  Will there be another such op?  I don’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have two capitals moved from Delve to Querious and waiting to gate into catch to carry on, and one capital sitting in Catch, only now there is an incursion in the middle of the route which shuts down all cyno traffic… I can’t even get on the trail of tears.  It has been delayed until that has been taken care of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it goes.  It is hard to sit on my hands and wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
