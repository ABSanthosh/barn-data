  "text": "Image credit: Bethesda Careful, Doom fans - details of Doom: The Dark Ages have leaked ahead of its release next week. As posted to the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit, some players have received their discs ahead of the 15th May street date, which means details are popping up all over the place now, including information about the plot, menus, combat, weapons, beastiary, and more. Introducing the DOOM: The Dark Ages Limited Edition Collection Here's a trailer showing off Xbox's Doom: The Dark Ages accessories.Watch on YouTube \"Hey dudes, I got lucky and got the [Collector's Edition on] the 8th and just finished this amazing game, what a trip. This will have spoilers, so it's up to you if you want to get spoiled,\" one player wrote, before individually linking dozens and dozens of screenshots with spoilers a-plenty. The early shipping has also identified something else, too; it seems as though even with a physical disc, PS5 players have to be connected to the internet and download the entire game to their consoles before they can play. As reportedly verified by ppe.pl, \"the disc for Doom: The Dark Ages contains nothing but the data necessary to trigger a download of the game from the internet. This means PS5 owners hoping to step into the Doom Slayer’s boots should be prepared to download over 80 GB - the full size of the game.\" \"Literal waste of materials,\" responded one commenter. \"This is just profoundly stupid.\" In Eurogamer's Doom: the Dark Ages review, Chris D. awarded it four stars out of five, writing: \"It's all so simple, so joyously, generously straight ahead. You're a powerful goody, you're surrounded by powerful baddies, and you have to finish them all off. Everyone knows where they stand, and they all seem pretty happy with the roles they're playing. And it's kind of lovely.\"",
