As a bonus, you also get a one month free trial to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The ROG Ally is still one of the best Windows-based gaming handhelds currently available, perhaps only surpassed by other recently released models that will run you at least $300 more.Asus ROG Ally Z1 Extreme Gaming Handheld for $499.99Asus ROG Ally AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme Gaming HandheldIncludes 1 month of Xbox Game Pass UltimateThe Asus ROG Ally Z1 Extreme is a Windows 11 based gaming handheld PC. This is the higher end of the two Asus ROG Ally models with an AMD Zen 4 based Z1 Extreme CPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. It boasts a 7\" screen size with a sharp 1080p resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. Whereas its main competitor, the Steam Deck, runs off a Linux-based Steam OS, the ROG Ally runs off Windows 11. The Steam OS is considered easier to use, but Windows 11 offers you finer control, and it's easier to install other game clients outside of the Steam ecosystem.In our Asus ROG Ally review, Robert Anderson wrote that \"the Asus ROG Ally truly feels like the portable Xbox Game Pass machine that many fans have been clamoring for. While a frustrating user experience, poor battery life, and a lack of Steam Deck-style touchpads do hold it back a bit, it’s undeniable how much fun this handheld is to use when it really gets ticking. With a beautiful 1080p screen that’s marvelously bright and perfect for playing on the go in any condition, alongside its powerful set of specs and a fierce price tag, it might actually be the Steam Deck competitor we’ve been anticipating.\"If you want a better handheld gaming PC, you'll have to pay more... a lot moreThere are a few new gaming handheld PCs that have been released that are superior alternatives to the Asus ROG Ally. One model is Asus' own ROG Ally X. It runs off the same Ryzen Z1 Extreme APU, but benefits from a much larger battery, more RAM, more built-in storage capacity, and two USB Type-C ports instead of one. However, it costs $800 at Best Buy, $300 more than the ROG Ally, and probably not worth the price premium.Another even newer 2025 release that we highly recommend is the Lenovo Legion Go S Steam Edition gaming handheld. Like the ROG Ally X, it's equipped with the same Ryzen Z1 Extreme APU but benefits from double the RAM and storage. It also has a larger 9\" display and is the first Steam-based gaming handheld outside of the Steam Deck. Feature-wise it's better than the aging Steam Deck, at least until Valve releases a newer, updated model. Unfortunately, it currently costs $830 at Best Buy, which means you'll need to spend another $330 choosing this over the ROG Ally.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
