  "description": "Call of Duty's Season 2 update arrives in Black Ops 6 and Warzone on January 28, and the patch notes reveal several improvements to the game. This includes a positive update for applying unlocked camos and weapon adjustments. Additionally, there are some movement changes included in the update that are specific to Warzone.Season 2 includes more multiplayer maps, another Zombies map, new weapons to unlock, and a battle pass packed with over 100 items to earn.All the major highlights of the Season 2 battle pass can be found here, which adds ninja-like operators, plenty of high-end weapon blueprints, new sprays, and other cosmetic items. All of the season's new multiplayer maps can be viewed here. Weapon changesSeason 2 makes a few major weapon changes. This includes reducing weapon motion from the Dexterity perk, which is improved from 60% to 70%. The game's weapon raise animations that play on respawn are now fully interruptible.Additionally, the update reduces bullet penetration on all surface types. The developer explains this by saying, \"We have continued to see cases where bullets are passing through too much cover. Our first step in addressing this is to decrease the maximum depth that bullets can pass through for all materials. We have longer-term plans to make bullet penetration more intuitive and consistent, and will be introducing further improvements in future updates.\" Magazine attachment changesThe update includes a change that speeds up reload times with the Fast Mag attachments. This includes the following:Fast Mag I, Fast Mag II, Fast Mag III, and Flip Mag reload times improved by 10% on all weapon classes but pistolsFast Mag I and Fast Mag II reload times improved by 5% on PistolsAll LMG magazines with 50 rounds or less have had reload times improved by 5%AS VAL default magazine reload time improved by 10%Addressed an issue with Swat 5.56 Fast Mag I, it will now improve reload times as intendedThe following magazine attachments have had their ammo add times updated to match the intended timings:C9 Extended Mag I: from 1.933s to 2.267sModel L Extended Mag II: from 2.133s to 2.433sGPMG-7 Extended Mag II: from 5.2s to 5.6sGPMG-7 Extended Mag III: from 5.7s to 6.07sGPMG-7 Extended Mag IV: from 6.13s to 6.47sSVD Extended Mag 2: from 2.63s to 3s Multiplayer weapon tuningA small amount of weapon tuning is also included with the update. This includes a buff for all Black Ops 6 shotguns, which improves ranges and sprint-to-fire speeds. Some of these changes are minor, with the Maelstrom shotgun getting the largest buff. The developer says, \"The Maelstrom has received some more pronounced changes, as it was lagging behind the Marine SP and ASG-89. It is now capable of a one-shot kill at very close proximity, and all its other ranges have received a larger boost than the other shotguns. We've also given it a small fire rate improvement to help its firepower without further changes to pellet damage.\"The PU-21 light machine gun also gets buffed to make it a faster option in the LMG class. The changes include improving the pre-fire delay from 55ms down to 20ms, increasing the sprint-to-fire speed from 245ms to 240ms, and increasing the tactical sprint-to-fire speed from 335ms to 330ms. Spawn adjustmentsTreyarch says the game's spawn logic has been adjusted to continue to reduce a player's proximity to enemies when respawning.Even more spawn changes could arrive after the launch of Season 2, as the developer says, \"We have also added the ability to conduct live A/B testing with spawn changes to evaluate on a smaller scale, and if results are positive, we will roll those changes out globally. This will allow us to be more agile with spawn changes.\" Changes to camos and camo challengesSeason 2 will allow players to equip any unlocked Special camos to a weapon as soon as they,ve unlocked any five Military camos for that weapon. Previously, players needed to unlock all nine Military camos for at least one mode to equip Special camos.Additionally, challenge progress bars now appear below Special and Mastery camo swatches on the Camo tab in the Gunsmith, making it easier for players to check their progress. Several Citadelle des Morts improvementsIn addition to The Tomb map, the Zombies update includes tons of improvements across all existing maps. The most notable changes are the major fixes for the Citadelle des Morts map. This includes bug fixes for several of the map's main story quest steps and issues related to Maya's Revenge Quest. Warzone gets small map changesAs previously announced, much of Warzone's update is geared toward making gameplay improvements, so some Season 2 content has been shifted to focus on game updates.Season 2 makes small updates for the Urzikstan map. This includes updated Buy Station locations and a refresh to the loot and equipment found in the Gulag.The map's train gets a change to the automatic brake release timer, which has increased from 60 to 240 seconds.For the Area 99 Resurgence map, two additional Buy Stations are added to give players more places to shop for gear. Changes to player and weapon XP for battle royale modesThe developer says player and weapon XP rates have been adjusted in Warzone to bring each mode closer in line with one another. The changes are as follows:Battle RoyalePlayer XP increased by +7%Weapon XP increased by +10%ResurgencePlayer XP decreased by -8%Weapon XP increased by +10%PlunderPlayer XP increased by +22%Weapon XP decreased by -13% Warzone movement changesOne movement change applies to jumping in Warzone. This increases both jump speed and successive jump height with one unmodified successive jump. The developer discusses this by saying, \"We're reverting some jump penalties to the values used last year. This marks the first step in our jump evaluation, and we'll revisit this topic again in the future.\"Another movement adjustment is made for the parachute, which the developer says aims to make the action \"more fluid and balanced, preventing it from feeling overly restrictive.\"This includes an increase to the speed of the parachute cut animation, making cutting a parachute and readying your weapon significantly faster. It also increases player velocity when landing from a cut parachute land, giving players a smoother transition into full sprint. Warzone perk adjustmentsWarzone's Tracker perk gets major adjustments. Tracker pings have been replaced with an outline that is not visible through walls but will still appear on targets through smoke. Additionally, Tracker can now mark up to five targets simultaneously, and engaging a sixth target will remove the outline from the first target.The Dexterity perk now has better handling, providing smoother weapon handling for jumping, sliding, and diving. It's also now a default perk for all Warzone players.Since Dextiery is no longer a perk players can equip to their custom loadout, the Mountaineerperk from last year's Warzone returns to take its place in the Slot 1 perk selection.With Mountaineer, fall damage reduction has been significantly improved, though the developer says it's not as powerful as the Modern Warfare 3 version.

GLOBALRICOCHET ANTI-CHEATAs previously discussed in our recent Community Update blog, we are ramping up our fight against cheaters across both Multiplayer and Warzone with new security measures deploying throughout the coming seasons. Updates include enhanced detection models for behaviors like aim botting, stricter account trust and hardware identification to target repeat offenders, and new tools to combat dishonest behavior such as playing with cheaters or attempting to spam report innocent players. We are also focusing on more precise tools, including major upgrades to the kernel-level anti-cheat driver and server-side systems starting this season and continuing into Season 03. These measures, combined with ongoing improvements and legal actions against cheat sellers, aim to deliver a more secure and enjoyable experience for everyone.For more information on Ricochet Anti-Cheat, check out our recent Community Update. BATTLE PASSThe Season 02 Battle Pass includes over 110 pieces of unlockable content (excluding BlackCell) including three new Base Weapons, an Underbarrel Crossbow Attachment, new Operator Skins and Weapon Blueprints, and a whole lot more. Read on for more BlackCell intel and stay tuned for a deeper dive with the BlackCell, Battle Pass and Store Bundles blog prior to Season 02 launch for a deep dive into the massive offering. PROGRESSION \u0026 PRESTIGEAddressed an issue that was causing the “Congratulations, you’ve Mastered Prestige” screen to appear after every match for some Prestige Master players.Addressed an issue that would occasionally occur after Quick-Resuming Black Ops 6 that would incorrectly display all other players as Level 1 with default customization.Players who’ve reached Max Level will now see a reminder that they have a Prestige available after each match.Players who’ve reached Max Level will now see a “Prestige Available” treatment on the Prestige Tile in the Barracks Progression menu.Prestige Master Ribbons will now display in the player details when inspecting a player from the Lobby.Players can now tab between individual Prestiges (L1/R1 on PlayStation, LB/RB on Xbox) when viewing an individual Prestige’s rewards via the Prestige screen.The player’s current Prestige Master Ribbon and Icon milestone will now be highlighted by default whenever they enter the Prestige Master screen. CHALLENGESChallenge Tracker \u0026 Near CompletionWe know our Challenge chasers have been asking for the ability to track Challenges, and we've been hard at work to add that functionality with Season 02. The Challenge Tracker makes it easy for players to manually track up to 10 Camo and 10 Calling Card Challenges they're actively working toward, but there's another element of this system that we think players will find useful on the journey to Dark Matter, Nebula, and 100 Percenter: Near Completion.Players who don't manually fill their Tracked Challenge lists will see Challenges auto-populate that they are close to completing, making it easy to discover Challenges you might not be aware of yet or give you a goal to go after in your next match.Your top Tracked or Near Complete Camo and Calling Card Challenge can be seen in the Lobby by cycling the Daily Challenge widget (via Right Thumbstick on console, or the \"R\" key on PC). From this view, players can enter each Challenge type's Tracked \u0026 Near Complete list to see the full list of Tracked \u0026 Near Complete Challenges.We’re hopeful the Challenge Tracker \u0026 Near Complete system will help shortcut players to their Challenges and make it easier to keep tabs on the Challenges you're pursuing, both in-and-out of game.Manually track up to 10 Camo and 10 Calling Card Challenges.Untracked Slots (out of the 10) will automatically display Camo and Calling Card Challenges closest to completion.The Top Tracked (or Near Complete) Camo and Calling Card Challenge can be seen in the Lobby by cycling the Daily Challenge display panel The Top Tracked (or Near Complete) Camo and Calling Card Challenge can also be seen in-game by bringing up the Options Menu and cycling the Daily Challenge display panel.When tracking a Camo, the Weapon's next Camo Challenge is automatically tracked and displayed. You do not need to re-track each individual Camo Challenge as you progress through Camos for a single Weapon.Access the \"Tracked \u0026 Near Complete\" list for Camos and Calling Cards from the Lobby panelThe Calling Card Challenges \"Tracked \u0026 Near Complete\" list can also be accessed via the Calling Card Challenge menu.Addressed an issue where XP would not be rewarded Armory Challenges before opening the Armory for the first time.This feature is planned to arrive in Warzone at a later date.Camos \u0026 Camo ChallengesPlayers can now equip any unlocked Special Camos to a Weapon as soon as they\"ve unlocked any 5 Military Camos for that weapon. Previously, players needed to unlock all 9 Military Camos for at least 1 mode to equip Special Camos.We’ve seen feedback from players about how the 250+ unique Special Camos in Black Ops 6 are underutilized because of the current equip requirement, and we feel the same way. Currently, we see a very limited window of time where Special Camos get equipped: after all of one mode's Military Camos have been unlocked, but before players have unlocked Gold Camo (or beyond).In Season 02, we’ll be changing this equip requirement to give players the ability to equip their unlocked Special Camos earlier in each Weapon's Camo journey, while still preserving a short \"on-ramp\" of first needing to unlock 5 Military Camos that we feel is important to the new Weapon journey. In MP, this means that Specials can now be accessed after 30 Headshots instead of 100, but getting to 5 Military Camos unlocked can also be done across all 3 modes if desired.Challenge progress bars now appear below Special Camo and Mastery Camo swatches on the Camo tab in the Gunsmith.The currently equipped Camo will now be highlighted by default when entering the Camo tab in the Gunsmith (if applicable). SOCIAL \u0026 CHANNELSAdded a \"Favorites Only”\"Filter to the Friends List that can be used to display only Favorite Friends.Player mic indicators will now appear when viewing the Party Channel or Game Channel.\"Sort by Progression\" and \"Sort by Rank\" will now display the applicable Level or Rank icons in the Friends List, regardless of which mode the player is viewing the Social menu from.Dark Ops Calling Cards that you haven’t unlocked yet yourself will no longer appear as \"Classified\" when viewed in another player's Calling Card Showcase. MULTIPLAYERWEAPONSAddressed an issue where Akimbo Attachments did not properly display Pros and Cons.Addressed an animation pop when using certain muzzle attachments with the GS45 Pistol. All WeaponsWe have a few global changes landing with the start of Season 02 that will affect all weapons. The first is an improvement to the weapon motion reduction on the Dexterity Perk, which will make weapons feel even more stable while jumping, sliding, and diving. The second is a response to feedback that the weapon animations on respawn can get in the way of combat. These animations are now immediately interruptible when firing, aiming down sights, sprinting, or performing other gameplay actions.Lastly, we are tuning down bullet penetration significantly, as we have continued to see cases where bullets are passing through too much cover. Our first step in addressing this is to decrease the maximum depth that bullets can pass through for all materials. We have longer-term plans to make bullet penetration more intuitive and consistent, and will be introducing further improvements in future updates.Weapon motion reduction from the Dexterity perk improved from 60% to 70%.Weapon raise animations that play on respawn are now fully interruptible.Reduced bullet penetration on all surface types.Magazine Attachment ChangesAnother large-scale change we are making is speeding up Fast Mag reload times. Our goal is for every magazine attachment to have a role across the many playstyles in Call of Duty, but we recognize that it can feel hard to trade away the larger mag sizes. We want to avoid adding more penalties to Extended Mags, so we are instead focusing on improvements to Fast Mags to make the selection more enticing. We're starting with reload time adjustments, but we'll continue to assess magazines to make sure players have more interesting choices and build potential with this node.Fast Mag I, Fast Mag II, Fast Mag III, and Flip Mag reload times improved by 10% on all weapon classes but pistols.Fast Mag I and Fast Mag II reload times improved by 5% on Pistols.All LMG magazines with 50 rounds or less have had reload times improved by 5%.AS VAL default magazine reload time improved by 10%.Addressed an issue with Swat 5.56 Fast Mag I, it will now improve reload times as intended.The following magazine attachments have had their ammo add times updated to match the intended timings. The overall reload times and interrupt times remain the same.C9 Extended Mag I: from 1.933s to 2.267s.Model L Extended Mag II: from 2.133s to 2.433s.GPMG-7 Extended Mag II: from 5.2s to 5.6s.GPMG-7 Extended Mag III: from 5.7s to 6.07s.GPMG-7 Extended Mag IV: from 6.13s to 6.47s.SVD Extended Mag 2: from 2.63s to 3s.MeleeRemoved screen flash from taking frontal bullet damage while holding a melee.Assault RiflesGoblin Mk2The Goblin Mk2 may be the most divisive weapon out there in the community. Some players absolutely love it, and a lot of players… strongly prefer other weapons. We’re making a number of small improvements to help overall usability and consistency without affecting the weapon's identity. In particular, the maximum damage range increase will help with mid-range engagements, and we're giving it a bit more inflicted flinch than the average Assault Rifle to reward players who land that first hit.SMGsKompakt 92Our design intent for the 3-Round Burst Mod on the Kompakt 92 is to give the weapon an alternate playstyle that trades some raw upfront power for more consistent mid-range performance. The upside wasn't as strong as we wanted it to be, so we've adjusted the range slightly and made some significant recoil reductions.ShotgunsWith this update, we are improving ranges and Sprint to Fire speeds on all Shotguns. We know that some of these adjustments may look inconsequential, but Shotgun balance in particular tends to live on a knife’s edge. We want Shotguns to play a greater role outside of our very smallest maps, and we’ll keep adjusting until we’re happy with their usage.The Maelstrom has received some more pronounced changes, as it was lagging behind the Marine SP and ASG-89. It is now capable of a one-shot kill at very close proximity, and all its other ranges have received a larger boost than the other Shotguns. We've also given it a small Fire Rate improvement to help its firepower without further changes to pellet damage.MGsPU-21The PU-21 is intended to be a more lightweight LMG with build opportunities skewing towards Assault Rifle handling and mobility. We are reducing the pre-fire delay by a little more than half to help fit the more aggressive playstyle, and are reducing deviation in its recoil to help with consistency in gunfights.AdjustmentsPre-fire delay improved from 55ms to 20ms.Sprint to Fire Speed improved from 245ms to 240ms.Tactical Sprint to Fire Speed improved from 335ms to 330ms.View Kick Deviation slightly reduced.Marksman RiflesDM-10The Gain-Twist Barrel improvement to Bullet Velocity was unintentionally low on the DM-10. There will now be an advantage to using it over the Reinforced Barrel.Sniper RiflesWe saw a lot of positivity surrounding the AMR Mod 4 when it launched in Season 01, in no small part due to the consistency it has with its hit location multipliers. With Season 02 we are increasing the one-shot hit locations on the launch snipers, with the goal of giving all of them a similar feeling of consistency and opening the doors to more weapon variety.We are also making some small reductions to the Aim Down Sight speed bonuses on Quickdraw Grips. There were a couple considerations that went into this change. The first was the general power level of snipers, as the body multiplier changes are a big buff. Another consideration was our Fast Mag buffs, which we hope will enable players to comfortably take builds that stack multiple sources of ADS speed improvements.PistolsStryder .22The Stryder .22 launched with a smaller Bullet Penetration profile than the other pistols. The distinction is hard to read as a player and offers little to weapon identity, so we’re bringing it up to parity with the rest of the class.Special WeaponsSirin 9mmWe’ve addressed an issue causing unintended Sprint to Fire modifications with the magazine attachments on the Sirin 9mm. We have updated the attributes on these magazines so that they’re in line with the tradeoffs that appear on other weapons.LaunchersLast but not least, launchers are receiving some major handling improvements to help with general usability and responsiveness.HUDAddressed an issue that would occasionally incorrectly display the Field Upgrade “READY” state after respawning.Addressed an issue where player names would not display beside the speaker icon when speaking in a match.HUD Presets can now be set separately for Zombies and Multiplayer.PROGRESSION \u0026 XPSearch \u0026 DestroyAddressed an issue that was preventing the end-of-game Match Bonus XP payout from being awarded in the following situations: The entire enemy team quit, ending the matchThe player did not deal any damage in the final RoundCHALLENGESBlack Ops 6 launched with more Calling Card Challenges than any recent Call of Duty, brought the return of \"100 Percenter\" Cards for Multiplayer and Zombies, and brought a deep Calling Card grind to Warzone with its own “100 Percenter” Card for the first time. It has been very exciting to see players strategizing over and unlocking all the various Calling Card Challenges in the game since launch.Some Multiplayer Challenges, however, have been either a bit on the frustrating side, or have had bugs and other issues that have prevented some players from completing them on the path to \"100 Percenter\".For Season 02, we’ve put a big focus on fixing these Challenge bugs and smoothing over the key frustration points players have been experiencing as part of the Multiplayer Calling Card Challenge grind since launch. We hope these fixes and updates help players stuck in their Challenge journey and unblock their progress toward 100% completion.Scorestreak Destruction ChallengesAddressed an issue that was not awarding Challenge progress towards Scorestreak Destructions in cases where players didn’t perform the final blow on the destroyed enemy Scorestreak.Players will now earn progress for Camo Challenges that require destroying Scorestreaks even if they do not deal the destroying final blow. This impacts the following content: Camo Challenges for the CIGMA 2B and HE-1Mastery Badges for the CIGMA 2B and HE-1“Hot Lead”, “Air Control,” and “Field Work” Calling Card ChallengesWe made this adjustment to ensure that Challenge progress for destroying Scorestreaks is made whenever you earn Scorestreak Destruction Medals like \"Flyswatter\" and \"Downed,\" and to make challenges that involve destroying Scorestreaks much more consistent. This should make the grind for Diamond Launchers smoother and less random or frustrating for players.Calling Card Challenges“Redemption Arc” Going Ham Challenge: Removed the time requirement of needing to get a kill shortly after being revived. Players can now make progress by earning a Kill anytime after they revive themselves with the Morphine Injector.“Tick Tock Boom” Humiliation Challenge: Semtex sticks that do not result in a kill for the sticking player will now also progress the Challenge.“On Point” Prestige 1 Challenge: The Challenge now uses the same Dive detection as the “Dive Shot” Medal, allowing for a grace period shortly after landing from a Dive where the Challenge can still be progressed.“Squint Test” Prestige 1 Challenge: Moonshot requirement reduced from 100m to 75m to make completing this Challenge possible on more maps.“Explosive Plays” Prestige 4 Challenge: Addressed a bug that was displaying the wrong Calling Card name.“Hot Dawg” Prestige 4 Challenge: Reduced the Molotov or Thermo Grenade Kills without dying requirement from 4 to 3.“Headhunter” Prestige 5 Challenge: Addressed a typo in the Challenge description that specified the incorrect Barrel needed to progress the Challenge.

With Season 02, we wanted to remove or update some of the more frustrating Dailies to ensure that players are always receiving Challenges that are approachable and straightforward. Our goal with Daily Challenges is to encourage players to try out various items and strategies, without making them too restrictive or frustrating for players to complete in a single session. Addressed an issue that was preventing the following Daily Challenges from tracking properly: Get 50 Eliminations with a Suppressed Weapon.Get 50 Eliminations using a Weapon with 5 or more Attachments.The “Get Eliminations with Secondary Weapons” Daily Challenge will now track Eliminations earned with the Sirin 9mm Special Weapon.Mastery BadgesTactical Insertion: Addressed an issue that was causing the Tactical Insertion Mastery Badge from only progressing via Revenge Kills. It will now progress when any enemy is Killed by the player shortly after they’ve respawned via a Tactical Insertion.The Mastery Badge for the used Weapon, Scorestreak, Field Upgrade, or Equipment will now appear correctly in Killcam and Best Plays.SpawnsSpawn logic has been adjusted to continue our efforts to reduce proximity to enemies when respawning.We have also added the ability to conduct live A/B testing with spawn changes to evaluate on a smaller scale, and if results are positive, we will roll those changes out globally. This will allow us to be more agile with spawn changes.ModesOverdrive (LTM)Rack up stars to unlock special Operator abilities that will greatly aid you in battle and keep that streak going to reach Overdrive! If you get eliminated, or the elimination timer runs out before you take out another target, you’ll start the process over again. Operators “attempting Overdrive” can expect the following improved capabilities: 1 Star: Awakened Senses: See enemies through walls and replenish your health after eliminating a target.3 Stars: Physical Enhancements: Increased movement and reloading speed.6 Stars: Augmented Handling: Improved hip-fire accuracy and improved sprint-to-fire and ADS speeds.Earn all three buffs to activate Overdrive! This allows you to earn double the stars when eliminating enemies.Search and DestroyAddressed an issue where XP could not be rewarded if no damage was dealt in the final round.Kill OrderAddressed an issue where the HVT icon would follow a Dreadnought called in by an active HVT.Free For AllAddressed an issue where final placements were being incorrectly calculated.Addressed an issue where the Winner’s Circle would not consistently display the Top 3 players.Kill ConfirmedReduced the height of dog tags that are dropped in Kill Confirmed to improve player visibility.ControlB zone has been moved to where Hardpoint P2 is located. After consideration, we have found this to be a more competitive location for engagements with both Attackers and Defenders.Equipment, Perks, Field Upgrades, and WildcardsAddressed an issue where Lethal and Tactical Equipment inventory was reduced when using Danger Close or Tactical Expert Wildcards and resupplying with the Scavenger Perk.Reduced additional Smoke Grenade given to +1 from +2 with the Tactical Expert Wildcard. (Yes, we’re annoyed by the smoke too, and will continue to evaluate.)Addressed an issue where Field Upgrades could not be deployed in certain scenarios while using the Prepper Wildcard.Addressed an issue where Gearhead Perk would not decrease the time to earn Field Upgrades.Decreased the amount of weapon motion when jumping, sliding, and diving with the Dexterity Perk.Addressed an issue where the Ninja Perk could lose functionality between respawns and round transitions, resulting in footsteps not being quieter.Addressed an issue where the Ninja Perk was not being applied to enemy players when spectating a teammate.Headshots will no longer skip Last Stand when using the Morphine Injector Field Upgrade.ScorestreaksAddressed an issue where Care Packages could be captured by teammates at the same capture rate as the owner.Addressed an issue where the SAM Turret could target enemy Scorestreaks that were leaving the airspace.Addressed an issue where the SAM Turret’s targeting laser would not be visible when tracking a target.MedalsAdjusted the “Dive Shot” Medal (Kill an enemy while or shortly after diving in any direction) to be more forgiving so that Kills earned just after diving will award the Medal more consistently.Tuned the “Snaked” Medal (2 rapid weapon kills against enemies in different directions while on your stomach, back or side) to be more forgiving and be awarded in more situations that match the intent of the Medal.GeneralDetailed Weapon Stats Improvements: Added new stats \u0026 refactored the layout to be data-driven.Addressed an issue in Theater where thrown projectiles could not be seen.Addressed an issue where vehicles could visually disappear for some players during gameplay.Training Course entry point has been moved from the playlist selection to the top right navigation panel.MovementWe are continuing to monitor Omnimovement feedback, and of course playing the game ourselves. We are currently testing slight reductions to initial slide speed and duration to improve predictability of engagements when opponents enter with a slide.Additionally, we are always evaluating areas for improved fluidity, whether those are specific to movement mechanics or other mechanics like the ability to interrupt weapon raises during respawns that we highlighted above.Reduced collision with teammates. This should improve the ability to maneuver around tight spaces like doorways with nearby teammates.RANKED PLAYCross-PlayThe following changes are being implemented at the launch of Season 02 to provide players on console with the option to select the platform pool(s) they wish to matchmake with:PlayStation – In-Game OptionsRanked:On: Enables matchmaking with all gaming platforms when playing in Ranked playlists.On (Consoles Only): Enables matchmaking only with other consoles when playing in Ranked playlists.

This one week evaluation period will give players a chance to experiment with the weapons in a competitive environment, provide feedback, and help Treyarch and the CDL determine whether they should remain unrestricted in CDL and Ranked Play.To stay up to date on the latest Ranked Play restrictions and settings, stay tuned to @Treyarch and @CODUpdates for the latest details, and bookmark our Patch Notes pages.Season 02 Rank SetbackCompetitors who are continuing their conquest in Ranked Play from Season 01 will notice that their accounts may have been set back as outlined in previous notes. Every new Season, your Rank may be rolled back based on where you ended the previous season, as follows: Bronze or Silver Rank players are not impacted by the Seasonal setback and will be able to pick up where they ended Season 01 with no SR deduction.Gold or Platinum Rank players will start Season 02in Tier I of Gold or Platinum respectively.Diamond Rank and above players will start the Season 02 at Diamond I.Demotion ProtectionDemotion Protection will be active for everyone’s first 3 Ranked Play losses in Season 02, and players can expect 1 free loss per day via Daily Loss Forgiveness like in Season 01.Ranked Play Season 02 RewardsRank Camos: Each Rank Gold and above has a unique animated Camo you can earn to show off your rank: Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Crimson \u0026 Iridescent: Start in (or above) or reach the applicable Rank anytime in Season 02 to earn.Top 250: Finish Season 02 in the Top 250.Rank Calling Cards: Each Rank Silver and above has a unique Calling Card reward: Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Crimson, Iridescent (Animated): Start in (or above) or reach the applicable Rank anytime in Season 02 to earn.Top 250 (Animated): Finish Season 02 in the Top 250.Top 250 Champion (Animated): One-of-a-kind Calling Card awarded to the single player who finishes Season 02 in the #1 position on the Top 250.Pro Issue Jackal PDW Blueprint: Unlocked by winning 10 Ranked Play matches in Season 02 Muzzle: CompensatorBarrel: Long BarrelUnderbarrel: Ranger ForegripRear Grip: Ergonomic GripStock: Balanced Stock100 Season 02 Wins Decal: Unlocked by winning 100 Ranked Play matches in Season 02. Veto VoteThe Veto Vote before Ranked Play matches will now occasionally present a choice between the 3 Ranked Play modes (Hardpoint, Control \u0026 Search and Destroy) on the same map.This new addition to the Ranked Play Veto Vote gives players the occasional choice over which Ranked Play mode they want to avoid in their next match, while ensuring that all the maps in the CDL map rotation get playtime in Ranked. We look forward to seeing how players react and vote when this Veto type occasionally appears before Ranked matches. Please let us know what you think. SR Gain \u0026 Loss AdjustmentsPlayers will notice that their personal match performance has a bigger impact on their SR gained or lost after Ranked Play matches in Season 02, especially for the lower Ranks. This should help players early in their Ranked Play Rank journey more consistently earn bigger SR payouts when they perform well, and reduce SR losses incurred after a strong personal performance in a losing effort. While this tuning will impact all Ranks, team performance and the margin of victory are still the primary consideration for SR gains and losses in Ranks Crimson and above.

PLAYLISTFor information about upcoming Playlists, please check out the dedicated Warzone Trello Board. RANKED PLAYFor the second season of Warzone Ranked Play, we’re deploying adjustments to restrictions, SR gains, and deployment fees. Notably, the Tracker perk, which now outlines enemies in line-of-sight without live pings, has been removed from the list of restrictions. New SR adjustments aim to streamline progression, helping players quickly align with skill-appropriate divisions while addressing barriers when bridging the gap between key ranks. Placement and elimination rewards have been fine-tuned to encourage competition and skill diversity in higher ranks, while also ensuring players in top tiers like Crimson and Iridescent face greater challenges to maintain their status. In addition, deployment fees have been rebalanced to ease progression in lower ranks and increase the prestige of reaching top tiers. See the full details below: Cross-PlayThe following changes are being implemented at the launch of Season 02 to provide players on console with the option to select the platform pool(s) they wish to matchmake with: » PlayStation – In-Game Options «On: Enables matchmaking with all gaming platforms when playing in Ranked playlists.On (Consoles Only): Enables matchmaking only with other consoles when playing in Ranked playlists. May negatively impact matchmaking queue times.Off: Restricts Ranked matchmaking to your current gaming platform only. Will negatively impact matchmaking queue times. » Xbox – In-Game Options «On: Enables matchmaking with all gaming platforms when playing in Ranked playlists.On (Consoles Only): Enables matchmaking only with other consoles when playing in Ranked playlists. May negatively impact matchmaking queue times.Off: Restricts Ranked matchmaking to your current gaming platform only. Will negatively impact matchmaking queue times. RestrictionsTracker perk has been removed from the restricted items list in WZ Ranked Play.The Tracker perk no longer live pings players and instead applies an outline to enemy players that is not visible through walls. In addition, fixes to Cold Blooded now allow the footsteps to be appropriately countered. Skill RatingRanked SR adjustments are a challenging task. Everything has a cascading effect, especially when modeling consequences across different types of match outcomes. Our approach to these adjustments aims to achieve several key objectives:One major objective is to onboard more players into the early ranks and help them progress toward divisions that better represent their skill sets more quickly. We aim to adjust the rewards for SR in a way that allows players performing above their skill division to accelerate into higher divisions and remain there, where their skill matches the other players. This should, ideally, lead to greater player and skill diversity in the mid and higher divisions.There is also a very clear set of plateaus or walls that players encounter in the ranges of Silver III through Gold I and Platinum III through Diamond I. There are several reasons for this, but we aim to address these issues in a few critical ways. By adjusting the \"team remaining\" rewards to smooth out the curve, we hope players on the upper borders of these skill bands will be nudged more frequently into higher divisions. This will provide them with opportunities to play with and against stronger players, helping to improve their skills rather than leaving them in a division where they feel their abilities are underrepresented.Additionally, these changes are designed to ensure that players without access to the upper bands of division delta bonuses for eliminations (e.g., players in Crimson and Iridescent) cannot easily maintain their positions just because the delta rewards for +1/+2/+3 have increased. These players will still need to work hard to remain in these divisions, and the influx of new players into higher divisions should foster more competition and diversity in gameplay. Deployment FeesThe adjustments to deployment fees align with the overall goals of Ranked Play. We aim to make accessing certain divisions less frustrating by reducing barriers and smoothing out the progression experience. Reaching the Iridescent rank will become slightly more challenging (partially offset by the SR changes for the +0 delta and teams-remaining rewards) due to increased deployment fees, requiring more effort from players to maintain their position in this elite rank. For reference, less than 0.1% of players achieve Iridescent or Crimson status.Fee reductions at lower division levels encourage players to re-enter and play more frequently, ensuring a smoother and more enjoyable progression experience. However, once players reach Iridescent—especially those competing for a spot in the top 250—we want to ensure that achieving and maintaining this level truly reflects exceptional skill and is something players can proudly showcase. RewardsCompete in a second season of Battle Royale Ranked Play, earning the following seasonal rewards as you progress:First Season Win: Elimination CharmGet 25 Eliminations: Elimination StickerGet 100 Eliminations: Elimination Weapon CamoGet 250 Eliminations: Elimination Weapon BlueprintSilver: “Ranked Season 02 – “Silver” EmblemGold: “Ranked Season 02 – “Gold” Calling Card, Emblem, and Weapon CamoPlatinum: “Ranked Season 02 – Platinum” Calling Card Emblem, and Weapon CamoDiamond: “Ranked Season 02 – Diamond” Calling Card Emblem, and Weapon CamoCrimson: “Ranked Season 02 – Crimson” Calling Card Emblem, and Weapon CamoIridescent: “Ranked Season 02 – Iridescent” Calling Card Emblem, and Weapon CamoTop 250: “Ranked Season 02 – Top 250” Calling Card Emblem, and Weapon CamoGENERALBuy StationsAll Buy Stations, including deployable and standard ones, now close at the beginning of the \"Final Circle\" announcement.Deployable BoxesUtility boxes, such as munition boxes, armor boxes, and others, can no longer be placed in the gas.We’ve noticed an increase in buy backs during the final circle, sometimes even after the gas has completely consumed the map. While we appreciate resourceful plays, the tactic of a team camping a Buy Station to secure a win doesn’t align with our vision for “last team standing wins”. To address this, we’re making changes to encourage more meaningful and intense engagements in the final moments – the way we believe most matches are meant to end.We remain committed to identifying and addressing other “cheese” strategies in the game. Regardless of how long a mechanic has been around, we’re dedicated to refining systems to enhance the game’s competitive integrity.Score Events Added a new \"Splat\" score event in Battle Royale, which triggers when a player is eliminated while parachuting or skydiving.Experience BalanceBattle Royale Player XP increased by +7%.Weapon XP increased by +10%.Resurgence Player XP decreased by -8%.Weapon XP increased by +10%.Plunder Player XP increased by +22%.Weapon XP decreased by -13%.Player and Weapon XP rates have been adjusted in Warzone to bring each mode closer in line with one another.Quality of Life HighlightsAdvanced UAVAdvanced UAVs now display elevation arrows to indicate player altitude.Warzone BarracksThe button layout in the Warzone Barracks has been reorganized to match the structure used in Multiplayer and Zombies.Ammo CachesAmmo Cache Depots now function like Munition Boxes, dropping additional ammo and equipment on the ground.Pinging Buyback FlaresPlayers can now ping the flares from buybacks to better alert their teammates.Match Stat TrackerThe font used in the match stat tracker has been adjusted for improved readability, especially at lower resolutions.Detailed Weapon StatsNew stats have been added, and the layout has been redesigned to prioritize data clarity and accessibility.Some stats adjusted by the attachments were not represented. The new stats better reflect reality.Fade DistanceThe fade distance for loadout and cash drop crates while parachuting has been reduced to 300 meters for improved visibility.COMBATBody ShieldVictims are no longer automatically released mid-air.The outline of the victim, previously visible through walls, has been disabled.Players can no longer release a victim without executing them first.The body shield was incorrectly releasing your victim when attempting to take someone with you to a plummeting death, resulting in your own death but not your victim's.Additionally, we are removing the griefing mechanic of repeatedly releasing, downing, and releasing the same target. Going forward, if you choose to body shield a player, it must now culminate in an execution.MOVEMENTJumpingIncreased both jump speed and successive jump height with one unmodified successive jump.We’re reverting some jump penalties to the values used last year. This marks the first step in our jump evaluation, and we’ll revisit this topic again in the future.ParachuteIncreased the speed of the parachute cut animation, making cutting a parachute and readying your weapon significantly faster.Increased player velocity when landing from a cut parachute land, for smoother transition into full sprint.The recovery time after landing from a parachute has often felt overly punishing, both for players trying to evade and those looking to engage. This adjustment aims to make the action more fluid and balanced, preventing it from feeling overly restrictive.PERKSNewReactive Armor Perk Slot 2• Your armor will regenerate up to 50% if you have not taken damage in the last 5 seconds.• Available via Event RewardAdjustmentsTrackerPings have been replaced with an outline that is not visible through walls but will still appear on targets through smoke.Tracker can now mark up to five targets simultaneously. Engaging a sixth target will remove the outline from the first target.Tracker, Spy Camera, and Proxy Alarm have been adjusted to balance their usage. These changes address the over-reliance on intel systems that provide vision through walls. By scaling this back, we aim to align these mechanics with systems like UAVs while offering additional visual feedback. Our goal is to make highlight interactions more consistent, grounded, and balanced across engagements.DexterityThe weapon handling component of Dexterity has been enhanced and is now a default perk for all Warzone players.This will result in smoother weapon handling for jumping, sliding and diving as a default change to all players. MountaineerThis perk returns in Slot 1, replacing Dexterity. Fall damage reduction has been significantly improved compared to the current version with Dexterity, though it’s not as powerful as its iteration in Modern Warfare III.VeteranNow provides significant damage reduction against the effects of Gas Grenades. EQUIPMENTMunitions Satchel Now only provides 1 additional item, down from 2, to address overstocking and spamming equipment.Tacticals \u0026 LethalsMaximum deployed tacticals and lethals reduced to 2 each, down from 3, to make more purposeful trap plays.Impact GrenadeDefault stack size increased from 2 to 3.When equipped with a Munitions Satchel, the max stack size increases to 4.Impact Grenades occupy a unique niche between Semtex and Frag grenades. A direct hit significantly boosts its damage while also bypassing some of the mitigation provided by Bomb Squad, making it a more skill-based option. We’ve made the choice to retain its max stack size at 4, due to it underperforming quite significantly in metrics previously. Perhaps this makes it more IMPACTFUL. ThermobaricInner radius increased from 25 to 50.Inner damage increased from 190 to 220.Outer damage increased from 48 to 55.The Thermobaric grenade has been adjusted to improve its usability by increasing the inner radius, making it easier to deal higher damage. The slight damage boost complements this change.Frag GrenadeInner damage decreased from 250 to 240.Middle damage decreased from 170 to 120.Outer damage increased from 48 to 55.Frag grenades are a staple in combat, known for their reliability. Following adjustments in Black Ops 6, they’ve become easier to use. These changes aim to align their damage output with their ease of use, and we will continue to monitor their effectiveness.Experimental Gas GrenadeSlightly increased the trigger height of the gas effects to better match visuals.Movement reduction from gas decreased:Without resistance: from 60% to 50%.With resistance: from 60% to 25%.Gas damage against resistant targets reduced from 8 to 5.Gas grenade usage has increased, and these changes ensure proper counters are in place. The Veteran perk remains the best option to counter negative equipment effects. These adjustments aim to balance the grenade’s effectiveness while keeping counters viable.Stim ShotStrafe slide velocity with stim slightly reduced.The combination of stim and omni-directional slides exceeded normal velocity thresholds. This adjustment brings it back in line with regular gameplay metrics.Spy CameraUpdated the outline visual to no longer display through walls.Effect duration increased from 7 seconds to 10 seconds.Proxy AlarmUpdated the outline visual for better clarity. KILLSTREAKSAdvanced UAVAdvanced UAVs now display elevation arrows to indicate player altitude.Bunker BusterGas damage against targets with gas resistance has been reduced from 8 to 5. FIELD UPGRADESLoadout Drop MarkerThe bounce factor for Loadout Drop Markers has been reduced by 50%.It’s not uncommon to see Loadout Markers bouncing far from their intended drop location. By halving the bounce factor - which was previously comparable to that of a smoke grenade - we aim to maintain the grenade-like behavior while minimizing the frustrating, unintended movement. We’ll continue to monitor player feedback on this adjustment.Decontamination StationThe ability to re-enable closed Buy Stations by placing a Decontamination Station nearby has been removed. WEAPONSGeneralReload SpeedsReload speeds have been improved across all weapons, with increases ranging from 5% to 20%, depending on the weapon class. Modern Warfare 3Assault Rifles (ARs): 15% fasterMarksman Rifles (MRs): 5% fasterSubmachine Guns (SMGs): 10% fasterSniper Rifles: 12% fasterHandguns: 5% fasterBattle Rifles: 10% fasterModern Warfare 2Assault Rifles (ARs): 12% fasterMarksman Rifles (MRs): 10% fasterLight Machine Guns (LMGs): 15% fasterSubmachine Guns (SMGs): 22% fasterSniper Rifles: 15% fasterHandguns: 5% fasterBattle Rifles: 10% fasterBlack Ops 6Assault Rifles (ARs): 5% fasterMarksman Rifles (MRs): 5% fasterLight Machine Guns (LMGs): 10% fasterSubmachine Guns (SMGs): 10% fasterSniper Rifles: 10% fasterHandguns: 5% fasterReload speeds for Flip and Fast Mag attachments have been increased by an additional 5%.We have increased reload speeds to help make combat feel more fluid and decrease overall downtime. This should get it closer to previous iterations when using sleight of hand.Bullet PenetrationAdjusted bullet penetration across most materials resulting in a more consistent experience for thicker walls in particular.Weapon SwapIncreased swap speed by 10%, effectively replicating the effect of the Quick Grip Gloves Perk from Modern Warfare.Sprint-to-FireReduced sprint-to-fire penalty when jumping from 35% to 10%.Aim-Down-SightReduced the aim-down-sight (ADS) jump speed penalty by 25%.We want to allow different play styles and movement mechanics to feel viable and smooth to perform. We will continue to monitor how these are playing out and adjust accordingly.New WeaponsPPSh-41 Submachine GunFull-auto submachine gun. Fast fire rate with impressive damage and high recoil.

While we work on improving fire mode visibility, we’ve simplified the ground loot weapon pool to create a more predictable and consistent experience for all players.CONTRACTSIntelCompleting Intel contracts now has a very low chance to reward a Durable Gas Mask.Signal IntelligenceCash rewards for Signal Intelligence contracts, which were previously $7,500 per player, have been reduced based on squad size as follows: Solos: $7,500 per player ($7,500 total).Duos: $4,500 per player ($9,000 total).Trios: $3,500 per player ($10,500 total).Quads: $3,000 per player ($12,000 total).Signal Intelligence contracts were providing an excessive cash payout, especially for larger squad sizes. These adjustments, while significant, still offer high rewards compared to other contracts.Scavenger Distance between scavenger crates has been reduced, requiring less of a marathon between objectives.The majority of the time, objectives will prioritize remaining within the same point of interest. PUBLIC EVENTSRunaway TrainThis event now has a 10% chance to occur in the 5th circle of Battle Royale. CHALLENGESWarzone TacticianBunker Busters and Cluster Strikes no longer count toward progress for this challenge.DeadeyeThe requirement to ping an enemy before eliminating them has been removed for challenge progression.

Updates include enhanced detection models for behaviors like aim botting, stricter account trust and hardware identification to target repeat offenders, and new tools to combat dishonest behavior such as playing with cheaters or attempting to spam report innocent players. We are also focusing on more precise tools, including major upgrades to the kernel-level anti-cheat driver and server-side systems starting this season and continuing into Season 03. These measures, combined with ongoing improvements and legal actions against cheat sellers, aim to deliver a more secure and enjoyable experience for everyone.For more information on Ricochet Anti-Cheat, check out our recent Community Update.BATTLE PASSThe Season 02 Battle Pass includes over 110 pieces of unlockable content (excluding BlackCell) including three new Base Weapons, an Underbarrel Crossbow Attachment, new Operator Skins and Weapon Blueprints, and a whole lot more. Read on for more BlackCell intel and stay tuned for a deeper dive with the BlackCell, Battle Pass and Store Bundles blog prior to Season 02 launch for a deep dive into the massive offering.PROGRESSION \u0026 PRESTIGEAddressed an issue that was causing the “Congratulations, you’ve Mastered Prestige” screen to appear after every match for some Prestige Master players.Addressed an issue that would occasionally occur after Quick-Resuming Black Ops 6 that would incorrectly display all other players as Level 1 with default customization.Players who’ve reached Max Level will now see a reminder that they have a Prestige available after each match.Players who’ve reached Max Level will now see a “Prestige Available” treatment on the Prestige Tile in the Barracks Progression menu.Prestige Master Ribbons will now display in the player details when inspecting a player from the Lobby.Players can now tab between individual Prestiges (L1/R1 on PlayStation, LB/RB on Xbox) when viewing an individual Prestige’s rewards via the Prestige screen.The player’s current Prestige Master Ribbon and Icon milestone will now be highlighted by default whenever they enter the Prestige Master screen.CHALLENGESChallenge Tracker \u0026 Near CompletionWe know our Challenge chasers have been asking for the ability to track Challenges, and we've been hard at work to add that functionality with Season 02. The Challenge Tracker makes it easy for players to manually track up to 10 Camo and 10 Calling Card Challenges they're actively working toward, but there's another element of this system that we think players will find useful on the journey to Dark Matter, Nebula, and 100 Percenter: Near Completion.Players who don't manually fill their Tracked Challenge lists will see Challenges auto-populate that they are close to completing, making it easy to discover Challenges you might not be aware of yet or give you a goal to go after in your next match.Your top Tracked or Near Complete Camo and Calling Card Challenge can be seen in the Lobby by cycling the Daily Challenge widget (via Right Thumbstick on console, or the \"R\" key on PC). From this view, players can enter each Challenge type's Tracked \u0026 Near Complete list to see the full list of Tracked \u0026 Near Complete Challenges.We’re hopeful the Challenge Tracker \u0026 Near Complete system will help shortcut players to their Challenges and make it easier to keep tabs on the Challenges you're pursuing, both in-and-out of game.Manually track up to 10 Camo and 10 Calling Card Challenges.Untracked Slots (out of the 10) will automatically display Camo and Calling Card Challenges closest to completion.The Top Tracked (or Near Complete) Camo and Calling Card Challenge can be seen in the Lobby by cycling the Daily Challenge display panel The Top Tracked (or Near Complete) Camo and Calling Card Challenge can also be seen in-game by bringing up the Options Menu and cycling the Daily Challenge display panel.When tracking a Camo, the Weapon's next Camo Challenge is automatically tracked and displayed. You do not need to re-track each individual Camo Challenge as you progress through Camos for a single Weapon.Access the \"Tracked \u0026 Near Complete\" list for Camos and Calling Cards from the Lobby panelThe Calling Card Challenges \"Tracked \u0026 Near Complete\" list can also be accessed via the Calling Card Challenge menu.Addressed an issue where XP would not be rewarded Armory Challenges before opening the Armory for the first time.This feature is planned to arrive in Warzone at a later date.Camos \u0026 Camo ChallengesPlayers can now equip any unlocked Special Camos to a Weapon as soon as they\"ve unlocked any 5 Military Camos for that weapon. Previously, players needed to unlock all 9 Military Camos for at least 1 mode to equip Special Camos.We’ve seen feedback from players about how the 250+ unique Special Camos in Black Ops 6 are underutilized because of the current equip requirement, and we feel the same way. Currently, we see a very limited window of time where Special Camos get equipped: after all of one mode's Military Camos have been unlocked, but before players have unlocked Gold Camo (or beyond).In Season 02, we’ll be changing this equip requirement to give players the ability to equip their unlocked Special Camos earlier in each Weapon's Camo journey, while still preserving a short \"on-ramp\" of first needing to unlock 5 Military Camos that we feel is important to the new Weapon journey. In MP, this means that Specials can now be accessed after 30 Headshots instead of 100, but getting to 5 Military Camos unlocked can also be done across all 3 modes if desired.Challenge progress bars now appear below Special Camo and Mastery Camo swatches on the Camo tab in the Gunsmith.The currently equipped Camo will now be highlighted by default when entering the Camo tab in the Gunsmith (if applicable).SOCIAL \u0026 CHANNELSAdded a \"Favorites Only”\"Filter to the Friends List that can be used to display only Favorite Friends.Player mic indicators will now appear when viewing the Party Channel or Game Channel.\"Sort by Progression\" and \"Sort by Rank\" will now display the applicable Level or Rank icons in the Friends List, regardless of which mode the player is viewing the Social menu from.Dark Ops Calling Cards that you haven’t unlocked yet yourself will no longer appear as \"Classified\" when viewed in another player's Calling Card Showcase.MULTIPLAYERWEAPONSAddressed an issue where Akimbo Attachments did not properly display Pros and Cons.Addressed an animation pop when using certain muzzle attachments with the GS45 Pistol.All WeaponsWe have a few global changes landing with the start of Season 02 that will affect all weapons. The first is an improvement to the weapon motion reduction on the Dexterity Perk, which will make weapons feel even more stable while jumping, sliding, and diving. The second is a response to feedback that the weapon animations on respawn can get in the way of combat. These animations are now immediately interruptible when firing, aiming down sights, sprinting, or performing other gameplay actions.Lastly, we are tuning down bullet penetration significantly, as we have continued to see cases where bullets are passing through too much cover. Our first step in addressing this is to decrease the maximum depth that bullets can pass through for all materials. We have longer-term plans to make bullet penetration more intuitive and consistent, and will be introducing further improvements in future updates.Weapon motion reduction from the Dexterity perk improved from 60% to 70%.Weapon raise animations that play on respawn are now fully interruptible.Reduced bullet penetration on all surface types.Magazine Attachment ChangesAnother large-scale change we are making is speeding up Fast Mag reload times. Our goal is for every magazine attachment to have a role across the many playstyles in Call of Duty, but we recognize that it can feel hard to trade away the larger mag sizes. We want to avoid adding more penalties to Extended Mags, so we are instead focusing on improvements to Fast Mags to make the selection more enticing. We're starting with reload time adjustments, but we'll continue to assess magazines to make sure players have more interesting choices and build potential with this node.Fast Mag I, Fast Mag II, Fast Mag III, and Flip Mag reload times improved by 10% on all weapon classes but pistols.Fast Mag I and Fast Mag II reload times improved by 5% on Pistols.All LMG magazines with 50 rounds or less have had reload times improved by 5%.AS VAL default magazine reload time improved by 10%.Addressed an issue with Swat 5.56 Fast Mag I, it will now improve reload times as intended.The following magazine attachments have had their ammo add times updated to match the intended timings. The overall reload times and interrupt times remain the same.C9 Extended Mag I: from 1.933s to 2.267s.Model L Extended Mag II: from 2.133s to 2.433s.GPMG-7 Extended Mag II: from 5.2s to 5.6s.GPMG-7 Extended Mag III: from 5.7s to 6.07s.GPMG-7 Extended Mag IV: from 6.13s to 6.47s.SVD Extended Mag 2: from 2.63s to 3s.MeleeRemoved screen flash from taking frontal bullet damage while holding a melee.Assault RiflesGoblin Mk2The Goblin Mk2 may be the most divisive weapon out there in the community. Some players absolutely love it, and a lot of players… strongly prefer other weapons. We’re making a number of small improvements to help overall usability and consistency without affecting the weapon's identity. In particular, the maximum damage range increase will help with mid-range engagements, and we're giving it a bit more inflicted flinch than the average Assault Rifle to reward players who land that first hit.SMGsKompakt 92Our design intent for the 3-Round Burst Mod on the Kompakt 92 is to give the weapon an alternate playstyle that trades some raw upfront power for more consistent mid-range performance. The upside wasn't as strong as we wanted it to be, so we've adjusted the range slightly and made some significant recoil reductions.ShotgunsWith this update, we are improving ranges and Sprint to Fire speeds on all Shotguns. We know that some of these adjustments may look inconsequential, but Shotgun balance in particular tends to live on a knife’s edge. We want Shotguns to play a greater role outside of our very smallest maps, and we’ll keep adjusting until we’re happy with their usage.The Maelstrom has received some more pronounced changes, as it was lagging behind the Marine SP and ASG-89. It is now capable of a one-shot kill at very close proximity, and all its other ranges have received a larger boost than the other Shotguns. We've also given it a small Fire Rate improvement to help its firepower without further changes to pellet damage.MGsPU-21The PU-21 is intended to be a more lightweight LMG with build opportunities skewing towards Assault Rifle handling and mobility. We are reducing the pre-fire delay by a little more than half to help fit the more aggressive playstyle, and are reducing deviation in its recoil to help with consistency in gunfights.AdjustmentsPre-fire delay improved from 55ms to 20ms.Sprint to Fire Speed improved from 245ms to 240ms.Tactical Sprint to Fire Speed improved from 335ms to 330ms.View Kick Deviation slightly reduced.Marksman RiflesDM-10The Gain-Twist Barrel improvement to Bullet Velocity was unintentionally low on the DM-10. There will now be an advantage to using it over the Reinforced Barrel.Sniper RiflesWe saw a lot of positivity surrounding the AMR Mod 4 when it launched in Season 01, in no small part due to the consistency it has with its hit location multipliers. With Season 02 we are increasing the one-shot hit locations on the launch snipers, with the goal of giving all of them a similar feeling of consistency and opening the doors to more weapon variety.We are also making some small reductions to the Aim Down Sight speed bonuses on Quickdraw Grips. There were a couple considerations that went into this change. The first was the general power level of snipers, as the body multiplier changes are a big buff. Another consideration was our Fast Mag buffs, which we hope will enable players to comfortably take builds that stack multiple sources of ADS speed improvements.PistolsStryder .22The Stryder .22 launched with a smaller Bullet Penetration profile than the other pistols. The distinction is hard to read as a player and offers little to weapon identity, so we’re bringing it up to parity with the rest of the class.Special WeaponsSirin 9mmWe’ve addressed an issue causing unintended Sprint to Fire modifications with the magazine attachments on the Sirin 9mm. We have updated the attributes on these magazines so that they’re in line with the tradeoffs that appear on other weapons.LaunchersLast but not least, launchers are receiving some major handling improvements to help with general usability and responsiveness.HUDAddressed an issue that would occasionally incorrectly display the Field Upgrade “READY” state after respawning.Addressed an issue where player names would not display beside the speaker icon when speaking in a match.HUD Presets can now be set separately for Zombies and Multiplayer.PROGRESSION \u0026 XPSearch \u0026 DestroyAddressed an issue that was preventing the end-of-game Match Bonus XP payout from being awarded in the following situations: The entire enemy team quit, ending the matchThe player did not deal any damage in the final RoundCHALLENGESBlack Ops 6 launched with more Calling Card Challenges than any recent Call of Duty, brought the return of \"100 Percenter\" Cards for Multiplayer and Zombies, and brought a deep Calling Card grind to Warzone with its own “100 Percenter” Card for the first time. It has been very exciting to see players strategizing over and unlocking all the various Calling Card Challenges in the game since launch.Some Multiplayer Challenges, however, have been either a bit on the frustrating side, or have had bugs and other issues that have prevented some players from completing them on the path to \"100 Percenter\".For Season 02, we’ve put a big focus on fixing these Challenge bugs and smoothing over the key frustration points players have been experiencing as part of the Multiplayer Calling Card Challenge grind since launch. We hope these fixes and updates help players stuck in their Challenge journey and unblock their progress toward 100% completion.Scorestreak Destruction ChallengesAddressed an issue that was not awarding Challenge progress towards Scorestreak Destructions in cases where players didn’t perform the final blow on the destroyed enemy Scorestreak.Players will now earn progress for Camo Challenges that require destroying Scorestreaks even if they do not deal the destroying final blow. This impacts the following content: Camo Challenges for the CIGMA 2B and HE-1Mastery Badges for the CIGMA 2B and HE-1“Hot Lead”, “Air Control,” and “Field Work” Calling Card ChallengesWe made this adjustment to ensure that Challenge progress for destroying Scorestreaks is made whenever you earn Scorestreak Destruction Medals like \"Flyswatter\" and \"Downed,\" and to make challenges that involve destroying Scorestreaks much more consistent. This should make the grind for Diamond Launchers smoother and less random or frustrating for players.Calling Card Challenges“Redemption Arc” Going Ham Challenge: Removed the time requirement of needing to get a kill shortly after being revived. Players can now make progress by earning a Kill anytime after they revive themselves with the Morphine Injector.“Tick Tock Boom” Humiliation Challenge: Semtex sticks that do not result in a kill for the sticking player will now also progress the Challenge.“On Point” Prestige 1 Challenge: The Challenge now uses the same Dive detection as the “Dive Shot” Medal, allowing for a grace period shortly after landing from a Dive where the Challenge can still be progressed.“Squint Test” Prestige 1 Challenge: Moonshot requirement reduced from 100m to 75m to make completing this Challenge possible on more maps.“Explosive Plays” Prestige 4 Challenge: Addressed a bug that was displaying the wrong Calling Card name.“Hot Dawg” Prestige 4 Challenge: Reduced the Molotov or Thermo Grenade Kills without dying requirement from 4 to 3.“Headhunter” Prestige 5 Challenge: Addressed a typo in the Challenge description that specified the incorrect Barrel needed to progress the Challenge.

With Season 02, we wanted to remove or update some of the more frustrating Dailies to ensure that players are always receiving Challenges that are approachable and straightforward. Our goal with Daily Challenges is to encourage players to try out various items and strategies, without making them too restrictive or frustrating for players to complete in a single session. Addressed an issue that was preventing the following Daily Challenges from tracking properly: Get 50 Eliminations with a Suppressed Weapon.Get 50 Eliminations using a Weapon with 5 or more Attachments.The “Get Eliminations with Secondary Weapons” Daily Challenge will now track Eliminations earned with the Sirin 9mm Special Weapon.Mastery BadgesTactical Insertion: Addressed an issue that was causing the Tactical Insertion Mastery Badge from only progressing via Revenge Kills. It will now progress when any enemy is Killed by the player shortly after they’ve respawned via a Tactical Insertion.The Mastery Badge for the used Weapon, Scorestreak, Field Upgrade, or Equipment will now appear correctly in Killcam and Best Plays.SpawnsSpawn logic has been adjusted to continue our efforts to reduce proximity to enemies when respawning.We have also added the ability to conduct live A/B testing with spawn changes to evaluate on a smaller scale, and if results are positive, we will roll those changes out globally. This will allow us to be more agile with spawn changes.ModesOverdrive (LTM)Rack up stars to unlock special Operator abilities that will greatly aid you in battle and keep that streak going to reach Overdrive! If you get eliminated, or the elimination timer runs out before you take out another target, you’ll start the process over again.

(Yes, we’re annoyed by the smoke too, and will continue to evaluate.)Addressed an issue where Field Upgrades could not be deployed in certain scenarios while using the Prepper Wildcard.Addressed an issue where Gearhead Perk would not decrease the time to earn Field Upgrades.Decreased the amount of weapon motion when jumping, sliding, and diving with the Dexterity Perk.Addressed an issue where the Ninja Perk could lose functionality between respawns and round transitions, resulting in footsteps not being quieter.Addressed an issue where the Ninja Perk was not being applied to enemy players when spectating a teammate.Headshots will no longer skip Last Stand when using the Morphine Injector Field Upgrade.ScorestreaksAddressed an issue where Care Packages could be captured by teammates at the same capture rate as the owner.Addressed an issue where the SAM Turret could target enemy Scorestreaks that were leaving the airspace.Addressed an issue where the SAM Turret’s targeting laser would not be visible when tracking a target.MedalsAdjusted the “Dive Shot” Medal (Kill an enemy while or shortly after diving in any direction) to be more forgiving so that Kills earned just after diving will award the Medal more consistently.Tuned the “Snaked” Medal (2 rapid weapon kills against enemies in different directions while on your stomach, back or side) to be more forgiving and be awarded in more situations that match the intent of the Medal.GeneralDetailed Weapon Stats Improvements: Added new stats \u0026 refactored the layout to be data-driven.Addressed an issue in Theater where thrown projectiles could not be seen.Addressed an issue where vehicles could visually disappear for some players during gameplay.Training Course entry point has been moved from the playlist selection to the top right navigation panel.MovementWe are continuing to monitor Omnimovement feedback, and of course playing the game ourselves. We are currently testing slight reductions to initial slide speed and duration to improve predictability of engagements when opponents enter with a slide.Additionally, we are always evaluating areas for improved fluidity, whether those are specific to movement mechanics or other mechanics like the ability to interrupt weapon raises during respawns that we highlighted above.Reduced collision with teammates. This should improve the ability to maneuver around tight spaces like doorways with nearby teammates.RANKED PLAYCross-PlayThe following changes are being implemented at the launch of Season 02 to provide players on console with the option to select the platform pool(s) they wish to matchmake with:PlayStation – In-Game OptionsRanked:On: Enables matchmaking with all gaming platforms when playing in Ranked playlists.On (Consoles Only): Enables matchmaking only with other consoles when playing in Ranked playlists.

This one week evaluation period will give players a chance to experiment with the weapons in a competitive environment, provide feedback, and help Treyarch and the CDL determine whether they should remain unrestricted in CDL and Ranked Play.To stay up to date on the latest Ranked Play restrictions and settings, stay tuned to @Treyarch and @CODUpdates for the latest details, and bookmark our Patch Notes pages.Season 02 Rank SetbackCompetitors who are continuing their conquest in Ranked Play from Season 01 will notice that their accounts may have been set back as outlined in previous notes. Every new Season, your Rank may be rolled back based on where you ended the previous season, as follows: Bronze or Silver Rank players are not impacted by the Seasonal setback and will be able to pick up where they ended Season 01 with no SR deduction.Gold or Platinum Rank players will start Season 02in Tier I of Gold or Platinum respectively.Diamond Rank and above players will start the Season 02 at Diamond I.Demotion ProtectionDemotion Protection will be active for everyone’s first 3 Ranked Play losses in Season 02, and players can expect 1 free loss per day via Daily Loss Forgiveness like in Season 01.Ranked Play Season 02 RewardsRank Camos: Each Rank Gold and above has a unique animated Camo you can earn to show off your rank: Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Crimson \u0026 Iridescent: Start in (or above) or reach the applicable Rank anytime in Season 02 to earn.Top 250: Finish Season 02 in the Top 250.Rank Calling Cards: Each Rank Silver and above has a unique Calling Card reward: Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Crimson, Iridescent (Animated): Start in (or above) or reach the applicable Rank anytime in Season 02 to earn.Top 250 (Animated): Finish Season 02 in the Top 250.Top 250 Champion (Animated): One-of-a-kind Calling Card awarded to the single player who finishes Season 02 in the #1 position on the Top 250.Pro Issue Jackal PDW Blueprint: Unlocked by winning 10 Ranked Play matches in Season 02 Muzzle: CompensatorBarrel: Long BarrelUnderbarrel: Ranger ForegripRear Grip: Ergonomic GripStock: Balanced Stock100 Season 02 Wins Decal: Unlocked by winning 100 Ranked Play matches in Season 02.Veto VoteThe Veto Vote before Ranked Play matches will now occasionally present a choice between the 3 Ranked Play modes (Hardpoint, Control \u0026 Search and Destroy) on the same map.This new addition to the Ranked Play Veto Vote gives players the occasional choice over which Ranked Play mode they want to avoid in their next match, while ensuring that all the maps in the CDL map rotation get playtime in Ranked. We look forward to seeing how players react and vote when this Veto type occasionally appears before Ranked matches. Please let us know what you think. SR Gain \u0026 Loss AdjustmentsPlayers will notice that their personal match performance has a bigger impact on their SR gained or lost after Ranked Play matches in Season 02, especially for the lower Ranks. This should help players early in their Ranked Play Rank journey more consistently earn bigger SR payouts when they perform well, and reduce SR losses incurred after a strong personal performance in a losing effort. While this tuning will impact all Ranks, team performance and the margin of victory are still the primary consideration for SR gains and losses in Ranks Crimson and above.GeneralAddressed an issue

Notably, the Tracker perk, which now outlines enemies in line-of-sight without live pings, has been removed from the list of restrictions. New SR adjustments aim to streamline progression, helping players quickly align with skill-appropriate divisions while addressing barriers when bridging the gap between key ranks. Placement and elimination rewards have been fine-tuned to encourage competition and skill diversity in higher ranks, while also ensuring players in top tiers like Crimson and Iridescent face greater challenges to maintain their status. In addition, deployment fees have been rebalanced to ease progression in lower ranks and increase the prestige of reaching top tiers. See the full details below:Cross-PlayThe following changes are being implemented at the launch of Season 02 to provide players on console with the option to select the platform pool(s) they wish to matchmake with:» PlayStation – In-Game Options «On: Enables matchmaking with all gaming platforms when playing in Ranked playlists.On (Consoles Only): Enables matchmaking only with other consoles when playing in Ranked playlists.

Will negatively impact matchmaking queue times.RestrictionsTracker perk has been removed from the restricted items list in WZ Ranked Play.The Tracker perk no longer live pings players and instead applies an outline to enemy players that is not visible through walls. In addition, fixes to Cold Blooded now allow the footsteps to be appropriately countered. Skill RatingRanked SR adjustments are a challenging task. Everything has a cascading effect, especially when modeling consequences across different types of match outcomes. Our approach to these adjustments aims to achieve several key objectives:One major objective is to onboard more players into the early ranks and help them progress toward divisions that better represent their skill sets more quickly. We aim to adjust the rewards for SR in a way that allows players performing above their skill division to accelerate into higher divisions and remain there, where their skill matches the other players. This should, ideally, lead to greater player and skill diversity in the mid and higher divisions.There is also a very clear set of plateaus or walls that players encounter in the ranges of Silver III through Gold I and Platinum III through Diamond I. There are several reasons for this, but we aim to address these issues in a few critical ways. By adjusting the \"team remaining\" rewards to smooth out the curve, we hope players on the upper borders of these skill bands will be nudged more frequently into higher divisions. This will provide them with opportunities to play with and against stronger players, helping to improve their skills rather than leaving them in a division where they feel their abilities are underrepresented.Additionally, these changes are designed to ensure that players without access to the upper bands of division delta bonuses for eliminations (e.g., players in Crimson and Iridescent) cannot easily maintain their positions just because the delta rewards for +1/+2/+3 have increased. These players will still need to work hard to remain in these divisions, and the influx of new players into higher divisions should foster more competition and diversity in gameplay.Deployment FeesThe adjustments to deployment fees align with the overall goals of Ranked Play. We aim to make accessing certain divisions less frustrating by reducing barriers and smoothing out the progression experience. Reaching the Iridescent rank will become slightly more challenging (partially offset by the SR changes for the +0 delta and teams-remaining rewards) due to increased deployment fees, requiring more effort from players to maintain their position in this elite rank. For reference, less than 0.1% of players achieve Iridescent or Crimson status.Fee reductions at lower division levels encourage players to re-enter and play more frequently, ensuring a smoother and more enjoyable progression experience. However, once players reach Iridescent—especially those competing for a spot in the top 250—we want to ensure that achieving and maintaining this level truly reflects exceptional skill and is something players can proudly showcase.RewardsCompete in a second season of Battle Royale Ranked Play, earning the following seasonal rewards as you progress:First Season Win: Elimination CharmGet 25 Eliminations: Elimination StickerGet 100 Eliminations: Elimination Weapon CamoGet 250 Eliminations: Elimination Weapon BlueprintSilver: “Ranked Season 02 – “Silver” EmblemGold: “Ranked Season 02 – “Gold” Calling Card, Emblem, and Weapon CamoPlatinum: “Ranked Season 02 – Platinum” Calling Card Emblem, and Weapon CamoDiamond: “Ranked Season 02 – Diamond” Calling Card Emblem, and Weapon CamoCrimson: “Ranked Season 02 – Crimson” Calling Card Emblem, and Weapon CamoIridescent: “Ranked Season 02 – Iridescent” Calling Card Emblem, and Weapon CamoTop 250: “Ranked Season 02 – Top 250” Calling Card Emblem, and Weapon CamoGENERALBuy StationsAll Buy Stations, including deployable and standard ones, now close at the beginning of the \"Final Circle\" announcement.Deployable BoxesUtility boxes, such as munition boxes, armor boxes, and others, can no longer be placed in the gas.We’ve noticed an increase in buy backs during the final circle, sometimes even after the gas has completely consumed the map. While we appreciate resourceful plays, the tactic of a team camping a Buy Station to secure a win doesn’t align with our vision for “last team standing wins”. To address this, we’re making changes to encourage more meaningful and intense engagements in the final moments – the way we believe most matches are meant to end.We remain committed to identifying and addressing other “cheese” strategies in the game. Regardless of how long a mechanic has been around, we’re dedicated to refining systems to enhance the game’s competitive integrity.Score Events Added a new \"Splat\" score event in Battle Royale, which triggers when a player is eliminated while parachuting or skydiving.Experience BalanceBattle Royale Player XP increased by +7%.Weapon XP increased by +10%.Resurgence Player XP decreased by -8%.Weapon XP increased by +10%.Plunder Player XP increased by +22%.Weapon XP decreased by -13%.Player and Weapon XP rates have been adjusted in Warzone to bring each mode closer in line with one another.Quality of Life HighlightsAdvanced UAVAdvanced UAVs now display elevation arrows to indicate player altitude.Warzone BarracksThe button layout in the Warzone Barracks has been reorganized to match the structure used in Multiplayer and Zombies.Ammo CachesAmmo Cache Depots now function like Munition Boxes, dropping additional ammo and equipment on the ground.Pinging Buyback FlaresPlayers can now ping the flares from buybacks to better alert their teammates.Match Stat TrackerThe font used in the match stat tracker has been adjusted for improved readability, especially at lower resolutions.Detailed Weapon StatsNew stats have been added, and the layout has been redesigned to prioritize data clarity and accessibility.Some stats adjusted by the attachments were not represented. The new stats better reflect reality.Fade DistanceThe fade distance for loadout and cash drop crates while parachuting has been reduced to 300 meters for improved visibility.COMBATBody ShieldVictims are no longer automatically released mid-air.The outline of the victim, previously visible through walls, has been disabled.Players can no longer release a victim without executing them first.The body shield was incorrectly releasing your victim when attempting to take someone with you to a plummeting death, resulting in your own death but not your victim's.Additionally, we are removing the griefing mechanic of repeatedly releasing, downing, and releasing the same target. Going forward, if you choose to body shield a player, it must now culminate in an execution.MOVEMENTJumpingIncreased both jump speed and successive jump height with one unmodified successive jump.We’re reverting some jump penalties to the values used last year. This marks the first step in our jump evaluation, and we’ll revisit this topic again in the future.ParachuteIncreased the speed of the parachute cut animation, making cutting a parachute and readying your weapon significantly faster.Increased player velocity when landing from a cut parachute land, for smoother transition into full sprint.The recovery time after landing from a parachute has often felt overly punishing, both for players trying to evade and those looking to engage. This adjustment aims to make the action more fluid and balanced, preventing it from feeling overly restrictive.PERKSNewReactive Armor Perk Slot 2• Your armor will regenerate up to 50% if you have not taken damage in the last 5 seconds.• Available via Event RewardAdjustmentsTrackerPings have been replaced with an outline that is not visible through walls but will still appear on targets through smoke.Tracker can now mark up to five targets simultaneously. Engaging a sixth target will remove the outline from the first target.Tracker, Spy Camera, and Proxy Alarm have been adjusted to balance their usage. These changes address the over-reliance on intel systems that provide vision through walls. By scaling this back, we aim to align these mechanics with systems like UAVs while offering additional visual feedback. Our goal is to make highlight interactions more consistent, grounded, and balanced across engagements.DexterityThe weapon handling component of Dexterity has been enhanced and is now a default perk for all Warzone players.This will result in smoother weapon handling for jumping, sliding and diving as a default change to all players. MountaineerThis perk returns in Slot 1, replacing Dexterity. Fall damage reduction has been significantly improved compared to the current version with Dexterity, though it’s not as powerful as its iteration in Modern Warfare III.VeteranNow provides significant damage reduction against the effects of Gas Grenades.EQUIPMENTMunitions Satchel Now only provides 1 additional item, down from 2, to address overstocking and spamming equipment.Tacticals \u0026 LethalsMaximum deployed tacticals and lethals reduced to 2 each, down from 3, to make more purposeful trap plays.Impact GrenadeDefault stack size increased from 2 to 3.When equipped with a Munitions Satchel, the max stack size increases to 4.Impact Grenades occupy a unique niche between Semtex and Frag grenades. A direct hit significantly boosts its damage while also bypassing some of the mitigation provided by Bomb Squad, making it a more skill-based option. We’ve made the choice to retain its max stack size at 4, due to it underperforming quite significantly in metrics previously. Perhaps this makes it more IMPACTFUL. ThermobaricInner radius increased from 25 to 50.Inner damage increased from 190 to 220.Outer damage increased from 48 to 55.The Thermobaric grenade has been adjusted to improve its usability by increasing the inner radius, making it easier to deal higher damage. The slight damage boost complements this change.Frag GrenadeInner damage decreased from 250 to 240.Middle damage decreased from 170 to 120.Outer damage increased from 48 to 55.Frag grenades are a staple in combat, known for their reliability. Following adjustments in Black Ops 6, they’ve become easier to use. These changes aim to align their damage output with their ease of use, and we will continue to monitor their effectiveness.Experimental Gas GrenadeSlightly increased the trigger height of the gas effects to better match visuals.Movement reduction from gas decreased:Without resistance: from 60% to 50%.With resistance: from 60% to 25%.Gas damage against resistant targets reduced from 8 to 5.Gas grenade usage has increased, and these changes ensure proper counters are in place. The Veteran perk remains the best option to counter negative equipment effects. These adjustments aim to balance the grenade’s effectiveness while keeping counters viable.Stim ShotStrafe slide velocity with stim slightly reduced.The combination of stim and omni-directional slides exceeded normal velocity thresholds. This adjustment brings it back in line with regular gameplay metrics.Spy CameraUpdated the outline visual to no longer display through walls.Effect duration increased from 7 seconds to 10 seconds.Proxy AlarmUpdated the outline visual for better clarity.KILLSTREAKSAdvanced UAVAdvanced UAVs now display elevation arrows to indicate player altitude.Bunker BusterGas damage against targets with gas resistance has been reduced from 8 to 5.FIELD UPGRADESLoadout Drop MarkerThe bounce factor for Loadout Drop Markers has been reduced by 50%.It’s not uncommon to see Loadout Markers bouncing far from their intended drop location. By halving the bounce factor - which was previously comparable to that of a smoke grenade - we aim to maintain the grenade-like behavior while minimizing the frustrating, unintended movement. We’ll continue to monitor player feedback on this adjustment.Decontamination StationThe ability to re-enable closed Buy Stations by placing a Decontamination Station nearby has been removed.WEAPONSGeneralReload SpeedsReload speeds have been improved across all weapons, with increases ranging from 5% to 20%, depending on the weapon class. Modern Warfare 3Assault Rifles (ARs): 15% fasterMarksman Rifles (MRs): 5% fasterSubmachine Guns (SMGs): 10% fasterSniper Rifles: 12% fasterHandguns: 5% fasterBattle Rifles: 10% fasterModern Warfare 2Assault Rifles (ARs): 12% fasterMarksman Rifles (MRs): 10% fasterLight Machine Guns (LMGs): 15% fasterSubmachine Guns (SMGs): 22% fasterSniper Rifles: 15% fasterHandguns: 5% fasterBattle Rifles: 10% fasterBlack Ops 6Assault Rifles (ARs): 5% fasterMarksman Rifles (MRs): 5% fasterLight Machine Guns (LMGs): 10% fasterSubmachine Guns (SMGs): 10% fasterSniper Rifles: 10% fasterHandguns: 5% fasterReload speeds for Flip and Fast Mag attachments have been increased by an additional 5%.We have increased reload speeds to help make combat feel more fluid and decrease overall downtime. This should get it closer to previous iterations when using sleight of hand.Bullet PenetrationAdjusted bullet penetration across most materials resulting in a more consistent experience for thicker walls in particular.Weapon SwapIncreased swap speed by 10%, effectively replicating the effect of the Quick Grip Gloves Perk from Modern Warfare.Sprint-to-FireReduced sprint-to-fire penalty when jumping from 35% to 10%.Aim-Down-SightReduced the aim-down-sight (ADS) jump speed penalty by 25%.We want to allow different play styles and movement mechanics to feel viable and smooth to perform. We will continue to monitor how these are playing out and adjust accordingly.New WeaponsPPSh-41 Submachine GunFull-auto submachine gun. Fast fire rate with impressive damage and high recoil.

While we work on improving fire mode visibility, we’ve simplified the ground loot weapon pool to create a more predictable and consistent experience for all players.CONTRACTSIntelCompleting Intel contracts now has a very low chance to reward a Durable Gas Mask.Signal IntelligenceCash rewards for Signal Intelligence contracts, which were previously $7,500 per player, have been reduced based on squad size as follows: Solos: $7,500 per player ($7,500 total).Duos: $4,500 per player ($9,000 total).Trios: $3,500 per player ($10,500 total).Quads: $3,000 per player ($12,000 total).Signal Intelligence contracts were providing an excessive cash payout, especially for larger squad sizes. These adjustments, while significant, still offer high rewards compared to other contracts.Scavenger Distance between scavenger crates has been reduced, requiring less of a marathon between objectives.The majority of the time, objectives will prioritize remaining within the same point of interest.PUBLIC EVENTSRunaway TrainThis event now has a 10% chance to occur in the 5th circle of

We are also focusing on more precise tools, including major upgrades to the kernel-level anti-cheat driver and server-side systems starting this season and continuing into Season 03.

The first is an improvement to the weapon motion reduction on the Dexterity Perk, which will make weapons feel even more stable while jumping, sliding, and diving. The second is a response to feedback that the weapon animations on respawn can get in the way of combat. These animations are now immediately interruptible when firing, aiming down sights, sprinting, or performing other gameplay actions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, we are tuning down bullet penetration significantly, as we have continued to see cases where bullets are passing through too much cover. Our first step in addressing this is to decrease the maximum depth that bullets can pass through for all materials. We have longer-term plans to make bullet penetration more intuitive and consistent, and will be introducing further improvements in future updates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWeapon motion reduction from the Dexterity perk improved from 60% to 70%.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWeapon raise animations that play on respawn are now fully interruptible.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReduced bullet penetration on all surface types.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch4\u003eMagazine Attachment Changes\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother large-scale change we are making is speeding up Fast Mag reload times. Our goal is for every magazine attachment to have a role across the many playstyles in Call of Duty, but we recognize that it can feel hard to trade away the larger mag sizes. We want to avoid adding more penalties to Extended Mags, so we are instead focusing on improvements to Fast Mags to make the selection more enticing. We\u0026#39;re starting with reload time adjustments, but we\u0026#39;ll continue to assess magazines to make sure players have more interesting choices and build potential with this node.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFast Mag I, Fast Mag II, Fast Mag III, and Flip Mag reload times improved by 10% on all weapon classes but pistols.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFast Mag I and Fast Mag II reload times improved by 5% on Pistols.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll LMG magazines with 50 rounds or less have had reload times improved by 5%.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAS VAL default magazine reload time improved by 10%.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAddressed an issue with Swat 5.56 Fast Mag I, it will now improve reload times as intended.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe following magazine attachments have had their ammo add times updated to match the intended timings.

Some players absolutely love it, and a lot of players… strongly prefer other weapons. We’re making a number of small improvements to help overall usability and consistency without affecting the weapon\u0026#39;s identity. In particular, the maximum damage range increase will help with mid-range engagements, and we\u0026#39;re giving it a bit more inflicted flinch than the average Assault Rifle to reward players who land that first hit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSMGs\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eKompakt 92\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur design intent for the 3-Round Burst Mod on the Kompakt 92 is to give the weapon an alternate playstyle that trades some raw upfront power for more consistent mid-range performance. The upside wasn\u0026#39;t as strong as we wanted it to be, so we\u0026#39;ve adjusted the range slightly and made some significant recoil reductions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eShotguns\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith this update, we are improving ranges and Sprint to Fire speeds on all Shotguns. We know that some of these adjustments may look inconsequential, but Shotgun balance in particular tends to live on a knife’s edge. We want Shotguns to play a greater role outside of our very smallest maps, and we’ll keep adjusting until we’re happy with their usage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Maelstrom has received some more pronounced changes, as it was lagging behind the Marine SP and ASG-89. It is now capable of a one-shot kill at very close proximity, and all its other ranges have received a larger boost than the other Shotguns. We\u0026#39;ve also given it a small Fire Rate improvement to help its firepower without further changes to pellet damage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eMGs\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003ePU-21\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe PU-21 is intended to be a more lightweight LMG with build opportunities skewing towards Assault Rifle handling and mobility.

With Season 02 we are increasing the one-shot hit locations on the launch snipers, with the goal of giving all of them a similar feeling of consistency and opening the doors to more weapon variety.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are also making some small reductions to the Aim Down Sight speed bonuses on Quickdraw Grips. There were a couple considerations that went into this change. The first was the general power level of snipers, as the body multiplier changes are a big buff. Another consideration was our Fast Mag buffs, which we hope will enable players to comfortably take builds that stack multiple sources of ADS speed improvements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003ePistols\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eStryder .22\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Stryder .22 launched with a smaller Bullet Penetration profile than the other pistols.

second season of Warzone Ranked Play, we’re deploying adjustments to restrictions, SR gains, and deployment fees. Notably, the Tracker perk, which now outlines enemies in line-of-sight without live pings, has been removed from the list of restrictions. New SR adjustments aim to streamline progression, helping players quickly align with skill-appropriate divisions while addressing barriers when bridging the gap between key ranks. Placement and elimination rewards have been fine-tuned to encourage competition and skill diversity in higher ranks, while also ensuring players in top tiers like Crimson and Iridescent face greater challenges to maintain their status.

Everything has a cascading effect, especially when modeling consequences across different types of match outcomes. Our approach to these adjustments aims to achieve several key objectives:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne major objective is to onboard more players into the early ranks and help them progress toward divisions that better represent their skill sets more quickly. We aim to adjust the rewards for SR in a way that allows players performing above their skill division to accelerate into higher divisions and remain there, where their skill matches the other players. This should, ideally, lead to greater player and skill diversity in the mid and higher divisions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is also a very clear set of plateaus or walls that players encounter in the ranges of Silver III through Gold I and Platinum III through Diamond I. There are several reasons for this, but we aim to address these issues in a few critical ways. By adjusting the \u0026#34;team remaining\u0026#34; rewards to smooth out the curve, we hope players on the upper borders of these skill bands will be nudged more frequently into higher divisions. This will provide them with opportunities to play with and against stronger players, helping to improve their skills rather than leaving them in a division where they feel their abilities are underrepresented.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, these changes are designed to ensure that players without access to the upper bands of division delta bonuses for eliminations (e.g., players in Crimson and Iridescent) cannot easily maintain their positions just because the delta rewards for +1/+2/+3 have increased. These players will still need to work hard to remain in these divisions, and the influx of new players into higher divisions should foster more competition and diversity in gameplay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eDeployment Fees\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe adjustments to deployment fees align with the overall goals of Ranked Play. We aim to make accessing certain divisions less frustrating by reducing barriers and smoothing out the progression experience. Reaching the Iridescent rank will become slightly more challenging (partially offset by the SR changes for the +0 delta and teams-remaining rewards) due to increased deployment fees, requiring more effort from players to maintain their position in this elite rank. For reference, less than 0.1% of players achieve Iridescent or Crimson status.\u003cbr/\u003eFee reductions at lower division levels encourage players to re-enter and play more frequently, ensuring a smoother and more enjoyable progression experience. However, once players reach Iridescent—especially those competing for a spot in the top 250—we want to ensure that achieving and maintaining this level truly reflects exceptional skill and is something players can proudly showcase.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRewards\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eCompete in a second season of Battle Royale Ranked Play, earning the following seasonal rewards as you progress:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFirst Season Win: Elimination Charm\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGet 25 Eliminations: Elimination Sticker\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGet 100 Eliminations: Elimination Weapon Camo\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGet 250 Eliminations: Elimination Weapon Blueprint\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSilver: “Ranked Season 02 – “Silver” Emblem\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGold: “Ranked Season 02 – “Gold” Calling Card, Emblem, and Weapon Camo\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlatinum: “Ranked Season 02 – Platinum” Calling Card Emblem, and Weapon Camo\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDiamond: “Ranked Season 02 – Diamond” Calling Card Emblem, and Weapon Camo\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCrimson: “Ranked Season 02 – Crimson” Calling Card Emblem, and Weapon Camo\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIridescent: “Ranked Season 02 – Iridescent” Calling Card Emblem, and Weapon Camo\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTop 250: “Ranked Season 02 – Top 250” Calling Card Emblem, and Weapon Camo\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGENERAL\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eBuy Stations\u003c/b\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll Buy Stations, including deployable and standard ones, now close at the beginning of the \u0026#34;Final Circle\u0026#34; announcement.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eDeployable Boxes\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUtility boxes, such as munition boxes, armor boxes, and others, can no longer be placed in the gas.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve noticed an increase in buy backs during the final circle, sometimes even after the gas has completely consumed the map.
