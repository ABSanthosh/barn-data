  "text": "News Written By Sophie Austin Published 10/22/24 Get ready to muster up your courage and remaster your inventory, because Bundles of Bravery is finally here! Our third game drop brings bundles (an item that lets you store and stack other items) and Hardcore mode (the toughest Survival sub-mode), to Minecraft – and it’s available to play right now.  Declutter your inventory with bundles Bundles aren’t just a stylish way to give gifts to your fellow Realm members – they’re nifty organization tools that’ll help you manage your ever-expanding inventory. Bundles are an item that can store other items – but unlike chests or barrels, which need to be placed, bundles can be kept in your inventory. In other words, they can travel wherever you do!*  *OK, technically putting a chest on a donkey/llama can also travel with you. But have you ever tried to put a donkey in your inventory? No. That’s just for bundles! (Donkey eggs do not count.)  Bundles can combine stacks of items together – so those three oak wood planks, six different flowers, and four types of stairs can all find a home neatly in your bundle. The bundles tooltip also makes it easy for you to add, view, and remove items as often as you want. Finally, if you feel like engaging in some bundle-ception (not a word), you can also store bundles within bundles. That is, as long as the bundle you’re storing in another bundle isn’t full! Phew. That was a tongue twister, wasn’t it?   Bundles are an item that lets you store other items, so they’re great for de-cluttering your inventory You can also dye bundles one of sixteen different colors! Color-coordinate your inventory, or gift a bundle to a friend in their favorite color! Plus – adding, viewing, and removing items from your bundle is easy Hardcore mode – new for Bedrock Edition They didn’t call Hardcore mode “easy-peasy Survival” for one very good reason – it’s the exact opposite of that. In Hardcore mode, the game’s difficulty is locked to the hardest setting, and you only have one life. That means if you die, you can’t respawn – and you’ll only be able to spectate your worlds! So unless pretending to be a ghost in your own Minecraft world, you’ll want to keep an eye on your hunger bar. And watch out for pesky hostile mobs. Oh, and steep cliffs, your bubble-meter, and anything else that might cause you to de-spawn in spectacular fashion. Ehm, good luck with that!  Java players have been dying hopelessly in Hardcore mode for years, and now Bedrock players can experience the terrifying fun for themselves, too! In Hardcore mode, the game’s difficulty is locked to the highest setting, and death is permanent That means if you DO die in Hardcore mode you'll only be able to spectate your world. So keep an eye on those hearts! Hardcore mode – now on Realms for Bedrock and Java Hardcore mode has existed on Minecraft: Java Edition for a while, but today marks the first day friends can experience the thrill (and the pain!) of this punishing Survival mode together via a realm! That’s right – Hardcore mode is now available on realms in both Bedrock and Java Edition. So if the thought of venturing into the hardest Survival mode of Minecraft by yourself fills you with fear, then grab your realm buddies, and take on the challenge together! Have each other's backs as you work to survive, or play against one another in the most Hardcore PvP challenge you’ve ever attempted. And if you’re not sure how to set up a realm on Java Edition or Bedrock Edition, you can find some help here. Make sure to also check out the Java and Bedrock changelogs. We’re confident that Hardcore mode will run smoothly for most Bedrock players, but we’re still working on quashing some smaller bugs. Two of these impact multiplayer gameplay – one related to low internet speeds, and another when replacing a Creative mode Realm with a Hardcore mode world. While we develop a fix for these final bugs, we recommend all players regularly back up their worlds and check our changelog for more detailed information on factors that might trigger them.  In fact, that advice applies to anyone playing on Hardcore mode. Regularly back up your worlds! That’s not just great advice, it’s also a teaser for the very special writers’ challenge coming to Minecraft.net soon. Check back to see if we survived...! In the meantime – master the chaos with bundles, or embrace it with Hardcore mode.
