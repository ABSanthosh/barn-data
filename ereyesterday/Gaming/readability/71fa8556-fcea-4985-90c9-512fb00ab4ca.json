It’s impossible to keep up with everything hitting the digital space, whether it be Premium Video on Demand (PVOD) or a traditional streaming network. With that in mind, we figured it was well past time for us to whip up a little something to help you keep up (and catch up) with all there is to watch in the big, wide world of digital viewing. And thus, the Streaming Rewind was born! We’ll update this list at the end of each week so you can check out what you may have missed, and what’s coming up on the weekend. We’ll keep it a mix of popular releases and noteworthy lesser-known titles to help you find what’s worth taking the risk on as well as dive into a few things that we loved and why we loved ‘em, or just break down a show or movie that left us with some opinions. Sometimes, we’ll even have guest entries from other members of the IGN staff. If you’re not interested in all that and just want to see a bulleted list of what’s out there, pop on down to the New and Noteworthy and ICYMI sections.Ash and Freaky Tales Hit Digital and DemandIt’s rare I combine two titles for one of these blurbs, but fate releasing Ash and Freaky Tales on digital and demand in the same week obligates me to talk about them both. They share absolutely no D.N.A with each other with one exception: they’re both weird little guys. Just oddball, out there movies that are there for people who want something a little more esoteric for their weekend viewing pleasure. Ash (featuring performances from Eiza González and Aaron Paul) is there for folks who like their sci-fi weird and extra serious. It’s trippy and existential with an underlying mystery that extends beyond the “why are we here” of it all. Meanwhile, Freaky Tales is some straight-up silly nonsense. This one features a set of several anthology entries. Each is weirder than the last, but all of them involve beating the hell out of Nazis. It is not a good movie, but it is quite often a very funny movie. Even if perhaps it doesn’t mean to be. (Oh, and Pedro Pascal is in it.) Andor Returns to Disney+Cassian Andor and the Rebel Alliance are back, and not a moment too soon. The first batch of Andor Season 2’s episodes have dropped on Disney+, setting up a season of intrigue, espionage, desperation and, of course, rebellion. Though the release schedule is a little wonky (more on that below), I suspect we’re in for one hell of a ride as the last part of Andor’s pre-Rogue One journey comes to a close. The Last of Us Had Its Big Moment (Max)Welp. Joel has officially gone golfing. If you don’t understand what that means then please know that the bit is for your protection. If you do know what that means then you’re likely aware that fans are just as divided as ever on whether or not it was the right move, only this time it has the added complication of happening in a new medium. A massive horde attack on Jackson keeps things moving this week, but only time will tell what’s to come and which of the townspeople made it out of the attack alive and bite free.
