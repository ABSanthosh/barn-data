  "text": "\"Let me handle Viewtiful Joe too!\" Image credit: Capcom Devil May Cry director Hideki Kamiya has revealed he'd \"love\" to remake the first game in Capcom's classic hack-and-slash series, acknowledging the aging original \"really does feel like a 24-year-old game design\" after all this time. Back in December, Kamiya confirmed he'd entered into a new partnership with Capcom - the publisher he left in 2006 after helming such classics as Resident Evil 2, Okami, and Viewtiful Joe - and was responding to a fan question inspired by the news during the latest episode of his YouTube show (as translated by VGC). When asked how he might approach a remake of the first Devil May Cry, he replied, \"I'd love to do that.\" \"I usually don't replay my own games after release,\" he continued, \"and Devil May Cry is no exception. But once in a while, I catch gameplay clips and think, 'Yeah, this really does feel like a 24-year-old game design.'\" As to how he might tackle a remake, Kamiya said, \"With today's technology and game design approach... I'd want to remake it from the ground up. If that ever happens... well, I don't think seriously unless it's really happening, so right now, I don't have anything in mind. But if the time comes, I'll come up with something. That's what I do! So Capcom, leave it to me! Also, let me handle Viewtiful Joe too!\" Devil May Cry | Official Trailer | Netflix Devil May Cry was adapted into a Netflix series earlier this year.Watch on YouTube Since its debut outing in 2001, Devil May Cry - which follows the demon-hunting adventures of white-haired protagonist Dante - has seen five major instalments (plus the polarising 2013 reboot DmC: Devil May Cry), but Kamiya only directed the first. After departing PlatinumGames in 2023, he formed new studio Clovers, which is currently working with Capcom to create a sequel to his beloved action-adventure Okami. As for Devil May Cry, the series has remained dormant since 2019's well-received fifth instalment, but it recently returned to the spotlight thanks to Netflix's anime adaptation, which Eurogamer contributor Graeme Virtue called a \"spirited take on the mythos\" last month.",
