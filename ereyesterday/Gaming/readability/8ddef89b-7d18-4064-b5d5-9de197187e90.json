Netflix released a new trailer Tuesday, which gave us our longest look yet at the series and maybe even a hint at what the story might be.As you might expect, the trailer itself is mostly focused on action. There are plenty of extremely sick shots of Dante killing demons with both his signature sword and his dual pistols — though it doesn’t actually look like he’s using Ebony and Ivory in the trailer. Of course, all of this is also set to Last Resort by Papa Roach, which gives the trailer exactly the right flood of early-2000s nostalgia it needs.But, beyond the trailer’s flashy action, there’s also a few hints of plot in the trailer as well. It seems that White Rabbit, a character first introduced in the Devil May Cry 3 manga, is the main antagonist of the show, something that was hinted at in previous trailers but not officially revealed. It also seems like the White Rabbit may, at least briefly, be in possession of Dante’s Perfect Amulet, and the trailer also includes a Vergil reveal, which should give Dante plenty to contend with through the show’s eight episode first season.Devil May Cry will arrive on Netflix on April 3.",
