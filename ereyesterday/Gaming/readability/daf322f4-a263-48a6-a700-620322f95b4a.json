Pandas are Coming I mean, don’t get me wrong.  I love the WoW Classic plan and quite enjoyed the time the group spent in both vanilla classic and in Wrath of the Lich King.  But here we are at another five level expansion… a good one, I will grant… certainly a much better one than Cataclysm… and I am wondering if maybe I have ridden out the WoW Classic experience for now. We’re now into an era where the single player campaign is waning, where were into the complexities of when and where flight will be unlocked, and some rep grinds that I am not sure I care do to again.  I mean, that water strider mount was a game killer to the extent that Blizz had to patch in water walking to all mounts just to get us to give it up… but do I care enough to do all that Nate Pagle daily stuff again? We’ll see.  That is almost two months away and I am not feeling like we have to rush right into it.  Blizz will probably keep it running for a year if there is any justice in the world, given how long they kept Cataclysm going.  (I am never going to let that go, how over long they let Cataclysm linger both at its launch and again as a classic title.  It is like there is zero institutional memory at Blizz.) I suppose I should be happy we’re getting it as early as July 21st.  The roadmap from November had the launch possibly as late as autumn and even the later fine print was putting a boundary as late as August 31st. Blizzard WoW Classic 2025 Roadmap Anyway, as I was saying, it will probably run for at least a year and has a good six months worth of content unless you want to get on the rep grind treadmill and that island of whatever where you collected tokens daily, so we don’t have to rush in on day one.  We could let it settle down. Also, didn’t they just have a Pandaria Remix in retail not too long ago?  Have they worn out the pandas ahead of time? I know, I am one to talk about shaming old content given that I gave up Azeroth for Middle-earth.  But at least in LOTRO the 15 year old content I am playing through is stuff I am seeing for the first time. Of course, Blizz has a whole bunch of deals to get you ready for Pandaria.  Must monetize the experience.  Level boosts, server transfers, and all the services are being pushed. And if you haven’t leveled through Cataclysm yet, they turned the Joyous Journeys xp buff on again.  One wonders why they bothered turning it off this year, but I guess it isn’t special if it is just there all the time. Anyway, pandas are coming.  The pre-patch is July 1st and the expansion is July 21st.
