  "text": "SummarySwarm-based combat encounters, hundreds of Bugs on screen at a time, base building, and frenetic online 16-player online co-op FPS action.New single-player mode with original Starship Troopers actor Casper Van Dien.Liberate the galaxy with fellow Troopers in online Galactic Front campaigns with exclusive rewards. Fight for the United Citizen Federation in Starship Troopers: Extermination, a 16-player online co-op FPS set in the universe of the 1997 cult classic film Starship Troopers. As a member of the Deep Space Vanguard, it’s your duty to defend the Federation’s planets from Bug incursions by establishing bases and battling swarms together with your fellow Troopers. With the game’s launch on Xbox Series X|S, we’re thrilled to reveal two new ways to crush Bugs: by rubbing shoulders with a Starship Troopers legend in single-player, and together with many more Troopers in online campaigns. Welcome to the Special Operations Group The Special Operations Group (S.O.G.) is a boot camp designed to introduce core mechanics like Bugs, resources, base building, and this expansive universe to new Troopers in a thrilling and engaging way. The single-player campaign features 25 missions starring the hero of planet P himself, General Johnny Rico — a role reprised by Casper Van Dien from the original Starship Troopers film. The first chapter of the S.O.G. — ‘Answering the Call’ — has you following General Rico’s orders through a gauntlet of underground missions, winding down the infested tunnels and caves of Valaka that lead to an Arachnid hive. Three original characters form the rest of your squad and will help you learn more about the importance of combat roles. Jackson “Moose” Callahan is a Demolisher, a master of explosives who believes force can be overcome with greater force. Taral “Scorch” Ashcroft is a Ranger, nimble and effective in close-range combat. Rounding it out, Olivia “Jensen” Jensen is a quick-thinking Medic who’s always got her fellow Troopers’ backs. More chapters will be released in the future, so even if you’re a veteran Trooper, you’ll want to stick around to see what happens next! Storm the Galactic Front Remember the mission: everyone fights, no one quits! There’s a wider galaxy waiting for you in the Galactic Front, a brand-new online campaign where many players can work together to overcome threats too big for your usual Trooper squads. Join a Company of players and enlist in Company Operations, where you can work together to achieve collective goals. The first Galactic Front revolves around Boreas, a newly discovered ice planet in an unexplored system. It’s rich in resources that could turn the tide against the Bugs, so make sure you beat the Bugs to it. Unique rewards await, including special cosmetics, and your actions may impact the ongoing story of Starship Troopers: Extermination. Check back often for new phases of the Galactic Front, and make sure you’re doing your part in this galactic struggle! Come on Trooper, you wanna live forever? Starship Troopers: Extermination is now available on Xbox Series X|S.",
