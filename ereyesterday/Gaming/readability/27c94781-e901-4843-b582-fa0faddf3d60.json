The feature will be available this holiday on the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, where players will see their aggregated gaming library within the new Xbox full screen experience. With this new feature, your Xbox library, hundreds of Game Pass titles (membership required), and all your installed games from other PC game stores are always at your fingertips. An Aggregated Gaming Library to Launch YourGames With the aggregated gaming library, players can conveniently launch games from Xbox, Game Pass, Battle.net and other leading PC storefronts from a single library within the Xbox PC app. Whether you’re on a Windows PC or a handheld device, your Xbox library, hundreds of Game Pass titles, and all your installed games from leading PC storefronts will now be at your fingertips.  When a player installs a game from a supported PC storefront, it will automatically appear in “My library” within the Xbox PC app, as well as the “Most recent” list of titles in the sidebar—making it easier than ever to jump back into your games. And this is just the beginning. We’ll continue rolling out support for additional PC storefronts over time. How to Get Started As long as you have game titles installed from supported PC stores, you should see them listed in both My Library as well as the Most Recent section. If you’d prefer not to see those titles listed you can select your profile picture, then select Settings, then Library \u0026 Extensions and you will see the available storefronts, then select “Hide” for each storefront and those titles will no longer appear.
