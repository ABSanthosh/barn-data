  "text": "SummaryHuge update comes to Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders today.New Trick Mode and the return of the beloved Free Ride Mode.Wide range of new accessibility features. After opening the skiing season of the Lonely Mountains in January with Xbox Game Pass, more than one million riders have already hit the snowy slopes. But our team from Megagon Industries isn’t done yet. Our newest Freestyle update released today not only introduces two new game modes with more than 100 new challenges to the game but also several accessibility improvements. Check out what’s in store. Overcome new challenges in the new Trick Mode! Ride in style, ramp up points, and pull off as many awesome flips, spins and grabs as you can on your way down the slopes. To achieve the highest score, you need to look at the mountains from a fresh perspective. Your best speedrunning strategy might not be the best route to jump to the top of the leaderboard. The new update also brings back the belovedFree Ride Mode from Lonely Mountains: Downhill to the snowy peaks of Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders. Free Ride is the ultimate challenge to all speedrunners. Not limited by any checkpoints you can freely explore the mountains and hunt for the ultimate path down to the finish line. However, be cautious, as no checkpoints also means that every crash will send you back to the start. Both modes come with full leaderboard support and new achievements. The update also addresses one of the loudest asks from the community, as you can now reach the highest player level without the need to participate in multiplayer matches. In addition to the new game modes, we’re also adding a wide range of accessibility features! You can now turn on auto-break or or auto-accelerate allowing you to play the game with only one trigger. Break, accelerate or crouch can now also be set to toggle instead of the need to hold the buttons allowing you to play the game without the need to hold a button constantly over time. You can now individually map the buttons and keyboard keys to your own liking. You can now play with mouse and keyboard combined. We hope that the new Freestyle update will allow a much wider audience to enjoy the game and experience the Lonely Mountains. We wish you all a great time with the new additions, and the whole team is looking forward to watching your best trick videos and crazy free-ride speedruns! Daniel \u0026 The Megagons Megagon Industries $24.99 $19.99 PC Game Pass Xbox Game Pass Take a deep breath, count to three, and… go! Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is a game about skiing down gorgeous mountain vistas. Slice through deep snow, skitter over ice lakes, and leap into the air in spectacular jumps, all surrounded by a variety of breathtaking landscapes. Play solo or race together! Snow Riders also adds a brand new feature to the Lonely Mountains world – online multiplayer! Work your way down the mountain as a team in co-op, adding save points as you go, or compete in a breakneck race to the base in versus mode. Available for 2-8 players. Fancy a challenge? Perform daredevil tricks or try to best your time for a spot on the leaderboard. Or you can take the road less travelled, discovering shortcuts as you explore the slope. Unlock new equipment, outfits and tricks as you play! Whether you’re looking for a challenge or a chilled out vacation with friends, Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is the perfect winter getaway.",
