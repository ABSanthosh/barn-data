Welcome to Enshrouded Potshot found out over the course of the week that we were missing an ingredient for the base the skeleton is supposed to stand upon.  We needed to unlock the ectoplasm block to build the base, and that was hidden away in the Nomad Highlands Hollow Halls. We had been there before, so a return trip seemed reasonable enough.  It was the run where we had to drop down through a hole in the floor a ways in to get into the core of the dungeon.  Lots of fun in that on our first trip. So off we went.  Potshot even laid down a spare flame shrine outside the place so Ula and I just had to fast travel and we were at the door.  Potshot had the key, the door was open, in we went. There it was into the thick of things until we arrived at the great hole in the floor, at which point there was little else to do save jump in, fall through, and deploy gliders once it looked safe.  And so we landed in the huge room below… though not the largest room in the dungeon… scattered about and fighting some mobs, but it wasn’t a big deal.  We are all at the current level cap of 35, deep into our specs, and geared up about as well as one can be at this point I imagine.  Mobs here were not a real threat. So we cleared our way and started searching the area because the ectoplasm block was supposed to be in here somewhere.  Starting at the ground and working our way up took a bit, but eventually, after jumping across a wide gap, a gold chest was spotted and opening it up revealed the block. The block discovered Once you discover a block on your server it is added to the list of blocks that can be crafted at the workbench and used to build. Now available at the workbench That done, we poked around a bit, then headed back to base, our mission seeming complete. Potshot had built a new trophy room addition to the back of the main house at our base… he actually hewed it out of the living rock, since the house is up against a sheer cliff face… which, in hindsight, doesn’t seem like a great place to build a house, gravity and all… where he had left a big space for our cyclops skeleton trophy. He went off to make the pedestal for the skeleton while I fetched the pieces.  However, once we put things together, we found we were missing a head. Headless cyclops skeleton Also, the trophy room was a bit too short for the skeleton… so maybe the head missing was okay for the moment. But we were troubled, as we had a variety of cyclops heads stored away… piles of them, really.  But the UI insisted that it wasn’t a head that we needed, but a skull.  That seemed to be splitting hairs for us.  After all, what is a head but the skull with all the extra pieces still attached?  But I guess you wouldn’t put a full T-rex head on a skeleton of the beast at the museum of natural history, so we were not going to be allowed that sort of leeway in our own little exhibit. Skulls for the skull throne. All the other skeletal bits had come from the various cyclops we had run into, so it felt like we must have missed one.  Potshot had one on his map that he hadn’t visited, so we felt that must be the place, so we went, which involved running around, getting split up, gliding, and eventually finding each other before showing up to slay yet another cyclops. There he is, let’s see that skull This cyclops, like the ones before, yielded a head rather than a skull.  We were no closer. So it was time for the internet to help, and it pointed us to a building complex near one of the beacons we had to light to summon the dragon.  It was, however, in kind of an out of the way place, on the far side of the Albaneve Summits.  But it looked like we could go back to the flame shrine we had setup for the dragon fight, glide to, though, and past the dragon’s playground, which has a bunch of rising thermals to help you along, coming out on the far side to glide to our destination. And, it actually worked. Gliding, having made it past the dragon This followed our usual mode, where we didn’t so much have a plan as the concept of a plan that we were discussion until one of us decided to just jump and see what happened.  That, as usual, ended up with us spread all over the drop zone, though at least nobody got hung up on a clock tower like Red Buttons in The Longest Day. We finally regrouped and started going through the complex of buildings, looking for a lab that was said to be the location of the skull… presumably still attached to the rest of a cyclops.  But the buildings and tower said to be the location of the lab didn’t see big enough to house a cyclops. Then we found a lab note. PS. Do you like the new stationary? I mean, that says “cyclops head” and not “cyclops skull,” but it felt like there might be something laying around here that would fit the bill.  So we kept searching, finding a host of hidden treasure chests… I went home with bags full and Potshot got a bow upgrade… until, in the middle of the night, I ended up down a rampart, having jumped another huge gap, to find a room with a big old cyclops skull on the table, highlighted with that “this is a quest objective” glow. Quest items glow red That was the ticket.  It was back to base to put the skull on top of our as yet incomplete cyclops skeleton. Complete skeleton, with ceiling adjustment Our mission for the afternoon accomplished, we fell to some planning as to what comes next.  But that is for another post.",
