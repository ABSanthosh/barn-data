  "text": "Plus new Space Marine 2 DLC and more. Image credit: Owlcat It's been a busy day in the grimdark world of Warhammer 40K, thanks to its latest video game focused Warhammer Skulls showcase. Not only have we learned a couple of classics getting a spruce-up, there's brand-new stuff coming too, including a Boltgun sequel, new tactical RPG Dark Heresy, plus a smattering of fresh DLC. Warhammer 40K: Boltgun 2, which seems as good a place as any to start, is exactly what it sounds like - a follow-up to developer Auroch Digital's acclaimed 2023 retro shooter Boltgun. Details are relatively limited at present, but it'll pick up immediately after the events of the first game, and offer another helping of old-school-inspired FPS action over the course of its branching single-player campaign. There's talk of new locations - \"from the colossal heights of a hive city to the impenetrable mangrove swamps of a jungle\" - plus new weapons and never-before-seen foes, including the ferocious Bloodletters and their daemonic Juggernauts. Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 Teaser Trailer | @BigFanPresents Warhammer 40K Boltgun 2 teaser trailer.Watch on YouTube All that's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC sometime in 2026. However! There's an extra - and more immediate - treat for Boltgun fans in the form of Boltgun: Words of Vengeance. This \"first person typer\" twist on the retro shooter - in which players must deploy their QWERTY skills for maximum carnage - is entirely free and available to download on Steam today. Elsewhere in the gloomy world of Warhammer 40K, developer Owlcat has announced Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy, a \"narrative-driven tactical RPG\" set against the backdrop of the Noctis Aeterna and the mystery of the Tyrant Star. \"Players will lead a warband of diverse companions in a desperate battle against heresy and corruption,\" the studio explains, \"from loyal Imperial subjects, such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catachan, to nefarious xenos, including a bird-like Kroot mercenary.\" Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy | Announcement Trailer Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy announcement trailer.Watch on YouTube There's talk of full voice acting, \"intricate investigations\", turn-based combat, and \"choices that carry grave consequences\", all said to build on the ideas introduced in Owlcat's Rogue Trader. And if that sounds intriguing, Dark Heresy is coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC (via Steam, GOG, and Epic) at some currently undisclosed future point. Speaking of Rogue Trader, Owlcat has also announced a 24th June release date for the game's second expansion, Lex Imperialis. This introduces a faction of \"incorruptible enforcers\" known as the Adeptus Arbites, plus a new companion - Solomorne Anthar - across its 15-hour storyline. Additionally, the studio has revealed it's working on a Season Pass 2 for Rogue Trader, bundling together an appearance customisation pack and two more 15-hour expansions - each featuring new quests and a new companion. The first of these expansions takes players to a Necron vault curated by Trazyn the Infinite, where they'll encounter ancient guardians and uncover relics relating to the Von Valancius legacy. The second new expansion promises a \"descent into madness and mystery\" as they explore a \"surreal\" voidship graveyard.

This \"endless\" PvE mode for the acclaimed shooter unfolds on Kadaku, where three players must survive against ever-more-deadly waves of Tyranid and Chaos as they attempt to defend an Imperial fortress. It'll be playable on Steam via developer Saber Interactive's Public Test Server starting 4th June, and it gets its full release across all platforms as part of a free update on 26th June.
