  "text": "Here's every major sale that's relevant for PC gamers this weekend Image credit: RPS Photo Composite Memorial Day weekend is here and the sales seem to be spilling out even for PC gamers. To be fair, these sales are typically a great time to find a reasonable discount on the latest gaming PCs, laptops, and everything else. While it’s not as dramatic as, say, Black Friday or Prime Day, there are still some proper savings to be had if you know where to look. If you’re looking for the best deals available, I’ve rounded up the biggest Memorial Day sales going for PC gamers, alongside a few handpicked deals that I personally think are worth considering. Dell Amazon HP Lenovo Best Buy Wayfair While RTX 5090s continue to be waaay too expensive, small discounts in sales like this can make it a little easier to swallow if you are looking to spend a lot on your next rig to ensure it’s as future-proof as possible. But, if I might entice you, the RTX 5080 is probably what you’re looking for, as it’s much more affordable—even when buying a full PC—and won’t bankrupt you quite as quickly. Take this Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 7 265F RTX 5080 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB) in the Memorial Day sales at Dell, down to $2,349.99 right now—probably one of the best deals on a gaming PC you can buy at the moment. While I say affordable, it’s still over two grand (yikes). But if it’s a 5080 you want, a 5080 you shall have—and at the best price possible, I should hope. 50 series GPUs are generally in the wild now standalone, but typically, it’s still better to buy a full pre-built PC if you’re looking for value for money and avoid paying inflated prices. HP probably has the best deal on a 5090 setup right now, with its Omen 45L Intel Core Ultra 7 265K RTX 5090 rig for $4,189.99. To configure and get the deal, follow these steps: Click here Select Graphics Card – NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 (+$1,600) Select Chassis – Front Bezel Black Glass and 1200W Power Supply (+$60) Price should show as $4,189.99 shipped (plus tax) But still, let's not get crazy here: $4,000+ PCs aren't exactly the move for the vast majority of us. If you're looking for a complete gaming PC that's not crazy money, I'd suggest considering the HP Omen 35L, featuring AMD Ryzen 5 8500G and an RTX 4070 Super, for $1,349.99 in the sale (down from $1,679.99). So that's pre-builds, and laptops are a bit more expensive, if you want to pay for some kind of warped portability (I won't be taking this on my morning commute, thanks very much), but it's still worth mentioning Dell's new Alienware Area 51 series if you're after a decent 5080 gaming laptop, alongside HP's Omen Max 16 for $2,799.99 as well ($500 off this one). I'm going to round things off by touching on a couple of decent monitor deals, such as the 32\" Alienware AW3225QF 4K 240Hz QD-OLED Gaming Monitor for $899.99 ($300 off the $1,199.99 MSRP), alongside the 32\" Dell S3222DGM QHD 165Hz for $329.99 for those who want a decent monitor but aren't fussed about OLED. Questionable, as OLED is wonderful, but I'm here to offer alternatives all the same.",
