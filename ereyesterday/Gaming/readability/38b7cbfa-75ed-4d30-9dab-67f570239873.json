We’ve got the opportunity to really dive into the Marvel characters here.\"He then showed the film's opening to the assembled audience, showcasing a sequence in which Kraven goes on a human hunt in a prison.

Billed as a roadtrip movie, it will feature Venom and Eddie Brock as fugitives on the run from pursuers from both our world and planets beyond.Tom Hardy was also on hand to continue his farewell tour, saying he \"absolutely loved\" playing Eddie and Venom. \"It’s been seven years doing this.

But while Hardy is likely finished as Venom, he's not ruling out the possibility of one day fighting Spider-Man. \"I want to fight Spider-Man. I want to fight Spider-Man right now. I’m well up for it…. Never say never.\"In the meantime, Sony's symbiote universe is just getting started. In an interview with IGN published earlier this week, Marcel revealed that the villainous Knull won't be Venom's main villain, and that the character is \"just the beginning.\" We'll know soon enough what that entails when Venom releases on October 24.
