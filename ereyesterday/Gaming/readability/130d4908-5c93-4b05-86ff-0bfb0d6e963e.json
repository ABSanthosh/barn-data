CSM18 is coming CCP Arcade posted the following the in the official forums: Last week we became aware of information being posted publicly relating to the upcoming Revenant expansion that was only known to CCP developers or CSM members. Internal Affairs department was made aware of the leak and began their investigation. During the investigation CSM 18 member Alcoholic Satan came forward voluntarily and admitted to being the source of the leak. We believe that the leaking of this information was a genuine mistake, in that he believed the information was already public, and that there was no malicious intent from Alcoholic Satan. No immediate in-game advantage, economical or otherwise, would have been able to be gained from the information leaked. With that being said, we have to uphold the Non-Disclosure Agreements that each CSM member signs. As such, Alcoholic Satan has been removed from CSM 18, his candidacy for CSM 19 is being removed and all his accounts will be banned for 60 days. His eligibility to run in future CSM elections will be at the discretion of CCP. Alcoholic Satan was informed about this decision yesterday and as a token of recognition for the hard work he has put into the CSM we wanted to give him the opportunity to make a statement himself before we made the information public. Voting for CSM 19 will begin on Thursday 17 October. It has been a while since we have had a CSM issue like this.  There is often somebody who steps down or gets kicked or, as happened earlier this year, goes to work for CCP. The tale is that when doing an open house talk with his alliance he shared too much of what he knew about some aspects of the upcoming Revenant expansion, the lines being a bit blurry about what he thought was already public knowledge.  What he shared began to make the rounds and when CCP opened up the investigation he admitted he was the source.  That there had to be an investigation meant CCP needed to act. He may be able to run again at a future date, but for now his account has been banned for 60 days and he will be removed from the CSM19 ballot when it goes live on Thursday.
