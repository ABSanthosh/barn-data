For a limited time, Amazon has dropped the price on the Crucial T500 2TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe solid state drive to just $124.99 with free shipping. The Crucial T500 is one of the top performing PCIe 4.0 SSDs on the market. Besides its high transfer speeds, this SSD has onboard DRAM (rare at this price point) and includes a pre-installed heatsink, making it an excellent drop-in ready solution for your PlayStation 5 console.2TB Crucial T500 SSD (PS5 Compatible) for $124.99Crucial T500 2TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 SSD with HeatsinkThe T500 is Crucial's premium PCIe 4.0 solid state drive and is equipped with a Phison E25 controller with 232-layer Micron TLC NAND flash memory. It has proven to be one of the fastest SSDs on the market with sequential speeds of 7,300/6,800MB/s and random speeds of 1.15M/1.44M IOPs. It's on par with other top-tier SSDs like the WD Black SN850X, the Samsung 990 Pro, and the SK Hynix P41 Platinum and it's currently the least expensive of the bunch. The Crucial T500 also has a dedicated LDDR4 DRAM cache. Pretty much every other SSD at this price point is DRAM-less and rely on HMB, or system memory, as a less expensive alternative. Crucial backs this SSD with a 5-year warranty.The Crucial T500 makes for an excellent replacement SSD for your PlayStation 5 console. It fulfills all of Sony's requirements, like a minimum read speed of 5,500MB/s and a PCI-Express Gen4x4 interface. A robust aluminum heatsink is also already pre-installed, so you don't need to spend time and money installing one yourself.The best PS5 SSDs you can buy in 2025Over the past few console generations with built-in storage, gamers were typically stuck with however much storage that came with the console. With the PS5, Sony made a surprising move by including an internal M.2 PCIe slot to install an off-the-shelf SSD to supplement the internal storage. Given that this is the same company that paired the PS Vita and PSP with ludicrously expensive memory cards, this was a welcoming change of pace, especially given the paltry 825GB of storage you have to work with. Now, you can install high-end PC SSDs like the Corsair MP600 Pro LPX, our number one pick, to load even more games nearly as fast as the extra-special drive that's built into the console itself.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
