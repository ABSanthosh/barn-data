  "text": "Mudang: Two Hearts – coming to Xbox Series X|S and Xbox on PC as an Xbox Play Anywhere title in 2026 – is a narrative-driven, third-person action adventure game that blends cinematic storytelling with immersive stealth and dynamic combat set on a politically volatile Korean peninsula. Built on our state-of-the-art performance capture pipeline, it integrates fluid motion-matched animations, open-ended level design, dynamic spatial audio, and intelligent AI— woven seamlessly to deliver a harrowing journey through a fractured future Korea. This isn’t a story of triumph or glory — it’s a search for truth. You will be challenged to uncover that truth for yourself as you confront engineered emotions, falsified information, and manipulated beliefs throughout the story. When even your rage and innermost beliefs may have been carefully shaped by unseen hands, truth becomes your only weapon. Someone Is Using Your Rage The world celebrated as the two Koreas signed a historic reunification treaty, promising to end decades of division and bring lasting peace to the peninsula. But beneath the surface, darker forces stirred. On the day the pivotal bill was set to pass, a mysterious terrorist group attacked the South Korean National Assembly, drenching the symbol of peace in blood. Chaos erupted across the peninsula. Ji Jeongtae is a North Korean special forces operative dispatched to the South under the terms of the new peace accord. Neither friend nor foe, Jeongtae quickly finds himself isolated within his new unit. As suspicion festers, he is tasked with putting an end to a string of bloody terrorist attacks that have been driving civilians into uncontrollable rage. As his pursuit of a terrorist group calling themselves Beolmuban hits a dead end, he manages to catch a glimpse of the faceless power lurking in the shadows. Eight months have passed since the last attack, but the fear hasn’t gone away. The South Korean military declares martial law, restoring order at the cost of constant surveillance. As the public adjusts to this uneasy calm, a K-pop group named ORDO announces the first state-sanctioned concert under martial law. Now part of the newly formed Martial Law Command, Jeongtae is assigned to security detail for the event. When Beolmuban suddenly storms the stage, Jeongtae is thrown into familiar chaos — and uncovers a dangerous secret involving GAVI, ORDO’s brightest star. Strategy Before Instinct In Mudang you can choose between stealth, CQC (close-quarters combat), or all-out aggression at any moment. No matter the approach, the game offers a wealth of options: environmental takedowns, a wide range of CQC moves — both lethal and nonlethal — a robust toolkit of gadgets like goggles, EMPs, grenades, lures, and mines, and a deep arsenal of firearms to round it all out. But without the right strategy, you can quickly become overwhelmed by the enemy’s response. Our enemy AI was built from the ground up with versatility in mind, dynamically adapting to your actions in real time. While you remain hidden, enemies form search parties, investigate suspicious signs — like fallen allies, disabled lights, or even nearby footsteps — and raise the alarm when something’s off. In combat, they coordinate to flank and outmaneuver you and use every gadget, CQC move, and weapon that you can use as well. To stay ahead, you’ll need to adapt and experiment. Our open-ended level design supports that experimentation, offering multiple routes and vantage points: hide in the shadows, hang from pipes, slip through vents, climb buildings, or destroy parts of the environment to set up ambushes. Put together, Mudang’s unique blend of stealth and action creates a steady ebb and flow in every battle, with close-quarters combat inspired by real Korean Special Forces tactics grounding each encounter in visceral, tactical realism. Two Playable Characters, Two Perspectives You’ll take on the roles of two protagonists from seemingly opposite walks of life. As the story progresses, you switch between them at key moments and experience the narrative from their distinct perspectives. Ji Jeongtae: An elite special forces operative who shines on the battlefield. He uses his military training and equipment to fight his way through enemy forces in pursuit of the truth. GAVI: A famous K-pop star who shines on stage. Living under constant surveillance, she longs to reclaim control over her life. Though she’s never handled a weapon, she plays a pivotal role in uncovering the truth. The use of dual protagonists allowed us to build two contrasting gameplay experiences — and two distinct narrative threads that converge to reveal a single truth. Reflecting Emotional Momentum In Gameplay Missions in Mudang aren’t built on repeating gameplay loops. Instead, it evolves alongside the narrative, reflecting each character’s emotional stakes at every turn. From infiltration and reconnaissance to rescue and pursuit, every sequence is crafted to draw you into the moment, letting you feel as though you’re living the events as they unfold. No Borders Between Cutscene and Gameplay Mudang’s cutscenes are rendered in real time using in-game assets, allowing for seamless transitions between story and gameplay. Characters move naturally in and out of scripted moments without jarring cuts or loading screens, keeping you immersed in the moment and maintaining the emotional throughline without interruption. Capturing Emotion In a narrative-driven game like Mudang, our characters needed to feel real, not just in cutscenes, but in every moment of gameplay. With Korean film and TV actors lending their talents, we used cutting-edge volumetric and motion capture technologies to bring every subtle glance, delicate gesture, and nuanced expression to life within the game. Mudang: Two Hearts is set to arrive in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S and Xbox PC as an Xbox Play Anywhere title. And while the wait may feel long, the world we’re building demands time, care, and precision. Every scene, every emotion, every choice is being crafted to deliver a story that lingers — one that stays with you long after the screen fades to black. Follow the game’s YouTube channel and EVR Studio’s official website to learn more. In a unified Korea, masked terrorists strike at the heart of Seoul. Ji Jeongtae, a soldier sent in to stop the attacks, stumbles upon a K-Pop star named Gavi at the center of the unfolding crisis. As their stories intertwine, a chilling truth begins to take shape.",
