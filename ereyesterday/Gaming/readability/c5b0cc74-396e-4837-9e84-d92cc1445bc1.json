  "text": "Image credit: Eurogamer/Nintendo Industrious Switch fans have started compiling a fan-made list that tracks which Switch 1 games have seen an improvement - or a decline - in performance when running on their new Nintendo Switch 2 consoles. So far, over 350 games have been submitted and over 150 of them comprehensively categorised, recording what performance changes players have identified, regardless of whether or not there has been a formal patch or update deployed by the publisher.

However, the thread \"isn't meant to decide whether a game is worth buying (now) for you\", but is \"purely informational\". If you'd like to join the effort, head on over to Reddit. Nintendo recently revealed it has sold 3.5m Switch 2 consoles in its first four days on sale, becoming the fastest-selling piece of Nintendo hardware. It also provided a solution to an issue causing the Switch 2's battery indicator to display incorrectly.",
