Minigames include condensed versions of some classic Party Modes alongside wild challenges like the Dance Off, tasking Operators to get down and funky in the designated dance zones, as well as Musical Zones later in the season, featuring multiple capture points that dwindle down to a final location when the music stops.

Abomination Challenge (LTM) During Beavis and Butt-Head Event Summon Mo by opening the doors to the Aether Church. Then defeat Mo. Mo has some unique abilities as an Abomination HVT. He will gain resistance, then immunity, to a weapon repeatedly used on him. Mo’s charge attack also holds a secret. Available: Flow Mode, Cel-Shaded Map Restricted: Quests, Easter Eggs, Exit Strategy (GobbleGum) Available Maps: Liberty Falls Enter a cel-shaded version of Liberty Falls in this chaotic and seriously challenging Limited Time Mode! Your match begins with a baseline of classic RBZ: Available for crews of one to four players versus Zombies The match ends when all players are eliminated Mystery Boxes can contain Wonder Weapons Takes place on the entirety of the Liberty Falls map However, there’s a twist. Or in this case, a vicious, drooling red-mouthed Abomination called Mo. This HVT is in a permanent state of fury, summoned from the Dark Aether when the Church is opened. Your main and overriding goal is: Defeat Mo, the HVT Abomination Exfil is disabled until the HVT is defeated Additional Modifiers Modified Features: Expect a variety of Snacks and enemy-based modifiers as you desperately try to gain the upper hand against the undead onslaught: Rounds turn faster (expect Cranked or Rampage Inducer rates of enemy spawning) Additional enemies are added to Liberty Falls including: Amalgams Doppelghasts Elder Disciples Shock Mimics Toxic Zombies Additional Features: The Abomination Challenge LTM utilizes a modified version of the “Zombies Snacks” ruleset for Health—meaning you need to secure Snacks dropped as ground loot to increase your Health once you’ve taken damage—though players do not lose energy by moving.

Disabled Features: The following gameplay features are disabled in this Mode: Save and Quit Main Quest Easter Eggs Rampage Inducer Exit Strategy (GobbleGum) Idle Eyes (GobbleGum) Mo Problems Mo the HVT Abomination is a force to be reckoned with. He has an extremely mean disposition, inflicts the maximum damage at all times, has an impressive constitution, loves to sprint at foes as often as possible, doesn’t like the taste of equipment, and it’s said he headbutts you with such force that your Perks are knocked out of you, landing on the ground. Which begs the question: How exactly do you mow Mo down? Rewards: 15,000 XP, A Hidden Power GobbleGum, and a special Calling Card for completing the Abomination Challenge. Starting Room (LTM) Available In-Season “Locked in. How long can you last?” Starting Room locks all the doors confining you to the start area of the map.

Survive to the highest round you can and die trying! Additional Modifiers Classic Features: The classic Round-Based Zombies baseline rules are in effect: Available for crews of one to four players versus zombies The match ends when all players are eliminated Modified Features: There are various modifications within a Starting Room match: If the power in the map was off during a normal match, it is already switched to “on”. If a machine or feature, like a Perk Machine, Pack-A-Punch and/or Der Wunderfizz (at Round 25) are in the starting zone, they will appear. If not, they aren’t available. Fire Sale Power-up no longer drops randomly from fallen zombies. Random Perk Power-up has been added to randomly drop from fallen zombies. Door Buys and Exfil are disabled. There’s no way out!

Activate the Search \u0026 Destroy Contract to task your squad by planting a bomb on a Buy Station. Defend the site while the bomb timer ticks, as other squads can attempt to defuse the bomb, earning a Fire Sale discount from Buy Stations if successful. New Gameplay Content The more resources at your disposal, the better. Gear up faster with assistance from the new Loot Master Perk. New Perk: Loot Master Resurgence, Plunder Get more loot from supply caches. Simple and very effective. Found as ground loot in Resurgence and Plunder. This spawns additional items and gives a higher chance to find Tacticals and Lethals, cash, Field Upgrades, Killstreaks, and other high-tier gear. Cel-Shaded Rebirth Island Not to be outdone by Multiplayer’s cel-shaded playlists launching in the mid-season, Call of Duty: Warzone is joining in on the fun with a cel-shaded variant of Rebirth Island arriving later in the season. Group up in a Quad and start slaying. New Modes New LTM: Havoc Royale 44 Players (Quads), 15-minute matches Change up the normal gameplay flow with modifiers that disturb the fabric of reality. Havoc Royale drops Operators into specific areas of Verdansk—Downtown, Airport, or Train Station—with their Loadout in hand. These modifiers can affect the player, environment, or the gameplay rules with origins in the Modern Warfare® II and III Havoc modes but bringing the high-stakes environment and gameplay from Call of Duty: Warzone. Adapt and survive through it all to claim victory as the last team standing! Buy Stations: These have been adjusted to sell the following items (Havoc Royale Mode only): Squad Buyback Armor Plate Gasmask Door Barricade Munitions Box Redeploy Drone Hand Cannon UAV Within the six diminishing circle collapses, expect a modifier as each new gas zone coalesces on the map. Only one modifier will be active at a time, with one of two modifiers occurring towards the end of a match (known as “Finale Modifiers”), and each occurs randomly from the following selection: Charge Jump: Perform super-human leaps and reach previously unimaginable distances. Holding your button before a Charge Jump provides higher leaping and your velocity dictates how horizontal your jump will be. Cranked: Outlines of enemy players periodically flash red, Operators have a HUD indicating where foes are nearby, as well as Tracker footsteps, and quicker weapon switching, armor plate insertions, and reloads. There’s also a timer on the screen. When it reaches zero, the Operator explodes. Open a cache to increase your time. Defeat an enemy to fully refresh the timer. Crouch Potato: When crouched, Operators transform into a sack of potatoes. Movement and jumping are still possible, and health as well as armor slowly regenerates while crouched, which only stops if the Operator is struck by enemy fire. Eye See You: All Operators always have an Advanced UAV active for them, as well as googly eyes. Melon Heads: Operators appear with watermelon heads, with an impressive watermelon-based explosion if hit. Damage to the body is reduced. Damage to heads is multiplied. Make it Rain: More ammo and cash become available, to such an extent that it isn’t likely you’ll need to reload, as bullets are removed from your reserves rather than your chamber or magazine. Fire Sale also activates. Unregulated Airspace: The airspace is no longer overcrowded, allowing for more Killstreaks to be used at the same time. Expect more of them to be available as ground loot. Showdown (Finale Modifier): All Operators are given an identical Loadout. Nearby weapons are removed. Rising Gas (Finale Modifier): Operators are warned that gas will be rising vertically throughout the combat zone, forcing you to ascend to higher ground. Fortunately, you’re more likely to obtain Gas Masks and Personal Redeploy Drones (Havoc Royale Mode only) during this modifier’s lifespan. Drop in, loot up, and prepare to cause havoc across Verdansk! Resurgence Casual 44 Players, Players \u0026 Bots The Casual experience comes to Resurgence in the mid-season, mixing humans and bots in a fight to the finish. The main Resurgence ruleset applies, so do what it takes to stay alive and keep your squad redeploying. Drop in to warm up, teach a new player about the game, or just for a more relaxed Resurgence experience. As with Battle Royale Casual or Call of Duty: Warzone Bootcamp, game progression is limited in this mode and results will not count towards or against your stats. This mode also doesn’t count towards your eligibility for Resurgence Ranked Play. Ranked Play: Resurgence Trios, Rebirth Island Squad up in trios and compete for top placement with the return of Resurgence Ranked Play. Use your knowledge of Rebirth Island and face off against Call of Duty: Warzone’s top-performing players, using every advantage you can over the competing trios. For a list of rewards, check out the Season 04 Announcement blog here. World Series of Warzone: Qualifier Broadcasts Trios, Verdansk World Series of Warzone™ 2025 is finally here, challenging Trios around the globe to compete where it all began as teams drop into Verdansk for a chance at their share of the $1M prize pool.  Expansion Regions (Not Broadcast): Qualifying trios from APAC, LATAM North and LATAM South will head to the Global Final later this year! The top eight performing Trios from these areas will secure their placement at the WSOW Global Final. EMEA \u0026 NA Qualifier Broadcasts: Tune in this July to the EMEA and NA qualifier broadcasts, as follows: July 22 – NA Lower Round 2 (Eliminations Finals) July 23 – EMEA Lower Round 2 (Elimination Finals) July 29 – NA Regional Final July 30 – EMEA Regional Final The Regional Finals will decide the majority of the qualifying Trios for the Global Final, with 21 WSOW Global Final Trio spots open in each region. Catch all the action at Twitch.tv/callofduty. Call of Duty: Warzone Solo Playlist Update At the start of Season 04, we launched a new playlist test by introducing Battle Royale Casual Solos. This was driven by the overwhelming success of Battle Royale Casual Quads, introduced in Season 03, which quickly became one of the most popular modes in Call of Duty: Warzone. We are always reviewing engagement data to make sure we're continuing to deliver optimal gameplay experiences to as many players as possible. Over time, the data has shown that standard Solos has underperformed compared to other playlist options. This trend has become even more pronounced following the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, with standard Solos consistently ranking at the bottom across over 20 available playlist options. In an effort to solve this, we introduced a “Casual” version of Solos where players face off against a pool of real players in combination with a fixed number of bots, creating a lighter, more welcoming experience. Given the success of the Casual Quads format, we felt that Casual Solos could offer a more approachable way to play Solos—especially for returning or brand-new players jumping into Call of Duty: Warzone. To accurately test the appeal of Casual Solos, we removed standard Solos from the live playlist. This allowed us to isolate and better evaluate the impact of Casual Solos without overlapping between the two modes. Here’s what we’ve learned so far: Three times more players jumped into Casual Solos compared to standard Solos Queue times, ping stability, and other matchmaking metrics saw notable improvements The mode was popular with both existing and returning players This test not only gave us deeper insight into the viability of a Casual Solos experience but also reaffirmed existing data around the low engagement of standard Solos. The results show that Casual Solos fills a gap in our playlist that many players are interested in. The next step in our test—which launches today—is to make both modes available to further observe player preference. This side-by-side test is an important part of our ongoing effort to refine our playlist experience. We’ll share more results from this test at a later date. While we want players to have the freedom to choose the experience that’s most enjoyable for them, it’s vital that we maintain a healthy and balanced ecosystem for our players. Thank you to everyone who jumped into Casual Solos thus far. Your continued feedback and playtime are part of what helps shape the future of Call of Duty: Warzone.  As always, have fun and keep that feedback coming!

This was driven by the overwhelming success of Battle Royale Casual Quads, introduced in Season 03, which quickly became one of the most popular modes in \u003ci\u003eCall of Duty: Warzone\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are always reviewing engagement data to make sure we\u0026#39;re continuing to deliver optimal gameplay experiences to as many players as possible. Over time, the data has shown that standard Solos has underperformed compared to other playlist options. This trend has become even more pronounced following the launch of \u003ci\u003eCall of Duty: Black Ops 6\u003c/i\u003e, with standard Solos consistently ranking at the bottom across over 20 available playlist options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn an effort to solve this, we introduced a “Casual” version of Solos where players face off against a pool of real players in combination with a fixed number of bots, creating a lighter, more welcoming experience. Given the success of the Casual Quads format, we felt that Casual Solos could offer a more approachable way to play Solos—especially for returning or brand-new players jumping into \u003ci\u003eCall of Duty: Warzone\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo accurately test the appeal of Casual Solos, we removed standard Solos from the live playlist.

The results show that Casual Solos fills a gap in our playlist that many players are interested in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe next step in our test—which launches today—is to make both modes available to further observe player preference.
