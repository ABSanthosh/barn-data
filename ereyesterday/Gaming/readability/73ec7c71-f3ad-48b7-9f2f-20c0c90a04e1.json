  "description": "So, yeah. One of Tabsâ€™ little-known side hustles would have made him even MORE super popular around the neighborhood but, unfortunately, he had to keep his real identity under wraps. I mean, he wanted to promote it, but his contract with Easter Bunnies Inc. had an airtight NDA. So it was a pretty thankless job, but stillâ€¦highly rewarding. As you can imagine, Easter was a favorite around here. All of us at Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC were always busy during that critical first quarter trying to maximize the companyâ€™s gravy quota, so by Easter we were worn out. Thatâ€™s when Tabs would always decide on his spring goals, and when they were good, it definitely helped set the tone for the rest of the year. ðŸ˜¹ Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 858 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
