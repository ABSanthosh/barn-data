  "text": "A random promo image from Rockstar Games featuring the moon as seen in Grand Theft Auto V has led to a wild theory that, actually, the space orb that controls our tides in that image is really a clue pointing to when the next GTA 6 trailer will drop.Suggested ReadingYou Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total RecallOffEnglishSuggested ReadingLast December, Rockstar Games finally released the first official trailer for the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6. The trailer quickly racked up millions of views and fans dug through it over and over, trying to pull out as much info as possible. One fan even, seemingly, figured out an NPC’s sunscreen SPF level. Weird stuff, but not uncommon for this theory-loving fandom. And now, because of a moon in a screenshot, GTA superfans are convinced that on November 22, we’ll either get the next trailer or an announcement from Rockstar of when to expect.On November 1, Rockstar Games provided an update on GTA Online’s next major patch, which is set to arrive in December. The tweet contained a screenshot of someone sitting on a car and looking at a building at night. And in the sky above is the moon. Seems like a fairly mundane, boring image. But one fan on Reddit pointed out that the moon seen in the screenshot was in its waning gibbous phase. After some additional research, the community decided that on November 22, something will (probably) happen. What exactly are they predicting? Well, that remains to be seen, with some suggesting a new trailer, others a release date announcement, and others a teaser for a future trailer. This whole moon theory popped up not long after the tweet was published, but has continued to pick up support and momentum online as we get closer and closer to November 22. At first, this was a fringe theory, but now it’s all GTA fans can talk about at the moment. I even saw one popular account suggest that, because the first trailer contained a Tom Petty song off the album “Full Moon Fever,” this moon theory was more plausible. Here’s the wild part: This isn’t the first time the Rockstar community has tried to predict the future using the phases of the moon as seen in a tweet. Last year, fans did the same thing, and guess what... they ended up being right in the end! Two months before the first GTA 6 trailer was announced, Rockstar shared an image with the moon in it, with the phase pictured arriving on December 1. And weeks later, on December 1, Rockstar teased the December 5 release date for the first GTA 6 trailer. Hmmmm. Grand Theft Auto 6 arrives in Fall 2025 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And, if all this is to be believed, we might be only a few days away from a new trailer for the highly anticipated open-world game. .",
