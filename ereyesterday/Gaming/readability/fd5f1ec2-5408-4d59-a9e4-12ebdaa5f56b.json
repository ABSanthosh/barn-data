  "text": "Each week on Polygon, we round up the most notable new releases to streaming and VOD, highlighting the biggest and best new movies for you to watch at home.The National Geographic documentary Jaws @ 50, which shows how the first summer blockbuster was made and explores its legacy, swims onto Disney Plus this weekend. You can also just embrace the silliness of the genre Jaws established with Hot Spring Shark Attack, where an ancient shark attacks a new tourist attraction. Cobra Kai may have wrapped, but you can still see Ralph Macchio’s Daniel LaRusso alongside Jackie Chan in Karate Kid: Legends. David Cronenberg fans can find the horror legend’s latest film, The Shrouds, on The Criterion Channel, while Wes Anderson’s The Phoenician Scheme is available to rent.Here’s everything new that’s available to watch on streaming this weekend!New on NetflixBrickGenre: ThrillerRun time: 1h 40mDirector: Philip KochCast: Matthias Schweighöfer, Ruby O. Fee, Frederick LauA couple is about to call it quits when they discover that their apartment building has been surrounded by a seemingly impenetrable brick wall. Working with the building’s other residents, they try to figure out why their lives have turned into a twisted escape room and how they can get out alive.ZiamGenre: HorrorRun time: 1h 36mDirector: Kulp KaljareukCast: Mark Prin, Nychaa Nuttanicha, Vayla WanvaylaA criminal enforcer and Muay Thai fighter plans to quit his job to pursue a safer line of work. But when the hospital where his girlfriend works as a doctor becomes the center of a zombie outbreak, he’ll have to kick his way through police and the walking dead to save her.New on The Criterion ChannelThe ShroudsGenre: HorrorRun time: 2hDirector: David CronenbergCast: Vincent Cassel, Diane Kruger, Guy PearceThe latest conspiracy film from body-horror master David Cronenberg follows an entrepreneur and widower (Vincent Cassel) who has invented a device called a shroud, which allows mourners to watch their loved ones decay in their graves. Vandalism and strange growths on his wife’s corpse lead him to investigate who might be trying to get their hands on his technology.New on Disney PlusJaws @ 50Genre: DocumentaryRun time: 1h 28mDirector: Laurent BouzereauThe release of Jaws in 1975 transformed the movie industry and perceptions of sharks. This documentary combines archival footage and interviews with Steven Spielberg and other top filmmakers, including James Cameron, Guillermo del Toro, and George Lucas to reveal the story of how the first summer blockbuster was made, and explore its lasting impact. Zombies 4: Dawn of the VampiresGenre: MusicalRun time: 1h 29mDirector: Paul HoenCast: Milo Manheim, Meg Donnelly, Kylee RussellHumans and all sorts of monsters live in peace in the town of Seabrook. But when car trouble strands alien Addison (Meg Donnelly) and zombie Zed (Milo Manheim) during their summer road trip, they wind up in the middle of a war between Daywalkers and vampires. They’ll have to try to bring the two groups together before the dance-offs get out of hand.New on HBO MaxOpusGenre: ThrillerRun time: 1h 44Director: Mark Anthony GreenCast: Ayo Edebiri, John Malkovich, Juliette LewisFormer GQ editor Mark Anthony Green explores the cult of celebrity in this A24 film, where an enigmatic pop star (John Malkovich) invites a small group of journalists and influencers to hear his new album at his Utah compound. A young writer (Ayo Edebiri of Big Mouth and Inside Out 2) tries to figure out what’s going on with the musician’s strange followers even as everyone else falls under his sway.Opus, though it has some gory images and sudden reversals, is not a surprising film in the least; it’s deeply, but also satisfyingly, predictable. Its similarities to Midsommar, Blink Twice, and The Menu are not necessarily a sign of debut writer-director Mark Anthony Green borrowing too heavily from specific peers. To me, they’re a sign of this social-satire subgenre of horror — the one sometimes referred to, with either inverted snobbery or just plain snobbery, as “elevated horror” — settling into its own formulaic groove.New on HuluRiff RaffGenre: Dark comedyRun time: 1h 43mDirector: Dito MontielCast: Jennifer Coolidge, Ed Harris, Gabrielle UnionVincent (Ed Harris), a former criminal, is spending the holidays with his wife and family in a remote cabin, when more family than he was planning for shows up. His estranged son is on the run from gangsters (Bill Murray and Pete Davidson) and have come seeking safety, along with Vincent’s ex-wife (Jennifer Coolidge).New on PeacockDropGenre: ThrillerRun time: 1h 35Director: Christopher LandonCast: Meghann Fahy, Brandon Sklenar, Violett BeaneFirst dates are always stressful, but things get terrifying for Violet (Meghann Fahy of The White Lotus) when hers is interrupted by a series of increasingly threatening phone messages. Someone is watching her every move, and is willing to break into her home and kill her son to get Violet to murder her date.New on ShudderPushGenre: Horror thrillerRun time: 1h 29mDirector: David Charbonier and Justin Douglas PowellCast: Alicia Sanz, Raúl CastilloThe directors of The Boy Behind the Door combine the horrors of a home invasion and childbirth in Push, where a pregnant realtor is attacked at a showing for a possibly cursed house she’s trying to sell. When the assault sends her into labor, she’ll need to figure out how to escape a twisted killer before giving birth. New to rentBangGenre: Action thrillerRun time: 1h 28mDirector: Wych KaosayanandaCast: Jack Kesy, Tristin Mays, Marie BroennerA notorious hitman has a literal change of heart after his life is saved by a transplant. He wants to make the most of his second chance, but will have to use all his skills and plenty of heavy weaponry to fight for redemption by killing his former gang, who probably should have just let him quietly retire.Everything’s Going to Be GreatGenre: DramaRun time: 1h 35m Director: Jon S. BairdCast: Allison Janney, Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, Bryan CranstonBuddy Smart (Bryan Cranston) is a dreamer who risks everything to move his family across the country to take over a regional theater. Tensions mount between him and his more pragmatic wife (Allison Janney) when the audiences they need fail to manifest, forcing them to move in with her family.Hot Spring Shark AttackGenre: Horror comedyRun time: 1h 10mDirector: Morihito InoueCast: Takuya Fujimura, Daniel Aguilar, Shôichirô AkaboshiIn a particularly absurd spin on Jaws, the residents of a small town in Japan have to band together to fight an ancient shark that’s preying on visitors to the local hot spring ahead of the opening of a new spa meant to bring in tourists. The shark’s ability to fit into tight spaces means no one is safe.Karate Kid: LegendsGenre: Family dramaRun time: 1h 34Director: Jonathan EntwistleCast: Jackie Chan, Ben Wang, Joshua JacksonA continuation of the Karate Kid franchise and Cobra Kai, this movie features Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) and Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) teaming up to train a new martial arts prodigy to become a karate champion.

He teams up with her and an entomologist tutor (Michael Cera) to try to swindle his own investors (including Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeffrey Wright) in the hopes that God (Bill Murray) will judge him kindly.SovereignGenre: Crime thrillerRun time: 1h 40Director: Christian SwegalCast: Nick Offerman, Jacob Tremblay, Dennis QuaidInspired by real events, Sovereign follows Jerry Kane (Nick Offerman), who travels around the country with his son (Joe Kane) teaching people who feel they’ve been left behind by institutions about the Sovereign Citizen movement.
