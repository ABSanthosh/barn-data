  "text": "It is the time of year where Daybreak warms up for the expansion season for its three key expansion driven fantasy MMORPGs, EverQuest, EverQuest II, and Lord of the Rings Online. Yes, Dungeons \u0026 Dragons Online is out there as well… but it isn’t really expansion driven the way those other three are. We are at the point where the pre-orders are up, betas are under way, and pre-expansion events, such that they are, will be going.  So I will sum up the three coming expansions in the age before beauty ordering that seems to apply… once again leaving EverQuest II as the middle child. EverQuest – The Outer Brood Slated for a December launch, The Outer Brood , which will be the 31st expansion for the game. The Outer Brood is coming The pitch for the expansion is as follows: High in the sky over the hills of the long-ignored Hodstock looms a massive behemoth. A creature so large that it appears to have an entire castle fortress on its back. Terrifying monsters fly down from that fortress. Huge reptiles with massive, deadly claws, fangs, and too many limbs. These beasts wield magic never seen on Norrath nor by any Norrathian. These creatures, dubbed the Outer Brood by the elders of the Circle of the Crystalwing, speak a form of Elder Dragon that even the oldest of dragons barely understand. At first, they seem to have come to parley with the dragons of Norrath, but conversation quickly turns to contempt, and there seems to be no stopping the battles to come. A horde of powerful creatures prepares to assault Norrath to cleanse the world of what their herald calls “A clear failure to follow scripture.” Norrath has faced assault before, but this time the foe is different. Some farseers have spotted what can only be dragons around the great leviathan as it floats at the top of the sky. Beings so large that few elder Norrathian dragons would stand above their knees! All around the massive leviathan flows a force that defies the understanding of any magic users of Norrath, with power exceeding anything they have seen before. Norrathians of all types, mortal and dragon, have banded together to face this unknown power and attempt to drive them back to wherever they came from. Can you lead the charge against such danger, one that has caused even the fiercest elders of the dragon clans to hesitate? It turns out there was an unexplored area in the between Freeport and Nek Forest.  Who knew?  Cool stuff, and feels convenient as a travel destination, but my brain is also set in a time before the Plane of Knowledge.  Still, how hard could it be to get there?  It is the leviathan that will be the trick I suppose. That laid out, what does that mean we’re going to get from the expansion? 6 Expansion zones – Explore a lost area between Freeport and Nektulos, then fly to a leviathan so large that dragons built a castle on top of it. New Raids, Quests, Collections, and Missions New Spells, Combat Abilities, and AAs New race and class combination: Dark Elf Ranger – For the first time, Dark Elves can be Rangers! Join the hunt and mercilessly stalk your prey as a Dark Elf Ranger. Available on progression servers once The Outer Brood opens. Activated Items Key Ring – A new key ring that accepts most nonexpendable items with activatable effects that are not already part of another key ring. Most of that is pretty standard… but what did Dark Elves do to deserve having the ranger class inflicted upon them?  Or is that another 1999 point of view?  Do rangers no longer suck? And, of course, there is the pricing, which follows the now standard for tiers: Standard Edition – $35 Collector’s Edition – $70 Premium Edition – $140 Family and Friends – $250 As always, the crazy price of the Family and Friends includes additional copies of the expansion that you can turn around and give or sell to people in game. Related: The Outer Brood expansion page The Outer Brood order page EverQuest II – Scars of Destruction I already posted about the Scars of Destruction expansion as part of the previous producer’s letter, but now things are available for purchase. Coming Soon – Scars of Destruction The pitch for this expansion: Dangerous forces have been stirring, eliciting violence and stoking fierce rivalries across Norrath for months. Now, a band of concerned healers and followers of Quellious are closing in on the devious architect. Norrathians, journey to the remnants of Odus’ coastline, scarred by Ulteran magic, and then beyond the unnatural barrier surrounding Western Wastes, on your quest into the vast Dragon Necropolis to upend the machinations of a cunning, scheming, and unscrupulous foe! Artisans and adventurers, heed the call of the Open Hand. They are counting on your significant skill and exceptional experience to survive the deadly journey into the depths of the Sodden Archipelago! Bands of Ulteran magic dance through the air, and the skies roil with storms while the local residents, including kappa and Mandoko, fiercely defend their shrinking lands from the growing legion of Blackhook Raiders. Only then will we have the tools necessary to enter the revered lands raked by Veeshan’s claw – the Western Wastes! Here, she had left her mark, and here her children have lived and died since the Age of Scale. And it is here where we will have to face ageless denizens within the draconic crypts and bone-chewing vermin, as we race against an unnatural army intent on acquiring an arcane item of destructive power from the Dragon Necropolis! Plans will be derailed, repercussions will be felt, years of work will finally come to fruition, and enemies long lost to history will be brought forth, all within the Scars of Destruction! I am less sure where that is taking place… my geography has some holes in it from lapses over the years.  I am also less sure what we’re getting from it given the bullet points the team chose to emphasize. Store your Petamorph wands in the new Petamorph Key Ring! Make your weapons sparkle with new Weapon Auras! Discover new Adventure, Tradeskill, and Signature quests when you return to familiar lands and its new locations! Defeat all new Solo, Heroic, and Raid content, in Places like Blackhook Spiral and the Dragon Necropolis in Western Wastes! I mean, I am sure it is all the usual stuff, new zones, new dungeons, and all that… but, did I miss the explanation of what a Petamorph wand is and why I would have so many that I would need a key ring to hold them?  Probably. Anyway, this 21st expansion for the game is now available for pre-order at the now familiar price points: Standard Edition – $35 Collector’s Edition – $70 Premium Edition – $140 Family and Friends – $250 Once again, that $250 buys you in game versions to give, trade, or sell.  Also, every price level gets you a level 130 boost for your adventure level… but if you want a trade skill boost, you will need to opt for the big package. Related: Scars of Destruction expansion page Scars of Destruction order page LOTRO – Legacy of Morgoth Finally to the beauty end of the “age before beauty” spectrum… at least if we’re not talking about the UI.  Don’t get me started on that. Daybreak seems to have gotten LOTRO pretty solidly onto the annual expansion plan since they quietly purchased them back in late 2016. (The only hint back then was that Daybreak would be providing “publishing services,” though when their social media account became a near mimic of the rest of Daybreak it was a sign.) Anyway, Legacy of Morgoth is the next expansion on the Tolkien path. It is in the appendix somewhere! The pitch for this… we’re starting to get to the hairy edge of what was covered in any but scant reference in the trilogy to which SSG is constrained: Unearth the Secrets of Shagana Venture into the untamed wilds of Near Harad, where ancient secrets lurk beneath sun-scorched sands and treacherous marshlands! Feel the thrill of discovery as you race against time, deciphering cryptic maps and forging unlikely alliances. In this land of hidden perils and breathtaking vistas, your choices will shape the fate of Middle-earth. With courage as your compass, pursue cunning traitors through scorching deserts, petrified forests, and wind-carved canyons. Stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the fierce and enigmatic peoples of this land to prevent against a coming darkness more terrifying than Mordor’s shadow. For in these mysterious lands awaits something that few would have dreamed in their most terrible of nightmares: the Legacy of Morgoth. So we’re headed south from Umbar to Near Harad.  I mean, technically, we might even find the two missing istari mentioned in a footnote somewhere along the line.  Still, I bet the landscapes will be delightful. The bullet points, however, are less than informative: Experience Thrilling New Adventures Explore Untamed Frontiers Uncover Ancient Mysteries Obtain Collectibles with Our New Baubles Journey Farther with Expedition Supplies Exciting Bonus Items in the Ultimate Fan Bundle As with the above two, pre-orders are open, though the SSG team drew the line at having a $250 expansion option, so there are only three levels to which one might aspire, and they have different price points… by five to ten bucks depending on the package.  Being an ultimate fan is ten bucks cheaper than opting for a Norrath premium edition. Standard Edition – $40 Collector’s Edition – $80 Ultimate Fan Bundle – $130 As always, the more expensive the bundle the more cosmetic and consumable goodies you get. But every package gets you a level 150 character boost, which I think is new for LOTRO.  But if the game needs you to be level 150 to get into the new stuff… the good stuff… then you have a serious new play progress issue that is difficult to solve with an over priced and half baked level boost available for an additional cost in the cash shop. One hopes this boost is better than past attempts that left you hanging high and dry with a grossly under powered legendary item. Anyway, we shall see.
