  "text": "Decline’s Drops shows us that you should never, ever mess with a puppet’s beloved garden unless you want to receive an incredible stomping. Globule is a cute puppet in a sun dress and sun hat. Maybe the Hydra saw that and thought it could get away with wrecking her garden. How it missed those giant blue boxing gloves I’ll never know, but no creature in the world will ever forget them once they receive a walloping from Globule. Taking inspiration from platform-based fighters like Super Smash Bros and Rivals of Aether, this game gives its protagonist a ton of impressive aerial juggles and striking moves, sending enemies into the stratosphere with some smooth-animated strikes. As the person doling out the beatings, it’s endless entertaining to see what Globule can string together and the impressive animations on every hit. It’s not just the punches that look good, either. The game is filled with all kinds of wildlife and creature enemies that are vibrant and animated in their attempts to fight back against Globule’s flower-avenging onslaught. Frogs hucking frog-like bombs, chickens with their own boxing skills, flying lizards, and more all try to take you down in cartoonish fashion. Reading it in my words may not make it sound terribly exciting, so this is one of those times when I implore you to watch the video below and see all of this stuff in action. In motion, the creature movements and Globule’s absurd attacks capture this feeling of absurd, over-the-top old Newgrounds videos and games. And that’s not even factoring in all the creativity in the platforming through the levels. With an array of neat themes and traps to rush and fight through, Decline’s Drops is a fantastic package of an action game. Seriously, just go watch the trailer below and get in on this. Decline’s Drops will be made available today on Steam.
