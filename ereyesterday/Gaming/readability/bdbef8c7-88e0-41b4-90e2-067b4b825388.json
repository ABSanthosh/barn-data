  "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Shrimp or crab? Crab, but it can’t be imitation, and it has to be fresh. 2. Yoga or pilates? Both are equally as challenging for this very out-of-shape lady at the moment. LOL! (Been a rough 12 months.) I’ll pick yoga; I could use a good stretch. 3. Something that makes you feel sentimental? When my phone brings up baby photos of Connor or old photos of Tabs before he got sick. My heart swells up every single time. 4. What book are you reading at the moment? Nothing at the moment, boo. I need a good one. Got anything to suggest? I would like something not too heavy or scary. 5. Something you wish you said no to sooner? I wish I would’ve said no to[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 868 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

I would like something not too heavy or scary. 5. Something you wish you said no to sooner? I wish I would’ve said no to almost everyone who asked me out when I was a teenager and in my early 20s. I realize now that when I was that age, I didn’t know how to say no to people when they asked me things which made me uncomfortable, so I often ended up in relationships which I didn’t want to be in. I was very much a people pleaser until recently. Better late than never, I guess. 6. What’s one of the first signs of spring where you live? I know spring’s just around the corner when the white cherry blossoms in my neighborhood bloom. Can’t wait! I love spring much more than I used to when I was younger. I think it’s the sense of rebirth and the world coming to life again. 7. A gadget that you’d like? An air fryer that doesn’t take up a lot of space on my kitchen counter that’s easy to use and not hideous to look at. 8. What liner are you wearing these days? I bought a beautiful bronze pencil from MAC a couple weeks ago, Skip the Waitlist. It’s a twist-up gel liner, aka my favorite thing in the whole wide world.
