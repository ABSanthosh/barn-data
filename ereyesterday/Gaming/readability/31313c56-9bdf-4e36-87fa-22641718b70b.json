What do you need to do the most: rest, get organized or connect with others? All of the above! Right now, the thing I need most is to get organized, though. Since October, I’ve felt like I’ve been pulled along by external forces, and I don’t want to feel like that anymore. I want to feel like I’m in charge of where my life is going, you know? 2. Who would you rather hang out with: Santa Claus, Snoop Dog, the aliens (let’s assume they’re friendly) or Cupid? Santa Claus, of course! He’s my homeboy. Together we make magic happen. 3.

Which would you rather do: visit a haunted house, fly a plane, sing in front of an audience or try rock climbing on actual rocks? Sing in front of an audience because it’s the least terrifying of all the options, ha! 4. Which makeup item would you like to restock: foundation, mascara, eyeliner or concealer? I would LOVE to restock my makeup bag for the new year, so all the things, please. (Side note, I think I just found my new beauty project.) If I have to pick just one, then I could really use some new foundation. 5. Which skincare would you like to restock: sunscreen, serum or moisturizer? Serum! A bottle of Skinceuticals CE Ferulic would be great. Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon. 1.
