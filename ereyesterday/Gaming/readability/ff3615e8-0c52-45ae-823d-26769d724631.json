  "text": "Sifu! Weird deliveries! Monster destruction! Image credit: Sloclap It's a kung fu kind of week on the Epic Games Store, thanks its latest headline freebie: developer Sloclap's acclaimed Sifu, which arrives alongside several other free titles for mobile and PC. In total, Epic is giving away three free games across PC, Android, and iOS this week, and they'll be sticking around for the next seven days. The full list looks like this: Sifu (PC) Deliver At All Costs (PC) Gigapocalypse (PC/mobile) Sifu | Official Launch Trailer | PS4, PS5 \u0026 PC Sifu's launch trailer from back in the day.Watch on YouTube Sifu's the biggie, of course, even if it's not the first time it's been free on the Epic Games Store. For those unfamiliar, it takes players on a cinematic rampage of revenge through the streets of China. It's a game of pulverising, cathartic martial arts action, with the twist being its protagonist gets steadily older each time they're resurrected by their magical pendant upon death, despite the world around them staying the same. \"An elegant martial arts meditation on temporality and self-possession\", is what Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirwell said in his Sifu review back in 2022, and given all the improvements it's seen since then, it's well worth the (free) entry fee. Epic's other two PC freebies this week come in the form of the newly released Deliver At All Costs - a game of bizarre delivery challenges across highly destructible environments, set somewhere in the 1950s - and Gigapocalypse. This latter title sees players customising their own giant monsters, Kaijū style, and then setting out on a mission of mass destruction developer Goody Gaweworks describes as \"loud, punk, metal, anarchy and a lovely homage to the game and movie classics.\" Gigapocalypse is also currently free for iOS and Android via Epic's mobile store, but you'll need to be in the EU to access it on Apple devices. All the above are available to download and keep via the Epic Games Store right now and will remain so until next Thursday, 29th May. After that, a fresh batch of (still mysterious) freebies will take their place.",
