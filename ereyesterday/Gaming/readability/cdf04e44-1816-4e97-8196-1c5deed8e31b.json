  "text": "Mashina follows a machine of the same name as she mines the earth for useful materials to use to take care of a community of robots. In this game from the creators of Judero (which was our Game of the Year for 2024), our metallic heroine lives on a strange world with an array of other robotic buddies and neighbors, eking out a life while trying to help everyone out. To do this, she’ll spend a lot of time digging around underground looking for special ores and items that can be sold for cash. You can then use that money to build better tools to making mining easier, making you more effective at finding new things underground and reaping greater rewards. But all of that only talks about what your work does for you. You have a whole crew of delightful robot neighbors who could also use some help with various things. They’ll provide you with missions you can complete to make their lives easier, giving you stuff to do that helps you feel more like a part of this robot community. It always feels nice to do something to help out your neighbors, right? Especially when they’re cute robots. The robots look especially endearing from the footage the developers have put out so far, showing that Mashina will be using a similar stop-motion style as Judero. Something about all of these circular, grinning robots just makes me want to cuddle these mechanical beings, even if all of the metal plates will probably give me a good pinch in the process. More than the adorable robots, I’m looking forward to yet another touching work from Jack King-Spooner and Talha Kaya, though. Mashina is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can support its development on its Kickstarter page or add it to your Steam Wishlist.
