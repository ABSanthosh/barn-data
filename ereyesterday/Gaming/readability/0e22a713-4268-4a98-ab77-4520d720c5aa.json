  "text": "It's a cold day in hell.Entertainment has hit critical mass over the last decade, with more shows and movies being produced and released than ever before. It’s impossible to keep up with everything hitting the digital space, whether it be Premium Video on Demand (PVOD) or a traditional streaming network. With that in mind, we figured it was well past time for us to whip up a little something to help you keep up (and catch up) with all there is to watch in the big, wide world of digital viewing. And thus, the Streaming Rewind was born! We’ll update this list at the end of each week so you can check out what you may have missed, and what’s coming up on the weekend. We’ll keep it a mix of popular releases and noteworthy lesser-known titles to help you find what’s worth taking the risk on as well as dive into a few things that we loved and why we loved ‘em, or just break down a show or movie that left us with some opinions. Sometimes, we’ll even have guest entries from other members of the IGN staff. If you’re not interested in all that and just want to see a bulleted list of what’s out there, pop on down to the New and Noteworthy and ICYMI sections.Daredevil: Born Again — The Punisher Returns (Disney+)After a very stressful fakeout in Episode 3, Jon Bernthal’s Frank Castle has made his triumphant return to the Daredevil franchise, delivering yet another all-timer interaction between himself and Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock. The way these two actors play off of each other is constantly breathtaking as they battle over their diametrically opposed world views and both stubbornly refuse to understand that there is a time and a place for both of their, uh… perspectives.If you’re not already on the Daredevil: Born Again train, now’s the time to change that. Wicked Flies Onto PeacockIf you’ve been waiting for its streaming release to check out Part 1 of Jon M. Chu’s masterful adaptation of Wicked, today’s your lucky day. Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) and Glinda (Ariana Grande) are ready to spend one short day with you to help transport you to the wonderful (authoritarian) land of Oz. If you miss the age of DVD extras, there’s great news on that front as well. Not only are both the regular and sing-a-long versions of the musical available on the streamer, there’s a collection of bonus content that comes along with them! Severance Season 2 Comes to an End (Apple TV+)The war between the innies and outies continues but Season 2 has come to a close. While the close of this chapter is chock full of answers to longstanding questions like “what are the numbers for?” and “what is Lumon actually doing?” the last moments of the episode sets up a whole new set of mysteries for the coming season (which was confirmed today).
