  "text": "Welcome to the world of Elden Ring: Nightreign, coming to PlayStation 5 on May 30. This new spin on the beloved dark fantasy classic is a cooperative multiplayer-focused adventure, where you’ll choose a class/character, be matched up with two other adventurers, then go off to try and defeat one of the mythical Nightlords. And if you’re familiar with Elden Ring at all, you know very well that this won’t be an easy task even with a group to help you out. You’ll start with six classes from the outset, with two unlockable afterwards. Each class has a unique Passive Ability, a Character Skill, and an Ultimate Art. Due to Nightreign’s much faster pace and ever-decreasing explorable area, it would be difficult to plan out your builds, so the unique abilities of your currently chosen class and equipped Relics will largely determine your playstyle. To help get you started, we’ll give you a quick look at each class’s strengths and noteworthy attributes. But don’t sweat the choice too much — if one class just isn’t gelling for you, you can swap class anytime between expeditions. Wylder Starting weapons: Wylder’s Greatsword and Wylder’s Small Shield Passive: Sixth Sense Character Skill: Claw Shot  Ultimate Art: Onslaught Stake If you want to just get in, melee some enemies, and do a good chunk of damage, Wylder’s the class for you. Yes, he’s pretty simple, but “simple” certainly doesn’t mean “ineffective.” In fact, Wylder is one of the most versatile classes when it comes to equipment.  Using the Claw Shot, you can bring annoying ranged attackers straight to your face for a good slashing — or, for the big boys, you can fling yourself at them for a slick dashing strike. Plus, you’ve got the ability to nullify one deathblow per revival after taking a break at site of grace with Sixth Sense, making this a good choice for newbies. (Just don’t rely on that ability to get you out of trouble all the time.) Guardian Starting weapon: Guardian’s Halberd Passive: Steel Guard Character Skill: Whirlwind Ultimate Art: Wings of Salvation If you’re looking for a warrior who will stick around, the bird’s the word. Our stalwart avian friend has a huge HP pool and a Steel Guard, a shield stance that consumes less stamina, blocks more effectively, and makes countering a cinch. The Guardian’s ultimate skill, Wings of Salvation, not only looks cool and hurts a large area of foes, it can also help revive near-death teammates within the range of its impact. Build a Guardian wisely, and you’ll have a fearsome tank that can dish it out as well as he takes it. Ironeye Starting weapon: Ironeye’s Bow Passive: Eagle Eye Character Skill: Marking Ultimate Art: Single Shot Not everyone likes to get all up in an enemy’s face, especially when they hit as hard as they do in Nightreign. Ironeye serves as the premiere ranged class, preferring bows and crossbows and specializing in Dexterity above all other stats. He’s also got an eye for treasure, as his Eagle Eye increases the amount of drops you’ll get from felled foes. The Ironeye also specializes in bypassing an enemy’s defenses: Marking a foe with a melee dagger attack will create an opening for extra damage, while Single Shot can ignore defense and obstacles in its path. (And he’s great for distance revival, too.) Raider Starting weapon: Raider’s Greataxe Passive: Fighter’s Resolve Character Skill: Retaliate Ultimate Art: Totem Stela They say that pain makes you stronger, and the Raider epitomizes the phrase: he’s built big to take a beating and hit back hard. He’s focused around the Retaliate skill, which sees him first take a defensive stance, then going into a headbutt. If he’s taken enough damage, his Fighter’s Resolve skill will transform Retaliate into a smashing uppercut that deals massive damage and lets him survive a lethal blow during its execution. But Raider’s also got a softer, supportive side: his Ultimate Art creates a tombstone that serves as a safe perch for long-range attackers and boosts their power. Recluse Starting weapon: Recluse’s Staff Passive: Elemental Defense Character Skill: Magic Cocktails         Ultimate Art: Soulblood Song Compared to other classes, you’re going to need some technical knowledge for the Recluse to really work her magic. She’s a very versatile class, offering both offensive and support capabilities with her spells. However, using her effectively will involve proper collection of elemental affinity residues with her Magic Cocktail ability. Each combination of three elements yields a unique result, so knowing exactly what you’re mixing up is very important. She’s not particularly resilient, either, making her ill-suited for the frontlines. But if you’ve a hankering to cook up trouble with elemental recipes, she’s your go-to gal. Executor Starting weapon: Executor’s Blade Passive: Tenacity                   Character Skill: Cursed Sword            Ultimate Art: Aspects of the Crucible: Beast The Executor’s motto is “Hit fast and cause plenty of pain”–though whether that pain will come from sheer damage output or from status ailments is up to you and your playstyle. Thanks to his passive skill, Tenacity, he gets a nice boost after recovering from status ailments of his own–though we don’t recommend actively seeking out getting afflicted. If you’re skilled at guarding, you can draw out the Cursed Sword for some impressive ripostes. And when things get hairy, you will too, with a big bestial transformation that sees you going feral on enemies for a few precious seconds. Just don’t give him the big weapons — or take too many big-damage hits. You’ll unlock the final two classes — the fleet-footed Duchess and the spirit-calling Revenant — as you progress the game. (Don’t look too hard–you’ll likely stumble upon at least one of the key items required to unlock them during your quests.)  Good luck, and remember: every run will yield a reward, no matter how things go, so keep on questing.

(And he’s great for distance revival, too.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cvideo data-src=\"https://stream.mux.com/AGmGErpDs2PRSZgPCwNCUUPz3lloCmPQ298VX009zTPQ/capped-1080p.mp4?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJBR21HRXJwRHMyUFJTWmdQQ3dOQ1VVUHozbGxvQ21QUTI5OFZYMDA5elRQUSIsImF1ZCI6InYiLCJleHAiOjE3NDg1MjQzOTAsImtpZCI6IjRMNXlPY2pyVjFOVXFWemNVdkpCbjF3VG00ZVRHRzlNaDAyMDFZazVqdTlOQSJ9.IKEp-VV4uMinQIYXq_szfcd9aDZykStl4JqV72AwuLIN_R5Sv7z2wj4Hs6GPF_IlEsglYCTkWM1lDoN38gLdzxsN0N9mEsZ3ipKd5CdNbxvj54K0MHYlr6flFnUDDBj74CoJ1DU99HPM8ozM2aH68P_TUHPtaQOTXpvSGQ8giHR4LkuDdYn91HKeTXrY4BBPeIPLcW4Fo6NUZDu2OlZRHVugc-UiI0hQ9t_-8OPZWkrkEdgxrYbtaMCnAtudXDvRHB99n9HCNiea5S1QCVRhbnM53piUEaT1mwsZgVbeBAZGfIjWJ3wwBZECMFyPUkWpVPEPflOVo41iCSrCZlnuQg\" preload=\"metadata\" autoplay=\"\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\"\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eRaider\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStarting weapon\u003c/strong\u003e: Raider’s Greataxe\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePassive:\u003c/strong\u003e Fighter’s Resolve\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharacter Skill:\u003c/strong\u003e Retaliate\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUltimate Art: \u003c/strong\u003eTotem Stela\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey say that pain makes you stronger, and the Raider epitomizes the phrase: he’s built big to take a beating and hit back hard. He’s focused around the Retaliate skill, which sees him first take a defensive stance, then going into a headbutt. If he’s taken enough damage, his Fighter’s Resolve skill will transform Retaliate into a smashing uppercut that deals massive damage and lets him survive a lethal blow during its execution. But Raider’s also got a softer, supportive side: his Ultimate Art creates a tombstone that serves as a safe perch for long-range attackers and boosts their power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cvideo data-src=\"https://stream.mux.com/9TATfHu2Begt2vi8zOeMx7qSvsexnQuMLuDMxQa00Bfc/capped-1080p.mp4?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiI5VEFUZkh1MkJlZ3Qydmk4ek9lTXg3cVN2c2V4blF1TUx1RE14UWEwMEJmYyIsImF1ZCI6InYiLCJleHAiOjE3NDg1MjQzOTAsImtpZCI6IjRMNXlPY2pyVjFOVXFWemNVdkpCbjF3VG00ZVRHRzlNaDAyMDFZazVqdTlOQSJ9.cI4rVt849Sc1uHO0aF8c_gXg4mO_0FAKLTSnvO-rKz7R4PsQSPm788EntEZVnLA0XAnlXOvuAN2uSq3CJNM8i3DiMgKR3w2e-tcYStq2Av_kC5umAzOtFvVrITx1TJSpNptZtekiT1nmBk3hyDJsUaGDlszONaYsyaVcxszOmcQ9_EI2dRmNmeFOiJOgV-uQZAsI_306uAVn_kRdKCqLCTa0mbkACq6snARjlUSXW48lRmrzHCFx22yQlhL7rewlKc6Ey5WZBRvjv9mfu0Y6pOxzg2AwwDab0mb9wmmQBTBEzGo1VVX91pB68_YEWHcNK4DXv8MnI2pZaKcewYe3vw\" preload=\"metadata\" autoplay=\"\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\"\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eRecluse\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStarting weapon:\u003c/strong\u003e Recluse’s Staff\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePassive: \u003c/strong\u003eElemental Defense\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharacter Skill:\u003c/strong\u003e Magic Cocktails        \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUltimate Art: \u003c/strong\u003eSoulblood Song\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCompared to other classes, you’re going to need some technical knowledge for the Recluse to really work her magic. She’s a very versatile class, offering both offensive and support capabilities with her spells. However, using her effectively will involve proper collection of elemental affinity residues with her Magic Cocktail ability. Each combination of three elements yields a unique result, so knowing exactly what you’re mixing up is very important. She’s not particularly resilient, either, making her ill-suited for the frontlines. But if you’ve a hankering to cook up trouble with elemental recipes, she’s your go-to gal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cvideo data-src=\"https://stream.mux.com/2Dt21TDl6jsVArTOZfc01Xa400I5alKi9AtWAGhX902tHw/capped-1080p.mp4?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIyRHQyMVREbDZqc1ZBclRPWmZjMDFYYTQwMEk1YWxLaTlBdFdBR2hYOTAydEh3IiwiYXVkIjoidiIsImV4cCI6MTc0ODUyNDM5MCwia2lkIjoiNEw1eU9janJWMU5VcVZ6Y1V2SkJuMXdUbTRlVEdHOU1oMDIwMVlrNWp1OU5BIn0.BoFhcz_M2WHAHZkCIyAqQjGs0_VLCHmCCXJlNux_3pjlfZ5CO6OyQ7DbB8mMiH1NITdIAyljoYjai12qhLcbsJOupTQljo9eYVotbNvzSz6CiirhD9nT5jG4UCIDXrJXD2qSymZ4EEaAy-7uYlX_mDKIqRBWKeq8K2zjoAvvMf__Bn32lX7DjaBLcQBaQe8SQKO2QAi8y-BsGawb6irv2TwaWb9OlCx9qnsZYy9W9nnxww6GGkPcGAp3c2CfexCVyihVl1e3uYbhsKzYIrRhKYros-qtidu0rAWTzBEGykWKYWUG6pVqa4JtGhzNIAeAeZZn19SOWmjVOjt_z4oG7Q\" preload=\"metadata\" autoplay=\"\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\"\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eExecutor\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStarting weapon:\u003c/strong\u003e Executor’s Blade\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePassive: \u003c/strong\u003eTenacity                  \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharacter Skill:\u003c/strong\u003e Cursed Sword           \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUltimate Art: \u003c/strong\u003eAspects of the Crucible: Beast\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Executor’s motto is “Hit fast and cause plenty of pain”–though whether that pain will come from sheer damage output or from status ailments is up to you and your playstyle. Thanks to his passive skill, Tenacity, he gets a nice boost after recovering from status ailments of his own–though we don’t recommend actively seeking out getting afflicted. If you’re skilled at guarding, you can draw out the Cursed Sword for some impressive ripostes. And when things get hairy, you will too, with a big bestial transformation that sees you going feral on enemies for a few precious seconds.
