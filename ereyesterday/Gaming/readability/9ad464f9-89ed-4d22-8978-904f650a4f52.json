Right now, Dell is offering an Alienware Aurora R16 GeForce RTX 4090 gaming PC for only $2,899.99 after a $1,000 off instant discount. This is the first time I've seen an RTX 4090 gaming PC discounted to under $3,000 in months. GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards are actually going back up in price again, and getting a standalone card will run you at least $2,000 from a legitimate vendor, which means building your own DIY PC may not be as cost effective as you'd think. Plus, you have the advantage of an all-inclusive warranty with a prebuilt PC.Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 4090 Gaming PCAlienware Aurora R16 i9-14900KF RTX 4090 Gaming PCThis Alienware Aurora R16 gaming PC is equipped with an Intel Core i9-14900KF CPU, GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, 32GB of DDR5-5200MHz RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. The 14th gen Intel Core i9-14900KF is the best Intel gaming CPU you can get right now, and it's also a productivity beast. The chip is known to run pretty hot, but fortunately it's cooled by a robust 240mm all-in-one liquid cooler. The entire system is powered by an 1,000W 80PLUS Platinum power supply.The RTX 4090 is likewise the most powerful GPU on the market. No other video card, either from NVIDIA or from AMD, comes close. In his RTX 4090 review, Chris Coke writes \"The RTX 4090 may be huge and expensive, but holy smokes if it doesn’t blow the competition out of the water... Until the rest of the pack can catch up, between its impressive hardware specs and its DLSS 3 AI wizardry, even the $1,599 price doesn’t seem unreasonable for the unrivaled frame rates that this card can crank out.\" You'll be able to run any game in 4K with ultra settings and ray tracing enabled and still pump out high framerates, even the newest, most demanding titles like Black Myth: Wukong or Warhammer Space Marine 2.The 4090 is also the consumer card of choice for AI thanks to its 24GB of GDDR6X VRAM.A note on RTX 5000 series GPUsNVIDIA's newest generation of GPUs are set to be released starting the end of January. The RTX 5090 will undoubtedly be a more powerful card, but you'd have to be willing to pay a lot more money for that kind of power. Retail price is set to be $2,000 for the Founder's Edition at launch, but availability will definitely be an issue. The RTX 5080 will launch at a retail price of $999 but again there may be availability issues. We'll be sure to bench this card soon, but it will have less VRAM than the 4090 (16GB vs 24GB) and probably won't quite replace the 4090 as the dominant number two card.A note on Alienware's newest \"R16\" desktop chassisThe R16 is Alienware's 2024 desktop PC design. It's 40% smaller in volume compared to previous iterations. It features a simple yet proven airflow pattern; air is drawn in through the side intake vents over the GPU area and a 120mm fan at the front of the case, and exhausts by way of a 120mm rear fan and two 120mm top fans. A 240mm radiator for the all-in-one liquid cooling system is mounted to these top fans. Some configurations don't actually include the liquid cooling system, but we rarely include them in this roundup. That's because Alienware's liquid cooling solution is far superior to their stock air cooling and is easily worth the price premium. Note that Dell announced a new Area 51 chassis during CES 2025, but it looks very similar in appearance and design to the R16 chassis.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
