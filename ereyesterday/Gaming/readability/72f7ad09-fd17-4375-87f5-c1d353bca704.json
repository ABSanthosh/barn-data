What could you use most right now: cuddles with pets, a hot cup of tea or a nap? I’m drinking a hot cup of tea at the moment, and I’m not too sleepy, so I’ll take the cuddles from the pets. 2. On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest, how concerned are you about AI? Girl. As someone who named her daughter after a great science fiction heroine who rises up to help defeat the robots, I’m going to give this a solid 10. I’m freaked out, man! 3.

Something unexpected that happened to you recently? Well, I saw a bobcat out of my window when I was at work last week! (See the pic at the top.) The campus has a lot of trails and open space, and I frequently see deer and other animals out and about. This was the first time I ever saw a bobcat, though. She was pretty cute! Immediately after taking the picture, I texted it to El Hub, and he said, “Don’t go out there and try to make friends with that cat, sweetie.” HAHAHA! 4. What would you rather have miraculously show up on your doorstep: dinner every day for the next week, a new pair of shoes, a cute cat who wants to adopt you or two bags full of groceries? Dinner every day, for sure. In this scenario the meals would be delicious and nutritious, too. 5. A beauty product that you used to think was glamorous? I thought Jean Nate was the height of sophistication when I was in elementary school, LOL! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon. 1. What could you use most right now: cuddles with pets, a hot cup of tea or a nap? 2.
