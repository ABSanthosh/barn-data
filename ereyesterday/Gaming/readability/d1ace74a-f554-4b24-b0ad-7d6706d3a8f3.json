  "description": "Call of Duty's Season 1 update arrives in Black Ops 6 and Warzone on November 14, and the patch notes reveal updates to the spawn system, adjustments to weapon movement, and some gun balancing, as well. Improvements are also detailed for Call of Duty's Ricochet anti-cheat across Black Ops 6 and Warzone.Season 1 includes new multiplayer maps, new weapons to unlock, and a battle pass packed with over 100 items to earn. It also adds Black Ops 6's integration into Warzone, bringing the game's operators, weapon pool, and features like omnimovement to battle royale. Additionally, Season 1 includes the new Area 99 Resurgence map to Warzone. You can find more highlights of the season here, including a first look at the upcoming Zombies map.You can check out all the major highlights of the Season 1 battle pass, which adds Sevati \"Sev\" Dumas from the campaign as a new playable operator and several new weapon blueprints. Ricochet anti-cheat updatesThe developer says that Ricochet is now updated with enhanced AFK detections to battle against players who are account boosting, and as well as adjusting ping thresholds to require players play matches in their region to cut down on VPN abuse.To unlock Ranked Play mode in Black Ops 6, players will first need to win 50 match-made multiplayer matches. The developer says this is required to ensure that players are experienced with multiplayer before they enter the mode, and it gives the Ricochet team a historical match history to examine before an account enters Ranked Play.These anti-cheat updates are applied to both Black Ops 6 and Warzone. Multiplayer map adjustmentsTreyarch says it has made spawn logic updates across several maps to reduce players' chances of spawning near enemies. The update also adjusts the start spawns of the Subsonic map to prevent players from being able to damage the enemy team at match start.Additional map changes include an adjustment to the A bomb site for the Vault map in Search and Destroy to reduce lines of sight from the start spawn area. The A bomb on Protocol is also adjusted to prevent a line of sight from above artillery. Game chat adjustmentsThe Season 1 update addresses some issues with Black Ops 6's game chat. This includes an issue that previously prevented some players from being able to hear each other between rounds of modes like Search and Destroy and Gunfight. It also fixes an issue that blocked post-game voice chat. Adjustments for all multiplayer weaponsThe update makes a few adjustments to the entire weapon pool for Black Ops 6. This includes adjusted weapon motion while moving and changing stances to improve aiming feel and centering, which should especially be noticeable for weapons with optics. The \"Hold Breath\" focus state will now be maintained while firing if applicable on a specific gun, and all weapons now have an improved weapon depth of field settings when performing the weapon inspect animation. Assault rifle adjustments for Hardcore mode Treyarch says the damage values for some of the assault rifles are increased to ensure that they kill in just one bullet for Hardcore modes. While the damage is higher for these weapons, the headshot multipliers have been reduced. The developer says this change will either keep the bullets to kill with headshots the same, or in some cases, even improve them at some minimum damage ranges.These adjustments are applied to the XM4, Ames 85, GPR 91, and the Goblin MK2. Marksman rifle adjustments for multiplayerTreyarch says it adjusted the handling stats on the game's burst rifles so that they fit better into their intended roles. This includes significantly reducing the power of the Rapid Fire attachment for AEK-973 marksman rifle.\"The Swat 5.56 now has a slower fire rate within each burst and more recoil, making it better suited for mid-range engagements. Meanwhile the AEK-973 has better stability and precision, but a longer burst delay makes it a riskier pick when playing aggressively,\" the developer says. Sniper rifle adjustments for multiplayer All snipers in Black Ops will now have 1 second of 50% idle sway scaling at the beginning of the aim-down-sight motion. Additionally, all sniper rifles also have their base flinch resistance improved by 17%.The developer says the update should also make the LW3A1 Frostline a more competitive option against the more popular LR 7.62 sniper rifle. Zombies weapon adjustments Treyarch has increased the damage performance of all assault rifles in the game, which includes an increase to the Pack-a-Punched base damage and overall critical damage of the weapons.Additionally, the HE-1 launcher has a buff to become more useful at stopping hordes of zombies. When Pack-a-Punched, the launcher will now have more stock ammo and a larger explosion with more overall damage. Warzone map changes With Black Ops 6's integration, the maps will now include the Black Ops 6 weapons as ground loot, as well as new vehicles with improved handling. This includes the Black Ops 6 dirt bike.Urzikstan and Rebirth Island will have updated lighting and visual improvements using Black Ops 6 technology, and players can also expect audio improvements to in-game sound effects. This includes footstep audio tuning. Warzone quality-of-life updatesSeveral small quality-of-life changes arrive with Season 1. This includes the ability to nowloot self-revive kits while in the downed state, as long as that item is in close proximity.Another positive change is the speed at which players can replace broken or missing armor plates, which has been increased by 8% to better match the fluidity of Black Ops 6's Omnimovement.Additionally, the duration of live pings has been reduced from 3 seconds to 2, which the developer says was changed to \"bring more balance to a combat engagement.\" Warzone movement adjustments Based on player feedback around the game's default tac-sprint duration, the sprint has been increased from 2 to 4 seconds.Adjustments are also made to how players land from falls in battle royale. The duration of the shock effect when falling from a near-death height has been reduced from 3 to to 2.1 seconds, and the minimum fall damage required before the shock effect from landing is increased from 50 to now 55%. Treyarch says these changes are implemented to allow for slightly higher jumps with less punishment. Some Black Ops 6 attachments work differently in Warzone Some of Black Ops 6 weapon attachments will work differently in battle royale.The CHF Barrel has been adjusted for all weapons. For assault rifles, LMGs, DMRs, SMGs, and pistols: This attachment now grants an increased neck multiplier rather than a head multiplier. For snipers and shotguns: This attachment now provides increased leg modifiers instead of arm modifiers.The Flip Magazine's capacity penalty from multiplayer has been removed from the attachment. In Warzone, flip mags match the base weapon's ammo capacity.For the Rapid Fire attachment, it now applies a base damage penalty in Warzone, along with greater penalties to bullet velocity and range.The full patch notes and more detailed weapon changes can be found below for Black Ops 6 and Warzone, as shared by Activision.

Most weapons sit quite closely in both performance and pick rate, with no weapons dominating in both areas. As such our first round of Season 01 tuning changes will not be introducing any major shifts to the current state of weapon balance, and instead focus on elevating some of the weapons at the bottom of the pack. We are also addressing feedback regarding Assault Rifle damage in Hardcore and completing our adjustments to the shotgun slug attachment.Reminder: We're using a new Weapon Damage Adjustments tables to identify post-patch damage changes when possible. Need an explainer? Click here!All WeaponsAdjusted weapon motion while moving and changing stances to improve aiming feel and centering (especially with optics).Hold Breath focus state will now be maintained while firing if applicable.Improved Weapon depth of field settings when performing a Weapon Inspect.We are increasing the damage values for some of our Assault Rifles to ensure that they kill in just one bullet in Hardcore modes. The headshot multiplier changes have either kept the bullets to kill with headshots the same or even improved them at some Min Damage Ranges.ShotgunsStrelok Laser Attachment AdjustmentsIncreased the time it takes to reach ADS spread from 20% of Aim Down Sight Speed to 70% of Aim Down Sight SpeedSlug Attachment AdjustmentsSlugs allow players to run shotguns as mid-range precision weapons. As a tradeoff, they have limited short range effectiveness if you are not carefully hitting headshotsMarksman RiflesWe are adjusting handling stats on the burst rifles so that they fit more squarely into their intended roles. The Swat 5.56 has a slower fire rate within each burst and more recoil, making it better suited for mid-range engagements. Meanwhile the AEK-973 has better stability and precision, but a longer burst delay makes it a riskier pick when playing aggressively. We are also significantly reducing the power of the AEK-973 Rapid Fire, which was too strong not to take.Sniper riflesWe have been monitoring feedback on Sniper Rifles and are making some changes to promote more build diversity and improve the sniping experience before gaining access to a complete attachment set. We are lowering the baseline flinch on all Snipers and reducing the Flinch Resistance given by stock attachments. The resulting received flinch values are much lower up front and just a bit lower overall after equipping the stocks. We are also increasing Aim Walking Movement Speed bonuses on stock attachments to make those choices more valuable.Lastly, we are improving the ADS Idle Sway delay by default on all Snipers, meaning that on average there will be less deviation from your point of aim when entering ADS. Our goal is to support the various sniping playstyles you all enjoy through several viable weapon builds. We will continue to monitor weapon and attachment data as well as your feedback to ensure that all sniping playstyles are fun and rewarding in Black Ops 6.Sniper Rifle Class AdjustmentsAll snipers now have 1 second of 50% Idle Sway scaling at the beginning of Aim Down SightAll snipers have had base Flinch Resistance improved by 17%GunsmithVarious updates to weapon descriptions.Addressed an issue where stickers would appear in the Decal slot.PerksSlight reduction to Ninja footstep volume. Additionally we’ve made a slight reduction to default footstep volume.Addressed an issue that prevented Gearhead from being able to booby-trap enemy Care Packages.Addressed an issue that prevented Equipment from replenishing with the Scavenger Perk.ScorestreaksArchangel Addressed an issue where the rocket would sometimes explode immediately when firing near a wall.ChallengesAddressed an issue where some Daily Challenges were not tracking properly.Movement UpdatesAddressed a bug causing player to be slowed when shot while mantling.TheaterAdded Nuketown and Private Match recordings.Addressed various stability issues when viewing matches.UIClosed an exploit that allowed players to equip Operators they had not unlocked.Addressed an issue where the AAR could close when entering the Scoreboard tab.Addressed an issue earned and unearned medals would not display correctly in Collections.Addressed an issue where the option to select an attachment skin would not be visible for some players.GraphicsAddressed an issue where some weapon effects would persist on the character after changing weapons.StabilityAdded numerous stability fixes.ZOMBIESMapsTerminus Addressed an issue where defuse progress was sometimes not saved if the player stopped defusing during the Apocalypse Protocol Main Quest step.Addressed an issue where entering a Kazimir after completing the Main Quest would teleport the player to the boss arena and down them.Addressed an issue where loading into a saved game after unlocking the Pack-A-Punch machine could cause some doors to have inconsistent collision.Addressed an issue during the Main Quest where connecting both Node Connectors at the same time would cause overlapping voice lines.Changed the location of the Ammo Cache on the Seaside Path.Liberty Falls Updated the first Mangler whose arm is blown off to always drop a Mangler Cannon instead of only the first Mangler that spawns.Resolved an issue where Blanchard would not be present during some dialogue.Weapon AdjustmentsThe recent changes to Assault Rifles in Zombies were an unintended carryover from a global weapon tuning pass. We do not intend to inherit all MP weapon tuning without looking at how it affects Zombies tuning as well.We have corrected this in this update, while also making a pass on increasing the damage performance of ARs in Zombies. All ARs have had their Pack-a-Punched base damage and overall critical damage increased. While you may see the word \"decreased\" in a few places, the performance for these weapons is still increased overall!Additionally, the HE-1 Launcher has gotten a buff to become more useful at stopping hordes of zombies. When Pack-a-Punched, it will now have more stock ammo and a larger explosion with more overall damage.Bug FixesAddressed an issue where camos were not being applied to Zombie Builds.Closed an exploit that allowed players to have 3 weapons.Addressed an issue where Wallbuy rarity would reset when loading into a save.Addressed an issue where yellow damage numbers would appear when hitting a critical spot with the Ray Gun.PerksQuick ReviveDying Wish Augment Addressed an issue where Dying Wish could activate when diving from large heights while protected from fall damage.Elemental Pop Addressed an issue where Elemental Pop would prevent normal Ammo Mod activations.Jugger-nog Turtle Shell Augment Turtle Shell will now apply damage mitigation when being grabbed by an Amalgam.PHD Flopper Addressed an issue where diving onto an elevated or inclined surface, such as stairs or up a hill, would not activate the perk.GobbleGumsAddressed an issue that prevented players revived by Near Death Experience from keeping all their Perks.Field UpgradesAdjusted the description for the Energy Mine to no longer say it deals Electrical damage to accurately reflect the damage type.Increased Dark Flare damage from 25% to 40% of the base zombie max health per tick.Addressed an issue where an extra charge on Field Upgrades would be lost when loading a save.SupportAddressed an issue that could cause the Mutant Injection to end early when near water.Addressed an issue that allowed the player to pick up a Sentry Turret while using Mutant Injection.Reduced self-damage from the LDBR.Save \u0026 LoadClosed an exploit that allowed keeping a save file after it had already been loaded.EnemiesAddressed an issue where zombies charmed by Brain Rot could prevent the player from completing an exfil.Addressed an issue where loading a save would disable the rampage inducer if it was active.Addressed an issue where zombies would throw guts at the end camera if the player leaves the match to end the game.Terminus Addressed an issue where rarely the round would not end after killing all zombies.Addressed an issue where the Amalgam could grab the player while slowed.Addressed an issue where the Amalgam could pull players into walls causing them to get stuck.Addressed an issue where diving while being hit by knockback from Patient 13 could push the player further than intended.Liberty Falls Addressed an issue that prevented the Abomination from spawning inside Fuller’s Liberty Lanes.Addressed an issue where the Abomination could fire off a beam attack before leaving a spawn closet.ActivitiesAddressed an issue that would prevent one elite from spawning consistently during exfil from rounds 16 onwardUpdated S.A.M. Trials that required the player to not take damage to display a progress bar instead of a timer.Terminus. Addressed an issue where players would be able to use Equipment, Scorestreaks, and fire weapons during the Boat Race awards sequence.XP Earn RatesAddressed an issue where XP was being awarded to all weapons being used in an assist instead of just the last one. If two weapons were used in an assist only the last one used by the players getting the assist will be awarded XP.ChallengesAddressed an issue where Wall Buys would not progress the Prestige 8 Challenge Value Town.Addressed an issue where Legendary GobbleGums would progress the Ultra Prestige 8 Challenge Full Power instead of Ultra GobbleGums.Addressed an issue where the Liberated Challenge could be completed by saving and quitting before starting the final encounter.Addressed an issue that would complete the Social Distancing and Invincible Challenges by joining a game in progress.Addressed an issue that would complete the Harbinger of Doom Challenge when loading into a saved game and using a Scorestreak.Addressed an issue where the Prestige 5 Challenge Fire \u0026 Forget would mention needing a Bombing Run medal instead a Lethality medal.Addressed an issue where the player would not complete Outrageous Challenge until Round 16 instead of Round 15.Addressed an issue where loading a save past Round 25 would complete the Sticks N’ Stones Challenge.Addressed an issue where the Dark Journey Challenge could show as not complete when unlocking Nebula on 33 weapons and being awarded the Calling Card.AFK DetectionWe have updated the detection logic to determine if a player is AFK during an active match. This should reduce the amount of false positive AFK kicks in Zombies.Added AFK Kick warning UI to ZMUIUpdated visuals on all GobbleGums to improve readability.Addressed an issue where the Boat UI would overlap with the Map with the Central Command HUD preset.Addressed an issue where the Drop Node Connecter prompt during the Terminus Main Quest would overlap with the Map with the Central Command HUD preset.Addressed an issue where the Round number would initially be displayed incorrectly when loading a save.Addressed an issue where the Weapon Stats on the AAR would show the loadout players started with instead of the loadout they ended with.Addressed an issue where some items would show the wrong text on the Tac Map when pinged.Removed Multiplayer information from Melee Weapon descriptions.Added a Highest Round icon to the AAR when reaching a new personal highest round.Added a timer to the scoreboard.Added a notification when picking up Intel.GraphicsAddressed an issue on PS4 where some effects would stop rendering at higher rounds.Addressed an issue where some effects for the Mutant Injection were not working when Sprinting.Addressed an issue where the character effects from Brutus would be present during Mutant Injection.Liberty Falls Addressed an issue where some damaged vehicles would not have smoke effects.StabilityAddressed an issue where the game could crash when attempting to start a solo match after playing in splitscreen.Addressed an issue where sometimes the player would be unable to Save \u0026 Quit with the error \"The game failed to save for an unknown reason.

This map is set in the Nevada desert at the Echo Ridge Weapons Station — a hidden 1950s government site abandoned after a reactor leak. The map offers intense, tactical combat through desert roadways, open trenches, and pipework around a central Reactor “bullseye,” anticipated as the hottest drop zone. Another key point of interest is a massive crane suspending a Nuketown house in the Loading Bay, adding to the map's unique and dynamic environment.Points of InterestReactorBunkerTest SiteMannequin AssemblyCooling TowersNuketown ShippingLoading BayWarehouseManufacturingPodsReturning MapsUrzikstanThe \"big map\" returns to its early days featuring familiar landmarks from before the destruction of Popov Power Plant and the arrival of the Atlas Superstore.Enhanced with Black Ops 6 innovations, Urzikstan is the staging ground for a fierce Ranked Play Battle Royale later when Season 01's Mid-Season launches.Rebirth IslandThe infamous prison island returns during Season 01's playlist with Resurgence Modes, enhanced by Omnimovement, Black Ops 6 weaponry, and Killstreaks for added tactical intensity.Map AdjustmentsUrzikstan, Rebirth IslandVehicles All new vehicles with improved handling, detailed further below.Brand new dirtbike for quick rotation.Loot All new Black Ops 6 ground loot including weapons and equipment.Visuals Lighting and visual improvements to the map with Black Ops 6 technology.Sound Audio improvements to in-game sound effects including footsteps balance tuning.Rebirth IslandSubmarine The Submarine POI introduced earlier this year now appears 100% of the time.Redeploy Drones Increased Redeploy Drone count and spawn rate for balancing later circles.Biometric Scanner \u0026 Weapon Trade Station Rewards for the Biometric Scanner and Weapon Trade Station have been rebalanced and updated to Black Ops 6 loot.MODESReturning ModesBattle RoyaleThis mode offers the classic Warzone experience, centered around high-risk, high-reward gameplay.

Then fire to eliminate the enemy quickly as they appear, all the while staying in the supine position.Intelligent Movement Players can now customize elements of how they traverse landscape and navigate combat.Available in the Keyboard \u0026 Mouse or Controller Options under “Movement,” players will find the following features: Sprint Assist: Choose whether to manually or automatically sprint, tactically sprint, how much of a delay before sprinting begins, and if the assist occurs while sprinting sideways or backwards.Mantle Assist: Customize how and when to automatically mantle over obstacles.Crouch Assist: This enables crouching and sliding when the intent is to move through a valid opening.Corner Slice: Allows the act of inclining weapons (and camera) when adjacent to or moving around a corner. This doesn’t affect aim. Default is “on.”Unlimited Tac Sprint Players will have access to unlimited tac sprint via the Sprinter Perk or by holding their dedicated melee weapon.Mantle Protection Players will now climb onto thin or high ledges rather than over them to prevent untimely deaths.Movement AdjustmentsTac Sprint Duration We heard feedback around default tac sprint duration, so it has been increased from 2 seconds to 4 seconds.Landing Tuning The duration of the shock effect when falling from a near-death height has been reduced to 2.1 seconds from 3 seconds.The minimum fall damage required before the shock effect from landing is now 55%, up from 50% allowing for slightly higher jumps with less punishment.This change is made to better enable the movement opportunities that the Black Ops 6 integration allows.Vertical Ascenders \u0026 Horizontal Zipline Improvements Quality of Life Interacting with the Ascenders and Ziplines lines has been improved, making it easier to attach to the line from an angle or while free falling to increase fluidity.Redeploy Drones Redeploy Drones are fixed in place for the duration of a match.Once a Redeploy Drone has been consumed by the gas, it will leave the map rather than relocating to give a more consistent experience.INVENTORYStreamlined Inventory At the start of Season 01, we're streamlining the inventory system by removing the “Backpack” and returning to a classic inventory layout, organized by sections for cash, gas mask, armor plates, killstreaks, field upgrades, weapons, ammo and perks.PERKSPerks in Warzone are now streamlined, allowing players to choose three Perks (one from each color-coded slot) in the Loadouts Menu. Most Pick-3 Perks unlock as you level up but re-lock upon Prestiging. Black Ops 6 player levels carry over to Warzone, unlocking corresponding Perks.GeneralLootable Perks Lootable Perks return! Each season, players will encounter a number of perks via Ground Loot and Supply Boxes. These perk effects stack on top of the original Pick-3 Perks players have selected in their loadout.When a player is eliminated, their Pick-3 Perks will drop on the ground as a “Custom Perk Pack” to be recovered or stolen by another player, while any looted perks will disappear.The Lootable Perks players can find include a mix of perks from the 18 possible Pick-3 Perks, in addition to two perks that are unique to ground loot; ShroudedIrradiatedPlayers will recognize their Pick-3 Perks when they are equipped in the bottom right of the HUD, while lootable perks can be viewed in the Inventory.Specialist Perk Package Found as a rare loot drop or Care Package reward, Specialist grants every Perk including all 18 Pick-3 Perks, as well as both Ground Loot exclusive Perks - Irradiated and Shrouded.If you're eliminated, the Specialist Perk package will disappear.Can be acquired in Buy Stations in limited quantities for $30,000.Pre-Match Perks Quality of Life Perks can now be edited in the pre-match lobby.WILDCARDSFirst introduced in Black Ops Cold War, Wildcards come to Warzone with 4 options that act as special, single-use perks for each loadout. These loadout modifiers allow players to equip more gear, weapons, or attachments, adding unique customization and variety to gameplay.Available WildcardsBandolier• Your loadout provides a Munitions Satchel.• This Wildcard is only available in Warzone.• Unlocked at player level 15Overkill• Equip two Primary or Secondary weapons.• Unlocked at player level 24Gunfighter• Get 3 extra attachment points for your Primary weapon.• This only applies to Black Ops 6 weapons.• Unlocked at player level 33Battle Ready• Your loadout provides a UAV and Utility Box.• This Wildcard is only available in Warzone.• Unlocked at player level 38SATCHELSSatchels are new loot items that expand storage for inventory slots, allowing players to carry more of an item type and improve efficiency.

With the release of Black Ops 6, players can explore new additions to the equipment lineup, some of which we suspect may become fan favorites. We’ve also made several visual and balance adjustments to classic equipment, ensuring a diverse arsenal to choose from.Equipment AdjustmentsWith the Black Ops 6 integration, we have adjusted a number of the Lethal and Tactical equipment to offer a new and fresh arsenal of choices.Maximum Deployed Equipment The maximum number of lethal and tactical equipment that can be planted at the same time has been increased to 3, up from 2.We aligned Warzone with the changes to Multiplayer. This enables some of the new traps to be better utilized and function better with other adjustments like the Munitions Vest and Bomb Squad.Frag Outer damage decreased to 65 from 110.Middle damage increased to 170 from 155.Inner damage decreased to 260 from 275.Frag Cooking Indicator Quality of Life Players will now notice a UI indicator to better determine the time remaining until a frag detonates.Semtex Explosion radius decreased to 5m from 6.5m.Outer damage decreased to 45 from 110.Inner damage decreased from 200 to180.Throwing Knife Damage decreased to 180 from 200.Drill Charge Outer damage decreased to 39 from 110.Molotov Burn stage damage was reduced to 10,15,25 from 15, 25, 30.Smoke VFX updated to be at parity with Black Ops 6.Experimental Gas Will now deal 10 damage per tick.Snapshot Grenade Radius increased to 15m from 10m.Will now put a mark over a successfully “snapped” target which lasts for 5 seconds.KILLSTREAKSKillstreaks in Warzone, much like Multiplayer’s Scorestreaks, are game-changing tools that players can find via ground loot, Supply Boxes, or as rewards from contracts and events. Many of these Killstreaks are lethal, unleashing devastating airstrikes and explosions that can decimate enemy squads from above. Others are tactical, offering valuable intel on enemy positions or on ideal positioning for upcoming fights. With Black Ops 6, a few new Killstreaks have been introduced designed to give players a real advantage in the heat of battle.Killstreak AdjustmentsBunker Buster The trophy system will now counter the bunker buster.Field Upgrade AdjustmentsHeartbeat Sensor The warning display now highlights in red when enemies are within 15 meters, up from 7.The time between pings has been reduced to 1.5 seconds, down from 2.5 seconds.Munitions Box The munitions crate now grants 3 clips of every ammo type, rather than only refilling your primary and secondary weapon ammo types.With this change players are enabled to make pivots in their weapon choices. A focus on breadth rather than depth of ammo.Portable Radar The duration of the portable radar pulse has been increased from 25 seconds to 30.Personal Redeploy Drone Deploys 50% faster.No longer prohibits firing while in use.Standardized height across the different maps.Reinforcement Flare 30% faster to use.Trophy System Counter charges increased from 3 to 5.WEAPONSIntroductionWe've expanded the Warzone arsenal to include weapons from the launch of Black Ops 6 in October 2024, giving players even more options to customize their loadouts. Dive into Warzone with these powerful additions, now available alongside fan favorites from previous titles.At launch, Black Ops 6 weapons in Warzone will share similar values to their Multiplayer counterparts such as ADS speed, sprint to fire, and recoil. However, damage profiles for a number of weapons have been modified to establish a baseline for Warzone. We encourage new and returning players to study their favorite weapon’s details in the Gunsmith.With the integration of Black Ops 6, we also now have new tuning options for weapons that weren’t previously available, allowing us to adjust aspects like handling (ADS speed and sprint to fire), magazine sizes, recoil, and more. For instance, while the AS VAL has a default magazine size of 20 in Multiplayer, we’ve set it to 30 for Warzone.Our goal is to make weapon adjustments faster to keep the available selection dynamic and engaging, without making any weapons feel obsolete. With these new tuning options, we aim to refine each weapon’s identity and role specific to their use in Warzone, such as emphasizing Assault Rifles as strong long-range options.Additionally, all bolt-action snipers and pump-action shotguns (while aiming down sights) from Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, and Black Ops 6 will have a one-shot headshot potential within their respective max damage ranges. Additionally, in order to incentivize intentional aim, all shotguns will fire 5 pellets while ADSing versus 4 when fired from the hip.We want players to feel that weapons from Modern Warfare II and Modern Warfare III continue to remain solid, viable choices in Warzone. Our goal is to create a unified combat system that makes each gun enjoyable to use, regardless of its origin. We’ll continue to improve legacy weapons and attachments throughout the coming year to further support this vision.Black Ops 6 WeaponsBlack Ops 6 weapons have a unique Warzone damage profile, which includes specific base damage, range, and location-based modifiers.We’ve adjusted several Black Ops 6 attachments to function differently in Warzone:CHF Barrel For Assault Rifles, LMGs, DMRs, SMGs, and Pistols: This now grants an increased neck multiplier rather than a head multiplier.For Sniper Rifles and Shotguns: This now provides increased leg modifiers instead of arm modifiers.Flip Magazine The magazine capacity penalty from Multiplayer has been removed. In Warzone, flip mags match the base weapon's ammo capacity.Rapid Fire This attachment now applies a base damage penalty in Warzone, along with greater penalties to bullet velocity and range.Modern Warfare II \u0026 III WeaponsA visual recoil reduction pass has been applied to Modern Warfare II weapons, enhancing their feel and control while shooting.Barrel and stock attachments from Modern Warfare II have also had their penalties reduced. Additionally, a significant balancing pass has been completed for underbarrel and muzzle attachments from both Modern Warfare II and III. All cons have been removed from these attachments, meaning they now only provide stat boosts, with each subcategory of underbarrels and muzzles functioning identically except for cosmetic differences. AMP attachments in these slots, however, retain their unique functionality and balancing.Muzzle Enhancements Suppressors: Boost velocity and damage range.Comps: Improve recoil control.Flash Hiders: Increase damage range and firing aim stability.Breacher: Enhance melee damage and recoil control.Underbarrel Enhancements Angled Grip: Increases hipfire and tacstance accuracy and aim walking steadiness.Handstop: Improves sprint-to-fire and ADS speed.Vert Grip: Enhances recoil control and firing aim stability.Furthermore, Modern Warfare II and III weapons now have corner-slicing functionality, adding an extra tactical edge.Global Weapon BuildsSeamlessly access a custom weapon build you've created across Black Ops 6 Multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. This time-saving feature lets you adjust any Build or Blueprint in one game, with changes automatically applied wherever that weapon is equipped. To create a build, select a base weapon or Blueprint, add attachments and cosmetics in the Gunsmith, and return to the Custom Loadout screen to save it. The build, with all selected customizations, will then appear in other modes under the same weapon type.New WeaponsThese weapons are new to Season 01 and were not part of the original launch of Black Ops 6 Multiplayer in October 2024.Krig C Assault Rifle Full-auto assault rifle. High damage and average handling. Recoil pattern starts very controllable before ramping up.Unlockable via Battle Pass Page 3 HVT Tier Reward OR Page 14 Battle Pass BlueprintSAUG Submachine Gun Fully automatic submachine gun.

Very fast attack speed.Unlockable via Event RewardNew AttachmentsThese attachments are new to Season 01 and were not part of the original launch of Black Ops 6 in October 2024.12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath Add some heat to your Shotgun blasts with incendiary rounds comprised of magnesium sparks that stick to and burn enemies over time. Equipping the 12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath Fire Mod prevents using Barrel Attachments, but the tradeoff is well worth it when seeking a fiery finish.Compatible with ShotgunsAcquired via Battle Pass Page 7 RewardBuffer Weight Stock (In-Season) The heavier Buffer Weight Stock provides significantly smoother action through the additional resistance met by the bolt carrier group. The improvement results in more manageable recoil through sustained fire, ideal for staying on target though at the expense of ADS Speed and Aim Walk Movement Speed.Compatible with XM4 Assault Rifle, XMG LMG, DM-10 Marksman RifleAcquired via Event RewardBurst Fire Conversion (In-Season) Convert the XM4 Assault Rifle’s primary firing mode into a three-round burst to help conserve ammo and stay on target. There’s an impressive lack of recoil too, so it’s still possible to pump out consistent damage when facing heavy threats.Compatible with XM4 Assault RifleAcquired via Event RewardBurst Fire Conversion (In-Season) Convert the Kompakt 92 SMG’s primary firing mode into an exceptionally rapid three-round burst. Equipping the Burst Fire Conversion Fire Mod locks the Underbarrel and Barrel Attachment slots. When you need to fire quickly in close quarters, hold down the trigger to automatically cycle through burst shots.Compatible with Kompakt 92 SMGAcquired via Event RewardWeapon AdjustmentsThe following weapon adjustments are strictly limited to Modern Warfare II and III weapons. It's a lot.Future patch notes for Black Ops 6 weapons will follow the table format introduced with the launch of Black Ops 6.CLICK HERE TO SHOW/HIDE INFOLOOTGround \u0026 Supply Box Loot Added Black Ops 6 items including: WeaponsField Equipment: War Cry, ScramblerKillstreaks: Napalm Strike, Sentry Gun, SAM Turret, Care PackageLethals: Throwing Axe, Blast Trap, Impact Grenade, Spring MineTacticals: Neurogas Mine, Prox Alarm, Spy CameraPerks: Grenadier, Combat Tracker, Dexterity, Cold-Blooded, Irradiated, ShroudedSatchels: Armor Satchel, Munitions SatchelRemoval of the following: Killstreaks: Cluster Mine, Mosquito Drone, GuardianLethals: Proxy Mine, Claymore, Thermite, Breacher DroneTacticals: Tracker Grenade, Scatter MineRedeploy tokensLoot Distribution The loot distribution system will now create further space for larger items as they are dropped to the ground to avoid overlapping loot.The loot distribution system will now purposely avoid dropping items near objects in close proximity such as Buy Stations.Medical Cabinets Quality of Life Loot that drops out of medical cabinets now drops within closer proximity of its origin.Buy StationsBuy Station inventory and prices have had slight adjustments with the Black Ops 6 integration.Weapon Outlines Quality of LifeWeapons now have rarity outlines to help players better evaluate the options at their disposal throughout a match.CONTRACTSAvailable ContractsBelow is a summary of each contract type to help both new and returning players quickly grasp how each one functions with the integration of Black Ops 6. These summaries cover key objectives, mechanics, and rewards, making it easier for players to jump in and engage with contracts confidently.BountyWhen you pick up a Bounty contract, a nearby player will be selected as your target. A circle will appear on your tac map, periodically updating to show the target’s location. The target will be somewhere within this circle each time it updates, and the circle gradually shrinks as you move closer. The target can also see an indicator on their HUD showing how close the closest player from your hunting team is; this is displayed as a three-level \"threat indicator.\" Completing the contract by killing the target rewards cash, XP, and a singular ping from the bounty target’s body. If another team kills the target, your contract ends with a \"poached\" outcome, offering a lesser reward. Allowing the timer to run out or losing your team will fail the contract.Big Game BountyThis contract works similarly to the base Bounty but with a few twists. It only spawns after Circle 2 closes and prioritizes teams with the highest cumulative kills, provided they’re not already bounty targets. If you complete this contract by eliminating the target, you’ll earn an immediate advanced UAV ping along with extra cash and XP, offering greater rewards than a standard Bounty.ScavengerUpon picking up a Scavenger contract, three scavenger caches will spawn near the pickup spot. You’ll be directed to each cache one at a time, with the next cache revealed only after you open the previous one. Opening a cache adds 45 seconds to the contract timer. These caches contain slightly better loot than usual, and each will drop a lootable perk. Opening the third and final cache completes the contract, rewarding your team with cash, XP, and an armor satchel from the last cache. Failing to open all caches before time runs out, or having your team wiped, will fail the contract.IntelWhen you accept an Intel contract, a nearby upload station will be marked for your team to upload sensitive intel. Reaching the station and interacting with it initiates an \"upload\" phase where one team member must remain near the station until the upload is complete. If multiple players are in this radius, the upload speed can increase by up to 200%. Completing the upload rewards cash, XP, and a peek at the next circle’s location. Failure occurs if the timer expires or if your team is wiped.Most WantedBy picking up the Most Wanted contract, you or the team member who picked it up becomes visible on the map for all players. Opponents who kill the Most Wanted target receive cash and XP, while the Most Wanted team can reduce their contract time by obtaining kills and opening loot caches (10-second reduction per cache, 25-second reduction per kill). If the Most Wanted target survives the full contract duration, the contract is completed, and the team earns cash, XP, and revives any dead squad members. Whether the contract ends in success or failure, a \"VIP reward crate\" appears near the VIP’s location, containing ammo, plates, a killstreak, a weapon, a Gulag token, and cash.Signals IntelligenceThis contract directs your team to hack nearby contracts for rewards. The nearest contract will be marked for hacking, although you can hack any contract. The number of contracts required depends on team size: solos and duos hack one, while trios and quads hack two. Hacking all required contracts completes the mission, rewarding your team with XP and ten periodic cash payments. Letting time run out or losing your team results in failure.Spy DroneThis contract spawns multiple drones in a circle formation near your team. The number of drones varies with team size—solos face five, duos six, trios seven, and quads eight. Destroy all drones to complete the contract and earn cash, XP, a UAV, and redeploy drone beacon from the last drone. Failure results if time expires or your team is wiped out.Elite ContractsThese are tougher versions of existing contracts, offering higher rewards. Elite Contracts reduce the contract time by 45% and reward an additional 1,500 cash on completion. Completing an Elite Contract also drops a reward crate with items, including an ammo pile, armor plate, ultra-rare weapon, and one of several rare items such as a UAV, redeploy drone beacon, deployable kiosk, or, with low probability, a Specialist or Foresight. Note that Most Wanted contracts cannot become Elite, although other contracts might turn Elite as the match progresses.Contract AdjustmentsBounty Completing the contract now includes finishing downed targets you didn’t down yourself.Bounty contracts should no longer start without a valid target.\"Poached\" end state now counts as a contract failure for challenge tracking.Most Wanted Removed the redeploy token from the Most Wanted reward crate in solos.Scavenger The primary reward in Battle Royale and Resurgence is now an armor plate carrier.PUBLIC EVENTSBattle Royale \u0026 ResurgenceFiresale All items in the buy station are discounted at 50% for a limited time.Restock All Supply Boxes close and are refilled with items.Jailbreak All operators in gulag and eliminated operators are redeployed at the end of a timer.Fly Buy A series of drones drop a number of deployable buy stations across the warzone.Recon Flyover Avoid the detection of overhead drones to prevent your location from being broadcast.Squad Loadout Drop Loadout drops that are only accessible by their assigned team.Battle RoyaleContested Loadout Drop Limited number of loadout drops that are accessible by any team.Cash Drop A number of crates are dropped across the field that, when captured, drop a bounty of cash.Contractor All contracts pay out more when completed within a timer.Rogue Signal All teams compete on a random task -- the top teams get access to a reward with exclusive loot.ResurgenceBounty Royale All teams are automatically assigned a Bounty contract.High Stakes A number of crates are dropped across the warzone that, when captured, double the XP earn in the current match for the team while also drop high tier loot.PlunderBlood Money For the duration of the event, operators that are eliminated drop significantly more money.Attack Choppers Once the match enters overtime, attack choppers enter the warzone. Take them down for a large payout.GulagLocked \u0026 Loaded Start the match with full armor and upgraded guns.Go Again Get another chance at gulag if you lose your fight.Cash Drop The ground loot is replaced with all cash.Climb \u0026 Punishment Ladder's drop in the center of the Gulag.

Most weapons sit quite closely in both performance and pick rate, with no weapons dominating in both areas. As such our first round of Season 01 tuning changes will not be introducing any major shifts to the current state of weapon balance, and instead focus on elevating some of the weapons at the bottom of the pack. We are also addressing feedback regarding Assault Rifle damage in Hardcore and completing our adjustments to the shotgun slug attachment.Reminder: We're using a new Weapon Damage Adjustments tables to identify post-patch damage changes when possible. Need an explainer? Click here!All WeaponsAdjusted weapon motion while moving and changing stances to improve aiming feel and centering (especially with optics).Hold Breath focus state will now be maintained while firing if applicable.Improved Weapon depth of field settings when performing a Weapon Inspect.We are increasing the damage values for some of our Assault Rifles to ensure that they kill in just one bullet in Hardcore modes. The headshot multiplier changes have either kept the bullets to kill with headshots the same or even improved them at some Min Damage Ranges.ShotgunsStrelok Laser Attachment AdjustmentsIncreased the time it takes to reach ADS spread from 20% of Aim Down Sight Speed to 70% of Aim Down Sight SpeedSlug Attachment AdjustmentsSlugs allow players to run shotguns as mid-range precision weapons. As a tradeoff, they have limited short range effectiveness if you are not carefully hitting headshotsMarksman RiflesWe are adjusting handling stats on the burst rifles so that they fit more squarely into their intended roles. The Swat 5.56 has a slower fire rate within each burst and more recoil, making it better suited for mid-range engagements. Meanwhile the AEK-973 has better stability and precision, but a longer burst delay makes it a riskier pick when playing aggressively. We are also significantly reducing the power of the AEK-973 Rapid Fire, which was too strong not to take.Sniper riflesWe have been monitoring feedback on Sniper Rifles and are making some changes to promote more build diversity and improve the sniping experience before gaining access to a complete attachment set. We are lowering the baseline flinch on all Snipers and reducing the Flinch Resistance given by stock attachments. The resulting received flinch values are much lower up front and just a bit lower overall after equipping the stocks. We are also increasing Aim Walking Movement Speed bonuses on stock attachments to make those choices more valuable.Lastly, we are improving the ADS Idle Sway delay by default on all Snipers, meaning that on average there will be less deviation from your point of aim when entering ADS. Our goal is to support the various sniping playstyles you all enjoy through several viable weapon builds. We will continue to monitor weapon and attachment data as well as your feedback to ensure that all sniping playstyles are fun and rewarding in Black Ops 6.Sniper Rifle Class AdjustmentsAll snipers now have 1 second of 50% Idle Sway scaling at the beginning of Aim Down SightAll snipers have had base Flinch Resistance improved by 17%GunsmithVarious updates to weapon descriptions.Addressed an issue where stickers would appear in the Decal slot.PerksSlight reduction to Ninja footstep volume.

We do not intend to inherit all MP weapon tuning without looking at how it affects Zombies tuning as well.We have corrected this in this update, while also making a pass on increasing the damage performance of ARs in Zombies. All ARs have had their Pack-a-Punched base damage and overall critical damage increased. While you may see the word \"decreased\" in a few places, the performance for these weapons is still increased overall!Additionally, the HE-1 Launcher has gotten a buff to become more useful at stopping hordes of zombies. When Pack-a-Punched, it will now have more stock ammo and a larger explosion with more overall damage.Bug FixesAddressed an issue where camos were not being applied to Zombie Builds.Closed an exploit that allowed players to have 3 weapons.Addressed an issue where Wallbuy rarity would reset when loading into a save.Addressed an issue where yellow damage numbers would appear when hitting a critical spot with the Ray Gun.PerksQuick ReviveDying Wish Augment Addressed an issue where Dying Wish could activate when diving from large heights while protected from fall damage.Elemental Pop Addressed an issue where Elemental Pop would prevent normal Ammo Mod activations.Jugger-nog Turtle Shell Augment Turtle Shell will now apply damage mitigation when being grabbed by an Amalgam.PHD Flopper Addressed an issue where diving onto an elevated or inclined surface, such as stairs or up a hill, would not activate the perk.GobbleGumsAddressed an issue that prevented players revived by Near Death Experience from keeping all their Perks.Field UpgradesAdjusted the description for the Energy Mine to no longer say it deals Electrical damage to accurately reflect the damage type.Increased Dark Flare damage from 25% to 40% of the base zombie max health per tick.Addressed an issue where an extra charge on Field Upgrades would be lost when loading a save.SupportAddressed an issue that could cause the Mutant Injection to end early when near water.Addressed an issue that allowed the player to pick up a Sentry Turret while using Mutant Injection.Reduced self-damage from the LDBR.Save \u0026 LoadClosed an exploit that allowed keeping a save file after it had already been loaded.EnemiesAddressed an issue where zombies charmed by Brain Rot could prevent the player from completing an exfil.Addressed an issue where loading a save would disable the rampage inducer if it was active.Addressed an issue where zombies would throw guts at the end camera if the player leaves the match to end the game.Terminus Addressed an issue where rarely the round would not end after killing all zombies.Addressed an issue where the Amalgam could grab the player while slowed.Addressed an issue where the Amalgam could pull players into walls causing them to get stuck.Addressed an issue where diving while being hit by knockback from Patient 13 could push the player further than intended.Liberty Falls Addressed an issue that prevented the Abomination from spawning inside Fuller’s Liberty Lanes.Addressed an issue where the Abomination could fire off a beam attack before leaving a spawn closet.ActivitiesAddressed an issue that would prevent one elite from spawning consistently during exfil from rounds 16 onwardUpdated S.A.M. Trials that required the player to not take damage to display a progress bar instead of a timer.Terminus. Addressed an issue where players would be able to use Equipment, Scorestreaks, and fire weapons during the Boat Race awards sequence.XP Earn RatesAddressed an issue where XP was being awarded to all weapons being used in an assist instead of just the last one. If two weapons were used in an assist only the last one used by the players getting the assist will be awarded XP.ChallengesAddressed an issue where Wall Buys would not progress the Prestige 8 Challenge Value Town.Addressed an issue where Legendary GobbleGums would progress the Ultra Prestige 8 Challenge Full Power instead of Ultra GobbleGums.Addressed an issue where the Liberated Challenge could be completed by saving and quitting before starting the final encounter.Addressed an issue that would complete the Social Distancing and Invincible Challenges by joining a game in progress.Addressed an issue that would complete the Harbinger of Doom Challenge when loading into a saved game and using a Scorestreak.Addressed an issue where the Prestige 5 Challenge Fire \u0026 Forget would mention needing a Bombing Run medal instead a Lethality medal.Addressed an issue where the player would not complete Outrageous Challenge until Round 16 instead of Round 15.Addressed an issue where loading a save past Round 25 would complete the Sticks N’ Stones Challenge.Addressed an issue where the Dark Journey Challenge could show as not complete when unlocking Nebula on 33 weapons and being awarded the Calling Card.AFK DetectionWe have updated the detection logic to determine if a player is AFK during an active match. This should reduce the amount of false positive AFK kicks in Zombies.Added AFK Kick warning UI to ZMUIUpdated visuals on all GobbleGums to improve readability.Addressed an issue where the Boat UI would overlap with the Map with the Central Command HUD preset.Addressed an issue where the Drop Node Connecter prompt during the Terminus Main Quest would overlap with the Map with the Central Command HUD preset.Addressed an issue where the Round number would initially be displayed incorrectly when loading a save.Addressed an issue where the Weapon Stats on the AAR would show the loadout players started with instead of the loadout they ended with.Addressed an issue where some items would show the wrong text on the Tac Map when pinged.Removed Multiplayer information from Melee Weapon descriptions.Added a Highest Round icon to the AAR when reaching a new personal highest round.Added a timer to the scoreboard.Added a notification when picking up Intel.GraphicsAddressed an issue on PS4 where some effects would stop rendering at higher rounds.Addressed an issue where some effects for the Mutant Injection were not working when Sprinting.Addressed an issue where the character effects from Brutus would be present during Mutant Injection.Liberty Falls Addressed an issue where some damaged vehicles would not have smoke effects.StabilityAddressed an issue where the game could crash when attempting to start a solo match after playing in splitscreen.Addressed an issue where sometimes the player would be unable to Save \u0026 Quit with the error \"The game failed to save for an unknown reason.

This map is set in the Nevada desert at the Echo Ridge Weapons Station — a hidden 1950s government site abandoned after a reactor leak. The map offers intense, tactical combat through desert roadways, open trenches, and pipework around a central Reactor “bullseye,” anticipated as the hottest drop zone. Another key point of interest is a massive crane suspending a Nuketown house in the Loading Bay, adding to the map's unique and dynamic environment.Points of InterestReactorBunkerTest SiteMannequin AssemblyCooling TowersNuketown ShippingLoading BayWarehouseManufacturingPodsReturning MapsUrzikstanThe \"big map\" returns to its early days featuring familiar landmarks from before the destruction of Popov Power Plant and the arrival of the Atlas Superstore.Enhanced with Black Ops 6 innovations, Urzikstan is the staging ground for a fierce Ranked Play Battle Royale later when Season 01's Mid-Season launches.Rebirth IslandThe infamous prison island returns during Season 01's playlist with Resurgence Modes, enhanced by Omnimovement, Black Ops 6 weaponry, and Killstreaks for added tactical intensity.Map AdjustmentsUrzikstan, Rebirth IslandVehicles All new vehicles with improved handling, detailed further below.Brand new dirtbike for quick rotation.Loot All new Black Ops 6 ground loot including weapons and equipment.Visuals Lighting and visual improvements to the map with Black Ops 6 technology.Sound Audio improvements to in-game sound effects including footsteps balance tuning.Rebirth IslandSubmarine The Submarine POI introduced earlier this year now appears 100% of the time.Redeploy Drones Increased Redeploy Drone count and spawn rate for balancing later circles.Biometric Scanner \u0026 Weapon Trade Station Rewards for the Biometric Scanner and Weapon Trade Station have been rebalanced and updated to Black Ops 6 loot.MODESReturning ModesBattle RoyaleThis mode offers the classic Warzone experience, centered around high-risk, high-reward gameplay.

This allows players to Sprint, Slide, and Dive in any direction, perform 180-degree Combat Dives, and execute advanced moves like the Combat Supine and Omni-Sprint for dynamic tactical play.Combat SupineDrop to a prone position, then rotate your Operator for a complete 360-degree view of your surroundings. Then fire to eliminate the enemy quickly as they appear, all the while staying in the supine position.Intelligent Movement Players can now customize elements of how they traverse landscape and navigate combat.Available in the Keyboard \u0026 Mouse or Controller Options under “Movement,” players will find the following features: Sprint Assist: Choose whether to manually or automatically sprint, tactically sprint, how much of a delay before sprinting begins, and if the assist occurs while sprinting sideways or backwards.Mantle Assist: Customize how and when to automatically mantle over obstacles.Crouch Assist: This enables crouching and sliding when the intent is to move through a valid opening.Corner Slice: Allows the act of inclining weapons (and camera) when adjacent to or moving around a corner. This doesn’t affect aim. Default is “on.”Unlimited Tac Sprint Players will have access to unlimited tac sprint via the Sprinter Perk or by holding their dedicated melee weapon.Mantle Protection Players will now climb onto thin or high ledges rather than over them to prevent untimely deaths.Movement AdjustmentsTac Sprint Duration We heard feedback around default tac sprint duration, so it has been increased from 2 seconds to 4 seconds.Landing Tuning The duration of the shock effect when falling from a near-death height has been reduced to 2.1 seconds from 3 seconds.The minimum fall damage required before the shock effect from landing is now 55%, up from 50% allowing for slightly higher jumps with less punishment.This change is made to better enable the movement opportunities that the Black Ops 6 integration allows.Vertical Ascenders \u0026 Horizontal Zipline Improvements Quality of LifeInteracting with the Ascenders and Ziplines lines has been improved, making it easier to attach to the line from an angle or while free falling to increase fluidity.Redeploy Drones Redeploy Drones are fixed in place for the duration of a match.Once a Redeploy Drone has been consumed by the gas, it will leave the map rather than relocating to give a more consistent experience.INVENTORYStreamlined Inventory At the start of Season 01, we're streamlining the inventory system by removing the “Backpack” and returning to a classic inventory layout, organized by sections for cash, gas mask, armor plates, killstreaks, field upgrades, weapons, ammo and perks.PERKSPerks in Warzone are now streamlined, allowing players to choose three Perks (one from each color-coded slot) in the Loadouts Menu. Most Pick-3 Perks unlock as you level up but re-lock upon Prestiging. Black Ops 6 player levels carry over to Warzone, unlocking corresponding Perks.GeneralLootable Perks Lootable Perks return! Each season, players will encounter a number of perks via Ground Loot and Supply Boxes. These perk effects stack on top of the original Pick-3 Perks players have selected in their loadout.When a player is eliminated, their Pick-3 Perks will drop on the ground as a “Custom Perk Pack” to be recovered or stolen by another player, while any looted perks will disappear.The Lootable Perks players can find include a mix of perks from the 18 possible Pick-3 Perks, in addition to two perks that are unique to ground loot; ShroudedIrradiatedPlayers will recognize their Pick-3 Perks when they are equipped in the bottom right of the HUD, while lootable perks can be viewed in the Inventory.Specialist Perk Package Found as a rare loot drop or Care Package reward, Specialist grants every Perk including all 18 Pick-3 Perks, as well as both Ground Loot exclusive Perks - Irradiated and Shrouded.If you're eliminated, the Specialist Perk package will disappear.Can be acquired in Buy Stations in limited quantities for $30,000.Pre-Match Perks Quality of Life Perks can now be edited in the pre-match lobby.WILDCARDSFirst introduced in Black Ops Cold War, Wildcards come to Warzone with 4 options that act as special, single-use perks for each loadout. These loadout modifiers allow players to equip more gear, weapons, or attachments, adding unique customization and variety to gameplay.Available WildcardsBandolier• Your loadout provides a Munitions Satchel.• This Wildcard is only available in Warzone.• Unlocked at player level 15Overkill• Equip two Primary or Secondary weapons.• Unlocked at player level 24Gunfighter• Get 3 extra attachment points for your Primary weapon.• This only applies to Black Ops 6 weapons.• Unlocked at player level 33Battle Ready• Your loadout provides a UAV and Utility Box.• This Wildcard is only available in Warzone.• Unlocked at player level 38SATCHELSSatchels are new loot items that expand storage for inventory slots, allowing players to carry more of an item type and improve efficiency.

With the release of Black Ops 6, players can explore new additions to the equipment lineup, some of which we suspect may become fan favorites. We’ve also made several visual and balance adjustments to classic equipment, ensuring a diverse arsenal to choose from.Equipment AdjustmentsWith the Black Ops 6 integration, we have adjusted a number of the Lethal and Tactical equipment to offer a new and fresh arsenal of choices.Maximum Deployed Equipment The maximum number of lethal and tactical equipment that can be planted at the same time has been increased to 3, up from 2.We aligned Warzone with the changes to Multiplayer. This enables some of the new traps to be better utilized and function better with other adjustments like the Munitions Vest and Bomb Squad.Frag Outer damage decreased to 65 from 110.Middle damage increased to 170 from 155.Inner damage decreased to 260 from 275.Frag Cooking IndicatorQuality of Life Players will now notice a UI indicator to better determine the time remaining until a frag detonates.Semtex Explosion radius decreased to 5m from 6.5m.Outer damage decreased to 45 from 110.Inner damage decreased from 200 to180.Throwing Knife Damage decreased to 180 from 200.Drill Charge Outer damage decreased to 39 from 110.Molotov Burn stage damage was reduced to 10,15,25 from 15, 25, 30.Smoke VFX updated to be at parity with Black Ops 6.Experimental Gas Will now deal 10 damage per tick.Snapshot Grenade Radius increased to 15m from 10m.Will now put a mark over a successfully “snapped” target which lasts for 5 seconds.KILLSTREAKSKillstreaks in Warzone, much like Multiplayer’s Scorestreaks, are game-changing tools that players can find via ground loot, Supply Boxes, or as rewards from contracts and events. Many of these Killstreaks are lethal, unleashing devastating airstrikes and explosions that can decimate enemy squads from above. Others are tactical, offering valuable intel on enemy positions or on ideal positioning for upcoming fights. With Black Ops 6, a few new Killstreaks have been introduced designed to give players a real advantage in the heat of battle.Killstreak AdjustmentsBunker Buster The trophy system will now counter the bunker buster.Field Upgrade AdjustmentsHeartbeat Sensor The warning display now highlights in red when enemies are within 15 meters, up from 7.The time between pings has been reduced to 1.5 seconds, down from 2.5 seconds.Munitions Box The munitions crate now grants 3 clips of every ammo type, rather than only refilling your primary and secondary weapon ammo types.With this change players are enabled to make pivots in their weapon choices. A focus on breadth rather than depth of ammo.Portable Radar The duration of the portable radar pulse has been increased from 25 seconds to 30.Personal Redeploy Drone Deploys 50% faster.No longer prohibits firing while in use.Standardized height across the different maps.Reinforcement Flare 30% faster to use.Trophy System Counter charges increased from 3 to 5.WEAPONSIntroductionWe've expanded the Warzone arsenal to include weapons from the launch of Black Ops 6 in October 2024, giving players even more options to customize their loadouts. Dive into Warzone with these powerful additions, now available alongside fan favorites from previous titles.At launch, Black Ops 6 weapons in Warzone will share similar values to their Multiplayer counterparts such as ADS speed, sprint to fire, and recoil. However, damage profiles for a number of weapons have been modified to establish a baseline for Warzone. We encourage new and returning players to study their favorite weapon’s details in the Gunsmith.With the integration of Black Ops 6, we also now have new tuning options for weapons that weren’t previously available, allowing us to adjust aspects like handling (ADS speed and sprint to fire), magazine sizes, recoil, and more. For instance, while the AS VAL has a default magazine size of 20 in Multiplayer, we’ve set it to 30 for Warzone.Our goal is to make weapon adjustments faster to keep the available selection dynamic and engaging, without making any weapons feel obsolete. With these new tuning options, we aim to refine each weapon’s identity and role specific to their use in Warzone, such as emphasizing Assault Rifles as strong long-range options.Additionally, all bolt-action snipers and pump-action shotguns (while aiming down sights) from Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, and Black Ops 6 will have a one-shot headshot potential within their respective max damage ranges. Additionally, in order to incentivize intentional aim, all shotguns will fire 5 pellets while ADSing versus 4 when fired from the hip.We want players to feel that weapons from Modern Warfare II and Modern Warfare III continue to remain solid, viable choices in Warzone. Our goal is to create a unified combat system that makes each gun enjoyable to use, regardless of its origin. We’ll continue to improve legacy weapons and attachments throughout the coming year to further support this vision.Black Ops 6 WeaponsBlack Ops 6 weapons have a unique Warzone damage profile, which includes specific base damage, range, and location-based modifiers.We’ve adjusted several Black Ops 6 attachments to function differently in Warzone:CHF Barrel For Assault Rifles, LMGs, DMRs, SMGs, and Pistols: This now grants an increased neck multiplier rather than a head multiplier.For Sniper Rifles and Shotguns: This now provides increased leg modifiers instead of arm modifiers.Flip Magazine The magazine capacity penalty from Multiplayer has been removed. In Warzone, flip mags match the base weapon's ammo capacity.Rapid Fire This attachment now applies a base damage penalty in Warzone, along with greater penalties to bullet velocity and range.Modern Warfare II \u0026 III WeaponsA visual recoil reduction pass has been applied to Modern Warfare II weapons, enhancing their feel and control while shooting.Barrel and stock attachments from Modern Warfare II have also had their penalties reduced. Additionally, a significant balancing pass has been completed for underbarrel and muzzle attachments from both Modern Warfare II and III. All cons have been removed from these attachments, meaning they now only provide stat boosts, with each subcategory of underbarrels and muzzles functioning identically except for cosmetic differences. AMP attachments in these slots, however, retain their unique functionality and balancing.Muzzle Enhancements Suppressors: Boost velocity and damage range.Comps: Improve recoil control.Flash Hiders: Increase damage range and firing aim stability.Breacher: Enhance melee damage and recoil control.Underbarrel Enhancements Angled Grip: Increases hipfire and tacstance accuracy and aim walking steadiness.Handstop: Improves sprint-to-fire and ADS speed.Vert Grip: Enhances recoil control and firing aim stability.Furthermore, Modern Warfare II and III weapons now have corner-slicing functionality, adding an extra tactical edge.Global Weapon BuildsSeamlessly access a custom weapon build you've created across Black Ops 6 Multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. This time-saving feature lets you adjust any Build or Blueprint in one game, with changes automatically applied wherever that weapon is equipped. To create a build, select a base weapon or Blueprint, add attachments and cosmetics in the Gunsmith, and return to the Custom Loadout screen to save it. The build, with all selected customizations, will then appear in other modes under the same weapon type.New WeaponsThese weapons are new to Season 01 and were not part of the original launch of Black Ops 6 Multiplayer in October 2024.Krig C Assault Rifle Full-auto assault rifle.

Equipping the 12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath Fire Mod prevents using Barrel Attachments, but the tradeoff is well worth it when seeking a fiery finish.Compatible with ShotgunsAcquired via Battle Pass Page 7 RewardBuffer Weight Stock (In-Season) The heavier Buffer Weight Stock provides significantly smoother action through the additional resistance met by the bolt carrier group. The improvement results in more manageable recoil through sustained fire, ideal for staying on target though at the expense of ADS Speed and Aim Walk Movement Speed.Compatible with XM4 Assault Rifle, XMG LMG, DM-10 Marksman RifleAcquired via Event RewardBurst Fire Conversion (In-Season) Convert the XM4 Assault Rifle’s primary firing mode into a three-round burst to help conserve ammo and stay on target. There’s an impressive lack of recoil too, so it’s still possible to pump out consistent damage when facing heavy threats.Compatible with XM4 Assault RifleAcquired via Event RewardBurst Fire Conversion (In-Season) Convert the Kompakt 92 SMG’s primary firing mode into an exceptionally rapid three-round burst. Equipping the Burst Fire Conversion Fire Mod locks the Underbarrel and Barrel Attachment slots. When you need to fire quickly in close quarters, hold down the trigger to automatically cycle through burst shots.Compatible with Kompakt 92 SMGAcquired via Event RewardWeapon AdjustmentsThe following weapon adjustments are strictly limited to Modern Warfare II and III weapons. It's a lot.Future patch notes for Black Ops 6 weapons will follow the table format introduced with the launch of Black Ops 6.CLICK HERE TO SHOW/HIDE INFOLOOTGround \u0026 Supply Box Loot Added Black Ops 6 items including: WeaponsField Equipment: War Cry, ScramblerKillstreaks: Napalm Strike, Sentry Gun, SAM Turret, Care PackageLethals: Throwing Axe, Blast Trap, Impact Grenade, Spring MineTacticals: Neurogas Mine, Prox Alarm, Spy CameraPerks: Grenadier, Combat Tracker, Dexterity, Cold-Blooded, Irradiated, ShroudedSatchels: Armor Satchel, Munitions SatchelRemoval of the following: Killstreaks: Cluster Mine, Mosquito Drone, GuardianLethals: Proxy Mine, Claymore, Thermite, Breacher DroneTacticals: Tracker Grenade, Scatter MineRedeploy tokensLoot Distribution The loot distribution system will now create further space for larger items as they are dropped to the ground to avoid overlapping loot.The loot distribution system will now purposely avoid dropping items near objects in close proximity such as Buy Stations.Medical CabinetsQuality of Life Loot that drops out of medical cabinets now drops within closer proximity of its origin.Buy StationsBuy Station inventory and prices have had slight adjustments with the Black Ops 6 integration.Weapon Outlines Quality of LifeWeapons now have rarity outlines to help players better evaluate the options at their disposal throughout a match.CONTRACTSAvailable ContractsBelow is a summary of each contract type to help both new and returning players quickly grasp how each one functions with the integration of Black Ops 6. These summaries cover key objectives, mechanics, and rewards, making it easier for players to jump in and engage with contracts confidently.BountyWhen you pick up a Bounty contract, a nearby player will be selected as your target. A circle will appear on your tac map, periodically updating to show the target’s location. The target will be somewhere within this circle each time it updates, and the circle gradually shrinks as you move closer. The target can also see an indicator on their HUD showing how close the closest player from your hunting team is; this is displayed as a three-level \"threat indicator.\" Completing the contract by killing the target rewards cash, XP, and a singular ping from the bounty target’s body. If another team kills the target, your contract ends with a \"poached\" outcome, offering a lesser reward. Allowing the timer to run out or losing your team will fail the contract.Big Game BountyThis contract works similarly to the base Bounty but with a few twists. It only spawns after Circle 2 closes and prioritizes teams with the highest cumulative kills, provided they’re not already bounty targets. If you complete this contract by eliminating the target, you’ll earn an immediate advanced UAV ping along with extra cash and XP, offering greater rewards than a standard Bounty.ScavengerUpon picking up a Scavenger contract, three scavenger caches will spawn near the pickup spot. You’ll be directed to each cache one at a time, with the next cache revealed only after you open the previous one. Opening a cache adds 45 seconds to the contract timer. These caches contain slightly better loot than usual, and each will drop a lootable perk. Opening the third and final cache completes the contract, rewarding your team with cash, XP, and an armor satchel from the last cache. Failing to open all caches before time runs out, or having your team wiped, will fail the contract.IntelWhen you accept an Intel contract, a nearby upload station will be marked for your team to upload sensitive intel. Reaching the station and interacting with it initiates an \"upload\" phase where one team member must remain near the station until the upload is complete. If multiple players are in this radius, the upload speed can increase by up to 200%. Completing the upload rewards cash, XP, and a peek at the next circle’s location. Failure occurs if the timer expires or if your team is wiped.Most WantedBy picking up the Most Wanted contract, you or the team member who picked it up becomes visible on the map for all players. Opponents who kill the Most Wanted target receive cash and XP, while the Most Wanted team can reduce their contract time by obtaining kills and opening loot caches (10-second reduction per cache, 25-second reduction per kill). If the Most Wanted target survives the full contract duration, the contract is completed, and the team earns cash, XP, and revives any dead squad members. Whether the contract ends in success or failure, a \"VIP reward crate\" appears near the VIP’s location, containing ammo, plates, a killstreak, a weapon, a Gulag token, and cash.Signals IntelligenceThis contract directs your team to hack nearby contracts for rewards. The nearest contract will be marked for hacking, although you can hack any contract. The number of contracts required depends on team size: solos and duos hack one, while trios and quads hack two. Hacking all required contracts completes the mission, rewarding your team with XP and ten periodic cash payments. Letting time run out or losing your team results in failure.Spy DroneThis contract spawns multiple drones in a circle formation near your team. The number of drones varies with team size—solos face five, duos six, trios seven, and quads eight. Destroy all drones to complete the contract and earn cash, XP, a UAV, and redeploy drone beacon from the last drone. Failure results if time expires or your team is wiped out.Elite ContractsThese are tougher versions of existing contracts, offering higher rewards. Elite Contracts reduce the contract time by 45% and reward an additional 1,500 cash on completion. Completing an Elite Contract also drops a reward crate with items, including an ammo pile, armor plate, ultra-rare weapon, and one of several rare items such as a UAV, redeploy drone beacon, deployable kiosk, or, with low probability, a Specialist or Foresight. Note that Most Wanted contracts cannot become Elite, although other contracts might turn Elite as the match progresses.Contract AdjustmentsBounty Completing the contract now includes finishing downed targets you didn’t down yourself.Bounty contracts should no longer start without a valid target.\"Poached\" end state now counts as a contract failure for challenge tracking.Most Wanted Removed the redeploy token from the Most Wanted reward crate in solos.Scavenger The primary reward in Battle Royale and Resurgence is now an armor plate carrier.PUBLIC EVENTSBattle Royale \u0026 ResurgenceFiresale All items in the buy station are discounted at 50% for a limited time.Restock All Supply Boxes close and are refilled with items.Jailbreak All operators in gulag and eliminated operators are redeployed at the end of a timer.Fly Buy A series of drones drop a number of deployable buy stations across the warzone.Recon Flyover Avoid the detection of overhead drones to prevent your location from being broadcast.Squad Loadout Drop Loadout drops that are only accessible by their assigned team.Battle RoyaleContested Loadout Drop Limited number of loadout drops that are accessible by any team.Cash Drop A number of crates are dropped across the field that, when captured, drop a bounty of cash.Contractor All contracts pay out more when completed within a timer.Rogue Signal All teams compete on a random task -- the top teams get access to a reward with exclusive loot.ResurgenceBounty Royale All teams are automatically assigned a Bounty contract.High Stakes A number of crates are dropped across the warzone that, when captured, double the XP earn in the current match for the team while also drop high tier loot.PlunderBlood Money For the duration of the event, operators that are eliminated drop significantly more money.Attack Choppers Once the match enters overtime, attack choppers enter the warzone. Take them down for a large payout.GulagLocked \u0026 Loaded Start the match with full armor and upgraded guns.Go Again Get another chance at gulag if you lose your fight.Cash Drop The ground loot is replaced with all cash.Climb \u0026 Punishment Ladder's drop in the center of the Gulag.

Another key point of interest is a massive crane suspending a Nuketown house in the Loading Bay, adding to the map\u0026#39;s unique and dynamic environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003ePoints of Interest\u003c/b\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eReactor\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBunker\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTest Site\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMannequin Assembly\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCooling Towers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNuketown Shipping\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLoading Bay\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWarehouse\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eManufacturing\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePods\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cu\u003eReturning Maps\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch4\u003eUrzikstan\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u0026#34;big map\u0026#34; returns to its early days featuring familiar landmarks from before the destruction of Popov Power Plant and the arrival of the Atlas Superstore.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEnhanced with Black Ops 6 innovations, Urzikstan is the staging ground for a fierce Ranked Play Battle Royale later when Season 01\u0026#39;s Mid-Season launches.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eRebirth Island\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe infamous prison island returns during Season 01\u0026#39;s playlist with Resurgence Modes, enhanced by Omnimovement, Black Ops 6 weaponry, and Killstreaks for added tactical intensity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cu\u003eMap Adjustments\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch4\u003eUrzikstan, Rebirth Island\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eVehicles \u003c/b\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll new vehicles with improved handling, detailed further below.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBrand new dirtbike for quick rotation.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eLoot \u003c/b\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll new Black Ops 6 ground loot including weapons and equipment.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eVisuals \u003c/b\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLighting and visual improvements to the map with Black Ops 6 technology.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eSound \u003c/b\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAudio improvements to in-game sound effects including footsteps balance tuning.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch4\u003eRebirth Island\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eSubmarine \u003c/b\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Submarine POI introduced earlier this year now appears 100% of the time.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eRedeploy Drones \u003c/b\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIncreased Redeploy Drone count and spawn rate for balancing later circles.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eBiometric Scanner \u0026amp; Weapon Trade Station \u003c/b\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRewards for the Biometric Scanner and Weapon Trade Station have been rebalanced and updated to Black Ops 6 loot.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMODES\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cu\u003eReturning Modes\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch4\u003eBattle Royale\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis mode offers the classic Warzone experience, centered around high-risk, high-reward gameplay.

Our goal is to create a unified combat system that makes each gun enjoyable to use, regardless of its origin.

These summaries cover key objectives, mechanics, and rewards, making it easier for players to jump in and engage with contracts confidently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eBounty\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you pick up a Bounty contract, a nearby player will be selected as your target. A circle will appear on your tac map, periodically updating to show the target’s location. The target will be somewhere within this circle each time it updates, and the circle gradually shrinks as you move closer. The target can also see an indicator on their HUD showing how close the closest player from your hunting team is; this is displayed as a three-level \u0026#34;threat indicator.\u0026#34; Completing the contract by killing the target rewards cash, XP, and a singular ping from the bounty target’s body. If another team kills the target, your contract ends with a \u0026#34;poached\u0026#34; outcome, offering a lesser reward. Allowing the timer to run out or losing your team will fail the contract.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eBig Game Bounty\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis contract works similarly to the base Bounty but with a few twists. It only spawns after Circle 2 closes and prioritizes teams with the highest cumulative kills, provided they’re not already bounty targets. If you complete this contract by eliminating the target, you’ll earn an immediate advanced UAV ping along with extra cash and XP, offering greater rewards than a standard Bounty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eScavenger\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eUpon picking up a Scavenger contract, three scavenger caches will spawn near the pickup spot. You’ll be directed to each cache one at a time, with the next cache revealed only after you open the previous one. Opening a cache adds 45 seconds to the contract timer. These caches contain slightly better loot than usual, and each will drop a lootable perk. Opening the third and final cache completes the contract, rewarding your team with cash, XP, and an armor satchel from the last cache. Failing to open all caches before time runs out, or having your team wiped, will fail the contract.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eIntel\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you accept an Intel contract, a nearby upload station will be marked for your team to upload sensitive intel. Reaching the station and interacting with it initiates an \u0026#34;upload\u0026#34; phase where one team member must remain near the station until the upload is complete. If multiple players are in this radius, the upload speed can increase by up to 200%. Completing the upload rewards cash, XP, and a peek at the next circle’s location. Failure occurs if the timer expires or if your team is wiped.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eMost Wanted\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy picking up the Most Wanted contract, you or the team member who picked it up becomes visible on the map for all players. Opponents who kill the Most Wanted target receive cash and XP, while the Most Wanted team can reduce their contract time by obtaining kills and opening loot caches (10-second reduction per cache, 25-second reduction per kill). If the Most Wanted target survives the full contract duration, the contract is completed, and the team earns cash, XP, and revives any dead squad members. Whether the contract ends in success or failure, a \u0026#34;VIP reward crate\u0026#34; appears near the VIP’s location, containing ammo, plates, a killstreak, a weapon, a Gulag token, and cash.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSignals Intelligence\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis contract directs your team to hack nearby contracts for rewards. The nearest contract will be marked for hacking, although you can hack any contract. The number of contracts required depends on team size: solos and duos hack one, while trios and quads hack two. Hacking all required contracts completes the mission, rewarding your team with XP and ten periodic cash payments. Letting time run out or losing your team results in failure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSpy Drone\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis contract spawns multiple drones in a circle formation near your team. The number of drones varies with team size—solos face five, duos six, trios seven, and quads eight. Destroy all drones to complete the contract and earn cash, XP, a UAV, and redeploy drone beacon from the last drone. Failure results if time expires or your team is wiped out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eElite Contracts\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese are tougher versions of existing contracts, offering higher rewards. Elite Contracts reduce the contract time by 45% and reward an additional 1,500 cash on completion. Completing an Elite Contract also drops a reward crate with items, including an ammo pile, armor plate, ultra-rare weapon, and one of several rare items such as a UAV, redeploy drone beacon, deployable kiosk, or, with low probability, a Specialist or Foresight.
