  "text": "Helldivers, get to your Super Destroyers! In a surprise turn of events that even our top researchers couldn’t predict, the Illuminate have finally revealed their intentions, emerging from the Meridian singularity, and setting a course for Super Earth. It’s now more important than ever that we band together and stop this salvo from destroying our liberty. New enemies The Illuminate threat has grown, unleashing new terrors on our citizens across the galaxy. Reports indicate the Illuminate have deployed larger, more powerful enemies within their fleet, among them are the Stingray: jetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky, targeting Helldivers and lining up devastating strafing runs. Another new foe is the Crescent Overseer, which has the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover. But perhaps most terrifying are the reports of a failed Illuminate experiment called the Fleshmob: a Frankenstein’s monster of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy. There have been sightings of other, even larger ships, though details remain unclear on their abilities. But we can’t underestimate the squids, divers, and that’s why we’re assembling our best and brightest to push them back into oblivion where they belong. We have to gather all our resources to face this incursion and, fortunately, Super Earth’s R\u0026D department has unlocked some powerful tools for our Helldivers, in the hopes that they will help crush the onslaught of Illuminate invaders. Customize your loadout Helldivers are being given access to a robust new weapon customization feature for the bulk of our primary weapon offerings. Most primary weapons now have levels that are achievable by completing missions, which then in turn unlock new attachments obtainable through Requisition. In addition to attachments, players can also unlock patterns for their weapons. Whether it’s tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazines for ammo capacity, muzzles to optimize weapon performance characteristics or adjusting under-barrel attachments for the handling you want, you’re in command of how your weaponry performs on the battlefield. This level of individual attunement is sure to make your favorite primary best in its class. Old Warbonds, new patterns We have unlocked and deployed a stash of patterns for the FRV themed on our Viper Commandos, Freedom’s Flame, Chemical Agents, and Truth Enforcers Warbonds. These will help your squad stand out to aid in battlefield coordination and collaboration. This backlog of patterns will unlock for Helldivers on May 15, with the launch of the Masters of Ceremony Warbond! Expanded Surplus The Superstore is also getting an emergency expansion to boost your arsenals for the fight. No more waiting for items to come back into rotation–now the items you want are always available, ready to stock your ship and armor your Helldivers with items you might have missed the first time around. This is the moment of truth, Helldivers. Everyone to the front lines and fight for our right to spread Managed Democracy! *Requires base game, paid purchase of Super Credits, and game progression to unlock. Trending Stories",
