  "text": "Image credit: BARB The team at MindsEye studio Build A Rocket Boy is \"heartbroken that not every player was able to experience the game as we intended,\" it has said, promising more fixes throughout June. MindsEye released earlier this week, however it wasn't the smoothest of launches. Many found themselves presented with distorting character bugs and stuttering issues when they booted up the game. Build A Rocket Boy released a statement yesterday, when it said it would be prioritising gameplay performance with an update. \"Our teams have worked tirelessly throughout the night to solve many of these issues, and we have now identified that the vast majority of crashes were caused by a memory leak,\" the developer has since shared on the MindsEye Discord, adding roughly one in 10 players were impacted. The Death of Console Exclusives Is Inevitable and I Don't Know How I Feel About It The Death of Console Exclusives Is Inevitable and I Don't Know How I Feel About It. Watch on YouTube \"We have developed a hotfix that addresses this issue (alongside other issues that our players have highlighted), which we are working hard to deploy as soon as tomorrow on PC and on consoles once it passes certification with PlayStation and Xbox,\" it continued, stating the team is \"fully committed to ensuring all players have a great experience\". Build A Rocket Boy additionally shared its hotfix plans for up until the end of June. These are: Friday, June 13-15 – Hotfix #1 – PC \u0026 Console What players can expect: Initial CPU and GPU performance improvements, along with memory optimisations Reduced difficulty for the CPR mini-game A new setting to disable or adjust Depth of Field Fix for missing controls in the MineHunter and Run Dungeon mini-games Pop-up warnings for PCs with Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling disabled and for PCs with CPUs prone to crashes Hotfix #2 – Week of June 16 – PC \u0026 Console What players can expect: Continuous incremental performance and stability improvements Fix for the buggy wheels not visually spinning while driving Fix for areas in Car Manufacturing where players could fall through the world By End of June – Update 3 – PC \u0026 Console What players can expect: Ongoing performance \u0026 stability improvements Rebalanced \"Hard\" difficulty setting Animation fixes AI improvements Image credit: Build a Rocket Boy / IOI MindsEye has had an unusual lead up to launch, it has to be said. At the end of May, the studio's co-CEO suggested the game's negative reaction up until that point had been paid for in a \"concerted effort\" against the developer. This is something IO Interactive, which serves as the game's publisher, doesn't believe to be the case. Meanwhile, the studio's Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer left the company, just one week before MindsEye released.",
