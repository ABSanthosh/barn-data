  "text": "In Hotel Architect, you make complex calls as you run and build your own hotel so that you can make a profit and keep guests happy. Management simulators can either feel extremely boring and tedious or like a fun version of doing a job you never actually want to take on in real life. This game allows you to build your hotel, manage your staff, research upgrades, level up, and explore more locations, making for a fun and sometimes chaotic game. When it comes to Hotel Architect, one of the things you are doing is building. You can easily define rooms and build them up, but you need to hire workers whenever you want to add stuff to your hotel. I found this to be quite interesting, as you cannot just click and add a new vending machine. Instead, you need to blueprint what you want, then hire some construction workers to bring it to you. These construction workers are paid per hour and will stay until you tell them to leave, so they can be useful but also dangerous to your budget. They will also carry items from their truck to the area they are building, and continue going back unless you purchase a material area, which actually harms the charm of your hotel. This game isn’t only building (however, I did find the building to be easy to do, as someone who hates having to build). It’s easy to see what items are needed for the type of room you are defining, and it’s simple to add more stuff that you want to have in the area. You also do need to hire workers that do different tasks in your hotel – staff to run the reception, clean, cook, and serve. These staff members come with various pros and cons, which are designed like character traits. It was fun watching the perfectionist take ages to plate food, resulting in me lowering their hourly wage as I was as frustrated as the reviewer who came in to check out our hotel. There is so much more you can do in the game from researching new items, following quests that are needed to complete and area, and fulfilling quests that are assigned to the game. If you are losing money too often, you can actually take out a loan or add a really big, bad thing to your hotel. Putting toxic waste in the middle of your lobby can net you about 30 dollars an hour. However, everyone seems really put off by the fact that it’s there. Hotel Architect feels quite polished and like a lot of details are thought through. Even the tutorial, which had full voice acting, was quite a fun one to sit through. There’s a lot of freedom in creating your hotel and seeing what happens with the customers within it. Hotel Architect is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can grab a demo (and add it to your wishlist) on Steam.
