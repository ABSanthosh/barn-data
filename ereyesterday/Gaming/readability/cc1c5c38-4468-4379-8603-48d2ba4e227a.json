Steam Autumn Sale 2024 That said, the autumnal event from Steam does have a purpose… a purpose which is why it the event doesn’t kick off at the start of the season, which was back in September, but perilously close to winter and the winter sale… which is to allow for Steam Awards nominations. Steam Awards 2024 The Steam Awards come into their own during the winter sale, where we get to vote on them, but the nominations during the autumn sale are what feeds into that.  I am fairly diligent about participation in both for no real reason… I barely play anything new as any long time reader will attest.  But I still do it, though it can be a bit of a pain… again, usually because I am not always that tied into what even released in a given year or what might be eligible. Steam tunes the voting and nomination process every year, and this year I think they have it just about down.  They now prompt you with two lists, one based upon titles you own and have played, and a second based on the larger community and what has been popular. My choices for game of the year So this year I was at least made to feel like I was nominating things that were in the zone… though I still selected titles that I had played and that are likely not to make the cut.  If you are dying to know you can click on this link and see my nominations. As for the sale itself… it runs just a week, which is another reason it doesn’t come up on my radar.  A number of things on my wishlist are on sale, but nothing I am dying to get right now.  And, of course, the Steam Winter Sale will be here in less than a month.  I will be ready for that when it arrives.",
