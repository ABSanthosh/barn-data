Fantasy Critic League – Like Fantasy Football, but for Video Games Following on from the 2022 hit Elden Ring, a title that made a bunch of dumb game execs think that all they had to do to achieve success was embrace hard mode for everything, and which achieved a score of 96 over on Meta Critic, Elden Ring Nightreign takes the series into the realm of co-op rogue-likes… because rogue-likes are also all the rage. The question was, could Nightreign capture the Elden Ring magic in a slightly different format? But first, the scores as they were when we left off last week. The standings for Week 20 With that baseline, we’ll get straight to the meat of the week, the new releases, starting with Nightreign, which picked up reviews early in the week so it had a score as soon as it released. Elden Ring Nightreign has released! [Picked by Slightly Scuffed Studios (Kluwes)] Now has a score of 79.5 Not a bad score.  As the season progresses I am developing my personal theory of scoring, which includes the idea that more reviews are not better and that franchise titles, which get lots of reviews, tend to end up around 80.  To get to 90+ you have to be a bit fringe, harness a vibe in the review community, and be seen as an indie to grab some sympathy points. With Elden Ring FromSoftware broke out as something fresh and new.  Now, with Elden Ring and having sold a bazillion copies along with an expansion, eyes and expectations were all over Nightreign.  It ended up in the “good for a mainline franchise that can never recapture that initial burst of joy the original brought” category.  Or such is my theory. In support of that, the other releases was an EA mainline franchise, F1 25, which came out like this: F1 25 has released! [Picked by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane)] Now has a score of 80.9 Look at that, an EA annual release racing title managed to do a point better!  Granted, as more reviews came in, it sagged a bit. F1 25 [Picked by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane)] Score has gone DOWN from 80.6 to 79.6 If, at the beginning of the year, you told me that these two titles, with a hype factor 92.1 for Nightreign and 8.2 for F1 25, would end with essentially tied scores I might have suggested you were mad.  But now, in week twenty-one, where titles I expected to be better received seem to fall into the low to mid 80s, I am starting to see a pattern.  Maybe.  Certainly, it feels like the more of the 174 review sites that Open Critic uses to assemble its scoring the more likely the game is to end up around 80. But I’ll keep testing that theory as the year progresses. Anyway, two new releases got us some score updates. Publisher Score Updates Slightly Scuffed Studios (Kluwes) Score has gone UP from 29.8 to 39.8 Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane) Score has gone UP from 27.5 to 37.1 There were some other score changes over the course of the week. Old Skies [Picked by Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss)] Score has gone DOWN from 82.2 to 81.1 Again, more reviews get you close to 80?  Maybe?  That was a big enough move to get a scoreboard update too: Publisher Score Updates Pretty Blue Fox Games (Bhagpuss) Score has gone DOWN from 60.6 to 59.5 Not enough to change the rankings, but Potshot is a little more solid in first I suppose. Likewise, Shawn got hit by more reviews pulling down the average it seems: Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker [Picked by Crash and Burn Games (Shawn)] Score has gone DOWN from 88.6 to 87.3 Meanwhile, Cyanbane got a bit of an additional boost with a title that doesn’t quite fit my model… a sequel, so already a franchise game, but from an indie?  It got a small boost: Monster Train 2 [Picked by Neutical Publishing (Cyanbane)] Score has gone UP from 87.4 to 88.6 All of that yielded just one swap on the scoreboard, as Kluwes picked up the fourth spot on the combined changes above: Publisher Score Updates Slightly Scuffed Studios (Kluwes) Moved from 5th place to 4th place Crash and Burn Games (Shawn) Score has gone DOWN from 40.4 to 39.2 Moved from 4th place to 5th place That left the scoreboard looking like this at the end of week twenty-one. The Standings for Week 21 Right now first and second place are close, and then third through sixth position are fairly close and could change hands pretty quickly based on a score change. We also had a couple of release dates firm up. Dragon Quest I \u0026 II HD-2D Remake [Picked by Crash and Burn Games (Shawn)] Release date changed from ‘2025’ to ‘Thursday, October 30, 2025’. Pokémon Legends Z-A [Picked by TAGN HQ (Wilhelm)] Release date changed from ‘Late 2025’ to ‘Thursday, October 16, 2025’. That is two more tentative dates now inked in on the calendar. As for what is coming up, this is what the schedule looks like for the league. Coming up for week 22 There is only one release this coming week, but it is a biggie.  On Thursday the Nintendo Switch 2 launches, and with it comes a key launch title, Mario Kart World. This will be a chance to test my theory on franchise games I suppose.  Mario Kart has been a Nintendo franchise since forever ago.  On the other hand, Nintendo is its own little ecosystem.  Unlike Nightreign, which came out on Windows, XBox, and Playstation, Mario Kart only has to worry about reviews from some of the general gaming press and its dedicated fan sites, which I suspect are more generous. So we shall see if this is Shintar’s big score.  She needs better than an 85 to make some headway on the ranks.  But that would put her in the race for third that I mentioned above.

week, but it is a biggie.  On Thursday the Nintendo Switch 2 launches, and with it comes a key launch title, \u003cem\u003eMario Kart World\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will be a chance to test my theory on franchise games I suppose.  \u003cem\u003eMario Kart\u003c/em\u003e has been a Nintendo franchise since forever ago.  On the other hand, Nintendo is its own little ecosystem.  Unlike \u003cem\u003eNightreign\u003c/em\u003e, which came out on Windows, XBox, and Playstation, \u003cem\u003eMario Kart\u003c/em\u003e only has to worry about reviews from some of the general gaming press and its dedicated fan sites, which I suspect are more generous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we shall see if this is Shintar’s big score.  She needs better than an 85 to make some headway on the ranks.  But that would put her in the race for third that I mentioned above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca
