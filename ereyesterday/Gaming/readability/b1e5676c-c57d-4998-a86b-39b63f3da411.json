  "text": "Image credit: Kinetic Games The next Phasmophobia update, Chronicle, is due out next month with a newly revealed June 24th release date, and developer Kinetic Games have offered up some details on what it calls one of the game's \"biggest updates\" so far. So, let's have a look at what that entails! The key addition with this update is the arrival of sound evidence, which as you can probably guess is a new haunting paranormal proof type that you'll acquire by using the newly added sound recorder. In turn, the journal has been completely redesigned. The photos tab will now be the media tab, which organises evidence into photos, videos, and those aforementioned sound recordings. You'll need to fill your book up with unique media to achieve a perfect investigation, and there's some new events like EMF spikes, interactions like rocking chairs, and different ghost forms to help you do this. The media quality system has been revamped too. Now whenever you capture your first bit of evidence of any media type, it'll be marked as unique, so you'll get some bonus dosh and experience once you've wrapped up a contract. Plus, there are some bug fixes coming with this update too. Following the release of Chronicle, a rework of Grafton Farmhouse will be coming too. Kinetic explained in a blog post that the whole map has been overhauled, namely some re-themed rooms, certain spaces increasing or decreasing in size, and there's a new \"crowded attic, complete with sheet covered old furniture.\" Earlier this year Kinetic outlined the future of Phasmophobia, promising more (but not big) maps, more map reworks, and Horror 2.0, the long awaited full release of the, uh, horror game.",
