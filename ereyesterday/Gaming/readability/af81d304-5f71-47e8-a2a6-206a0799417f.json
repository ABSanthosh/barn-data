For a very limited time, you can place an order for a Skytech Prism 4 Gaming PC equipped with the coveted GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card for $4,799.99 shipped. That's a pretty reasonable price considering the fact that this GPU by itself is currently selling for $3,500-$4000 on eBay.Update: The Skytech Legacy RTX 5090 gaming PC with similar specs can also be ordered.Skytech RTX 5090 Prebuilt Gaming PC for $4800Skytech Prism 4 AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D RTX 5090 Gaming PC with 32GB RAM, 2TB SSDSkytech Legacy AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D RTX 5090 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)The Skytech Prism 4 gaming PC complements the phenomenal GPU with some great specs, including an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D processor, 32GB of DDR5-6000MHz RAM, and a 2TB M.2 SSD. The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D was the reigning champ in terms of gaming performance before the new 9800X3D was released earlier this year, and even then the performance difference is practically negligible when paired with a powerful GPU such as this. It also uses less power than the new 9800X3D.

Although this time around Nvidia has prioritized dding AI features and DLSS 4 technology to improve gameplay performance over the previous generation GPUs, the RTX 5090 has still emerged as the most powerful consumer GPU on the market even if you only factor hardware-based raster performance. This card boasts a 25%-30% uplift over the RTX 4090 and with 32GB of GDDR7 VRAM.Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
