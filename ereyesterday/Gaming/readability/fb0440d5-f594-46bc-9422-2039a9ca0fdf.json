It will cost $449.99, and a bundle that includes Mario Kart World (which is only in production through the fall) will cost $499.99, saving you $30 versus buying the game separately.But should you buy the Switch 2?In early 2024, when I first published this article, many people wondered whether it was still a wise choice to buy a Switch, or if they should just wait for the Switch 2 instead. That was before we knew as much as we do now. Nintendo’s April 2 Direct, as well as Polygon’s own Switch 2 hands-on impressions, shined light on nearly everything we were curious about: namely, how powerful the Switch 2 will be, the ways in which it’s different from the original Switch, how much it’ll cost, and what games we can expect to play on launch day (and beyond).Considering the Switch 2’s high cost, it’s clearly not for everybody. Priced between $199.99 and $349.99, the original Switch model — whether that be a Switch OLED, the regular Switch, or the Switch Lite — might still be the right fit for some people. With so many options and so much money at stake, it’s as confusing as ever to decide what the right move is. Perhaps we can help you.Image: Nintendo via PolygonHave you played the Switch’s stellar game library?If you’re brand-new to the world of the Nintendo Switch, there are many good games to catch up on. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, its sequel Tears of the Kingdom, Metroid Dread, Super Mario Odyssey, Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Pikmin 4 — I could go on, but I’ll let our roundup of the best Switch games do that for me. You don’t need a Switch 2 to play so much of the best that the Switch has to offer.It’s reassuring to know that nearly all original Switch games — both digital and physical — are compatible with the new console, and that some of them will boast performance increases thanks to the faster hardware. (Nintendo is selling Switch 2 Edition upgrades of some original Switch games that contain a multitude of upgrades, but you won’t have to pay for those upgrades to simply play the games you own.) If you do choose to buy the new console, all of your games will likely come with you.While Nintendo has announced release dates for its first Switch 2-exclusive games, Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza, other upcoming Nintendo releases, like Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, are also coming to the original Switch. Unless you really love Mario Kart, the quantity of Switch 2 exclusives at this time doesn’t completely tip the scales in favor of the new console.And yet (this is dizzying, I know), I don’t suggest that most people buy a Switch at its full price just to catch up now. If you find one on a deal, that’s another story. But if you don’t want to wait for a deal that may never come (or that may not be as good as we wish for it to be), then you should consider pre-ordering the new console or waiting until more exclusive games are out to make the purchase.Image: NintendoDo VRR, ALLM, 120 Hz mean anything to you?If so, you’ll want to wait for the Switch 2. If not, you might be perfectly content with the original Switch.The Switch 2 boasts surprisingly modern specs (no offense, Nintendo) with a screen that’s capable of running games at up to 120 frames per second in 1080p resolution. Its Nvidia G-Sync display utilizes a technology called variable refresh rate (VRR) to adapt the screen’s refresh rate to the GPU’s performance so that you don’t notice screen tearing. As for auto low-latency mode (ALLM), the Switch 2’s dock can automatically trigger your TV’s low-latency gaming mode to ensure the best possible visuals, and it can play games at up to 4K.The original Switch… can’t do any of that. Its 720p screen tops out at 60 frames per second, and many games make it apparent just how long in the tooth the original hardware was becoming.On the other hand, are you buying for someone who doesn’t care about tech specs?Does the Switch’s lackluster-at-times performance dampen the fun you can have with its games? The answer depends on who you ask. As for me? Not really, coming from the guy who happily explored Hyrule (as well as above and below it in Tears of the Kingdom) and played dozens of other games with a grin from ear to ear. But again, from a financial perspective, buying a Switch OLED for $349.99 right now — just $100 less than the Switch 2 — doesn’t make sense. Unless Nintendo drops the price of the original Switch consoles (personally, I don’t expect Nintendo to slash prices in half, but wouldn’t that be nice?), I’d consider buying the Switch 2.That said, the Switch OLED’s built-in screen is better in one major way compared to that of the Switch 2’s. As you might have gleaned from its name, the Switch OLED has an OLED screen that makes games look phenomenal. While it runs at a lower resolution and refresh rate than the Switch 2, the new console’s LCD screen will likely pale in comparison when it comes to presenting rich, accurate colors and perfect blacks.Do you love the GameCube?Ah, Nintendo got you there, right where it hurts. The company is introducing GameCube games to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, but only if you have a Switch 2. Only with the new console will you be able to play The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soulcalibur 2, F-Zero GX, and more coming in the future.SwitchboardThe best way to stay up to date on all things Nintendo Switch 2.",

But if you don’t want to wait for a deal that may never come (or that may not be as good as we wish for it to be), then you should consider pre-ordering the new console or waiting until more exclusive games are out to make the purchase.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0,0,100,100\" data-pswp-height=\"1080\" data-pswp-width=\"1920\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Donkey Kong smashes the ground while sidekick Oddrock hovers overhead in artwork from Donkey Kong Bananza\" data-chromatic=\"ignore\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"fill\" sizes=\"(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px\" srcset=\"https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=2400 2400w\" src=\"https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/NintendoSwitch2_1x1_DonkeyKongBananza_KeyArt.jpg?quality=90\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100\u0026amp;w=2400\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ccite\u003eImage: Nintendo\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp id=\"yqoaIn\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDo VRR, ALLM, 120 Hz mean anything to you?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf so, you’ll want to wait for the Switch 2. If not, you might be perfectly content with the original Switch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Switch 2 boasts surprisingly modern specs (no offense, Nintendo) with a screen that’s capable of running games at up to 120 frames per second in 1080p resolution. Its Nvidia G-Sync display utilizes a technology called variable refresh rate (VRR) to adapt the screen’s refresh rate to the GPU’s performance so that you don’t notice screen tearing. As for auto low-latency mode (ALLM), the Switch 2’s dock can automatically trigger your TV’s low-latency gaming mode to ensure the best possible visuals, and it can play games at up to 4K.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe original Switch… can’t do any of that. Its 720p screen tops out at 60 frames per second, and many games make it apparent just how long in the tooth the original hardware was becoming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp id=\"on-the-other-hand-are-you-buying-for-someone-who-doesnt-care-about-tech-specs\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eOn the other hand, are you buying for someone who doesn’t care about tech specs?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoes the Switch’s lackluster-at-times performance dampen the fun you can have with its games? The answer depends on who you ask. As for me? Not really, coming from the guy who happily explored Hyrule (as well as above and below it in \u003cem\u003eTears of the Kingdom\u003c/em\u003e) and played dozens of other games with a grin from ear to ear. But again, from a financial perspective, buying a Switch OLED for $349.99 right now — just $100 less than the Switch 2 — doesn’t make sense. Unless Nintendo drops the price of the original Switch consoles (personally, I don’t expect Nintendo to slash prices in half, but wouldn’t that be nice?), I’d consider buying the Switch 2.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat said, the Switch OLED’s built-in screen is better in one major way compared to that of the Switch 2’s. As you might have gleaned from its name, the Switch OLED has an OLED screen that makes games look phenomenal. While it runs at a lower resolution and refresh rate than the Switch 2, the new console’s LCD screen will likely pale in comparison when it comes to presenting rich, accurate colors and perfect blacks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp id=\"do-you-love-the-gamecube\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDo you love the GameCube?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAh, Nintendo got you there, right where it hurts.
