  "text": "Get ready, Xbox gamers—Turbo Overkill, the critically acclaimed cyberpunk FPS, is revving its chainsaw leg and making its explosive debut on Xbox today. From indie developer Trigger Happy Interactive and legendary publisher Apogee Entertainment, Turbo Overkill is a love letter to retro shooters like Doom and Quake, blending their high-octane action with modern speed and style. It’s an adrenaline-fueled descent into the neon-drenched dystopia of Paradise, where players take on the role of Johnny Turbo, a cybernetically enhanced anti-hero armed with imaginative weapons, a chainsaw leg, and a thirst for vengeance. What Awaits you in Paradise Paradise isn’t the utopia it was promised to be. This futuristic megacity, riddled with corporate corruption and rogue AI monstrosities, is a brutal battleground. As Johnny Turbo, you’ll fight through three expansive episodes filled with intricate levels, unforgettable characters, and nonstop carnage—all at a buttery-smooth 60 FPS. Turbo Overkill’s Highlights: Iconic Combat: Wield absurd firepower, from dual magnums to plasma railguns, and turn every encounter into a gory spectacle. Kinetic Gameplay: Chain wall-runs, double jumps, and mid-air chainsaw slides for fluid, fast-paced combat that rewards creative destruction. Epic Levels: Battle through neon slums, abandoned arenas, corporate skyscrapers, and even the depths of space in Turbo Overkill’s three episodes. Enhanced for Xbox: Enjoy silky-smooth 60 FPS and enhanced visuals on Xbox Series X|S, delivering a visceral, immersive experience like no other. Voice Talent: Paradise with Personality Turbo Overkill boasts a stellar voice cast that brings its gritty characters to life: Patricia Summersett (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom) as the enigmatic and deadly bounty hunter Ripper. Jon St. John (Duke Nukem) as Johnny’s wisecracking AI companion, SAMM. Gianni Matragrano (Ultrakill, Neon White) as the cunning and ruthless Maw. DB Cooper (BioShock 2, The Elder Scrolls Online) as The Exec, a mysterious TeraTek executive with an agenda of her own. Tay Zonday (Chocolate Rain) as Dr. Nyx, Johnny’s bio-cybernetics surgeon. Their performances add depth to Turbo Overkill’s adrenaline-fueled narrative, ensuring every encounter and interaction is as unforgettable as the carnage. Words from the Creators “Turbo Overkill is something special. Sam Prebble poured everything into this game, and you can feel it in every corner of Paradise. From the brutal gameplay to the insane attention to detail, it’s a reflection of his relentless creativity and drive. As someone who grew up loving shooters, this game feels like a dream come true—and I couldn’t be prouder to see it finally land on Xbox.” —Jeron Moore, Executive Producer, Apogee Entertainment “This is the game I’ve always wanted to play—one that doesn’t let up and rewards players who embrace style, carnage, and creativity. Console players are in for a wild ride. This might be the fastest shooter you’ve ever played, and that’s one of the reasons that led me to calling it Turbo Overkill. Find me on X and let me know what you think!” —Sam Prebble, Creator of Turbo Overkill The Music of Turbo Overkill: A Cyberpunk Opus Turbo Overkill’s pulse-pounding soundtrack perfectly complements its chaotic gameplay. Composed by Chipper Hammond, Nikola Jeremic, and Tim Stoney, the score blends cyberpunk synths, heavy metal riffs, and cinematic arrangements to fuel every chainsaw slide and wall run. The Turbo Overkill soundtrack is now available from Apogee Music, featuring two distinct albums: the “Episode 1 Soundtrack”, a comprehensive collection of nearly two hours of music from the entirety of Episode 1, and the “Soundtrack Selections” album, a curated compilation running over three hours. Fans can stream or download these high-energy, genre-defining tracks on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTubeMusic, and Bandcamp. Albums featuring the complete soundtracks for Episodes 2 and 3 are set to release in the coming weeks, delivering even more pulse-pounding music to accompany their adventures in Paradise, and beyond.

You play as Johnny Turbo, augmented with hidden arm rockets and a chainsaw that extends from your lower leg allowing you to slide-slice enemies wide open.\n\nJohnny returns to his hometown of Paradise and finds its entire population possessed by Syn, a rogue AI, and its army of augmented minions. Desperate for enough money to outrun his past mistakes, Johnny takes on the impossible job of destroying the greatest AI ever created. Rival bounty hunters want to claim the prize first. Nothing is easy in paradise.\n\n\nTURBO TIME, WALL-RUNNING, DASHING AND GRAPPLING HOOKS, OH MY\nTurbo Overkill takes over-the-top to never-before-reached heights. Activate Turbo Time(™), a new form of slow motion with a twist. Build incredible speed by wall-running and dashing. Slide on your chainsaw leg, eviscerating foes and opening up bosses for critical damage, and go car-surfing on the hoods of flying cars. Blast away with the Twin Magnums, which lock-on and instagib several foes, the Boomer Shotgun and its attached grenade launcher, or the Telefragger sniper rifle, which teleports Johnny inside an enemy before they explode from within.\n\nRace through two dozen stages packed with secrets, bonus arena stages, and white-knuckle combat puzzles. Find game-changing collectibles to unlock punishing modifiers like triple-monster-speed and insta-kill. Combine all of Johnny’s weapons and powers to outsmart, outgun and outrun the corrupted legions.\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003c/div\u003e\n\t\u003c/article\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
