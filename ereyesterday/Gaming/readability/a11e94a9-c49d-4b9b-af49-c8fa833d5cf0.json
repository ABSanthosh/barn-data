  "text": "Hey Washers! You are hereby summoned to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away on a guided tour of Duloc, hosted by the devs of PowerWash Simulator. Kick back with a mug of warm swamp-mud and let us regale you with some behind-the-scenes insight on the development of the Duloc level in the new Shrek Special Pack – Available now! We collaborated with Universal Products \u0026 Experiences to  bring  the world of DreamWorks’ Animations Shrek to life in PowerWash Simulator, transforming iconic locations such as Shrek’s Swamp, Duloc, Hansel’s Honeymoon Hideaway, Fairy Godmother’s Potion Factory and Dragon’s Lair. FuturLab’s own: Designer Jade Staines and Artist Sean Ferretti, who both worked extensively on the Duloc level (one of five within the Shrek Special Pack), are here to tell you all about it, while our Concept Artist Nick Peacock gives you a closer look at early concepts for the Knight character model you’ll play as in the Shrek Special Pack. Duloc is a Perfect Place! It’s not *quite* the picture-perfect Duloc is inspired by the original Shrek film. Barely recognizable under a layer of filth Ferretti explains: “Players will find House sigil tags scattered across the walls that belong to the Knights and other references to the films. You’ll find tons of fun details like these in all the levels because everybody in the Art team adores these movies and we had a blast bringing this pack to PowerWash Simulator!” “It was fun to collaborate with Universal Products \u0026 Experiences abd DreamWorks Animation teams to come up with ideas and jokes that the knights had graffitied around Duloc including as many film references as we could,” adds Staines. The graffiti looks especially cool in conjunction with a new accessibility tool that allows players to change the colour of the dirt highlight, that will come with a patch to the main game at the time of the Shrek Special Pack release. Shine your shoes, wipe your… visor Perhaps one of the most iconic moments from the Shrek films (and there’s no shortage to choose from) is the moment that Shrek and Donkey arrive in Duloc, and are greeted with a catchy tune from the information booth, or as Ferretti puts it… “That scene has forever been seared into my brain. My colleague Bara (Artist) and I must’ve rewatched this clip at least 50 times altogether while designing the Information Booth inspired by the film but we’re proud to have it included!” Because the information booth is such an icon of the Shrek films, we really went to town on making it special – this humble landmark alone contains over 80 Dings. “As soon as I saw the information booth with all the puppets I just knew I had to make them individual objects for all of the Dings! Playing it and hearing them all is sooo satisfying.” Just like Donkey, we want players to think “Wow, let’s do that again!” Arise, Washer! We love making our Special Packs even more immersive with unique character models. In the Shrek Special Pack, you can go forth and conquer grime as a power washing knight, looking right at home, especially in Duloc. Peacock explains the process of creating the character model: “I looked at real suits of armour, films with armour (live action and animation) and other artistic renditions of armour – useful in seeing how other people have solved complex problems and distilled down its essence. Once I’ve done this, I like to sketch out ideas, and see where my own interpretations take me.” “I loved coming up with ideas for the washer elements, like the water tank on the back or the sword washer. Both tools used for combat, made to look fun and toylike. It brings in some humour and fun, which I think adds to the experience on a game like ours. I enjoy working this way – like a kid drawing out their playful ideas on paper.” We hope you’ve enjoyed this access-all-areas look at the new Duloc level! We’ll leave you to discover the magic of the other four levels  yourselves. With all that said and done, these closing words from Staines sum up how many of us here at FuturLab feel about the Shrek Special Pack. “It’s fun watching scenes inspired by a film that I grew up with, become levels that you can run around and explore. Everyone involved with the pack did such an amazing job, I think the players are going to have a blast cleaning it all.” Xbox Game Pass members can play the base game, PowerWash Simulator, as part of their membership. Shrek Special Pack is available now for a separate purchase on the Xbox Store (a copy of PowerWash Simulator is required to play). Playtime is ogre. Get to work cleaning up five fairy tale maps inspired by DreamWorks Animation’s Shrek. It’ll take more than pixie dust to restore these iconic locales to their former lustre, but thankfully, happily ever after is in your hands! Like onions, dirt has layers. And boy, this particular brew of filth is potent enough to rival even the Fairy Godmother’s strongest concoctions. A sprinkle of soap, a touch of elbow grease and a large dose of ‘DING’s make for the perfect antidote potion! Wash it all down with a swish of high-pressure water and you’ll have these enchanting locations looking as spotless as the Magic Mirror. An all-star cast of beloved characters invites you to reinstate Duloc back to the seemingly pristine place it’s known to be, breathe life into Dragon’s Lair and restore Shrek’s Swamp to, well, just the right amount of muck! All these places and more are yours for the rescuing. Your great and noble quest takes you across five charming maps from: • Duloc • Hansel’s Honeymoon Hideaway • Shrek’s Swamp • Fairy Godmother’s Potion Factory • Dragon’s Lair Arise, Washer! You’ve officially been dubbed a knight in shining armour in order to defeat dubious debris in this Special Pack – a task befitting a true hero.

And boy, this particular brew of filth is potent enough to rival even the Fairy Godmother’s strongest concoctions. A sprinkle of soap, a touch of elbow grease and a large dose of ‘DING’s make for the perfect antidote potion! Wash it all down with a swish of high-pressure water and you’ll have these enchanting locations looking as spotless as the Magic Mirror.  \n\nAn all-star cast of beloved characters invites you to reinstate Duloc back to the seemingly pristine place it’s known to be, breathe life into Dragon’s Lair and restore Shrek’s Swamp to, well, just the right amount of muck! All these places and more are yours for the rescuing.\n\nYour great and noble quest takes you across five charming maps from:\n\n•\tDuloc\n•\tHansel’s Honeymoon Hideaway\n•\tShrek’s Swamp\n•\tFairy Godmother’s Potion Factory\n•\tDragon’s Lair\n\nArise, Washer!
