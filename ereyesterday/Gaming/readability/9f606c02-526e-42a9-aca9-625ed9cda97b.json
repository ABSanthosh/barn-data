  "description": "Solasta: Crown of the Magister is a fantastic video-game translation of D\u0026D's 5E ruleset, doing so with a healthy dose of humor and charm years before Baldur's Gate 3. Now, developer Tactical Adventures is hard at work on a full sequel, Solasta 2, and PC players will be able to take it for a spin in 2025.Announced during The Game Awards 2024 and launching initially in early access on PC, Solasta 2 will see players battle an \"all-powerful being\" named Shadwyn, who is voiced by Baldur's Gate 3 narrator Amelia Tyler. The game is set on the new continent of Neokos, which creative director Mathieu Girard said is filled with \"unprecedented lore.\" If you've played Baldur's Gate 3, you should be very familiar with most of the turn-based mechanics coming to Solasta 2. It makes use of the \"full depth\" of the 5E system, according to the developer, which--much like the first game--means playing it can actually give you a very good crash course in learning D\u0026D, even though it's not set in any Wizards of the Coast universe.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The original game eventually made its way to consoles (I devoured it on Xbox Game Pass, myself), so it's possible we'll see this happen for Solasta 2. For now, however, PC players can look forward to the early-access version in 2025, and a demo that will arrive sooner. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com",
