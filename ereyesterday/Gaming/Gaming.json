Now, there's a new all-time low thanks to Best Buy's latest round of December Doorbuster deals. You can get the Xbox Elite Series 2 for only for $120 (was $180) at Best Buy or Amazon. While Amazon is the only retailer matching Best Buy's Doorbuster, Walmart and Target also have the controller for a steep discount. Amazon is matching Best Buy's price, but if either retailer sells out, Walmart and Target have the controller priced a few bucks higher.Even five years out from its release, the Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller is our pick for the best premium controller you can buy for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC in 2024.Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller Deals (December 20):Best Buy -- $120 ($180) | Arrives by Christmas | In-store pickup availableAmazon -- $120 ($180)Walmart -- $124 ($180) | In-store pickup availableTarget -- $125 ($180) | Arrives by Christmas Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller $120 (was $180) The Elite Series 2 connects wirelessly via Xbox's wireless frequency or Bluetooth on PC and mobile. It can also be hardwired with the included USB-C cable. As for the features you won't find on a regular Xbox Wireless Controller, the Elite Series 2 can store three customizable control profiles, is equipped with trigger locks with three stopping points, and has swappable sticks with adjustable tension, D-pads, and back paddles. It also has textured grips and is made with better materials. The difference in quality is immediately noticeable.Here's what you get with the Elite Series 2:6 swappable analog sticks - standard pair, \"classic\" (smaller) pair, one wide dome, one tall.4 removable back paddles2 D-pads - the one shown above and a standard cross designCharging dockBraided USB-C cableThumbstick tension adjustment toolHardshell carrying case with dedicated slots for all componentsDelivery Estimates: As of December 20, Best Buy and Target are the only major retailers offering delivery by Christmas. Both retailers list the delivery date as December 24 on our end, but this will vary based on your location. That said, you can order online from Best Buy or Walmart for in-store pickup today.Just keep in mind that prices are slightly different depending on where you shop. Amazon is the only retailer matching Best Buy's $120 Doorbuster deal. The Elite Series 2 is $124 at Walmart and $125 at Target. See at Best Buy See at Amazon See at Walmart ($124) Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Controller (White) $98 (was $130) The difference between the Core and the standard model is that the Core only comes with the controller. It's the same premium controller with textured grips, trigger locks, and the ability to swap components. It doesn't include the four back paddles, four extra sticks, second D-pad, adjustment tool, charging dock, or carrying case.If you decide you want extra components down the line, there are plenty of third-party accessories for cheap. Our recommendation for back paddles is Scuf's Elite Series 2 Paddles for $20--though they are often on sale for $15. You can even find full accessory kits that are actually pretty good for as low as $18.Delivery Estimates: The only retailers offering delivery before Christmas (as of December 20) are Best Buy and Target. If your local Walmart or Best Buy has the controller in stock, you can order online for in-store pickup today. Online orders shipped to your doorstep won't arrive until after Christmas from Amazon and Walmart. See at Best Buy See at Amazon See at Walmart Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Controller (Red) $95 (was $140) The Elite Series 2 Core Controller in red is available for under $100 at three major retailers, but all of them have slightly different prices. Best Buy has the lowest price at $95, while Target and Walmart have the controller for $96 and $98, respectively. Amazon is sold out of this model. The red Elite Series 2 Core has a $140 MSRP, so you're saving a maximum of $45.Delivery Estimates: As of December 20, Best Buy and Target are offering delivery before Christmas, while Walmart's deal won't arrive in time. That said, you can order the controller online at Best Buy or Walmart and pick it up at your local store. See at Best Buy See at Target ($96) See at Walmart ($98) Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Controller (Blue) $98 (was $140) The blue Elite Series 2 Core Controller is $98 at Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and Target. Just like the red model, the blue carries a $140 retail price, so it's a \"better\" deal than the white edition.Delivery Estimates: As of December 20, Best Buy and Target state the controller will arrive before Christmas. You can also order online at Walmart or Best Buy and pick it up at your local store today. See at Best Buy See at Amazon See at Walmart The Xbox Elite Series 2 released back in 2019, but it still feels like the standard in the pro-style controller market. The Elite Series 2's superb weighting, incredibly solid build and high-quality components make it feel like a controller that's worth its $180 asking price. It's an absolute steal at $120. Numerous third-party brands have tried to outshine the Elite Series 2 in recent years, and although there have been a few controllers that have come close, all of the solid wireless alternatives cost either the same price or higher. And that's when the Elite Series 2 is at full price.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-playstation-games-of-2024-according-to-metacritic/2900-6073/",
    "description": "2024 was a year of surprise hits and critical flops for Sony and its PlayStation division, as games like Helldivers 2 and Astro Bot launched to critical acclaim while other projects like Concord were released to middling reviews and general player apathy.While this year was also light on first-party exclusives, third-party studios came to the rescue with a selection of games covering multiple genres. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Stellar Blade were two notable examples of PS5-only games releasing this year--they're both headed to PC in 2025--while other studios released must-play titles like Metaphor: ReFantazio (our Game of the Year), Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, and Silent Hill 2 on the Sony system.Heck, even Microsoft wanted to attract a few PlayStation gamers to its brand, leading to former Xbox Series X|S exclusives like Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Grounded, and Sea of Thieves releasing on its gaming rival's hardware, which expanded this year with the release of the PS5 Pro console.So which games were the most popular with critics? Thanks to GameSpot's sister site Metacritic, we've got a comprehensive list of the games that walked away with the highest aggregate scores (as of December 5), and overall, players couldn't get enough of JRPGs, puzzle games, metroidvanias and more. More Best Of 2024:Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024Best Xbox Games Of 2024Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024Best Of 2024 hub Elden Ring: Shadow of the ErdtreeLike the best video game expansions, Shadow of the Erdtree uses Elden Ring as a foundation to create an even better adventure for returning players. Enhancing and refining the magic of the 2022 game, Shadow of the Erdtree invites players to explore a new realm that they'll never want to leave.Metascore: 94 | Read our Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review See at Amazon Astro BotSony's first-party output has typically favored open-world games and those with mature themes, but Astro Bot is a breath of fresh air that'll appeal to anyone looking for a nostalgic return to simpler days. Not only is Astro Bot an exceptional platformer with an imaginative design, but it's also a delightful time capsule across multiple eras of PlayStation and a tribute to the lasting legacy of those influential adventures.Metascore: 94 | Read our Astro Bot review See at Amazon Metaphor ReFantazioGameSpot's Game of the Year for 2024, Metaphor: ReFantazio is another gem from developer Atlus. It takes the basic framework of what you'd expect in a Persona game and streamlines it in numerous ways, with a thought-provoking story, lovable characters, and some of the best turn-based RPG combat ever. It's a winning formula that is well worth the time investment.Metascore: 94 | Read our Metaphor: ReFantazio review See at Amazon Slay the Princess: The Pristine CutDo you think you have what it takes to commit some regicide and not ask any questions? That's the core premise of Slay the Princess, a game of time loops, twists, and murder most foul presented as a visual novel that never tells the same story twice. The Pristine Cut further polishes that experience, complementing its clever writing and excellent voice acting with even more content, thoughtful tweaks, and hundreds of new frames of handcrafted art.Metascore: 92 | Read our Slay the Princess: The Pristine Cut review See at Amazon Final Fantasy VII RebirthFinal Fantasy VII Remake set up an intriguing premise, both paying homage to the original while representing a very conscious break from it. Rebirth, the second installment in a planned trilogy, carries that idea forward, with new revelations, a vastly expanded world, and refined combat mechanics.Metascore: 92 | Read our Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review See at Amazon Dave the DiverA hilarious indie mash-up, Dave the Diver combines a deep-sea exploring action game with the madcap flurry of games like Diner Dash. You spend your days delving deeper into the briny waters to catch fish and nights working and managing a burgeoning sushi restaurant, only to spend your profits on better gear and do it all over again. It's a compelling mix of gameplay elements that's hard to put down.Metascore: 90 Destiny 2: The Final ShapeThe Final Shape had a challenging task to accomplish, as it had to serve as the culmination of the story that has been told since the beginning of the first Destiny a decade ago. Miraculously, it pulled that off, tying up much of the story in a satisfying way by focusing on the characters we've built relationships with over these years and offering an exciting new subclass and systems to engage with. The new Pale Heart location is great fun to explore and filled with mysteries to uncover, the new Dread enemies consistently mix up combat encounters, and quality-of-life improvements make for the best Destiny experience to date.Metascore: 90 | Read our Destiny 2: The Final Shape review BalatroBalatro is the embodiment of \"just one more round\" energy thanks to its killer combo of poker and roguelite gameplay mechanics. Easy to pick up, challenging to master, and undeniably hard to put down, it takes the best ideas from poker and repurposes them into one of the best puzzle games of the year. Sure, you're going to need to often cheat your way into a winning hand, but the euphoria that comes from successfully holding the right cards in a high-stakes game is an unbeatable feeling in Balatro.Metascore: 90 | Read our Balatro review See at Amazon The Last of Us Part 2 RemasteredThe best video games live rent-free in your head long after the end credits have rolled, and four years after it first released, it's still almost impossible to serve The Last of Us Part 2 an eviction notice. How much of a difference does this remastered version make to an already-brilliant game? Plenty, as not only does the game look phenomenal, but it benefits from several new features that helps to solidify The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered as a modern-day masterpiece. Come for the gripping story and polished gameplay, stick around for the guitar hero mode, lost levels, and a roguelite mode that'll make you sweat buckets.Metascore: 90 | Read our The Last of Us Part 2 review Tekken 8Tekken 8 plays like the kind of game that you'd happily sacrifice all your quarters to at an arcade. It looks amazing in action as you watch an international roster of fighters pop muscles and faces, the aggressive nature of its gameplay makes every match exciting, and the campaign mode is essentially Succession with a drastic increase in roundhouse kicks.Metascore: 90 | Read our Tekken 8 review See at Amazon Like a Dragon: Infinite WealthDoubling down on the RPG gameplay mechanics introduced in the previous game, Infinite Wealth introduced welcome changes and tweaks to its turn-based combat. Combined with a gripping story and an absurd amount of extra content, this year's Like a Dragon is a confident sequel and a passing of the torch as it continues to pave the way for a new era in the franchise.Metascore: 89 | Read our Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth review Castlevania Dominus CollectionAfter helping create the metroidvania genre, the Castlevania series moved into portable entries like the celebrated Aria of Sorrow. The Dominus Collection brings together the three Nintendo DS entries--Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin, and Order of Ecclesia--making them easily playable for the first time in years. It's a ton of Castlevania action in one place and comes with the arcade reimagining Haunted Castle to boot.Metascore: 89 | Animal WellMetroidvanias are a dime a dozen these days, but Animal Well stands out from the pack with the sheer genius of its design. Loaded with mysteries and captivatingly strange, it's the kind of game you want to go into as blindly as possible so that you can savor just how deep its metaphorical--and actual--well truly is.Metascore: 88 | Read our Animal Well review See at Amazon Hi-Fi RushXbox and PC gamers already knew just how good Hi-Fi Rush was, and thanks to a new multi-platform strategy at Microsoft, PS5 owners got to share in on that fun in 2024. Essentially Scott Pilgrim meets Devil May Cry, Hi-Fi Rush is still a captivating blast of action and rhythm that's complemented by a curated playlist of certified bangers. On PS5, Hi-Fi Rush benefits from a year's worth of gameplay fine-tuning and new modes that were added after launch, making this a beautifully crafted celebration of music that's full of personality.Metascore: 88 | Read our Hi-Fi Rush review Persona 3 ReloadPersona 3 Reload is a welcome return to the game that defined the modern format of the popular Persona series. Persona 3 has a real edge to it that subsequent games arguably do not, and Reload brings both visual improvements and some quality-of-like changes--along with availability on modern platforms--that all make it an easy recommendation in 2024.Metascore: 87 | Read our Persona 3 Reload review See at Amazon Shin Megami Tensei V: VengeanceShin Megami Tensei has always been a core pillar for Atlus, and with the Vengeance edition of the fifth mainline game, that series feels stronger than ever. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance isn't just a game that looks and performs better on new platforms; it's an impressive rethink of its source material that smooths over rough spots, adds several clever quality-of-life upgrades, and a substantial chunk of new story content to experience.Metascore: 87 | Read our Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance review See at Amazon Unicorn Overlord  Prince of Persia: The Lost CrownPrince of Persia reinvents itself yet again as a metroidvania, but this is far from a paint-by-numbers imitator. The Lost Crown boasts refined combat that's only augmented by the rich suite of traversal abilities you obtain, along with smart and innovative quality-of-life features.Metascore: 86 | Read our Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review See at Amazon Spin Rhythm XDSpin Rhythm XD is a wonderful return to the glory days of rhythm games, but with its own distinct twist on the expected timing-based gameplay. As the name suggests, you'll spin a wheel in order to match up colors with tiles coming down the track, which can lead to a sort of zen-like state that the best rhythm games can provide. With support for an optional VR mode, you have additional ways to play an exhilarating experience.Metascore: 86 Silent Hill 2Unquestionably the Silent Hill series' high point, the 2001 original Silent Hill 2 certainly shows its age these days--both in its visuals and game mechanics. Developer Bloober Team managed to completely remake the game for a new generation of players, with modern visuals, an over-the-shoulder gameplay style, and, crucially, the same scares and storyline you'd expect from the horror masterpiece. Silent Hill 2 is so tense that it's easy to feel a sense of dread overwhelm you even when no enemies are present, and we'd pack a few spare pairs of underwear before making this trip.Metascore: 86 | Read our Silent Hill 2 review See at Amazon Dragon's Dogma 2Some games can make you feel like you're running around like a headless chicken because of poor design choices or unclear direction. Others do it on purpose. Dragon's Dogma 2 is a single-player action-RPG, but Capcom's massively successful game takes many of its best ideas from MMOs. You cannot defeat most of the game's toughest challenges by yourself, and it's up to you to recruit a squad of effective Pawns--both from chance encounters in the world and from other players' games--in order to stand a chance. It can often feel like you stumbled your way into victory rather than carrying out a carefully constructed plan, but that's the beauty of it.Metascore: 86 | Read our Dragon's Dogma 2 review See at Amazon Braid: Anniversary EditionIt's hard to believe that Braid was first released 16 years ago, but time hasn't dulled the appeal of one of the greatest platforming-puzzle games of all time. Its anniversary edition is a must-play for anyone looking to revisit this masterpiece, as the new collection of levels, exquisite visuals, and a completely remixed soundtrack make it an essential classic.Metascore: 86 Horizon Zero Dawn RemasteredIf there's a running theme with PS5 releases this year, it's that remasters have been a major focus for Sony in 2024. Horizon Zero Dawn was already a fun game, but with this new coat of ultra-high-definition paint, the game looks better than ever. Mechanically, it's still the same game, but it's the visual changes across the board that help elevate the first Horizon game into an experience that you'd happily leave running in the background when you feel like showing off your new PS5 Pro console or OLED TV.Metascore: 85 | Read our Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered review See at Amazon Alan Wake 2: Night SpringsThe first DLC pack for Alan Wake 2 is quite unlike the rest of the game, and it also doesn't advance the story in any way; for that, you'll want to play DLC 2, The Lake House. But Night Springs nonetheless serves as a fun diversion from the ongoing story, being composed of three standalone episodes in which you'll play as stand-ins for other Remedy characters and explore some alternative and very meta worlds, all through the guise of episodes of the Warlin Door-hosted TV show Night Springs.Metascore: 85 Dragon Quest III HD-2D RemakeSquare Enix's HD-2D visual style--first seen in Octopath Traveler--has been used to great effect in brand-new RPGs, but it can be just as effective for breathing new life into classic games. Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is, as the name suggests, a full-on remake of the classic '80s game, complete with a new character class focused on capturing monsters. It's hard to deny just how well the HD-2D style works for the game's pixel-art visuals, and it gives younger players a chance to experience the classic game like older players remembered it, rather than how it actually was.Metascore: 84 | Read our Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake review See at Amazon ImmortalityOne of 2022's best games only just released on PS5 in January 2024, but it's every bit as worth playing now as it was previously. Immortality takes the form of an unusual game in which you'll discover and piece together footage from live-action films and behind-the-scenes clips by selecting objects within those videos to jump to related ones. What ensues is a mind-warping, non-linear puzzle as you seek to discover what happened to a fictional actress and uncover numerous surprises--be sure to avoid finding out much in advance of playing, as it's a game best played knowing very little about what's to come.Metascore: 84 | Read our Immortality review Thank Goodness You're HereSometimes the most-captivating game isn't one that's flexing radical gameplay or graphical engines that are almost indistinguishable from reality. The games that have a defined sense of whimsy and personality can easily reach the same heights as a AAA blockbuster, and Thank Goodness You're Here is a prime example. More British than being told to keep a stiff upper lip during hard times, it's a short-and-sweet \"slapformer\" that goes all in on its premise, delivering comedy gold with its absurdist sense of humor and gleefully weird visuals.Metascore: 84 | Read our Thank Goodness You're Here review The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through DaybreakA Metacritic list looking at the best of the year just wouldn't be complete without some Trails representation, and on PS5, The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak is waving that flag. One of the best entries in the series for newcomers to hop into, Trails Through Daybreak is a surprisingly mature and nuanced action-RPG thanks to its gripping story. Revamped combat systems and colorful anime-inspired visuals add to its appeal, as players fight to save a nation from descending into chaos.Metascore: 84 See at Amazon Fear the SpotlightAs a genre, horror isn't always so beginner-friendly, but Fear the Spotlight is a game that helps address that. On the surface, it's a retro-style ghost story with Clinton-era visuals and classic Silent Hill and Resident Evil gameplay mechanics. But its under-the-radar best attribute is how it's an experience that doesn't ever get too scary. It makes for a great gateway horror for players looking to dip their toes in the genre's waters, but its tale is interesting enough for veterans, too. It's split into two campaigns, and the second one is definitely creepier, but by then you'll be a serious ghosthunter, unafraid of what lurks in the shadows… right?Metascore: 84 | Read our Fear The Spotlight review",

The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich. And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness. Read more",

Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades. Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested? Read more",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Who would you rather go dancing with: your significant other, your best friend or your kid (if you have one)? Honestly, I’d love to go with Connor, LOL! 2. Spa weekend or a music festival weekend? Spa weekend, 100%. 3. Have you had any eggnog this holiday season? Nope, none! I don’t really crave it, but if it’s there, I’ll have a small cup. 4. Who would you rather have lunch with: your favorite musician, your favorite actor, your favorite author or your favorite teacher? Honestly, if she was still alive, lunch with my favorite teacher from elementary would be lovely. The last time I saw her, I was 18. 5. Do you pop the zit or leave it alone? I dunno, how ripe is it?

Company coming over, trees INSIDE the house, blinking lights, the biggest turkeys of the year — for a cat like Tabs, the holidays were a cat cornucopia of comfy couches, fragrant foliage, tinsel, tasty treats and plump plumage. As the head of the decorating committee for Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC, Tabs was responsible for the Christmas tree decorations, and I just sort of did what he said. Normally, it would go down something like this: first week of December, and he hadn’t decided on the overall theme yet, but he’d have it narrowed down to something like baked red, green and silver catnip crispy ornament treats or strings of classic white lights and red Christmas balls. Probably. But he wouldn’t be sure yet. Whichever way it went, he always got a lot of help. The decorating committee was always on standby and awaiting orders. And Tabs? Well, he was always late because of this or that.
