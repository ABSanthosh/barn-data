    "description": "\"I'll remember you, even after I die.\"This quote, delivered half-way through Lost Records: Rage and Bloom's first \"tape,\" is perhaps the most concise and poignant way to convey what Don't Nod's latest title is about. Lost Records is a game that revels in the melodrama and contradictory nature of adolescence. It understands the yearning we all once had to be completely unknowable and one-of-a-kind while also being fully-understood, accepted, and loved. Within its eight or so hours, insecurity and conviction walk hand-in-hand while the assumed invincibility of youth is stretched to its breaking point. How can one summer--how can life--feel so everlasting yet utterly fragile? Such is the magic of our teenage years.Lost Records captures this phenomenon stunningly, yet doesn't settle for being a game merely driven entirely by nostalgia or reminders of what it felt like to be young in the '90s. At its core is an eerie, supernatural mystery that spans nearly three decades and threatens to consume the four women involved in it--one that promises violence and the reemergence of events perhaps better left forgotten. This intense, slow-burning narrative provides an excellent framework for an empathetic exploration into girlhood, friendship, sexuality, individuality, expression, and the transition from youth to middle age. All this combined with dynamic characters, cinematic visuals, beautifully-rendered character models, and keen sense of atmosphere makes Lost Records one of Don't Nod's best games to date.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie Limited Edition Steelbook - Walmart Exclusive (4K Blu-ray) $28 (was $35) | Releases March 4 Preorder at Walmart The Super Mario Bros. Movie Power-Up Steelbook Edition (4K Blu-ray) $41.63 See at Walmart Super Mario returns to 4K Blu-ray next week with a new collectible edition of the 2023 movie. Exclusive to Walmart, The Super Mario Bros. Movie Limited Edition Steelbook was designed to resemble the iconic Question Blocks from the Nintendo series. Like most Walmart-exclusive editions of popular films, the new edition of the Mario Movie is cheaper than many steelbook releases these days. You can preorder The Super Mario Bros. Movie Limited Edition Steelbook for $28 ahead of its March 4 release. Up until recently Walmart was charging $35, so it's possible the price will increase again. The Super Mario Bros. Movie Limited Edition Steelbook - Walmart Exclusive (4K Blu-ray) $28 (was $35) | Releases March 4 Walmart's new Steelbook Edition of The Super Mario Bros. Movie is modeled after the iconic Question Block from the games (and film). Instead of bopping it with your head to reveal its contents, you open it like any other case. The interior of the case features landscape artwork depicting the Mushroom Kingdom's many varieties of large mushrooms.The steelbook case has slots for the 4K Blu-ray and 1080p Blu-ray discs of the film. Like the original release, you'll also get a digital copy of the film. The Mario Movie is available on Movies Anywhere, so you can add it to your library and watch on any of your devices.Walmart initially priced the new edition at $28 before raising it to $35, where it has remained all year--until now, at least. With just one week to go before launch, Walmart is now charging $28 again. If you placed your order when it was $35, Walmart's preorder price guarantee ensures you will pay the lowest offered before release. Walmart doesn't charge until your preorder ships, and adjustments are automatically applied to your account. Preorder at Walmart The Super Mario Bros. Movie Power-Up Steelbook Edition (4K Blu-ray) $41.63 Walmart restocked the Power-Up Edition Collectible Steelbook when preorders opened for the new edition late last year. This edition released in 2023 and promptly sold out at most major retailers.Walmart has the original steelbook in stock right now, but you may want to hold off on snagging a copy at its current price. The Power-Up Edition was priced at $28 for the past couple months, but it's going for $41.63 as of February 25. Since Walmart is the only retailer with copies on hand, this is the best price for the Power-Up Steelbook Edition. If you bought it from a reseller on Amazon, you'd wind up paying roughly $50. That said, if you're interested in adding this collectible edition to your display shelf, we'd recommend circling back to see if the price drops again.The Power-Up Edition has a black case with a Super Mushroom on the front and back. The interior artwork is a landscape shot of the Mushroom Kingdom leading up to Princess Peach's Castle. It also comes with 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and digital versions of the movie.All editions of The Super Mario Bros. Movie contain the same special features. You can check those out below.

I do not play a lot of World Of Warcraft, so when Blizzard came knocking about an interview, my reaction was a blend of being caught dozing off in history class and being casually asked to defuse a bomb. But Undermine(d) does harbour at least one addition that an Azeroth tourist like myself can understand: cars. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which would you rather have: an epic eyeshadow collection or an epic lipstick collection? My eye makeup game has been super minimal for the past couple of years, so epic lipstick collection it is! 2. If you could only wear one type of pants for the rest of your life, which would you pick: yoga/workout leggings, jeans, chinos or overalls? Although I like the idea of wearing pants with stretch, I do not love the idea of wearing leggings that hug my butt so closely for the rest of my life. UGH. But I guess I’d go with yoga/workout leggings, simply because I can’t imagine working out in jeans or chinos. And I guess one could dress leggings up for formal occasions? 3.

    "description": "Finally! A sunny week. 🌞 This is such a great time of year in the Bay Area. It’s still a bit wintry, but we usually get a few weeks in late February that are ridiculously perfect. Sunny and crisp with highs in the upper 60s to low 70s. We’ve gotten more rain than usual (the new usual) for three years in a row, including this one, which is weird because we had a drought that lasted a decade! I know it’s temporary, but for three years the weather has been, like, retro normal. Trees are healthy again, the streams and rivers are flowing — it’s bizarre! This is the time of year one of my tabby’s favorite flowers bloomed. Tulips! He loved almost everything about them. (“Almost” because he did not like the fact that they’re toxic.) Rosie loves this time of year too. Not quite spring, but not quite the dead of winter either.
