    "description": "Black Friday storage device deals have already started popping up, including steep discounts on high-capacity SanDisk microSD cards. Most notably, you can get the SanDisk Ultra 1.5TB microSD card for $95 (was $150) at Amazon and Best Buy. This is a great option for those looking to expand the storage capacity of their Steam Deck. Nintendo Switch owners who love Pokemon enough to pay a slight premium for a microSD card with Snorlax's face on it can get a big early Black Friday discount on an officially licensed 1TB SanDisk microSD card.You can also get limited-time discounts on microSDs made by SanDisk's biggest competitor, Samsung. The high-end Samsung Pro Plus 1TB microSD is on sale for $90, and the 512GB model is only $40. SanDisk Ultra 1.5TB microSD Card $95 (was $150) The SanDisk Ultra works without a hitch on Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch, and it's also one of the most reliable and popular microSD cards around.Up until very recently, the 1.5TB card was the largest SanDisk offered, but now there's a 2TB SanDisk Extreme. The 2TB card is still selling for its full $210 list price--yeah, that's an extreme investment. The 1TB SanDisk Extreme costs $90.The Extreme model offers up to 190MB/s transfer speed, while the Ultra is graded for 150MB/s--plenty fast enough for Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch. See at Amazon See at Best Buy Pokemon-themed SanDisk 1TB microSD Card $93 (was $150) SanDisk has a range of officially licensed microSD cards imprinted with characters and emblems from popular Nintendo franchises. One of the newest additions to that lineup is this 1TB Pokemon-themed card, which appropriately features Snorlax.All of the Nintendo-themed cards carry higher prices than the regular SanDisk cards. You're saving over $50 off this card's launch price, but you're essentially paying the same price for 1TB as you would for 1.5TB. This card has a read speed of up to 100MB/s, so it's not as fast as the Ultra either. On Nintendo Switch this won't make a difference, but if for some reason you want a Pokemon-themed microSD for your Steam Deck, the drop in speed is worth keeping in mind.Amazon is also offering a big discount on the 1TB SanDisk card featuring the Royal Crest from The Legend of Zelda. It's the same card as the Snorlax model, but it's on sale for only $88. See at Amazon See at Best Buy Zelda-themed SanDisk 1TB microSD Card $88 (was $150) Amazon is also offering a big discount on the 1TB SanDisk card featuring the Royal Crest from The Legend of Zelda. In terms of performance, the Zelda-themed microSD card is identical to the Snorlax model, but it's on sale for only $88. See at Amazon Early Black Friday microSD Card Deals for Steam Deck \u0026 Nintendo SwitchWe rounded up all of the best early Black Friday microSD card deals below. Smaller capacity SanDisk cards are available for discounts as well, including the 512GB Ultra for $33. You can also save on Samsung's highly rated Pro Plus microSD cards, which offer read speeds of to 180MB/s. The 1TB Samsung Pro Plus is on sale for $90, while the 512GB is up for grabs for only $40.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Don’t let the torbitude and dreamy eyes fool ya. Rosie is a ruthless competitor. She knows what she wants, and she usually gets it. Take, for instance, last summer’s crisis over her favorite treats, the aptly named Temptations, in tasty chicken flavor. She wanted more of them than I could provide. To be honest, she wanted them all — all of the Tasty Chicken Temptations nationwide. She threw herself into research, trying to reverse engineer the recipe for Temptations; however, every batch was a little bit off. Growing frustrated, she encountered an old sailor cat in a downtown Novato bar who told her the story of El Río de Tentación, the River of Temptation… According to the legend, hidden somewhere along the banks of the Sacramento River in Northern California were ancient ruins, within which held the Lost Book of Temptation, the book that contained the original recipe for Tasty Chicken Temptations.

    "description": "What is an Xbox? It's a pretty straightforward question, right? I'd define it as a custom piece of gaming technology, generally box-shaped, that typically sits in the lounge or bedroom. Competitively priced, it's a mainstream-orientated product that offers a great balance between price and performance and is as close to plug and play gaming as you're going to get. It is a console, or is it? Microsoft begs to differ with its latest, remarkable messaging. A cloud client running on a smart TV, Amazon Fire Stick or Meta Quest VR headset is now an Xbox. A desktop PC is an Xbox. A laptop or PC handheld is also an Xbox. It's all part of Microsoft's transition plan to evolve Xbox from a console/PC ecosystem into an 'Everywhere' platform that's as device-agnostic as it's possible to be - but is it going to work?
