    "description": "To mark its fourth anniversary, developer Housemarque has announced a free PlayStation 5 Pro upgrade to Returnal, promising to give a superb PS5 game a resolution boost of up to 2.5x on Sony's Pro hardware. The exact phrasing of \"up to 2.5x\" does suggest a form of dynamic scaling is in play, which I'll get to in a minute - but it's a welcome move that addresses one gripe with base PS5's image quality. Beyond that, are there any other improvements to the original experience? Are the performance issues addressed and what about the slight traversal stutter issues? Read more",

    "description": "Secret Wars Omnibus (Hardcover) $69.20 (was $100) See at Amazon Marvel is no stranger to annual blockbuster events in its comic books, but few can compare to its 2015 mini-series Secret Wars. The culmination of years of storytelling, Secret Wars broke and rebuilt the Marvel Universe, eventually forming a new status quo in the comic books. The massive crossover event centers on the Fantastic Four's leader, Reed Richards, and judging from the few details we know about the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday, it appears the new film will draw from elements of Secret Wars, making now the perfect time to catch up on the storyline. Luckily, Marvel recently published a massive hardcover Secret Wars omnibus edition that collects the entire run and several tie-in issues, and it's on sale for just $69.20 (was $100) at Amazon. Secret Wars Omnibus (Hardcover) $69.20 (was $100) The Secret Wars hardcover collection includes all nine issues of Secret Wars, the 2015 Free Comic Book Day Secret Wars 0 issue, as well as dozens of Avengers comics that tied into the Secret Wars storyline. Here's everything included:Avengers (2012) Issues 35-44New Avengers (2013) Issues 24-33Secret Wars Issue 0Secret Wars (2015) Issues 1-9If you never read it, Secret Wars is set after the Marvel multiverse was destroyed, with only a single reality surviving the incursion events. Ruled by Doctor Doom--who had gained godlike power--various Earths had been combined into a patchwork creation known as Battleworld. This new world was full of unique domains, like a wasteland populated by zombies, a region ruled by the genocidal AI Ultron and its robot hordes, a city of demons, and much more.With various forces conspiring against Doom and survivors from previous realities crash landing on Battleworld, it's only a matter of time before war breaks out to determine the fate of Battleworld and the Marvel universe. See at Amazon This isn't the first Secret Wars mini-series published by Marvel, as this title was first used in a 1984 mini-series. The 2015 version is a spiritual successor, but if you'd like to read the original, you can grab a paperback edition for just $17 (was $35). The original Secret Wars was Marvel's first major crossover event and ran for 12 issues, featuring the Avengers, Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men pitted against their major foes by the unbelievably powerful Beyonder.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Pick how much ice you’d like in your drink: all the way to the brim, half full, a few cubes or no ice at all? Half full, please. That’s purr-fect! 2. Have you ever raised a puppy or a kitten? Yes. It’s a wonderful experience, but be prepared to have your nice things destroyed! Oh, and you can forget about your couch ever looking pristine again. 3. How often do you hit the snooze button in the morning? Just once. I used to just get up when the alarm went right off, but lately, eh, I’ve been loving a little extra sleep. 4. What decade has the best clothes? I’m probably biased because I wish I could go back to 1998 at least once a day, but[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 877 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What sports would you have liked to have played as a kid? I would’ve loved to have taken dance classes. I think I would’ve enjoyed soccer, too. 2. Would you rather listen to the radio or replay a favorite album? Replay a favorite album. Speaking of that, my family will probably freak out if I play the greatest hits from Fleetwood Mac one more time. 3. Have you ever had a job where you had to be on your feet all day? Yup. I’ve done retail and worked in the back of the house in a bakery. Gotta have supportive shoes! 4. Do you have any travel plans for the summer? Right now we’ve got one camping trip to the Russian River planned, and that’s it.
