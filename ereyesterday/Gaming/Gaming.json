    "description": "Gearbox has revealed a new story trailer for its looter-shooter Borderlands 4. While it was brief, it did reveal a fresh look at the game's primary villain, the Timekeeper, his minions, and franchise punching bag Claptrap. Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S--with a Switch 2 version coming at a later date--and the base version of the game is priced at $70. With its launch date drawing closer, Gearbox has been revealing more details on the game, and how it's building on the Borderlands foundation with a seamless world to explore, dynamic events to take part in, and an overhauled drop-rate for weapons that will make legendary-class feel special again.Another big change in Borderlands 4 is its tone, as Gearbox wants the humor in the game to be more grounded. Essentially, this sounds like Borderlands 4 won't be relying on comedy that can become very quickly dated after launch.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you care about Labubus? Nah, I just don’t get the hype. 2. What’s your favorite summer dessert? Hmm, all of them? If pressed to pick one, then ice cream. 3. Do you have plans for the Fourth of July yet? Connor will be dancing with her dance team in the town parade, so that’s our main event during the day. We’ll probably do a barbeque at home after the parade. Where we live doesn’t allow fireworks, so we may or may not go looking for a fireworks display. We’ll see how ambitious we’re feeling! 4. How do you feel about maxi dresses? If it’s in a petite size and the print isn’t too overwhelming, then I’ll rock a maxi dress, for sure. 5.

That reminds me… Tabs wasn’t particularly interested in science or genetics like Rosie is, but he was interested in acting as a father figure to at-risk kittens and a mentor to up-and-coming kitty supermodels. Despite his busy schedule, he always made time for the kittens in his foundation. He would read to them, do homework with them, teach them how to strut and strike poses on the catwalk — all the basic life skills. Rosie Rosie’s view of Father’s Day is a little different. As an introverted, more science-minded cat, she’s more interested in the genetic aspects of parentage.

What are the characteristics of the hardware form factor and accompanying peripherals? The answers to these questions are generally positive but when it comes to LCD screen quality along with its signature VRR and HDR features - well, unfortunately, the drawbacks of Nintendo's display choices far outweigh the benefits.
