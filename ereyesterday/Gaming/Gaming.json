    "description": "Monkey Palace Lego Strategy Board Game $19.11 (was $40) See at Amazon ($19) See at Walmart ($35) See at Target ($40) See at Lego Store ($40) Monkey Palace, an officially licensed Lego board game, is discounted to its lowest price yet at Amazon. For a limited time, you can pick up the family-friendly strategy game for only $19.11, which is over 50% off its $40 list price. Monkey Palace is a fun experience that turns the act of piecing together Lego bricks into a fast-paced and varied strategy game for 2-4 players. As with many of Amazon's deals, the Monkey Palace discount doesn't have an end date listed, so it could disappear at any time. Created by Bezzerwizzer in collaboration with Lego, Monkey Palace released last October and still frequently sells for its full $40 MSRP at most retailers. At the moment, Walmart has it for $35, while Target and the Lego Store are selling the game for $40. Since we often times see price-matching on board games at major retailers, it's a bit surprising that Amazon is selling Monkey Palace for such a low price.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Red Dead Redemption is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, May 18, 2025. Below, we consider that it may be better at showing than telling.As a rule, Westerns are sincere. Sure, there are outright farces like Blazing Saddles. Plenty of classic Westerns like Rio Bravo have a warm, comedic side. Even dark epics like the Searchers have moments of levity. But even when they are funny, Westerns play their archetypes straight. They are easy to make fun of because they are so unfeigned. In this context, Red Dead Redemption struggles to find its place. It imports Grand Theft Auto's satire into a bare and somber world. In many moments, protagonist John Marston is the only voice of reason among cliches and caricatures. When Red Dead Redemption talks, it is often cheap and unserious. When it shuts up, it manages a real poetry, thanks to its austere landscapes and unpretentious world.First, let's dig into its writing. RDR is a sunset Western, set in the waning days of Western expansion. Marston is a man out of time: a cowboy criminal in a world that wants to kill him (and will). Marston is foolish. He hunts down his former compatriots on the behest of the US government, because he hopes they will keep his promise to return his family to him and leave him alone. He is wrong. The killings he undertakes swing back on him and his family alike.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Crisis between colleagues! Today, a special meeting of the Board of Directors of Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC was called to review a most disturbing matter — the repeated and inexplicable disappearance of Chief Feline Officer Rosie’s crunchies. At various times over the past few weeks, Rosie’s food bowl, which had been previously full, has become empty, and as you can imagine, this caused quite a corporate kerfuffle. The results of an internal investigation were inconclusive, but Rosie thinks she knows who’s doing it… Since the official investigation was inconclusive, the board hasn’t taken any action, but Rosie’s suspicions have created a lot of tension… Unfortunately for Marnie, she has a lengthy record of snack theft, so her history isn’t doing her any favors. Plus, she was captured on security footage early this morning in the vicinity of Rosie’s food bowl. When asked about it by the company investigator, Marnie lawyered up… I just hope this gets resolved soon because it’s been bad for morale in the office. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 861 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What made you smile today? It’s early in the day (I just woke up 30 minutes ago), but so far petting Marnie and Rosie, and re-reading the homemade Mother’s Day card Connor made are two things that made me smile. 2. What’s the first thing you do when you get home and walk through the door? Hmmm, well, I want to say that I usually take off my shoes first thing because, hello, I need foot freedom (shoes are so oppressive), but I think what I technically do is lock the door behind me. 3. What’s your favorite cereal? Does oatmeal count? If it doesn’t then, it’s Kellogg’s Special K with the dried red strawberries. I don’t really eat it for breakfast, though. It’s more of a[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 878 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
