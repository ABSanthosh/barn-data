    "description": "The new Citadelle des Morts Zombies map is live in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 with Season 1 Reloaded. This new map includes a full main storyline quest, but it also contains a hidden story cutscene that can only be unlocked by playing as Maya. Here's everything you need to know to experience this hidden cutscene for yourself. Naturally, this guide contains spoilers.Citadelle des Morts is a castle in France, and the Zombies storyline here picks up after the ending of the main story quest for Terminus. This is also an exciting narrative for Zombies fans, as the events of Terminus and Citadelle des Morts merge storylines from Treyarch's previously unconnected Zombies storylines. How to unlock Maya's secret cutsceneThe main prerequisite to unlock this secret is playing Citadelle des Morts as Maya. Follow the in-game prompts that will walk you through the first few steps of the map, leading you to the Pack-a-Punch room. The first step of this Easter egg can't be triggered until after round 11. Keep a zombie alive at the end of round 12 or higher, and then go to the Dining Hall, which is the same room with the Vulture Aid perk. Head upstairs by the Vulture Aid machine, and you'll find a wooden door in the left corner. There's also a table with a radio beside it. Interact with the radio first, and you'll hear a man named Franco speaking to you. He'll unlock the door, letting you enter inside a secret room that's otherwise inaccessible. Once through the door, you'll be inside a very cramped passageway. You'll be swarmed with Vermin enemies if you rush though, so it's best to hang back and take them out first. From there, enter a room with the map's new special enemy type called the Doppelghast. Kill the first one before progressing. Then, you'll run into an elite version of the Doppelghast named Laurent. Kill him to pick up a key. This will let you unlock the door to where Franco is hiding and receive Maya's hidden cutscene. Maya's cutscene explainedMajor spoilers ahead: Maya is introduced as a brand-new character in Zombies. She arrives at Terminus with the hopes of finding her brother Nathan. However, we learn during the events of the Terminus story quest that Nathan has been experimented on by scientists working with Richtofen as part of Project Janus. Sadly, Maya has to kill the mutated mini-boss that was once her brother.In the cutscene, Maya kills Franco. This is part of her revenge tour against the people who hurt her brother, as he was the man working with the French Syndicate who sold her brother to Project Janus and is still working with Richtofen.Additionally, Season 1 Reloaded includes the holiday-themed Merry Mayhem event. The event rewards include the season's new Maelstrom shotgun, a multiplayer perk, and weapon attachment. It also includes the new Light Bend ammo mod and Tesla Storm field upgrade specifically for Zombies, and you might want to consider unlocking them for use on Citadelle des Morts.",

    "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle stars the iconic archaeologist. Naturally, as you delve deeper into all sorts of creepy places, you're bound to encounter some puzzles. One, in particular, is actually based on Jesus Christ's Crucifixion. Here's our guide on how to solve the Five Sacred Wounds puzzle in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.How to solve the Five Sacred Wounds puzzle in Indiana Jones and the Great CircleThe Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Five Sacred Wounds puzzle is an important objective that's part of the Stolen Cat Mummy main quest. It takes place in Vatican City, right after you examine the strange inscriptions with the help of Father Antonio. The Tower of Pope Nicholas VIndy learns that he has to head to the Tower of Pope Nicholas V, which is in the eastern portion of the city. Make sure you're tracking the quest so you can reach the location without hassles.Once inside the building, pour wine in the basin in front of the altar. Then, interact with the bas-relief and rotate it to the left, which shows the angel skewering the demon from above. This will reveal a hidden stairway to the underground section. Take photos of the murals and statuesAt the bottom of this area, you'll see the Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Five Sacred Wounds puzzle. We suggest using the camera to take photos of all the murals and statues. This nets you additional Adventure Points. Here are the ones that are in the area:Three murals in the main chamber, including the puzzle wall in the center. The one on the left has a stone bust, so pick it up and drop it off somewhere.Two murals are in the chamber to your left. You have to destroy the weakened wall to reveal a small room that has the Longinus statue.The room at the right-hand side of the main chamber also has another mural. Pour wine and check the Roman numeralsYour goal now is to pour wine into each basin in front of the murals/statues. Once the basin has been drained, you're going to notice that Roman numerals have appeared:Christ with a chalice at his right side (hand): IIChrist with bread at his left side (hand): IIChrist standing and there's a glowing glyph to your left (foot): IIIChrist sitting and there's a glowing glyph to your right (foot): IVLonginus statue (side/torso): III Move the latches based on the Five Sacred WoundsAs mentioned earlier, the Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Five Sacred Wounds puzzle is based on the Crucifixion. However, the solution itself isn't based on the correct order in any prayer, stigmata phenomenon, or religious iconography. Rather, it's just based on the Roman numerals that you've seen in the basins.All you need to do is move the latches in the central wall where Christ is crucified depending on the wounds/body parts and the Roman numerals. Look directly at the puzzle wall itself and use the solution below for each latch:Hand (upper-left): IIHand (upper-right): IITorso/spear: IIIFoot (lower-left): IIIFoot (lower-right): IVThat does it for our guide on how to solve the Five Sacred Wounds puzzle in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. If you do it right, the wall will move, revealing a hidden passageway. This leads you to the underground crypt, which has even more mysteries and secrets.",

    "description": "The legacy of Indiana Jones has been on rather shaky ground lately. His last two films didn't quite hit the mark, and it's been even longer since a game has managed to do him justice either. It's a feeling that developer MachineGames seems acutely aware of, too, in the opening stretch of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. If there was ever a need to prove the studio fully understands what makes Indy great and what he's about, then letting us play a word for word, and almost shot for shot recreation of the iconic prologue from Raiders of the Lost Ark certainly isn't the worst way to go about it.

    "description": "I think It’s safe to say that Trigger Happy Interactive’s upcoming survival horror Total Chaos is a bit of a palette change from their last offering - the frenetic, neon-drenched, chainsaw-legged Turbo Overkill. Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention. Total Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like. Read more",

    "description": "I’m hesitant to say that I’ve got my makeup mojo back because I feel like the moment that I say that I’ll revert to just wearing brow pencil and tinted sunscreen for three years, as one does, but I’m gonna go ahead and risk it and say that it all started with a little bit of Club. You know, MAC Club eyeshadow? Of course you do. It’s a classic. Last week, out of nowhere, I thought to myself, “I really need to wear Club.” It’s been years since I’ve wanted to deal with complicated eye makeup, but I got the urge, so I went with it. My makeup collection is pretty barren compared to the thick of MBB’s beauty blogging days, but I’ve held on to this ancient Monster’s Bride palette from —I don’t even wanna say the year. LOL! I’ve always loved the shadows, especially Club. I took a little bit of Club, popped it on my lids and smoothed out the edges with a fluffy brush dipped in face powder.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. A habit that changed your life? Getting up early. For most of my life I was a night owl, and when I had Connor that all changed. When she was an infant, I started waking up at the crack of dawn to sneak in work before she woke up in the morning. The habit ended up sticking, and now I’m an early bird. 2. Fruit or cupcakes? As much as I love a small cake smothered in frosting, I’m gonna have to go with fruit. 3. Are you doing any advent calendars this year? At Trader Joe’s a couple weeks ago, I picked up a few for the “kids” – Connor, Rosie and Marnie. Ha ha ha! 4. Something on your Christmas list?
