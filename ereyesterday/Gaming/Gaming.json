    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/most-ridiculous-mascots-in-college-football-26/2900-6739/",
    "description": "A college football game can be seen as a whole sensory experience rather than just a sporting event. From the lively crowds to the bands and cheerleaders to the often unhinged actions on the field, there's a reason why college football is consistently one of the most-watched sports in America. A large part of what makes college football so special is the unique mascots that attend every game. All mascots want to do is see their team win and make the experience a memorable one for the fans in attendance.Naturally, College Football 26 features dozens of mascots that you can see all throughout a game. However, as all fans know, some mascots are simply more entertaining and ridiculous than others. These mascots truly stand out in any match, and if you want to see these mascots consistently, check out our list of the top 10 most ridiculously fun mascots in College Football 26. Stanford - The TreeOfficially, Stanford has no mascot since the school doesn't have a traditional name. Stanford is just \"Stanford University,\" but does have the team name \"Cardinal.\" However, the red bird isn't a part of Stanford's branding in the slightest. So, you wouldn't expect them to have one of the best mascots in the country. Well, in case you didn't know, Stanford has the \"Tree\" mascot, which is a nod to the green pine tree that dons Stanford's classic football helmets. The Stanford Tree is an unofficial mascot, but still shows up at most sporting events for the university, including its football games. This is quite lucky for the fans, as the Tree is a hilarious mascot that looks like it was just pulled off the street. The mascot has frequently changed over the years, but its famous googly eyes and tall, leafy stature have remained the same. BYU - Cosmo the CougarCosmo the Cougar is one of the most famous mascots in college sports. The surprisingly athletic cougar shows up all over the field at BYU football games, and has a knack for doing pushups, taking part in choreographed dances with the cheerleaders, and heckling fans of the opposing team. You'll also see Cosmo do some incredible stunts on the field, and he could be the star of the game depending on how BYU is playing. Oregon - Puddles the DuckOregon's Puddles the Duck is arguably the most well-known and popular mascot across America, and that includes professional sports. Bearing a striking resemblance to Disney's Donald Duck, Oregon's mascot is responsible for one of the most unique intros in College Football 26. Puddles rides in on a motorcycle to lead the players out onto the field and runs all over the field after he disembarks. Oregon's mascot also does a pushup for every point Oregon scores, which can be quite the ordeal given how potent the Ducks' offense is every year. The Pop-TartThis is the first and only mascot in College Football 26 that isn't a part of a team. EA decided to add the Pop-Tarts Bowl mascot into the game this year, and that's certainly a decision that fans can get behind. The Pop-Tart has all sorts of fun dances and animations in CFB 26, but it also just puts a smile on your face. You'll see the Pop-Tart mascot if your team makes it to the Pop-Tarts Bowl, which isn't usually a great accomplishment, but in this case, it is. Arkansas and Western Kentucky - Big RedIt's not often that we see a school share a mascot with the same name, but that's the case with Arkansas and Western Kentucky's Big Red. Fortunately, both versions of Big Red are great in College Football 26. Arkansas' version is a red razorback that charges onto the field with speed and adrenaline, while WKU's version tends to move its stomach around more than anything. You might get more of a kick out of WKU's Big Red, who looks like a McDonald's cast-off, whereas Arkansas' is a more traditional mascot. Akron - ZippyZippy is one of the new mascot additions in College Football 26, and it's a wonder why EA didn't include her in CFB 25. Zippy is one of the few female mascots in college football, and she's a kangaroo that does plenty of dancing every game. Pair that with a pretty hilarious design, and you've got quite the enjoyable mascot. Of course, you'll have to play as Akron to see Zippy every game, but that's a problem for another day. Michigan State - SpartyMichigan State's Sparty is a classic mascot, sporting a look that matches the team's logo and colors while still being an enjoyable presence at every MSU game. Sparty has a great entrance onto the field before a game begins and is always on the sidelines or with the cheerleaders performing some kind of dance. You'll also find him flexing his massive muscles or messing with fans on the opposite side of the field. Utah - SwoopBird mascots are a dime a dozen in sports, so one really needs to stand out to be considered among the elite. Utah's Swoop has certainly done that since it was introduced in the 1990s. The red hawk does an outstanding job as Utah's mascot, driving onto the field on a motorcycle to lead the players out and constantly flapping its wings all game long. The motorcycle entrance wasn't included in College Football 25, but it's now fully a part of CFB 26. Arizona State- SparkyFinally, we have Sparky, the hilariously named mascot for the Arizona State Sun Devils. Sparky is famous for throwing his pitchfork down onto the endzone turf before every ASU game, which really riles the fans up. While Sparky isn't nearly as intimidating as a real devil would be, he always comes to the field with a load of energy and ways to get the crowd into the game.",

    "description": "Later this year, Borderlands 4 will send players to explore a new planet called Kairos. A previous trailer introduced the game's villain, the Timekeeper, and his minions. Now, the Borderlands 4 dev team is sharing a closer look at Kairos itself, as well as the various factions who live there. As mentioned in the video, Kairos is a prison planet that's been ruled by the Timekeeper for a long time. The Timekeeper's control over the population may not be absolute, but he still possesses the technology to oppress the people and see through their eyes at his whim.Most of the new factions introduced in the video have their own reasons to hate the Timekeeper. The lone exception so far is Idolater Sol of the Fadefields. He's been exiled from the capital city and Sol is eager to get back in the Timekeeper's good graces and prove his worth after the players' party arrives on the planet. The other factions may oppose the Timekeeper, but there's no guarantee they'll be on the side of the player.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you keep backups of your favorite products? These days, the only backups I buy are things I know I’ll finish on a regular basis (like shampoo and conditioner, or body lotion). I don’t even bother with makeup backups anymore, though. If I finish something like a blush or an eyebrow pencil, great, and if it’s still around when it’s time to restock, that’s even better. If it’s discontinued, I might mourn it a little bit, but there’s always something new coming out, and I don’t mind trying new things, so I don’t stress about it too much. 2. Something that you read/watched/listened to recently that was surprisingly great?

I also love that you can put them in salads, roast them or just eat them plain with a variety of different dips. 2. A song that’s been stuck in your head lately? “Top of the World” by The Carpenters has been on repeat in my car. 3. Something you’ve been avoiding lately?
