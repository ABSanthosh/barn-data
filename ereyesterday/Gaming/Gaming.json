In fact, it currently holds a 93 on Metacritic, which includes GameSpot's 9/10 review, making it the best-reviewed video game of 2025 so far. It was immediately clear that publisher Kepler Interactive hadn't anticipated the level of demand for the debut title from Sandfall Interactive. Physical editions of the budget-priced $50 release have essentially been sold out since the game's April 24 launch. But fast forward to June, and we're finally starting to see retailers replenish their stock.Amazon restocked the PS5 physical edition on June 9. Meanwhile, GameStop is taking preorders on a reprint of its exclusive $70 Lumiere Edition.

IO exec Hakan Abrak has offered his view on how 007: First Light's Bond will play differently to 47 in an interview with IGN, which I'm glad to see also saw him emphasise that the studio aren't done with the Hitman series.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Loose or fitted t-shirts? Generally, I like my tees slightly loose-y goose-y if I’m wearing them with jeans or shorts. If I’m layering with a sweater or a sweatshirt on top, then fitted. 2. What’s the oldest thing in your makeup bag right now? Hmm, the brushes? Oh, and I’m almost embarrassed to say this out loud, but I have an ancient Nordstrom Naturals MAC palette that I bust out every so often. 3. How’s your June going so far? It’s been very, very busy with end-of-the-year activities, dance things and whatnot. Things will kinda slow down after June 30, which I’m looking forward to. 4. How do you feel about walking around in sandals or flip flops without your toenails painted? I like my toe nails[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 882 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What time do you usually wake up in the morning? These days, 6 in the morning. Ideally my day would start off at 5:30, though. 2. How organized is your purse? It’s on the verge of haphazard, always, LOL! I mean, I can find the usual things I absolutely need – my phone, wallet, keys, medication, lipgloss. But do I find those things in an efficient manner? No. 3. If you could make one rule that everyone around you had to follow, what would it be? Make your deadlines. I can’t stand it when people are casual about due dates! 4. How do you feel about wearing makeup when it’s hot? I’ll do it, but I don’t like to do too many layers. I’m happy with cream[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 881 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
