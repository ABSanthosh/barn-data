    "description": "How’s your Christmas shopping coming along? I hope you aren’t having to brave the crowds in these last couple days. Have I ever told you that one of my least favorite things on Earth — ON EARTH — is parking lots at Christmas? Not. A. Fan. Man, the Costco parking lot by my house? Or, rather, any Costco parking lot in any town in America at Christmas? How can it take 20 minutes for my car to move 20 feet? Ladybugs on the ground are passing my car. A snail that hitched a ride on my car overnight literally climbed back down to the road because it knew it could go faster. 😂 But I digress… Tabs loved Christmases, but it was easy for him because he was the boss, whereas I’m the one who had to do all the jobs. I had to decorate the office, make all the ornaments, get all the gifts, schedule all the cat spa services. It was a lot! Thankfully, Rosie is more chill about Christmas. She pretty much[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 843 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Who would you rather go dancing with: your significant other, your best friend or your kid (if you have one)? Honestly, I’d love to go with Connor, LOL! 2. Spa weekend or a music festival weekend? Spa weekend, 100%. 3. Have you had any eggnog this holiday season? Nope, none! I don’t really crave it, but if it’s there, I’ll have a small cup. 4. Who would you rather have lunch with: your favorite musician, your favorite actor, your favorite author or your favorite teacher? Honestly, if she was still alive, lunch with my favorite teacher from elementary would be lovely. The last time I saw her, I was 18. 5. Do you pop the zit or leave it alone? I dunno, how ripe is it?
