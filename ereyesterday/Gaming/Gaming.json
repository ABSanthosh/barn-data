    "description": "If you need Windows 11, it's hard to beat the current deal over at StackSocial. For a limited time, you can get a Windows 11 Pro license for only $10. Make sure to use GameSpot's exclusive promo code WINDOWS at checkout to get the full discount, otherwise you'll pay $15 for the license key. This Windows 11 Pro deal was available to GameSpot readers in early March, but if you missed out then, you have another chance to snag it.Licenses for Windows 11 Pro and Home purchased directly from Microsoft cost $200 or $139, respectively. If your computer is running Windows 10 already, you can upgrade to Windows 11 Home for free, but this deal is awesome for anyone who is currently in the process of building a PC. Get deal at StackSocial Windows 11 Pro License Key $10 with promo code WINDOWS Microsoft introduced Windows 11 four years ago, so many PC owners have moved on from its predecessor. A big chunk of gamers, however, have stuck with Windows 10. A survey conducted by Valve earlier this year showed that nearly half of all Steam users are gaming on Windows 10, which Microsoft will stop supporting this October.If you're ready to make the leap to Windows 11 and are building a new PC, we've listed some of the key features included with the Pro license below.Windows 11 Pro featuresEnhanced security featuresCustom layoutsBitLocker device encryptionDevice encryptionFind my deviceFirewall \u0026 network protectionInternet protectionParental controls \u0026 protectionSecure bootWindows HelloWindows Information Protection (WIP)Windows SecurityImportant: Windows 11 Pro licenses purchased from StackSocial must be redeemed within 30 days. Codes that haven't been activated within the redemption window can be returned for store credit. See at StackSocial Before upgrading to Windows 11, make sure your computer has enough storage space for the install. Microsoft's minimum requirement is 64GB, though the actual install size is closer to 30GB. Existing Windows 10 users can upgrade to Windows 11 for free, but if you want the Pro version on your old computer, it's worth noting that you need to be on Windows 10 to install the new OS. In addition to the storage requirement, Windows 11 requires a 1GHz or faster CPU and 4GB RAM. If you need help verifying your computer's eligibility for Windows 11, check out Microsoft's support page for instructions.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. How would you rather spend some unexpected afternoon free time: watching a movie, going for a walk or reading a book? I’d love some extra time to read! I recently found a new-to-me author that I enjoy, Rebecca Searle, and I’m going through all of her books. 2. What did you last cry about? Well, I went to the OBGYN last week, and I had a mini-meltdown when the nice nurse took my blood pressure. I think it’s a little bit of leftover post-traumatic stress from going to the doctor so much last year along with some hormonal stuff (dang this peri-menopause). 3. What would you rather do with a friend: play card games, have a picnic in the park or go to the farmers’ market?

What could you use most right now: cuddles with pets, a hot cup of tea or a nap? I’m drinking a hot cup of tea at the moment, and I’m not too sleepy, so I’ll take the cuddles from the pets. 2. On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest, how concerned are you about AI? Girl. As someone who named her daughter after a great science fiction heroine who rises up to help defeat the robots, I’m going to give this a solid 10. I’m freaked out, man! 3. Something unexpected that happened to you recently? Well, I saw a bobcat out of my window when I was at work last week! (See the pic at the top.)
