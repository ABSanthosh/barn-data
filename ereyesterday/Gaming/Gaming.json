    "description": "Candy Crush is getting another feather in its cap. Rather than offering another twist on match-three puzzling, Candy Crush Solitaire will bring the franchise's sickly sweet aesthetic to the card game classic. It will be the first Candy Crush game to release after Microsoft's acquisition of developer King.Candy Crush Solitaire bases itself on tripeaks solitaire, in which players must clear three \"peaks\" of cards. The game will feature familiar power-ups from Candy Crush, including jelly fish, the lollipop hammer, the color bomb, and the UFO. They will offer similar, but not exactly the same, powers as their match-three counterparts. Much like other Candy Crush games, the basic solitaire gameplay will be altered and made more challenging as players progress. Candy Crush Solitaire will launch worldwide on February 6. Players can pre-register now on the app store of their choice and they'll receive some in-game rewards: 5,000 Coins, four undos, two fish cards, and three color bomb cards.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. If you could eat one food all day long, what would it be? Popcorn! If left to my own devices, I could easily have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 2. Who in your life is most like you? To be honest, probably my dog, Marnie. 3. Your current favorite store? Ooh, girl. You know you’ve crossed a bridge when you no longer want to hang out at Sephora or Nordstrom anymore. LOL!

    "description": "Tabs was world renowned for his ambitious new year’s resolutions, whether it was training for the Iron Cat Triathlon, studying for the MCCATs (Medical Cat College Admission Test) or committing to walk in all four of the year’s big feline fashion shows — the so-called Grand Slam of kitty supermeowdelry. But his goals weren’t always epic. Sometimes, they were something simple… My darlings, The new year is upon us, and, with that, many new year’s resolutions. I was talking to a few kitty friends of mine, and one resolution that always pops up is getting fit. Believe it or not, despite my statuesque frame, fitness is something I actually have to work hard to achieve. This body doesn’t come naturally. Well…most of it does, but I do have to put in the work, and I believe in putting in the work, especially in the pursuit of purr-fection.
