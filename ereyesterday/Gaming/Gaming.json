    "description": "Ah, Bungie. Every so often the Destiny 2 developer will surprise Guardians globally by subtly launching a mission or quietly adding secrets to the game. This time around, the Barrow Dyad Exotic mission has been added to the game with the weekly reset, and no prior warning at all.Luckily, we've figured out how to locate the new Derealize Exotic mission, how to start it, and we have a step-by-step guide on how you can get your hands on the bizarre-looking SMG.Table of Contents [hide]Nether BlightsNether BlightsIf you've been playing Destiny 2 Episode Heresy already, you'll be familiar with the Nether activity. Formerly, we thought that you'd need to reload it until you spawn at the Trenchway or Hall of Souls, but it seems that you can start the Exotic quest from any landing zone in the Nether; you just might have a bit more of a search on your hands before you can trigger the quest steps.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Best Buy has brought back one of the most popular gaming accessory deals we saw last summer. The Asus ROG 65W Charger Dock is on sale for only $30. Normally $65, the official Asus Charger Dock was designed with the ROG Ally family of PC handhelds in mind. That said, you can use this portable docking station with other handhelds, including Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch--just make sure you update the accessory to its latest firmware. Asus ROG 65W Charger Dock $30 (was $65) It doubles as both a power brick and a docking station thanks to its built-in HDMI 2.0 port and USB 2.0 port. It connects to your handheld via USB-C to deliver power. As long as the device you want to use supports external displays and doesn't draw more than 65W of power, you should be able to use it with the ROG Charger Dock.It supports fast-charging via USB-C and is capable of displaying in 1080p with a 120Hz refresh rate or 4K at 60Hz. You can also use the USB-A port to charge a separate device, which could save you a spot in your power brick. Or you can use the USB-A port for accessories, such as dongles for keyboards, mice, or controllers.The compact design makes it ideal for travel, so if you bring your ROG Ally or Steam Deck with you on trips, this can substitute for a traditional dock--though you may want to pair it with a budget-friendly portable stand, like this great one from JSAUX. See at Best Buy Keep in mind that the ROG 65W Charger Dock deal has sold out quickly in the past, and it's very possible the same will happen with this deal before the end of the week.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Shrimp or crab? Crab, but it can’t be imitation, and it has to be fresh. 2. Yoga or pilates? Both are equally as challenging for this very out-of-shape lady at the moment. LOL! (Been a rough 12 months.) I’ll pick yoga; I could use a good stretch. 3. Something that makes you feel sentimental? When my phone brings up baby photos of Connor or old photos of Tabs before he got sick. My heart swells up every single time. 4. What book are you reading at the moment? Nothing at the moment, boo. I need a good one. Got anything to suggest? I would like something not too heavy or scary. 5. Something you wish you said no to sooner? I wish I would’ve said no to[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 868 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

In fact, he won the Kitty Bowl a record eight times, making him more accomplished than even Tom Brady. Yes, Tabs was quite the cat athlete. Today’s game starts in a few minutes, and while Tabs is no longer here to watch the game with me, I’m sure he’ll be watching from up above. This happens to also be the last Sunday before Valentine’s. Marnie and Rosie are both more interested in that aspect of the day than the football. I can appreciate that. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S.
