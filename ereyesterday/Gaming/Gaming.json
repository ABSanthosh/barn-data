    "description": "Asus ROG Ally $400 (was $500) See at Walmart The Asus ROG Ally with the AMD Ryzen Z1 chip is available for $400 at Walmart. This $100 discount might possibly be one of the last deals we see on the base model ROG Ally. Best Buy, the exclusive retail partner for the ROG Ally, has changed its listing to note the Z1 model is no longer available in new condition.So, why does Walmart have the ROG Ally if it's exclusive to Best Buy? Well, Walmart doesn't really have the handheld. This deal is hosted on Walmart's site, but your order will be shipped and sold by Antonline. Nevertheless, it's eligible for Walmart's extended holiday returns; if you have any issues or are buying it as a gift, the ROG Ally can be returned to your local Walmart through January 31. Asus ROG Ally $400 (was $500) The base model ROG Ally comes with a sharp 1080p screen, AMD’s Ryzen Z1 processor, 16GB LPDDR5 6400 RAM, and an internal 512GB NVMe SSD.If that's not enough space, you can always make use of a microSD card for a quick and cheap storage upgrade. Alternatively, you can upgrade the internal SSD with the WD Black SN770M 1TB or 2TB drive, which is on sale at Best Buy, too. If you want to upgrade your SSD without spending over $100, the Corsair MP600 Core Mini 1TB SSD for only $70 at Amazon.The ROG Ally offers impressive performance for the price. It's not going to play graphically demanding games at high settings, but you still can play many AAA titles in 1080p resolution with at least 30fps. It's an especially great little machine for older AAA titles and indie games that feel right at home on handhelds.It's worth noting that Windows can be cumbersome on gaming handhelds, unless you pair it with a traditional mouse and keyboard setup. We'd recommend grabbing a budget-friendly docking station, so you can use the device like a regular desktop PC when needing to do anything complex within Windows. Asus also makes a 65W Charger Dock, which has ports for USB-C, USB 2.0, and HDMI 2.0.Asus has a proprietary app called Armoury Crate that gives you a more traditional console-like interface for gaming, which is quite helpful after you have things squared away on the Windows side.

This set has only been discounted a few times since its release last year, and Target's deal ends tomorrow, November 12. See at Target The end result of this large-scale build is a detailed 18-inch model of the Wookie hero with his iconic Bowcaster Rifle and bandolier. Like many Lego Star Wars model sets designed for adults, it comes with a display plaque with key details about Chewie and a minifigure. Chewbacca was one of the marquee Lego Star Wars sets released for Return of the Jedi's 40th anniversary.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1.Something you accomplished recently that makes you feel good? I helped Connor start a weekly chart to track her chores around the house, and we’ve been refining it over a few weeks to see what works and what doesn’t work. It took a while to figure it out, to be honest. I’m feeling good about it, and I think she is too; I’m hoping it sets her up with good habits for the future. 2. Last beauty product you bought? I grabbed a cream shadow from Charlotte Tilbury, the Eyes to Mesmerise Cream Shadow in Oyster Pearl, a shimmery bronze-gold, from the Sephora fall sale. 3. Pick your fun eyeliner color – green, purple or blue? Purple, please! 4. Walking outside in the rain – yes or no?[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 856 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Novato police are on the lookout for a burglar who broke into the Novato Museum of Cat Antiquities last night. Detective Rosie was first on the scene. “Meow,” she said, when asked for a description of the burglar. The break in occurred shortly after 2:00 AM, and police were alerted when the burglar set off the museum’s security alarm. Police put out an APB and started a manhunt…although video surveillance suggests the suspect could be a canine. “Meow,” said Detective Rosie. If you or someone you know has information that leads to the arrest of the Novato Museum of Cat Antiquities burglar, Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC is offering a reward. Company founder and former Chief Feline Officer Tabs was a captain in the Canadian Cat Mounties before embarking upon his successful career as a kitty supermodel and entrepreneur, and the company continues to be a strong supporter of law enforcement. “Meow,” said Rosie again. Sooner or later, we’ll catch this criminal.
