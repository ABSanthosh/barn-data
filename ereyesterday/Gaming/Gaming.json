    "description": "From the first trailer, I knew Neva would be an emotional experience. Nomada Studio's previous game, Gris, was a poignant exploration of grief and the effects it can have on a person, told through the lens of a young girl who'd just lost her mother. Neva explores familial bonds through a different but just as emotional lens: parenthood.The relationship between Alba and Neva mirrors a mother/child relationship through most of the game. The wolf starts as a small cub, curious about the world and ready to explore, and eventually he becomes a strong protector, equaling his mother's capabilities. From there, the two fight against the blight that's affecting the world, with Neva learning new abilities in every season.The journey encompassing this coming of age includes some of the strongest voice acting you'll find in a video game this year. However, unlike games like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Metaphor: ReFantazio, which are bursting with dialogue, Neva accomplishes this feat with a much smaller script; throughout the entire five-hour adventure, only one word is ever spoken.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What do you need to do the most: rest, get organized or connect with others? All of the above! Right now, the thing I need most is to get organized, though. Since October, I’ve felt like I’ve been pulled along by external forces, and I don’t want to feel like that anymore. I want to feel like I’m in charge of where my life is going, you know? 2. Who would you rather hang out with: Santa Claus, Snoop Dog, the aliens (let’s assume they’re friendly) or Cupid? Santa Claus, of course! He’s my homeboy. Together we make magic happen. 3. Which would you rather do: visit a haunted house, fly a plane, sing in front of an audience or try rock climbing on actual rocks?
