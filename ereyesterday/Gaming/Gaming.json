The Fortnite Lego lineup includes the Battle Bus with a bunch of minifigures, a Peely Bone display model, the Supply Llama, and the Durrr Burger.All four sets initially launched in October as Lego Store exclusives, but now you'll start seeing them on store shelves--as long as they remain in stock, of course. The Fortnite Battle Bus is the No. 1 best-selling new Lego set at Amazon right now, and Walmart is currently sold out of units.

    "description": "Zelda fans can now get the Great Deku Tree Lego set at major retailers. Launched last September as a Lego Store exclusive, the first building set based on The Legend of Zelda is now available at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target. The superb 2,500-piece Great Deku Tree Display Model is a 2-in-1 package that lets fans build the Deku Tree as depicted in Breath of the Wild or Ocarina of Time.Buy The Great Deku Tree Lego Set at:AmazonBest BuyWalmartTargetLego StoreIt's worth noting the Great Deku Tree is currently on backorder from the Lego Store and won't ship for two months, so it's certainly possible other retailers will sell out, too. As of now, all major retailers have the Great Deku Tree in stock and can ship it now. Lego The Legend of Zelda: Great Deku Tree costs $300, but My Best Buy Plus/Total members save 10%, which drops the price down to $270. My Best Buy Plus costs $50/year, so new members will already be getting $30 of that fee back with this one purchase. All in-stock Lego sets are eligible for this perk, including the brand-new Mario Kart lineup. The Lego Mario Kart lineup is more budget friendly, with all six vehicle playsets adding up to $220. If you bought all of the Mario Kart sets and the new Zelda set, the membership will be fully paid off.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The longest novel ever written is generally agreed to be Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past - a coward’s pick, since it’s actually 13 different volumes. Don’t let Proust’s despicable lies sully the joy of literature for you, though. He did have a good quality moustache - a far more important literary trait than actually doing any writing, imo.

But his goals weren’t always epic. Sometimes, they were something simple… My darlings, The new year is upon us, and, with that, many new year’s resolutions. I was talking to a few kitty friends of mine, and one resolution that always pops up is getting fit. Believe it or not, despite my statuesque frame, fitness is something I actually have to work hard to achieve. This body doesn’t come naturally. Well…most of it does, but I do have to put in the work, and I believe in putting in the work, especially in the pursuit of purr-fection. Because you’re my favorite fans, here are my top tips to get in tip-top shape in 2016. Walking works!

    "description": "Happy New Year, friend! I sincerely believe 2025 will bring us so many wonderful things, including good health, joy and adventure! Connor and I spent the last day of 2024 soaking up art at the SF Museum of Modern Art, aka the SF MOMA and one of my favorite places in the world, with some of our favorite people. It was so nurturing for my soul to be surrounded by beautiful art and kind friends. ‘Twas the purr-fect way to wrap up the year.
