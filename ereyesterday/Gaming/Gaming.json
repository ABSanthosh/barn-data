The Wolverine Limited-Edition Steelbook is back in stock at Amazon for $66. If you're looking for the Deadpool steelbook, unfortunately that one remains sold out. Unlike many 4K Blu-rays with limited-edition steelbooks, Deadpool and Wolverine retained its $66 list price at Amazon leading up to last week's launch. It's a high price for a 4K steelbook edition, especially when compared to the standard 4K Blu-ray edition, which is available for $25 (50% off its list price).

    "description": "Turtle Beach is releasing a modular wireless Xbox controller called the Stealth Pivot that launches November 26, and preorders are available now at Amazon. Compared to Turtle Beach's Stealth Ultra ($200) and other customizable controllers, including Victrix's modular controller ($180), the Stealth Pivot is surprisingly \"cheap\" at $130. Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot wireless modular controller $130 | Releases November 26 Unlike other modular controllers that use detachable pieces, the Stealth Pivot features two rotating modules that are integrated directly into the gamepad.The right module features a standard thumbstick and four face buttons on one side and a six-button fight pad on the other.The left module has the standard thumbstick and D-pad on one side, but if you flip this one, you'll have a D-pad above two face buttons.The modules can be flipped on the fly to match your preferred layout. For example, you can use the standard Xbox controller layout for first-person shooters, then flip to the six-button module for fighting games. We're not sure how helpful the extra two face buttons on the left module would be, but Turtle Beach was smart to move the D-pad into the other slot for fighting games, side-scrollers, and other games that feel more natural with D-pad movement controls.Both thumbsticks use Hall Effect anti-drift sensors. Preorder at Amazon While the reversible modules are the Stealth Pivot’s main features, the controller can be customized in other ways, such as adjustable trigger and thumbstick sensitivity, four remappable microswitch buttons, adjustable trigger locks, and digital or analog modes for the D-pad. The Stealth Pivot sports some other cool features, including a mini-LED which is used to configure up to five custom control profiles, adjust settings, and even display social notifications or other alerts. It also supports rumble and various Turtle Beach audio enhancement features like EQ presets, chat volume mixing, and more. It can connect via 2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth 5.2, or wired USB to Xbox consoles, PC, or mobile. In wireless mode, it offers up to 20 hours of battery life and has quick charging via USB-C.

Sometimes, Indy's magic fingers help you glean an object you need from the game's religiously-sourced piles of Lucasfilm memorabilia.

Anyway, it's finally my chance for a bite at the apple, for developers Weappy Wholesome have just given their slice of throwback La La Land an early access release date: January 16th 2025.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last Halloween costume you wore? Hmm, a couple years ago I was a panda! It was a low-effort panda though. LOL! 2. Best and worst Halloween candy? I used to love Snickers, but now I find them too sweet, so please give me all the Ghrirardelli Caramel Squares. As for the worst ones, I automatically toss the rolls of Smarties and anything licorice related. Blech! 3. Pick your Halloween nail color – orange or black? Black with a high shine top coat please. 4. Vampires or werewolves? I’d rather hang out with the werewolves. 5. Scariest Halloween movie? “The Shining” still freaks me out! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon.[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 854 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "No one threw a Halloween shindig like Tabs — fancy cat costumes, spooky snacks, special appearances from top-tier talent, including Tabs. In fact, Heidi Klum stole the idea for her spooky soirees from him. Here’s a look back at a typical Halloween 🎃 and all the prep Tabs usually did. My Darlings, There’s an old saying in the plus-size kitty modeling world: “Go big or go home,” and I take that phrase to heart when it comes to hosting parties. I want my guests to be talking about them for years to come. Being a famous feline supermodel, I’ve hosted many Halloween shindigs in my time, and I have almost a decade of party-planning experience. In that vein, here are the four essential components of a successful feline Halloween party. 1. Invitations First things first — the invitations. In the digital age, e-vites and group invites via Facebook are acceptable; however, I’m a little old fashioned. I prefer paper invitations. Do what I do, and ask your assistant to design you a custom invite.
