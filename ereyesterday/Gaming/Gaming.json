    "description": "As surprising as it was to see Nintendo drop an uncharacteristically creepy teaser earlier this year about a masked man known as \"Emio,\" few could have expected it would be related to a brand-new entry in the company's long-dormant Famicom Detective Club series. What's less surprising is just how riveting the game turned out to be, an expertly paced thriller whose setting, music, and atmosphere masterfully crescendo into one of the most suspenseful denouements Nintendo has ever conjured.Spoilers for Emio - The Smiling Man follow.The lead-up to this climax, however, is anything but straightforward. Like the previous two games in the Famicom Detective Club series, Emio - The Smiling Man is a slow-burn detective story--a densely plotted mystery that unravels methodically over the course of roughly a dozen hours. Picking up a few years after the events of The Missing Heir, the Utsugi Detective Agency is enlisted to aid police detectives Junko Kuze and Daisuke Kamihara in investigating the death of a teenage boy, who was discovered wearing a paper bag unsettlingly scrawled with a smiley face.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Astro Bot got me right in the feels this year. Other games undoubtedly had more affecting storylines and characters, but as someone who obviously loves video games a great deal, Sony's PS5 nostalgia-fest drilled right into whichever part of my brain processes joy.

Whether it's donning a disguise in The Last Crusade to get his father’s Holy Grail diary back, or sneaking onto a submarine to follow the Ark when it slipped out of his grasp, there's always a time he needs to be silent and sneaky - though whether Indy actually pulls this off without being caught is another matter entirely. He's not always the subtlest of human beings, which is precisely one of the reasons I feel stealth in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle works so well. Read more",

    "description": "Hello, my friend. Merry Christmas to you! I hope that today you’re feeling loved, calm and joyful. We got back from Hawaii a couple days ago, and it’s been a whirlwind of cookie baking, card writing and gift delivering so far. I still feel the aloha sprit in my heart, though, and it’s keeping me warm and cozy in this chilly Bay Area day. How have your holidays been so far? I feel like mine flew by in the blink of an eye. Although I wanted to do so much more for everyone in my life, I’ve realized that at a certain point one just needs to accept that there’s only so many hours in the day and so much energy to go around, and you can only do the best you can. It’s truly been a season of grace on this end of the keyboard. Grace for myself, and grace for others. Anywho, since I spent most of last week with my toes in the sand, here are some pictures that I’ve been meaning[Continue reading...] The post Merry Christmas appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "How’s your Christmas shopping coming along? I hope you aren’t having to brave the crowds in these last couple days. Have I ever told you that one of my least favorite things on Earth — ON EARTH — is parking lots at Christmas? Not. A. Fan. Man, the Costco parking lot by my house? Or, rather, any Costco parking lot in any town in America at Christmas? How can it take 20 minutes for my car to move 20 feet? Ladybugs on the ground are passing my car. A snail that hitched a ride on my car overnight literally climbed back down to the road because it knew it could go faster. 😂 But I digress… Tabs loved Christmases, but it was easy for him because he was the boss, whereas I’m the one who had to do all the jobs. I had to decorate the office, make all the ornaments, get all the gifts, schedule all the cat spa services. It was a lot! Thankfully, Rosie is more chill about Christmas.
