    "description": "Earlier this year, Nintendo debuted a brief first look at the Switch 2 which didn't offer many details about the new console. However, there was a moment in the teaser video where the next generation of Joy-Cons appeared to move over a flat surface like a mouse. Now, a Japanese patent application filed in August 2023 appears to confirm that the Joy-Cons will have mouse capabilities.The application was publicly revealed on February 6, and it includes an early schematic for the new Joy-Con, which it describes as the \"input device.\" The patent also states that it has \"a sensor for mouse operation,\" which functions in a similar way that normal mice work with computers. Adding the mouse capabilities open up some intriguing possibilities for gameplay on Switch 2. Will shooter fans have the option to use the mouse instead of the conventional controller? This could potentially work very well with PC games that were designed to be played with mouse. It's also possible that Nintendo is working on some new titles that can take advantage of these mouse functions in ways we haven't thought of yet.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "You meet a lot of characters in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, but few are as intriguing as Katherine. First encountered early in the campaign, you soon realize that there's more to her than meets the eye. Perhaps Henry has a chance to woo her down the line. Here's our guide on how to romance Katherine in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Likewise, please be reminded that this article contains spoilers.How to romance Katherine in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Romance guideThe Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Katherine romance is less of a singular important decision, and more of a gradual change throughout the course of the campaign. At first, Katherine seems aloof and distant, though you eventually see how she develops feelings for Henry. Of course, you also need to tackle a couple of integral side quests: The Fifth Commandment and The Stalker. Part 1A: Katherine and Henry early in the campaignEarly in the campaign, Katherine tends to act cold and rude toward Henry. Here are some examples:She pretends not to recognize Henry when she encounters him in Troskowitz.She then chides Henry as you sneak around Trosky Castle during For Whom the Bell Tolls.Even if you get reputation drops during these segments, you need not worry since these are, technically, just part of the developing story arc. Part 1B: Flirting with Katherine midway through the campaignYou learn about Katherine's true motives once you reach the second half of the campaign. This is when you're able to flirt with her a few times. A few responses might make you think that the two are about to have a \"situationship,\" but nothing actually occurs at these stages. Here are some examples:The first time you spend the night in Suchdol, you can ask Katherine if you could join her for the night.Upon reaching Sigismund's Camp as part of The King's Gambit, Katherine will bathe Henry. You can select the following responses: Persuasion: \"It's different with you.\"Persuasion: \"What about a kiss for luck?\"Again, these are just flirty and fun banter between the two. However, the most important segments are discussed below. Part 2: The Fifth Commandment side questThe Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Katherine romance hinges on how much she trusts Henry, which means you need to help her with certain tasks, such as The Fifth Commandment.Katherine gives you this side quest once the two of you have a chat in the Kuttenberg tavern where she's working. It involves bringing a serial killer to justice. Note that you have an option on how to deal with the culprit at the end: Report the matter to the bailiff or let Katherine murder the monster herself. In our playthrough, we allowed Katherine to finish off the serial killer. Part 3: The Stalker side questThe next integral mission for the Katherine romance in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is called The Stalker. You may receive this task while tackling a main quest called The Lion's Den.And, just to be perfectly clear about this: You must complete The Stalker quest before you finish The Lion's Den.Okay, now that we got that out of the way, here's what you need to do for this part:Once inside Sigismund's Camp, wait until evening to trigger the scene where Katherine bathes Henry (as mentioned earlier).Talk to Katherine afterward. She'll tell you about a strange person who seems to be watching her, and that person even stole one of her shoes. The Stalker side quest then appears in your journal.Reply with [Houndmaster]: \"Mutt will track him down.\"Command Mutt and select Katherine's shoe. Mutt will track the scent so just follow him around the camp.You'll see Katherine's stolen shoe in a tent guarded by a Cuman named Chakan. This fellah has an all-red attire--i.e. hat, tunic, and pants.You can resolve your encounter with Chakan through the following means: Persuasion: \"Leave her alone. You're scaring her.\"Presence: \"If you don't leave her alone, I'll smash your head in.\"Bribe him with 200 Groschen.Defeat him in hand-to-hand combat.After dealing with Chakan, return to Katherine to complete The Stalker quest in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. She'll be very grateful for your help, leading to a huge reputation boost. Part 4: Hunger and Despair - Katherine romance sceneFrom there, simply proceed with the rest of the main missions until you reach a chapter called Hunger and Despair, where Henry and co. are besieged. Before you head out to call for reinforcements, talk to your dearest friends, most especially Katherine. You'll find her crying in one of the quarters.Reply with [Romance]: \"I'll bring help, and everything will be alright again.\" This causes Katherine to kiss Henry on the cheek. Later, though, a couple of cutscenes will play, and Henry will get more than just a smack.That does it for our guide on how to romance Katherine in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. If you're curious about all the other characters that you can flirt with, you can take a look at our romance options guide.If you need more tips as you explore Bohemia in the Middle Ages, be sure to visit our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 guides hub.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What would you rather do on a rainy day: go to the movies with a friend, cozy up at home with a good book and a cup of tea, or go on an adventurous and fun (and very wet) hike? Right now movies with a friend sounds like it would be fun! Of course we’d have to have all the snacks – popcorn, M\u0026Ms and bubbly water. 2. What game show would you absolutely dominate: Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy or The Price Is Right? I’d have the best chances at The Price Is Right. Can’t say I’d dominate it, though. Hahaha! 3. Do you wear more makeup now or less makeup than you did a year ago? I wear a little less these days, but that’s mostly[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 867 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "It has rained for almost a week! I’m getting kinda over it, but Tabs sure would have loved it. That cat LOVED the rain. His favorite thing about it? Rainbows. 🌈 Mind you, I also like the rain. But Tabs didn’t just like the rain. He loved it! I think what he liked about it was all the movement. My theory is that with his heightened cat senses, he could actually track the falling of individual raindrops. Rosie, however, is not a big fan of rain. In fact, she doesn’t particularly enjoy anything about it. Scratch that — I’m mistaken. There is one thing about rain she agrees with Tabs on. Rainbows are fantastic! 🌈😺 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 849 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
