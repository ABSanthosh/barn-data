    "description": "Spoilers for Final Fantasy VII [1997], Remake, and Rebirth.Even with far more barriers in the way, the desperation began almost as soon as the original game was on shelves and the first person saw Aerith die in Final Fantasy VII. The singular question haunted AOL chat rooms, usenet, and game magazine mailboxes for years: Can we bring her back?Games have such a strange relationship with the idea of death, so it makes sense that players in 1997--starved of narratives with any real permanent stakes beyond how many quarters you can pump in or whether you really wanted to fight all the way back to the place you died--would have a reaction to Aerith being permanently dead. It’s baked right into the narrative in fact, with Cloud, even with all of his emotional damage, grasping the enormity. “Aerith will no longer talk, no longer laugh, cry, or get angry....” Cloud wrestles, in the moment she dies in his arms, with grief for the first time. And Sephiroth does not give a shit. Sephiroth is beyond human concerns. He knows what Cloud is, and flies away with his gentle amusement. Cloud is a puppet. To him, emotions for someone ultimately meaningless in the larger context of time and space are no different than a toddler weeping because it accidentally stepped on a dandelion. But this is the internal struggle that would define the next stretch of FF7. Cloud discovers what he is, and has to come to grips with what it actually means to be human, because just copying Zack Fair’s homework will only get him so far.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The Epic Games Store continues to give away a free game each week, and this week is another nice find with a price that can't be beaten.

All you need to do to claim the free games is create a free Epic account and enable two-factor authentication. You have a week to add the freebies to your library before the new one(s) take their place. At this point, Epic has given away hundreds of free games, and there's no sign that the program will stop any time soon. We keep this article up to date weekly to highlight both the current free games and next week's offerings.Current free game at EpicOrcs Must Die 3Today you can grab Orcs Must Die 3, a tower defense game that has even more traps, weapons, and upgrades for you to use against the hordes of monsters looking to destroy your fortifications.

    "description": "Hello, my friend. Merry Christmas to you! I hope that today you’re feeling loved, calm and joyful. We got back from Hawaii a couple days ago, and it’s been a whirlwind of cookie baking, card writing and gift delivering so far. I still feel the aloha sprit in my heart, though, and it’s keeping me warm and cozy in this chilly Bay Area day. How have your holidays been so far? I feel like mine flew by in the blink of an eye. Although I wanted to do so much more for everyone in my life, I’ve realized that at a certain point one just needs to accept that there’s only so many hours in the day and so much energy to go around, and you can only do the best you can. It’s truly been a season of grace on this end of the keyboard. Grace for myself, and grace for others. Anywho, since I spent most of last week with my toes in the sand, here are some pictures that I’ve been meaning[Continue reading...] The post Merry Christmas appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "How’s your Christmas shopping coming along? I hope you aren’t having to brave the crowds in these last couple days. Have I ever told you that one of my least favorite things on Earth — ON EARTH — is parking lots at Christmas? Not. A. Fan. Man, the Costco parking lot by my house? Or, rather, any Costco parking lot in any town in America at Christmas? How can it take 20 minutes for my car to move 20 feet? Ladybugs on the ground are passing my car. A snail that hitched a ride on my car overnight literally climbed back down to the road because it knew it could go faster. 😂 But I digress… Tabs loved Christmases, but it was easy for him because he was the boss, whereas I’m the one who had to do all the jobs. I had to decorate the office, make all the ornaments, get all the gifts, schedule all the cat spa services. It was a lot! Thankfully, Rosie is more chill about Christmas.
