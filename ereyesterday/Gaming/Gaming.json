    "description": "Blue Prince from Dogubomb and Raw Fury has emerged as the highest-rated game of 2025 thus far on GameSpot sister site Metacritic.In Blue Prince, players explore a manor with shifting rooms. In practice, players must navigate this manor, solving the puzzles within each room before deciding which one to go into next. It has a roguelike structure, so the rooms within the manor reset each day and can slowly be upgraded over time depending on the player's actions. You might not have heard of Blue Prince before because it's an indie first-person puzzle game. That said, critics love its experimental structure and are heaping it with praise. \"Blue Prince is one of the most memorable video game experiences I have ever had,\" GameSpot's Steve Watts wrote in a glowing review. \"It is at once accessible and impenetrable, frustrating and euphoric. Like each of my dozens of permutations of the Mount Holly manor house itself, it is truly one of a kind.\"Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Pierce Brown's dystopian sci-fi series Red Rising has become one of the most popular ongoing book series in its genre over the past decade. Six novels in the Red Rising series have been published by Random House so far, with a seventh and final novel in the saga, Red God, expected to hit store shelves next year.

The first two books in the series are around 450 pages each, but Morning Star is considerably thicker at 576 pages.Red Rising is set hundreds of years in the future after humans have colonized the solar system and established a new caste-based society. The books follow Darrow, a Mars-born human of the lowly \"Red\" caste who discovers a secret about the planet that sparks him to free his fellow Reds. Get deal at Amazon Books 4-6 form the Iron Gold Trilogy and continue the trend of higher page counts.

In case you missed it, Reburn are a rebrand of Metro studio 4A Games Ukraine - they're not to be confused with 4A Games in Malta, who are still working on the Metro series. La Quimera doesn't look much like Metro. I compared it to Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare and Cyberpunk 2077 in our announcement post, and the below trailer's worth of exosuit punching and heatvision railgunnery is doing nothing to dissipate that characterisation.

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. How would you rather spend some unexpected afternoon free time: watching a movie, going for a walk or reading a book? I’d love some extra time to read! I recently found a new-to-me author that I enjoy, Rebecca Searle, and I’m going through all of her books. 2. What did you last cry about? Well, I went to the OBGYN last week, and I had a mini-meltdown when the nice nurse took my blood pressure. I think it’s a little bit of leftover post-traumatic stress from going to the doctor so much last year along with some hormonal stuff (dang this peri-menopause). 3. What would you rather do with a friend: play card games, have a picnic in the park or go to the farmers’ market?
