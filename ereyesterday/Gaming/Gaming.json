    "description": "After working on every GTA title since Grand Theft Auto 3 in 2001, producer and game designer Leslie Benzies left Rockstar Games after the release of Grand Theft Auto 5. Over a decade later, Benzies is set to release his new game, MindsEye, later this year as seen during Sony's State of Play. And if the new trailer is any indication, MindsEye is going to be an action game with some sci-fi touches. MindsEye puts players in control of Jacob Diaz, an ex-soldier who has a neural implant called The MindsEye placed in his head even after his military service has ended. The MindsEye is also giving Jacob visions of a covert mission he can't quite remember that may have changed his life for the worse. But as Jacob goes looking for answers, he finds himself beset by an unknown faction that's out to silence him with extreme prejudice.As seen in the accompanying gameplay trailer below, MindsEye takes place from a third-person perspective, and GTA fans will probably be right at home as Jacob uses any means necessary to take out his foes. He can even get in cars and engage in shootouts from behind the wheel. Jacob also has a companion drone that he can use to scout enemy positions and give himself an edge in combat.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "From its inception, Symphonia was envisioned as a game that rewarded control and timing mastery. Initially designed as a game to bring classical music to the world, it quickly became apparent that its fluid mechanics and open-ended level design also made it a natural fit for the speedrunning community. After many hours spent perfecting the […] The post How Features in Symphonia were Designed with Speed Runners in Mind appeared first on Xbox Wire.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Shrimp or crab? Crab, but it can’t be imitation, and it has to be fresh. 2. Yoga or pilates? Both are equally as challenging for this very out-of-shape lady at the moment. LOL! (Been a rough 12 months.) I’ll pick yoga; I could use a good stretch. 3. Something that makes you feel sentimental? When my phone brings up baby photos of Connor or old photos of Tabs before he got sick. My heart swells up every single time. 4. What book are you reading at the moment? Nothing at the moment, boo. I need a good one. Got anything to suggest? I would like something not too heavy or scary. 5. Something you wish you said no to sooner? I wish I would’ve said no to[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 868 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "It’s the Super Bowl! As you know, before Tabs rocked the world by reinventing kitty supermodeling, he entertained millions as a professional cat football player. In fact, he won the Kitty Bowl a record eight times, making him more accomplished than even Tom Brady. Yes, Tabs was quite the cat athlete. Today’s game starts in a few minutes, and while Tabs is no longer here to watch the game with me, I’m sure he’ll be watching from up above. This happens to also be the last Sunday before Valentine’s. Marnie and Rosie are both more interested in that aspect of the day than the football. I can appreciate that. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S.
