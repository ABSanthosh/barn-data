    "description": "Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series (Blu-ray) $18 (was $60) See at Amazon See 25th Anniversary Edition Akira on 4K Blu-ray $18.44 (was $30) | $11.49 on 1080p Blu-ray See at Amazon (4K) See at Amazon (Blu-ray) Akira 35th Anniversary Manga Box Set $130 (was $220) See at Amazon Amazon has fantastic deals on the classic anime series Cowboy Bebop. For a limited time, Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series on Blu-ray is available for only $18 (was $60). Alternatively, you can save nearly 50% on last year's 25th Anniversary Special Edition, which includes a small amount of additional content.Cowboy Bebop is one of two classic anime cited by Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann as an inspiration for the studio's upcoming game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which was revealed at The Game Awards. The other anime Druckmann mentioned was Akira, the 1988 cult-classic film adapted from Katsuhiro Otomo's legendary manga. You can save on Akira's 4K Blu-ray ($18), 1080p Blu-ray ($11.49), and 35th Anniversary Manga Box Set ($131) at Amazon. You can learn more about Akira and Cowboy Bebop below. For more on Intergalactic, check out our breakdown of everything we know about Naughty Dog's next game. Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series (Blu-ray) $18 (was $60) Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series features all 26 episodes across four discs. This remastered edition retains the original 4:3 aspect ratio, but with a high-definition resolution bump. It contains English voiceover dubs as well as the original Japanese audio track with subtitles. Along with all of the episodes, you'll get a bunch of bonus features, including five audio commentaries, various featurettes, multiple interviews, and more.Amazon's deal on Funimation's 2014 release, which drops the price to $18, is the best we've seen this year.Amazon also has the 25th Anniversary Special Edition on sale for $27.49 (was $50). Released by Crunchyroll last year, this edition is largely the same as the $18 version, except it comes with a fifth disc containing a 25-year retrospective and an interview with Koichi Yamadera (voice actor of Spike) recorded for the series 20th anniversary.Cowboy Bebop takes place five decades after Earth became uninhabitable. In 2071, many humans live on moons and other planets in the galaxy. Just like the main character in Intergalactic, Cowboy Bebop follows a bounty hunter. Spike Spiegel is the leader of a group of bounty hunters (cowboys) who travel the galaxy on a interplanetary fishing trawler (the Bebop) picking up contracts for bounties on criminals.Though it deals with some serious topics, Cowboy Bebop is also often funny and heartfelt. The ragtag group of bounty hunters who join the Bebop are well-developed characters that you really feel for throughout the show's 26 episodes. Plus, Cowboy Bebop has a very good and extremely intelligent pup named Ein (a space corgi). See at Amazon See 25th Anniversary Edition Akira on 4K Blu-ray $18.44 (was $30) | $11.49 on 1080p Blu-ray Akira is available on 4K Blu-ray for $18.44 (was $30) at Amazon. This version of Akira's 4K remaster released in 2022. It also comes with a standard Blu-ray disc with previously released bonus content, including storyboard collections, original trailers and commercials, featurettes on restoring the film, and more. In total, you're getting over two hours of bonus content.If you don't have a 4K media player or want to save some additional cash, Akira's 1080p Blu-ray and DVD combo pack is up for grabs for only $11.49 (was $35). This edition was released for the anime's 25th anniversary in 2013. The Blu-ray disc contains the film and the two-plus hours of bonus content.First released in 1988, Akira remains one of the most beloved anime films to this day. The alternate-history film takes place in Neo-Tokyo in 2019, 31 years after World War 3 was brought on by the destruction of Tokyo. The futuristic metropolis is now rife with seedy characters and rival gangs vying for territory and power. The story follows Shotaro Kaneda, the leader of a biker gang, and his friend Tetsuo Shima, who possesses psychic abilities that, in the wrong hands, can lead to destruction and ruin.Akira's plot is not the easiest to follow, and it's not always readily apparent who is good and who is bad. The movie is also quite different and drastically condensed, understandably, compared to the original manga by Katushiro Otomo. It released before Otomo's manga even ended and only covers roughly the first third of the story. See at Amazon (4K) See at Amazon (Blu-ray) Akira 35th Anniversary Manga Box Set $130 (was $220) Akira is still a gorgeous film to watch today, especially on 4K Blu-ray. If you enjoy the film, though, we'd highly recommend reading the manga, which fleshes out the story in many important ways.Akira's 35th Anniversary Box Set is on sale for $130 (was $220) at Amazon. The box set comes with six hardcover volumes telling the complete Akira story, which was published from 1982 to 1990 and totals 120 chapters. This set also comes with a hardcover Akira Club art book and exclusive pill patch. All seven books are stored inside a clamshell box with two doors. In total, the 35th Anniversary Box Set is a sprawling 2,532-page collection.If you don't want to commit to the complete box set, you can buy paperback volumes individually:Akira PaperbacksVolume 1 -- $16 ($25)Volume 2 -- $19.29 ($25)Volume 3 -- $19.45 ($25)Volume 4 -- $20.73 ($25)Volume 5 -- $22 ($25)Volume 6 -- $21 ($25) See at Amazon Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet - Trailer, Story, Setting, And Everything Else We KnowSee MoreMore Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals \u0026 Preorders Amazon-Exclusive Pokemon TCG Holiday Premium Collection Gets Big Discount DualSense PS5 Controllers Get Big Discounts - New Chroma Model For Only $54 At Amazon Woot Has Over 40 Nintendo Switch Game Deals, Including Many Of The Best Exclusives And Rare Finds + Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals \u0026 Preorders Links (5) The Minecraft Creeper Mini Fridge Is On Sale For Only $29 At Walmart The Legend Of Zelda Metal Puzzles Restocked At Amazon - Still On Sale For Only $15 Demon Slayer Blu-Rays Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Swordsmith Village Arc Launched Today Indiana Jones And The Great Circle Collector's Edition Up For Preorder At Amazon Get Dark Souls Board Game For Only $51 And Roleplaying Sourcebook For $30 Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Total War: Warhammer 3 lets you challenge knights, sorcerers, behemoths, daemons, and everything in between. Now, a new DLC promises additional strategic layers as you conquer the known world. Here's our guide that discusses the Total War: Warhammer 3 - Omens of Destruction legendary lords.Total War: Warhammer 3 - Omens of Destruction legendary lords guideTotal War: Warhammer 3 - Omens of Destruction lets you choose from three legendary lords: Golgfag Maneater of the Ogre Kingdoms, Gorbad Ironclaw of the Greenskins, and Skulltaker of the forces of Khorne. You can purchase each leader separately or as part of a bundle. Moreover, a free-DLC--also known as free-LC--adds Arbaal the Undefeated.Our Total War: Warhammer 3 - Omens of Destruction legendary lords guide discusses what makes each general unique, as well as what you can expect if you choose them for your campaigns. Ogre Kingdoms: Golgfag ManeaterThe Ogre Kingdoms offer their services to the highest bidder, and Golgfag Maneater aims to capitalize on ongoing regional conflicts. You can see his perks below.Faction effects:Access to Mercenary Contracts; can be recruited by other factions.Can instantly travel to a client's settlement once per Mercenary Contract.Unable to make alliances with other factions.+5 melee attack when fighting a contract enemy.Attribute: Immune to psychology when fighting a contract enemy (all armies).Lord effects:+25% post-battle loot income.-20% upkeep for Maneater units (lord's army).Ability: Dead EyeDLC-only units:Legendary hero: Bragg the GutsmanGeneric lord: Ogre PaymasterGeneric hero: BruiserUnit: Blood VulturesUnit: ThundertuskUnit: YheteeUnit: Pigback RidersUnit: Golgfag's ManeatersGolgfag Maneater might be the best legendary lord in Omens of Destruction for those who want a more free-form way of experiencing the campaign. That's because you can accept contracts from other factions to take on their rivals. Objectives include winning battles, raiding territories, and undertaking hero actions. You may also aid the contracting party by handing over settlements that you've captured. In turn, you receive nifty rewards, such as gold, meat, and other bonuses.This makes Golgfag a viable option if you want to travel around, beating people up to earn more money and build up your armies. This is also complemented by a recent change that's part of a free update, which allows you to move your Ogre Camps to a new location. The only downside is that you're unable to enact alliances with anyone, so don't expect others to come to your rescue when you're in dire straits. Greenskins: Gorbad IronclawGorbad Ironclaw of the Greenskins is for players that want to make the most out of their unit compositions. He has the following quirks.Faction effects:Access to Da Plan, allowing you to come up with tactics in the thick of the fray.Improved rewards for completing a Waaagh!+15% income from razing settlements (all armies).-1 turn global recruitment duration (factionwide).Lord effects:-10% upkeep (lord's army).+100% leadership aura.Ability: Orcs Are Da BestArmy ability: Gorbad's Waaagh! (replaces Waaagh!)DLC-only units:Legendary hero: Snagla GrobspitGeneric lord: Savage Orc Great ShamanGeneric hero: Night Goblin Big BossUnit: Black Orcs - Axe and ShieldUnit: Arachnarok Spider FlingersUnit: Mangler SquigsUnit: Colossal SquigsUnit: Bolt ThrowaYou're going to love it when Da Plan comes together. Gorbad's special mechanic lets you unlock tactics as you complete objectives and win battles. In doing so, you'll be able to mix and match different unit types to gain buffs.Bonuses include offensive and defensive boosts, passive perks (i.e. flammable attacks), and more. This further incentivizes you to experiment with various army compositions, such as a combination of orc, goblin, spider, squig, and all types of monstrous creatures. Of course, there are times when an unlocked tactic might seem great on paper, but you're not that keen on using certain troops, too. Khorne: SkulltakerKhorne cares not from where the blood flows, just that it does. And few of the god's champions are as vicious in this endeavor than Skulltaker.Faction effects:Access to the Cloak of Skulls, granting bonuses when you defeat the generals of other factions.+2 hero capacity for Bloodreapers.The Daemons Are Reforged: +10% chance for Bloodletters to be restored after battle (all armies).-15% upkeep for Bloodletters and Exalted Bloodletters of Khorne.Lord effects:+10% campaign movement range.+100% campaign line-of-sight.Passive ability: Frenzy - For Bloodletters and Exalted Bloodletters (lord's army).Ability: Bloody OnslaughtDLC-only units:Legendary hero: Scyla AnfingrimmLegendary hero: Skarr BloodwrathGeneric lord: BloodspeakerUnit: Blood BeastsUnit: SlaughterbruteUnit: KhorngorsUnit: WrathmongersUnit: SkullreapersSkulltaker is a deadly combatant, eager to go toe to toe with his rivals to claim dominance in the Blood God's name. As his own name implies, Skulltaker earns rewards by viciously chopping off heads to adorn his Cloak of Skulls. Doing so grants powerful bonuses, including the ability to travel to the whereabouts of opposing faction lords, additional experience points, increased campaign movement range, and more.For veterans of other Total War titles, this resembles Achilles' Living Legend mechanic from A Total War Saga: Troy or Lu Bu's Greatest Warriors feature from Total War: Three Kingdoms. Find your opponents and give them a fitting end for the glory of the Blood God. Khorne: Arbaal the UndefeatedArbaal the Undefeated is a free legendary lord, also known as free DLC or free-LC. He just might be one of the best lords in Omens of Destruction since he's naturally available to all Total War: Warhammer 3 players.Faction effects:Access to the Challenges of Khorne, allowing you to partake in battles to gain Khorne's Favor.-10% upkeep for non-daemonic units.-50% construction costs and construction time for mortal military and defense buildings (factionwide).Lord effects:-1 turn global recruitment duration (lord's army).+10% weapon strength for non-daemonic units (lord's army).Passive ability: Hellblade - For Chaos Warriors, Chosen, Chaos Knights, and Skullcrushers of Khorne (lord's army).Ability: Gaze of KhorneArbaal the Undefeated's perks nudge you to focus more on mortal/human troops, as opposed to daemonic selections. Still, you're free to do as you please when it comes to your army composition, especially if you want to successfully complete the Challenges of Khorne.Similar to Skulltaker's Cloak of Skulls or Wulfrik's Monster Hunts, Arbaal roams the world in search of battles to prove that he's worthy of the Blood God's blessings. Winning these trials nets you rewards, including favor (i.e. gold), Khorne's Favor (faction buffs), and other passive gains.Another quirk of note is that Arbaal's moniker, the Undefeated, means that you should do your best to avoid losing a battle. If this unfortunate instance occurs, you'll be presented with a dilemma: Either you continue the campaign with a permanent diplomatic penalty with other Khornate factions or you end your campaign instantly. Of course, it's totally fine to continue your run, since you're likely to conquer everyone else around you anyway, so this concept just adds a bit of flavor to the overall experience. Just as well, you can reload a previous save so you can ensure that you actually win on your next attempt.That does it for our guide on the best Total War: Warhammer 3 - Omens of Destruction legendary lords. We hope these tips help you choose the ideal general for your future runs.",

    "description": "Connor danced her little heart out at a performance recently! They did a tap routine wearing the cutest green and gold costumes. Her dance team requires the girls to wear red lipstick for performances, and the rest of the makeup is up to the individual dancer. Usually Connor only likes to wear MAC Fashion Legacy lipstick, and maybe if I’m lucky, she’ll let me swipe a little pink blush on her cheeks (NARS Gaiety is her go-to shade). She usually skips eye makeup. I KNOW! Anywho, I was absolutely shocked when at the last minute she asked me to put on some eyeshadow. We had about five minutes left to get ready when she made this request, but of course I responded with an enthusiastic yes! I dug through a drawer and found a palette of brights from Nomad Cosmetics. First I swiped on the green shade with a finger, then buffed out the edges with a fluffy eyeshadow brush. I layered the gold shade on top and blended the two together!

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Where would you rather go on vacation: New Zealand, Alaska, Costa Rica or Switzerland? I’d love to go to all of these places, but right now Switzerland sounds pretty cool. 2. Ponytail or curls? Hmm. I like ponytails because they’re functional, but sometimes they give me a headache, so let’s go with curls. They’d have to be super loose ones, though. And kinda messy! 3. Did you ever have a job where you had to wear a uniform? Kinda. We had very specific guidelines for safety when I worked at the bakery, like close-toed shoes, no nail polish, hair tied back. 4.
