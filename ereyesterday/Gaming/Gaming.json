    "description": "Small Soldiers Limited Edition Steelbook on 4K Blu-ray $25 | Releases July 22 Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart When it comes to '90s movies starring talking toys, most millennials who grew up during that era would probably think of Toy Story first. And while that's totally understandable, Toy Story wasn't the only memorable movie that brought toys to life. Remember Small Soldiers? The 1998 film from Paramount hasn't had anywhere close to the lasting impact as Toy Story, but it was a fun movie in its own right. If you have nostalgia for Small Soldiers, you'll be happy to hear that it's getting a 4K Blu-ray edition with a steelbook case on July 22. Small Soldiers Limited Edition Steelbook includes 4K Blu-ray and standard Blu-ray discs as well as a voucher to claim the digital version.At the time of writing, preorders are sold out at Walmart, but we'd recommend checking the site again, as it could be restocked at any moment. Meanwhile, Amazon has yet to open preorders, but a listing is live on the site, and you should be available to order a copy soon. Small Soldiers Limited Edition Steelbook on 4K Blu-ray $25 | Releases July 22 For the cover, you're getting a classic showdown stare between the action figures of the Gorgonite Archer and the Commando Elite commander Chip Hazard. The interior of the case features silhouettes of the characters and the GloboTech X1000 microprocessors that turned these toys into sentient beings.The bonus materials haven't been revealed for this 4K edition, but if it inherits the ones from the previous standard Blu-ray release, you can expect a DVD-era documentary on the making of Small Soldiers, a blooper reel, and a trailer. The 4K release also includes a standard Blu-ray disc, and it's possible that's where you'll find the bonus features.The 4K remaster will be displayed in 2.35:1 aspect ratio, which is very close to the original 2.39:1 ratio from the 1998 release. On the audio side, Small Soldiers supports DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart Small Soldiers 4K Steelbook Edition Blu-rayIn case you aren't able to secure the 4K edition or want to watch the movie before July, you can pick up the regular Blu-ray edition of Small Soldiers from Amazon, as it's on sale for $10.53 (was $14).Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Group chats: love ‘em or leave ‘em? It depends on the group, hahaha! I mostly love ‘em, and for those chats that I wanna leave (but can’t for whatever reason), well, that’s when the mute button comes in handy. 2. Full, medium or sheer? Hmm. For things like face makeup, then medium or sheer, although to be honest medium feels like full coverage for me these days! When it comes to, like, nail polish, though? Opaque all the way. I’ve got no time for sheer nail polish these days. Oh, and does this apply to perfume, too? Because if we’re talking about scents, I’ve been more into medium and sheer scents lately. 3. Did you pick up anything during the Sephora sale? Not this time, no.

    "description": "Sure, Tabs was a great boss, brilliant thinker, a total disruptor who dominated everything he ever tried, but let’s be real… He was a really tough employer. He was so demanding! “Meow!” he’d say, or “Mrrow!” A lot of the time, his directives had to do with treats (of course), or petting — specifically, deep-tissue kitty massage. I did my best, but I was only human, which yeah, was a bit of liability. That’s why Tabs spent years developing the perfect robotic assistant. We even released a couple pretty good ones. In fact, our Tabby Dynamics subdivision was the first to bring a bipedal humanoid cat assistant to market. When Rosie took over as CFO, I thought she’d be different. She had a bit of a softer streak than Tabs, but we quickly realized that she was also pretty demanding. She isn’t as tough as Tabs was, but I think it’s fair to say that one of our pet assistants has trouble with bananas. That’s one way to describe it… She may not be the[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 857 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
