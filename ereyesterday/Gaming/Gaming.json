    "description": "So‚Ä¶what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn‚Äôt, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It‚Äôs just a list of more or less random questions I‚Äôve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What sports would you have liked to have played as a kid? I would‚Äôve loved to have taken dance classes. I think I would‚Äôve enjoyed soccer, too. 2. Would you rather listen to the radio or replay a favorite album? Replay a favorite album. Speaking of that, my family will probably freak out if I play the greatest hits from Fleetwood Mac one more time. 3. Have you ever had a job where you had to be on your feet all day? Yup. I‚Äôve done retail and worked in the back of the house in a bakery. Gotta have supportive shoes! 4. Do you have any travel plans for the summer? Right now we‚Äôve got one camping trip to the Russian River planned, and that‚Äôs it.

    "description": "Things are a little different now under Rosie‚Äôs feline leadership ‚Äî less kitty modeling, fewer lavish parties, and we don‚Äôt fly business class anymore. Lot more science, though. üòÇ So, on the one paw, we‚Äôre on the cusp of developing a new fusion-powered AI robot that can dispense crunchies, but on the other paw, daily life can be a little‚Ä¶boring. But that‚Äôs OK! We like boring now. Here‚Äôs a quick look back at a typical spring day when Tabs was in charge. He made everything seem exciting, even just going for our morning walk. Tabs was hongry today on our walk. Not just hungry, but hongry. He was ravenous! He didn‚Äôt even care about the giant turkeys gobbling on the hill or the little kids shouting at the neighborhood playground. He was too busy hunting for the freshest, tastiest shoots of grass, which were hard to find today because the condo landscapers mowed the hill this week. Tabby loves Novato so much, and we‚Äôre coming up on the best time of year for kitty exploring.[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 859 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
