Amazon has a fresh restock of the popular Books of Knowledge series from Future Press. Volume 1 is available for $45 (was $50), Volume 2 is $50, and the recently released third volume covering Shadow of the Erdtree is $40.49. If you're interested in these Elden Ring guides, especially the first two, we'd recommend ordering them as soon as possible. Once they sell out, you might be stuck waiting for months, perhaps many of them, for a new printing.Volume 3 wasn't hard to find before today, but Volumes 1 and 2 had been sold out for most of 2024. Volume 2, in particular, was often listed on eBay for well over $100; there are still copies of it on eBay for north of $200. Thankfully, Elden Ring fans no longer need to entertain the idea of paying double or triple the MSRP for any of these books.Elden Ring Books of Knowledge Strategy GuidesAll three books will arrive before Christmas, so you can give the Elden Ring fan in your life the gift of knowledge this holiday.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Who would you rather go dancing with: your significant other, your best friend or your kid (if you have one)? Honestly, I’d love to go with Connor, LOL! 2. Spa weekend or a music festival weekend? Spa weekend, 100%. 3. Have you had any eggnog this holiday season? Nope, none! I don’t really crave it, but if it’s there, I’ll have a small cup. 4. Who would you rather have lunch with: your favorite musician, your favorite actor, your favorite author or your favorite teacher? Honestly, if she was still alive, lunch with my favorite teacher from elementary would be lovely. The last time I saw her, I was 18. 5. Do you pop the zit or leave it alone? I dunno, how ripe is it?

    "description": "This was an exciting time of year for Tabs. Company coming over, trees INSIDE the house, blinking lights, the biggest turkeys of the year — for a cat like Tabs, the holidays were a cat cornucopia of comfy couches, fragrant foliage, tinsel, tasty treats and plump plumage. As the head of the decorating committee for Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC, Tabs was responsible for the Christmas tree decorations, and I just sort of did what he said. Normally, it would go down something like this: first week of December, and he hadn’t decided on the overall theme yet, but he’d have it narrowed down to something like baked red, green and silver catnip crispy ornament treats or strings of classic white lights and red Christmas balls. Probably. But he wouldn’t be sure yet. Whichever way it went, he always got a lot of help. The decorating committee was always on standby and awaiting orders. And Tabs?
