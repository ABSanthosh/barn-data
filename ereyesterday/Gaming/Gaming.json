    "description": "Rise of the Ronin, the latest action-RPG from Team Ninja, is available for only $30 at Amazon and Walmart. The $40 discount is part of Walmart's Black Friday Sale, and Amazon, as it usually does, is matching the offer. But heads up: Amazon is estimating orders placed now to arrive in... February 2025. So, yeah, you might want to buy it at Walmart instead. Rise of the Ronin $30 (was $70) See at Walmart See at Amazon Stellar Blade Standard Edition $50 (was $70) See at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy Rise of the Ronin is a fast-paced action game set during a pivotal moment in Japanese history. As an outside agent, you'll run into real-life historical figures, occasionally battle them, and help influence Japan as it enters a new era. Like other Team Ninja games, Rise of the Ronin has Souls-like combat, but it's surprisingly approachable and rewarding when you master the way of the blade and several other weapons.\"It's not without some flaws, but I finished Rise of the Ronin with much more left to do, and even after 50 hours, I want to head back in to see what I'd missed and attempt to change history,\" Phil Hornshaw wrote in GameSpot's Rise of the Ronin review. \"The parts of the game that work more than balance out its weaker elements. And while it took a while to find the rhythm of Rise of the Ronin's combat, its speed, complexity, and intensity make for some phenomenal fights that always feel great to win. Rise of the Ronin is a game that might take a bit to get good, but the commitment is worth it.\"Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Soâ€¦what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isnâ€™t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. Itâ€™s just a list of more or less random questions Iâ€™ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Stuffing or mashed potatoes? Both speak volumes to my carb-loving heart, but I love mashed potatoes just a little bit more. 2. Apple pie or apple cider? Um, both? 3. Do you have any Thanksgiving day traditions? Not really, although I do short circuit if I donâ€™t get at least one slice of pecan pie. I gotta have it! 4. Have you ever hosted Thanksgiving? Yes, a handful of times, and yes, there was pecan pie. HAHAHA! 5. Something youâ€™re thankful for? So thankful to spend time with my little family of El Hub, Connor, Rosie and Marnie. Our house is full and so is my heart! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment.

    "description": "As most people know, Tabs was a demanding employer. He was also very fair to his employees. More than generous, actually. In keeping with his holiday traditions, Rosie allowed us to take the next two weeks off (thank you so much, Rosie!). Consequently, the employees of Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC have been up to their vacation shenanigans, which for me meant blogging while dressed up as a cat lady lumberjack. Makeup, of course, has been on Connorâ€™s agenda, but sheâ€™s still perfecting her techniqueâ€¦ Marnie has been cruisinâ€™ the streets of Novato looking for tiny dogs with short legs to bark at â€” that is, when Connor isnâ€™t demanding that they play dress-up together. Weâ€™ve all been enjoying this joyful break before Thanksgiving. I hope things are going well with you, too. Weâ€™re here and weâ€™re feisty (just tired). ðŸ˜Š Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 839 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
