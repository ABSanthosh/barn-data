    "description": "Grand Theft Auto 5 on PC has finally received the RT upgrades to achieve feature parity with the current generation console versions, almost three years since they arrived on Xbox and PlayStation consoles. The wait was worth it as scalability is impressive and the game also includes the ability to toggle ray traced global illumination - which may well hint at the kind of RT features we can expect to see in the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6.

    "description": "Metro 2033 is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, March 16, 2025. Below, we examine how its subtle morality system helped to illustrate its broader points about humanity and violence.In video games, evil tends to be gigantic. Think of the rivers of blood in Baldur's Gate 3's evil endings or an army of Sith bowing to the player in Knights of the Old Republic. These moments are not exactly comical, but they have a glee to them. They have the joy of a cackling cartoon villain. In some sense, Metro 2033 is no exception. In the wake of atomic devastation, the Moscow metro populates itself with cruel bandits, monstrous mutants, and authoritarian militants. It is grimmer than the prior examples to be sure, but there is still a note of the absurd in its endless cruel men. But the game's ultimate quest, to destroy a mutant army of \"Dark Ones\" with an atomic weapon, casts the shadow of real-world brutality. Metro 2033 concerns itself with the miniscule decisions and delusions that build up to atrocity, all under an atomic shadow. Unlike most other morality systems, Metro 2033 does not announce itself; instead it builds up the protagonist's character through tiny individual moments: beats of butterfly wings that become a hurricane.This works in a simple binary way. Completing certain tasks will net protagonist Artyom moral points. Get enough points and he'll have the opportunity for the good ending. In contrast to other games with morality systems, the player cannot see how many points Artyom has earned. There is only a sound and a flash of light (a more ominous sound plays when Artyom loses moral points). Fittingly, Artyom has humble origins. He is not a soldier. His station is distant from the comparatively sprawling central stations of the Metro and he has rarely left his home. He is as explicit a player-insert as a game like this can muster. More familiar with the world than the player to be sure, but also an outsider and newcomer to most of it. A sort of greatness awaits him. The game opens in media res: Artyom outfitted with military-grade gear and fighting a massive migration of mutants on the surface. But at the start, he is only arrogant because of his youth, not his power. He is incapable of atrocity; it takes an invitation for him to become a monster.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "I get that in-world the whole appeal of Dune's Arrakis is all of that spice it harbours, but to be honest the giant sandworms are a bit of a dealbreaker for me. Even still, I have to admit that Dune: Awakening looks pretty neat even with that ever present threat, and a new trailer all about exploring the desert planet that dropped this week has helped pique my interest a little further. For starters, that desert bike looks pretty nifty, my time in Sable taught me that I love a good zoom through beautiful, sandy vistas, and this looks to be similar, even if Dune: Awakening's world is a bit more hostile.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which would you rather have in your makeup collection: a nail polish that never chipped, a foundation that perfectly matched your skin tone, a long-lasting mascara that was easy to remove or a lipstick that never dried out your lips? Nail polish that never chipped! In a heartbeat. 2. How good are you at doing other people’s hair? Not great. Actually, terrible. I realized I really need to work at it when I tried to do Connor’s hair in a french braid for a dance competition, and it looked so wonky it was laughable. 3. What do you do when you’re sitting on a flight next to a stranger: chat them up or put in your headphones and pretend they’re not there? I’ll do a little polite[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 870 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which would you rather collect: vintage clothes or vintage furniture? I could do both, but if I could only pick one, I’d have to go with vintage clothes, mostly because I don’t have a big enough house to collect furniture pieces. Sigh! Oh, and also, I don’t want to worry about my furniture being beat up by the pets and the kids playing in my house, you know? 2. How good are you with keeping secrets? If you tell me something in confidence, it’s going to the grave with me, babe; however, I do have an exception policy. If I believe someone’s in danger, then I’m gonna say something. 3. Who’s the coolest Jennifer: Jennifer Hudson, Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Garner or Jennifer Coolidge? Jennifer Coolidge, all the[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 869 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
