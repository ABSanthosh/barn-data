    "description": "Big business.A Scene From Illumination's The Super Mario Bros. Movie2025 kicked off with the next big video game movie--A Minecraft Movie. After only a few weekends in theaters, it's made more than $700 million, cementing its position as the No. 2 highest-grossing video game movie of all time.It was not the first video game adaptation from Hollywood and won't be the last. But where does A Minecraft Movie rank all-time against biggest video game movies? In this gallery, we're rounding up the highest-grossing video game films of all time, breaking down box office results by domestic, international, and worldwide figures.The top 10 list is made up of massive franchises like Pokemon, Tomb Raider, Angry Birds, and Sonic, just to name a few. Looking ahead, there are a boatload of new video game films in the works.Without further ado, here are the top 14 highest-grossing video game movies of all time. All box office figures are pulled from Amazon's BoxOfficeMojo. 1: The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)Following 1993's poorly received live-action Super Mario Bros. Movie starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo, many wondered if Nintendo would ever again attempt to make a Mario movie. Well, 30 years later, the company partnered with Minions studio Illumination to do just that--and the movie is off to a fantastic start. Released on April 5, 2023 the movie quickly earned $377 million worldwide over its first five days and rapidly cleared more than $500 million. It's now earned more than $1.3 billion. The movie features the voice of Chris Pratt as Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi, and Jack Black as Bowser. Domestic – $574,934,330International – $787,009,114Worldwide – $1,361,943,444 2. A Minecraft Movie (2025)A Minecraft Movie was released on April 4, and it had a gigantic debut. After just three weekends in theaters, it's the No. 2 highest-grossing video game movie of all time. It's made more than $720 million so far, and every day it inches closer to $1 billion.Keep checking back, as we will update this post as more box office numbers come in and A Minecraft Movie inevitably climbs up the charts.Domestic –$379,966,661International – $436,600,00Worldwide – $816,566,661 3: Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (2024)Sonic the Hedgehog 3 released in December 2024 and became a fast success, zipping up to No. 2 all time for a video game movie. It's also just the second video game movie ever to exceed $200 million from the domestic market. Among other new additions, Keanu Reeves joined the film in the role of Shadow the Hedgehog.Domestic – $230,549,154International – $232,000,000Worldwide – $462,549,154 4: Pokemon Detective Pikachu (2019)Warner Bros. 2019 video game movie Pokemon: Detective Pikachu was a hit with critics and fans alike, and it did big business at the box office to rank as the second-highest grossing video game movie of all time worldwide. It featured the voice of Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu and a heartwarming and rollercoaster story involving Pikachu teaming up with a young man, Justice Smith, to find his father. Bill Nighy also starred in the film, which featured incredible CGI pocket monsters and some epic fight scenes, including a showdown with Mewtwo.Domestic – $144,174,568International – $289,303,033Worldwide – $449,762,638 5: Warcraft (2016)Legendary and Blizzard teamed up to make a Warcraft movie back in 2016, but development began much earlier and went through several changes before it was released. At one point, Spider-Man's Sam Raimi was attached to direct, but he dropped out due to the working conditions with Blizzard. Moon and Source Code director Duncan Jones, the son of David Bowie, eventually signed on to direct the fantasy film. It bombed in the US but did massive numbers internationally to pull in $439 million worldwide, putting it at the top of the charts. Jones said he had plans for a trilogy, but the poor box office performance in the US means that will likely never happen.Domestic – $47,365,290International – $391,683,624Worldwide – $439,048,914 6: Rampage (2018) Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson starred in 2018's Rampage, an adaptation of the classic video game in which The Rock plays a primatologist who works with a supersized gorilla to fight other massive monsters. Director Peyton Reed and The Rock previously worked together on the movies San Andreas and Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.Domestic – $101,028,233International – $327,000,000Worldwide – $428,028,233 7: Uncharted (2022)Sony's Uncharted film starring Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, blasted off in February 2022 to bigtime box office numbers. It had a huge $44 million opening weekend in the US, and has to date earned more than $400 million globally. That's good enough for Sony Pictures CEO Tom Rothman to call Uncharted Sony's next big franchise, suggesting a sequel may be on the way. Director Ruben Fleischer has said he's game for a sequel and has even outlined some of his ideas for a follow-up, including putting Uncharted 4's epic car chase set piece into a potential Uncharted 2.Domestic – $148,648,820International – $258,492,438Worldwide – $407,141,258 8: Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022)Sonic the Hedgehog 2 released in April 2022 and has become a quick success. It recently surpassed the 2020 original Sonic film to become the highest-grossing video game movie of all time in the US.Globally, it's not as high on the charts, but it's still performing well enough to become one of the highest-grossing video game movies ever. Unsurprisingly, plans are in motion for a Sonic movie cinematic universe, which will include Sonic 3 and a Knuckles TV series.Domestic -- $190,872,904International -- $214,548,614Worldwide -- $405,421,518 9: The Angry Birds Movie (2016) Rovio's Angry Birds is one of the best-known mobile games of all time, so it was no surprise that it became a movie. Sony Pictures produced the animated film, which boasted an all-star voice cast that featured Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad, Sean Penn, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Bill Hader, and Peter Dinklage. The screenplay was written by The Simpsons veteran Jon Vitti, and the film was directed by Disney animation veterans Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly. A sequel was released in 2019, but it performed considerably worse, bringing in about $148 million.Domestic – $107,509,366International – $244,824,563Worldwide – $352,333,929 10: Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010) Disney produced 2010's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, which starred Jake Gyllenhaal as Prince Dastan. The rest of the cast included Ben Kingsley, Alfred Molina, Gemma Artertron, and Toby Kebbel. The movie, which is based on Ubisoft's popular series, was directed by Mike Newell, who previously directed Four Weddings and Funeral as well as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Similar to Warcraft, it made the bulk of its money from foreign markets, pulling in $245.6 million, or 73% of its worldwide total ($336.4 million), from markets outside the US.Domestic – $90,759,676International – $245,606,000Worldwide – $336,365,676 11: Sonic the Hedgehog (2020)After controversies surrounding its character models being… not so good, the Sonic the Hedgehog came to the big screen in 2020 and was generally well-received and made a lot of money. The film features Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic, with Jim Carrey playing the evil Dr. Robotnik. The success of the film led Paramount to quickly greenlight a sequel, which comes to theaters in April, featuring Knuckles and Tails, in addition to the returning cast.Domestic – $148,974,665International – $170,741,018Worldwide – $319,715,683 12: Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016) Paul W.S. Anderson's Resident Evil movie series wrapped up with 2016's appropriately titled Resident Evil: The Final Chapter, which once again starred his partner, Mila Jovovich, in the lead role. In total, Anderson's Resident Evil films, which are inspired by Capcom's scary longrunning zombie video game series, have made more than $1 billion at the box office. Anderson and Jovovich stayed in business with Capcom after The Final Chapter, as they made the Monster Hunter movie in 2020.Domestic – $26,830,068International – $285,412,558Worldwide – $312,242,626 13: Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) The second Resident Evil movie to rank in the top 10 all-time highest-grossing video game movies, Paul W.S. Anderson's Resident Evil: Afterlife, based on Capcom's video game series, was released in 2010. Anderson returned to direct the film after stepping away from the series to direct Alien vs. Predator and work on other projects. Mila Jovovich starred as Alice, with a cast that also included Kim Coates, Wentworth Miller, and Shawn Roberts.Domestic – $60,128,566International – $240,099,518Worldwide – $300,228,084 14: Tomb Raider (2018) After multiple films starring Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, Oscar-winner Alicia Vikander took on the role of Lara Croft in the 2018 film from The Wave director Roar Uthaug. The film was partly inspired by Crystal Dynamics' 2013 reboot, telling an origin story for the character. Croft is trying to solve the mystery of her father's (Dominic West) disappearance. The film also starred Walton Goggins, Daniel Wu, and Kristin Scott Thomas. The movie made the bulk of its money ($216.4 million; 78.8%) from international markets, with just $58.25 million from the US. A sequel is now said to be in the works, but whether or not it ever gets made remains to be seen.Domestic – $58,250,803International – $216,400,000Worldwide – $274,650,803",

There's the yet to be released Honcho from the devs behind Landlord's Super and Jalopy, you can bet your bottom dollar I'll be playing that one. And now, there's Easy Delivery Co., a game with a kei truck that isn't exactly what it says on the tin. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. How many lip products do you typically carry with you: 1-2, 3-5 or 5+? Lately, I’ve been pretty streamlined, so it’s usually one or two things – lipstick and a gloss! 2. What nail colors have you been into lately? Pale opaque baby blues. Perhaps I’m having a mid-’90s nostalgia moment, ha! Remember that baby blue nail polish by Hard Candy? I couldn’t get enough of it. 3. Which would you rather do: an afternoon outdoor picnic or late night stargazing? Afternoon picnic because I’m pretty sure I’d be too sleepy to stargaze late at night, hahaha! 4. Scrambled or sunny side up? Both! But if it’s scrambled, I’ve got to be the one making the eggs. I’m weirdly picky about my scrambled eggs.

    "description": "So, yeah. One of Tabs’ little-known side hustles would have made him even MORE super popular around the neighborhood but, unfortunately, he had to keep his real identity under wraps. I mean, he wanted to promote it, but his contract with Easter Bunnies Inc. had an airtight NDA. So it was a pretty thankless job, but still…highly rewarding. As you can imagine, Easter was a favorite around here. All of us at Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC were always busy during that critical first quarter trying to maximize the company’s gravy quota, so by Easter we were worn out. That’s when Tabs would always decide on his spring goals, and when they were good, it definitely helped set the tone for the rest of the year. 😹 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 858 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Oblivion Remastered's shadow drop surprised no-one given that it was among the worst kept secrets over the last few weeks, but what did surprise was the sheer extent of its visual overhaul. Described by creative director Todd Howard as keeping the bones - the core logic - of the original 2006 game intact, it's fallen on developer Virtuos to use Unreal Engine 5 to re-work the visual layer. It's a much needed move, and the remaster gives us the works, deploying the full suite of UE5 features as a graphics renderer. Cyrodiil's lighting is transformed via its Lumen technology, allowing for an approximated form of ray traced global illumination and reflections, with dynamic shadows. Character models, materials, and effects are also reworked from scratch - plus we get a new locomotion system helping to address the rather stilted animations of the original. Best of all, Virtuos adds quality of life improvements like a modernised UI, levelling system, a sprint button, and even an updated lip-sync technology for NPCs. Read more",
