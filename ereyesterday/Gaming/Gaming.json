    "description": "When I downloaded Creeper World IXE's demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a \"failure\" - and Sin has an enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment. What does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in \"dominating\" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. A habit that changed your life? Getting up early. For most of my life I was a night owl, and when I had Connor that all changed. When she was an infant, I started waking up at the crack of dawn to sneak in work before she woke up in the morning. The habit ended up sticking, and now I’m an early bird. 2. Fruit or cupcakes? As much as I love a small cake smothered in frosting, I’m gonna have to go with fruit. 3. Are you doing any advent calendars this year? At Trader Joe’s a couple weeks ago, I picked up a few for the “kids” – Connor, Rosie and Marnie. Ha ha ha! 4. Something on your Christmas list? Honestly, I have no[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 859 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Jeez! It’s December already? Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! Rosie is NOT ready. Tabs handled the holidays differently. He was a total pro about it, planned everything out months in advance. His Christmas plans were always well underway by August. But Rosie didn’t even begin to take Christmas seriously until this weekend, and now she’s frantic! Wait — did I say frantic? 😂 I meant “totally uninterested and really fantastic.” Seriously, she isn’t bothered about it at all. She has three PhDs and a feline Nobel Prize. Rosie spends her days researching climate change and nuclear fusion. She isn’t worried about planning for Christmas. I’m sure she’ll pull something amazing together in the last few days. #bosskitty Marnie, on the other hand, has no idea what’s going on. 😂 Deputy Derp, reporting for duty!
