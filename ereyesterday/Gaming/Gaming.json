    "description": "Big business.A Scene From Illumination's The Super Mario Bros. Movie2025 kicked off with the next big video game movie--A Minecraft Movie. After only two weekends in theaters, it's made more than $550 million, cementing its position as the No. 2 highest-grossing video game movie of all time.It was not the first video game adaptation from Hollywood and won't be the last. But where does A Minecraft Movie rank all-time against biggest video game movies? In this gallery, we're rounding up the highest-grossing video game films of all time, breaking down box office results by domestic, international, and worldwide figures.The top 10 list is made up of massive franchises like Pokemon, Tomb Raider, Angry Birds, and Sonic, just to name a few. Looking ahead, there are a boatload of new video game films in the works.Without further ado, here are the top 14 highest-grossing video game movies of all time. All box office figures are pulled from Amazon's BoxOfficeMojo. 1: The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)Following 1993's poorly received live-action Super Mario Bros. Movie starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo, many wondered if Nintendo would ever again attempt to make a Mario movie. Well, 30 years later, the company partnered with Minions studio Illumination to do just that--and the movie is off to a fantastic start. Released on April 5, 2023 the movie quickly earned $377 million worldwide over its first five days and rapidly cleared more than $500 million. It's now earned more than $1.3 billion. The movie features the voice of Chris Pratt as Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi, and Jack Black as Bowser. Domestic – $574,934,330International – $787,009,114Worldwide – $1,361,943,444 2. A Minecraft Movie (2025)A Minecraft Movie was released on April 4, and it had a gigantic debut. After just two weekends in theaters, it's the No. 2 highest-grossing video game movie of all time. Keep checking back, as we will update this post as more box office numbers come in and A Minecraft Movie inevitably climbs up the charts.Domestic –$280,961,733International – $269,600,000Worldwide – $550,561,733 3: Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (2024)Sonic the Hedgehog 3 released in December 2024 and became a fast success, zipping up to No. 2 all time for a video game movie. It's also just the second video game movie ever to exceed $200 million from the domestic market. Among other new additions, Keanu Reeves joined the film in the role of Shadow the Hedgehog.Domestic – $230,549,154International – $232,000,000Worldwide – $462,549,154 4: Pokemon Detective Pikachu (2019)Warner Bros. 2019 video game movie Pokemon: Detective Pikachu was a hit with critics and fans alike, and it did big business at the box office to rank as the second-highest grossing video game movie of all time worldwide. It featured the voice of Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu and a heartwarming and rollercoaster story involving Pikachu teaming up with a young man, Justice Smith, to find his father. Bill Nighy also starred in the film, which featured incredible CGI pocket monsters and some epic fight scenes, including a showdown with Mewtwo.Domestic – $144,174,568International – $289,303,033Worldwide – $449,762,638 5: Warcraft (2016)Legendary and Blizzard teamed up to make a Warcraft movie back in 2016, but development began much earlier and went through several changes before it was released. At one point, Spider-Man's Sam Raimi was attached to direct, but he dropped out due to the working conditions with Blizzard. Moon and Source Code director Duncan Jones, the son of David Bowie, eventually signed on to direct the fantasy film. It bombed in the US but did massive numbers internationally to pull in $439 million worldwide, putting it at the top of the charts. Jones said he had plans for a trilogy, but the poor box office performance in the US means that will likely never happen.Domestic – $47,365,290International – $391,683,624Worldwide – $439,048,914 6: Rampage (2018) Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson starred in 2018's Rampage, an adaptation of the classic video game in which The Rock plays a primatologist who works with a supersized gorilla to fight other massive monsters. Director Peyton Reed and The Rock previously worked together on the movies San Andreas and Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.Domestic – $101,028,233International – $327,000,000Worldwide – $428,028,233 7: Uncharted (2022)Sony's Uncharted film starring Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, blasted off in February 2022 to bigtime box office numbers. It had a huge $44 million opening weekend in the US, and has to date earned more than $400 million globally. That's good enough for Sony Pictures CEO Tom Rothman to call Uncharted Sony's next big franchise, suggesting a sequel may be on the way. Director Ruben Fleischer has said he's game for a sequel and has even outlined some of his ideas for a follow-up, including putting Uncharted 4's epic car chase set piece into a potential Uncharted 2.Domestic – $148,648,820International – $258,492,438Worldwide – $407,141,258 8: Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022)Sonic the Hedgehog 2 released in April 2022 and has become a quick success. It recently surpassed the 2020 original Sonic film to become the highest-grossing video game movie of all time in the US.Globally, it's not as high on the charts, but it's still performing well enough to become one of the highest-grossing video game movies ever. Unsurprisingly, plans are in motion for a Sonic movie cinematic universe, which will include Sonic 3 and a Knuckles TV series.Domestic -- $190,872,904International -- $214,548,614Worldwide -- $405,421,518 9: The Angry Birds Movie (2016) Rovio's Angry Birds is one of the best-known mobile games of all time, so it was no surprise that it became a movie. Sony Pictures produced the animated film, which boasted an all-star voice cast that featured Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad, Sean Penn, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Bill Hader, and Peter Dinklage. The screenplay was written by The Simpsons veteran Jon Vitti, and the film was directed by Disney animation veterans Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly. A sequel was released in 2019, but it performed considerably worse, bringing in about $148 million.Domestic – $107,509,366International – $244,824,563Worldwide – $352,333,929 10: Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010) Disney produced 2010's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, which starred Jake Gyllenhaal as Prince Dastan. The rest of the cast included Ben Kingsley, Alfred Molina, Gemma Artertron, and Toby Kebbel. The movie, which is based on Ubisoft's popular series, was directed by Mike Newell, who previously directed Four Weddings and Funeral as well as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Similar to Warcraft, it made the bulk of its money from foreign markets, pulling in $245.6 million, or 73% of its worldwide total ($336.4 million), from markets outside the US.Domestic – $90,759,676International – $245,606,000Worldwide – $336,365,676 11: Sonic the Hedgehog (2020)After controversies surrounding its character models being… not so good, the Sonic the Hedgehog came to the big screen in 2020 and was generally well-received and made a lot of money. The film features Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic, with Jim Carrey playing the evil Dr. Robotnik. The success of the film led Paramount to quickly greenlight a sequel, which comes to theaters in April, featuring Knuckles and Tails, in addition to the returning cast.Domestic – $148,974,665International – $170,741,018Worldwide – $319,715,683 12: Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016) Paul W.S. Anderson's Resident Evil movie series wrapped up with 2016's appropriately titled Resident Evil: The Final Chapter, which once again starred his partner, Mila Jovovich, in the lead role. In total, Anderson's Resident Evil films, which are inspired by Capcom's scary longrunning zombie video game series, have made more than $1 billion at the box office. Anderson and Jovovich stayed in business with Capcom after The Final Chapter, as they made the Monster Hunter movie in 2020.Domestic – $26,830,068International – $285,412,558Worldwide – $312,242,626 13: Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) The second Resident Evil movie to rank in the top 10 all-time highest-grossing video game movies, Paul W.S. Anderson's Resident Evil: Afterlife, based on Capcom's video game series, was released in 2010. Anderson returned to direct the film after stepping away from the series to direct Alien vs. Predator and work on other projects. Mila Jovovich starred as Alice, with a cast that also included Kim Coates, Wentworth Miller, and Shawn Roberts.Domestic – $60,128,566International – $240,099,518Worldwide – $300,228,084 14: Tomb Raider (2018) After multiple films starring Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, Oscar-winner Alicia Vikander took on the role of Lara Croft in the 2018 film from The Wave director Roar Uthaug. The film was partly inspired by Crystal Dynamics' 2013 reboot, telling an origin story for the character. Croft is trying to solve the mystery of her father's (Dominic West) disappearance. The film also starred Walton Goggins, Daniel Wu, and Kristin Scott Thomas. The movie made the bulk of its money ($216.4 million; 78.8%) from international markets, with just $58.25 million from the US. A sequel is now said to be in the works, but whether or not it ever gets made remains to be seen.Domestic – $58,250,803International – $216,400,000Worldwide – $274,650,803",

    "description": "Are you ready to solve Eight Realms in Eight Months in Blue Prince? You're going to stumble upon this puzzle a few hours into your playthrough. However, you won't have all the information to make heads or tails of what you actually need to do. Thankfully, our guide here has all the details. Just watch out because we're going to include a few spoilers as well.How to solve Eight Realms in Eight Months in Blue Prince - Room 46 Map Puzzle guideEight Realms in Eight Months is quite a doozy of a puzzle. It involves doing the following:Revisit Room 46 after clearing the campaign once. Look behind the chair on the desk to see a map with pins. This is the Eight Realms in Eight Months Puzzle. It's a map with several continents and regions, and there are eight pins that you can place.Some partial clues can be found in other parts of the estate: The History of Orindia and Realm \u0026 Rune - These books can be purchased via the Bookstore, and you can request them in the Library.Classroom - Upon drafting a Classroom, you should check the test papers that students submitted. Likewise, if you can draft the Schoolhouse as an outer room, you can place up to eight Classrooms in the manor. The higher class \"grades\" have maps of the world.The most important hints, however, come from the Sanctum Keys that you've collected. These lead you to doorways in the Underground, where you have to solve the Sigil Puzzles.Each room with a Sigil Puzzle has a postcard from Herbert Sinclair detailing his trip. His letters addressed to you denote the correct order of the pins on the map board in Room 46.Note: Our guide looks into the clues first in case you want to solve the puzzle on your own. Or, you can skip straight ahead to the end to learn about the solution. Eight Realms in Eight Months clues: The History of Orindia and Realm \u0026 RuneBefore we provide the solution to the Blue Prince Eight Realms in Eight Months Puzzle, let's check out some clues from a couple of books:The History of Orindia book has a page that shows the eastern hemisphere of the map--i.e. Fenn Aries, Eraja, and Arch Aries. You can see this in the image above. The symbols on the landmasses correspond to some of the core symbols from the Sanctum Sigil Puzzles.Realm \u0026 Rune, which is primarily used for the Sanctum Sigil Puzzles, also has a page showing the core symbols of each nation. Another page even details terrains and transportation modes. Eight Realms in Eight Months clues: Classroom tests and mapsAs mentioned earlier, you can select the Schoolhouse if it appears as an outer room. This lets you draft up to eight additional classrooms inside the mansion.Some of the lesson plans and maps tell you about the history of the land. This includes the different continents and regions on the world map. The test papers, meanwhile, show flags with the correct colors--i.e. these are the flags of the nations from the books. Eight Realms in Eight Months clues: The Postcards from the Sanctum Sigil PuzzleNow, assuming you've solved all the Sanctum Sigil Puzzles, then you've likely seen the following:An illustration of a locale, be it a village, a mountain, a beach, etc.Herbert's letter to Simon talking about his travels.Flags and insignias with different colors.The idea is to arrange Herbert's letters in a chronological order. Imagine that he's sharing news about his journey. If so, which location did he come from? Which location did he travel to next? Which continent did he go to afterward? All of these appear as contextual clues in the letters. Eight Realms in Eight Months: Herbert's Travels Around the WorldOkay, we promise this is the last section about clues for the Blue Prince Eight Realms in Eight Months Puzzle. This is basically how Herbert's trip went:First location: Fenn Aries (chip symbol) - The first letter from the first Sigil Puzzle (from the left) tells you of how he started his journey. See how it matches the map from the History of Orindia.Second location: Eraja (hourglass symbol) - Herbert mentioned going south, so look at the Orindia map to see which region is south of Fenn Aries.Third location: Arch Aries (mountain symbol) - There are a couple of clues here: Herbert said that he misses the old days when railway tracks extended north.He wanted to trek along the northern coast.Fourth location: Mora Jai (cap symbol) - Herbert arrived on the main island after a sea voyage.Fifith location: Verra (jigsaw symbol) - Herbert mentioned that the weather in Verra is more severe compared to Mora Jai--i.e. he's been to Mora Jai already.Sixth location: Corarica (heart symbol) - It seems that frigid weather in Corarica is a welcome relief compared to Verra.Seventh location: Nuance (diamond symbol) - Herbert says that the views are as stirring as the ones in Corarica and Mora Jai, which he previously visited. He also says that he looks to the east and sees red flags.Eighth location: Fenn Aries (pentagon symbol) - He mentions that this is his last postcard. Moreover, the Sigil Puzzle painting has the nation's red flags. Eight Realms in Eight Months solutionThe image above shows you how to solve the Eight Realms in Eight Months Puzzle. You just need to place the pins on the correct regions/landmasses:Pin #1: Fenn Aries - The middle of the large landmasses at the right-hand side of the map.Pin #2: Eraja - South of #1 (Fenn Aries).Pin #3: Arch Aries - North of #1 (Fenn Aries).Pin #4: Mora Jai - The large northern island across the ocean from #3 (Arch Aries).Pin #5: Verra - The medium-sized circular island in the middle of the map.Pin #6: Corarica - The massive landmass at the left side of the map.Pin #7: Nuance - The Scotland-esque landmass to the left of #1 and #2.Pin #8: Fenn Aries - Herbert was already home when he penned his last letter. It means you should place the pin on the location of #1 as well.That's it! You've solved the Eight Realms in Eight Months Puzzle in Blue Prince. A small compartment will open, revealing a couple of letters. These aren't just for background lore or fluff. They're actually related to other puzzles and discoveries, too.A surreal adventure filled with wonders and mysteries await you in Blue Prince.

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. How would you rather spend some unexpected afternoon free time: watching a movie, going for a walk or reading a book? I’d love some extra time to read! I recently found a new-to-me author that I enjoy, Rebecca Searle, and I’m going through all of her books. 2. What did you last cry about? Well, I went to the OBGYN last week, and I had a mini-meltdown when the nice nurse took my blood pressure. I think it’s a little bit of leftover post-traumatic stress from going to the doctor so much last year along with some hormonal stuff (dang this peri-menopause). 3. What would you rather do with a friend: play card games, have a picnic in the park or go to the farmers’ market?

What could you use most right now: cuddles with pets, a hot cup of tea or a nap? I’m drinking a hot cup of tea at the moment, and I’m not too sleepy, so I’ll take the cuddles from the pets. 2. On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest, how concerned are you about AI? Girl. As someone who named her daughter after a great science fiction heroine who rises up to help defeat the robots, I’m going to give this a solid 10. I’m freaked out, man! 3.
