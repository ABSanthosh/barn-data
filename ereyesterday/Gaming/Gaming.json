    "description": "Back in the '90s, nothing was better than watching Saturday morning cartoons, and if you're looking to recapture that nostalgic feeling, one of the more absurd shows of that era is headed to home media. Toxic Crusaders: The Series Collector's Edition has been digitally restored and remastered on Blu-ray, and while each episode was a typical 21-minute advert to buy action figures based on the exploits of Toxie, it's still a surprisingly entertaining and weird show in its own right. Priced at $24.75 (was $35), it'll be released on December 10. Toxic Crusaders: The Series - Collector's Edition $24.75 (was $35) In addition to a sharp remaster of the cartoon series, this Blu-ray also includes some extra content alongside the original 13-episode run. There's a new introduction by Lloyd Kaufman--the director of the Toxic Avenger movie--the original Toxic Crusaders toy commercials and TV spots, archival footage thought to be lost to time, and bonus cartoons. There's even a documentary about the making of the Toxic Crusaders video game from Retroware, so this is a comprehensive Blu-ray. Preorder at Amazon If you never watched it, Toxic Crusaders was an adaptation of the horror-comedy film The Toxic Avenger, only with the violence toned down for younger audiences. The show starred Toxie, a former janitor who was horribly bullied until one day, he's exposed to toxic waste that mutates him into a super-powered creature. He then joins with several other misfit mutants to battle evildoers.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The dream of having an arcade inside your home is considerably more realistic these days thanks to the proliferation of consumer-grade cabinets, led by Arcade1Up. But unless you have a plethora of open space and the disposable cash to buy a bunch of cabinets, bringing the arcade home means maybe one or two machines. And unlike arcades, you're usually locked into a specific lineup of games; you can't take your quarters elsewhere when you have the urge to switch things up. Multiple cabinet manufacturers have tried to solve the space and boredom concerns by becoming arcade platforms. It hasn't really worked yet, but that could change with the arrival of one of the best pieces of gaming hardware in years: the Evercade Alpha Bartop Arcade.Officially licensed by Capcom and created by Blaze Entertainment, the Alpha offers an authentic arcade experience with full-size controls in a compact form factor for $250--a $20 discount is available if you complete your purchase before the Alpha's November 28 release. Two models, each with six preloaded games, will be available at launch: Mega Man: The Power Battle and Street Fighter II: Champion Edition. But what makes these superbly realized bartop cabinets so exciting is support for the 535 (and counting) games in the Evercade library. Evercade Alpha Street Fighter Edition $230 (was $250) | Releases November 28 Preorder at Amazon Evercade Alpha Mega Man Edition $230 (was $250) | Releases November 28 Preorder at Amazon For those unfamiliar with the brand, Evercade is a line of cartridge-based hardware that debuted as a handheld in 2020. Today, there are multiple iterations of the handheld as well as a home console. All Evercade devices share the same game library, which means the Alpha is launching with a massive catalog of over 60 cartridge collections featuring arcade, home console, and handheld classics.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

As someone who isn't often into the 'lore' behind things and prefers to just shoot and ask questions later, I found myself actually asking the questions. I wanted to know why I was targeted by such carnal eroticism. I wanted to know more about my character's own relationships. How angels fit into the picture. And why lots of the demons seem quite chill, really. But when it came to the actual survival - the bit I thought I'd enjoy the most - I came away a bit disappointed. Exploration is fine, it's just the combat is often too frequent and too frequently irritating. I came to dread the action more than the atmosphere, in the end. Read more",

The first: you will say \"lol, it me\" with enough humour to wishlist it on Steam and earmark it for the future. The second: you will mutter \"ugh, it me\" and be immediately put off by the idea of having to tolerate an entire second layer of psychological hangups. There is a third secret reaction though... you might think: oh, this looks a lot like Disco Elysium, but in the real world. Read more",

    "description": "My fall bucket list! Try a new chili recipe (I’ve got my eye on this one), and then make enough to share with my neighbors. Bake brownies, and perhaps share those with the neighbors, too, when I drop off the chili. Go on a long hike, then come home and drink hot apple cider. Buy an epic pair of rain boots. Go for a walk with Marnie and stomp into a pile of leaves with those epic rain boots. Snuggle into a warm, cozy sweater that makes me feel amazing when I wear it. Side note, is it just me, or is it surprisingly difficult to find a sweater that fits well and ticks all the boxes? Every time I try one on, I find at least 5 things that I want to change. Handwrite a few letters on nice stationary and send them via snail mail. Watch a classic musical wearing my coziest pajamas; of course a snuggly blanket will be up in the mix, too.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1.Something you accomplished recently that makes you feel good? I helped Connor start a weekly chart to track her chores around the house, and we’ve been refining it over a few weeks to see what works and what doesn’t work. It took a while to figure it out, to be honest. I’m feeling good about it, and I think she is too; I’m hoping it sets her up with good habits for the future. 2. Last beauty product you bought? I grabbed a cream shadow from Charlotte Tilbury, the Eyes to Mesmerise Cream Shadow in Oyster Pearl, a shimmery bronze-gold, from the Sephora fall sale. 3. Pick your fun eyeliner color – green, purple or blue? Purple, please! 4. Walking outside in the rain – yes or no?[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 856 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
