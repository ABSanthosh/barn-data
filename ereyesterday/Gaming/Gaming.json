    "description": "Until Dawn (4K Blu-ray + Blu-ray + Digital) $50 | Releases July 8 Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart Until Dawn on Prime Video Buy for $25 / Rent for $20 | Available Now See at Amazon While movie adaptations of video games can be very hit or miss, Until Dawn was one of the more memorable projects thanks to the film putting its own spin on the game's choose-your-own-design mechanics. In case you missed it on the big screen, Until Dawn is now available to watch from the comfort of your own couch. You can rent or buy the digital release from Prime Video for $20-$25. If you prefer physical media and don't mind waiting, Until Dawn's 4K Blu-ray combo pack is up for preorder at Amazon and Walmart ahead of its July 8 release date.Until Dawn is the third video game film adaptation from PlayStation Productions following Uncharted and Gran Turismo. The production company, which was founded in 2019, is also credited with the TV adaptations of Twisted Metal and the critically acclaimed HBO series The Last of Us. Until Dawn (4K Blu-ray + Blu-ray + Digital) $50 | Releases July 8 Until Dawn's 4K Blu-ray edition also comes a 1080p Blu-ray disc and digital copy of the film. Along with native 4K resolution, Until Dawn will support Dolby Atmos audio on supported devices.Amazon and Walmart have the 4K Blu-ray combo pack priced at $50 at the moment. That said, we expect the price to drop prior to launch. Both retailers offer preorder price guarantees, so you'll be eligible for any future discounts from the moment you place your order until your Blu-ray ships.Until Dawn is also getting a DVD release, in case you want to experience the horror film in spine-tingling 480p resolution. Amazon has the DVD version priced at $28.60, while Walmart listed it for $35.Here's the full list of Until Dawn special features:Adapting a Nightmare - Director David F. Sandberg and writer Gary Dauberman discuss the inspirations of the film and how they built off of the game world from the hit PlayStation game.Death-Defying Cast - Meet the castPractical Terrors - A look at the practical effects and props used to garner realistic reactions from the actors and actresses.pAudio Commentary with director David F. Sandberg and producer Lotta LostenDeleted and extended scenes Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart Until Dawn on Prime Video Buy for $25 / Rent for $20 | Available Now If you don't want to wait, you can rent Until Dawn for $20 or buy a digital copy for $25. If you buy the film, you can watch it whenever you want, but rentals on Prime Video have a couple of rules to keep in mind. You'll have 30 days to start watching the movie after making your purchase. Once the movie begins, it will be returned to Amazon in 48 hours. Your rental/purchase grants access to the 4K and standard definition versions of Until Dawn. See at Amazon In case you missed it, Until Dawn tells an original story and is set within the same universe as the game. Connecting the video game and the film is Stormare's character, Dr. Hill, who appeared in both mediums. Another nod to the game is that the movie has the same tone and vibe, as the main characters find themselves caught in a time-loop where they frequently die due to a variety of grisly means. The only way to break this vicious cycle is to survive…until dawn. The film has received mixed reviews, but if you're in the mood for a cheesy horror-comedy with slick direction, Until Dawn is an enjoyable watch.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What did you have for breakfast? Protein smoothie with whey protein powder, greek yogurt, unsweetened almond milk and fruit (apples and strawberries). It’s easy, doesn’t require turning on the stove and it keeps me full for hours. 2. How did you do your hair today? I’m wearing it down, with soft, barely there waves. Kinda boring but it’s practical for me because it takes about five minutes to style. Plus wearing it down helps with the migraines (I get bad ones). 3. What’s your favorite summer month? June. It’s the end of the school year, and you feel like the whole summer is ahead of you! It’s also warm but not too hot yet. Oh, and it’s my birthday month, too. Yay, to all my cray-cray geminis![Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 879 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Crisis between colleagues! Today, a special meeting of the Board of Directors of Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC was called to review a most disturbing matter — the repeated and inexplicable disappearance of Chief Feline Officer Rosie’s crunchies. At various times over the past few weeks, Rosie’s food bowl, which had been previously full, has become empty, and as you can imagine, this caused quite a corporate kerfuffle. The results of an internal investigation were inconclusive, but Rosie thinks she knows who’s doing it… Since the official investigation was inconclusive, the board hasn’t taken any action, but Rosie’s suspicions have created a lot of tension… Unfortunately for Marnie, she has a lengthy record of snack theft, so her history isn’t doing her any favors. Plus, she was captured on security footage early this morning in the vicinity of Rosie’s food bowl. When asked about it by the company investigator, Marnie lawyered up… I just hope this gets resolved soon because it’s been bad for morale in the office. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 861 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
