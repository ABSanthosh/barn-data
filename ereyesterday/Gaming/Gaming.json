    "description": "Surprise! Fanatical just kicked off Bundlefest 2025 event, which sees a new bundle deal launch each day of the week from February 10 through 14, and the first offering is a doozy. Monday's bundle is the Build Your Own Capcom Bundle, which lets you customize your own selection of classic Capcom-published PC titles at big discounts--check out more details about the bundle below. The next bundle launches on Tuesday, February 11, and we'll be updating this post throughout the week as more new bundles drop.Fanatical Bundlefest 2025: Quick LookFebruary 10: Build Your Own Capcom BundleFebruary 11: TBAFebruary 12: TBAFebruary 13: TBAFebruary 14: TBALike other Fanatical deals, all games purchased in these bundle deals are delivered as official keys. Most are Steam keys, but other launchers like the Epic Games Store may also be included. Also, while Bundlefest highlights Fanatical's newest deals, plenty of other bundles are also available at Fanatical's online store if you're looking to save even more.Build Your Own Capcom Bundle - Bundlefest 2025The Build Your Own Capcom Bundle lets you pick from a list of 21 Capcom games, each one available for $6.50 or less. Almost all the major Capcom series are here, though don't expect many new titles. The picks mostly include HD remasters and collections of classic entries in series like Ace Attorney, Mega Man, Devil May Cry, Street Fighter, Resident Evil, and more. One of the only major omissions is the Monster Hunter series--likely because Fanatical recently ran a separate Monster Hunter Bundle that is unfortunately no longer available.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Fortnite Chapter 6 has gotten off to a pretty strong start, adding new permanent modes with Fortnite OG and Ballistic, dropping a full-sized Godzilla on the island, and ushering in the game's Hatsune Miku era. But Chapter 6 Season 2 is just around the corner, bringing with it a whole new slate of attractions. With a few days to go before Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 starts, here's everything we know so far.When does Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 begin?Season 1 is currently scheduled to come to a close on February 21 at 11 PM PT/ 2 AM ET. That would mean that Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 should begin a few hours later on the morning of Friday, February 21.Will Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 1 have a live finale event?The Jan. 31 update added some interesting items to the Fortnite game files, including many indications that Season 1 will end with some sort of ambient live event on the battle royale island to bring the season story to a close. What exactly the event will entail is still a mystery, but the first stage of buildup has begun--the NPC Daigo has moved on from the spot in the Nightshift Forest where he's been battling demons all season and has taken up new residence by the unused portal in the mountains above Warrior's Watch, and that is where the big finale will go down.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "It’s the Super Bowl! As you know, before Tabs rocked the world by reinventing kitty supermodeling, he entertained millions as a professional cat football player. In fact, he won the Kitty Bowl a record eight times, making him more accomplished than even Tom Brady. Yes, Tabs was quite the cat athlete. Today’s game starts in a few minutes, and while Tabs is no longer here to watch the game with me, I’m sure he’ll be watching from up above. This happens to also be the last Sunday before Valentine’s. Marnie and Rosie are both more interested in that aspect of the day than the football. I can appreciate that. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What would you rather do on a rainy day: go to the movies with a friend, cozy up at home with a good book and a cup of tea, or go on an adventurous and fun (and very wet) hike? Right now movies with a friend sounds like it would be fun! Of course we’d have to have all the snacks – popcorn, M\u0026Ms and bubbly water. 2. What game show would you absolutely dominate: Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy or The Price Is Right? I’d have the best chances at The Price Is Right. Can’t say I’d dominate it, though. Hahaha! 3. Do you wear more makeup now or less makeup than you did a year ago? I wear a little less these days, but that’s mostly[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 867 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
