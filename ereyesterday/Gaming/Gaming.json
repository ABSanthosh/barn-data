    "description": "PS5 owners who haven't added the masterful Resident Evil 4 remake to their collection can grab a physical copy for cheap right now. Amazon has discounted Resident Evil 4 to only $20 for PS5. This is the lowest price ever for the PlayStation 5 physical edition. Resident Evil 4 carries a $40 retail price, though it's often available for $30-$35 at Amazon. Xbox Series X players can snag a physical copy for $22. See at Amazon Resident Evil 4 continued Capcom's streak of successful Resident Evil remakes, recreating the 2005 original's story and setting with modernized visuals and gameplay that iterates on the design of the Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes. However, unlike the massive overhauls seen in those other remakes, this new version of Resident Evil 4 is a much more faithful adaptation.In GameSpot's Resident Evil 4 review, Kurt Indovina awarded the game a 10/10, saying that the remake \"stands as a re-envisioning of its past rather than a replication of it. In doing this, it raises the bar for what a good remake is and at the same time, preserves Resident Evil 4's legacy as a genre-defining experience and one of the greatest games of all time.\"Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Their forthcoming Love Eternal is the story of Maya, a girl whisked off to a \"castle built of bitter memories\" by a weird, lonely god, and obliged to make her way \"through over 100 screens filled with spikes, lasers, switches, and traps\". When not getting spiked or lasered, Maya appears to spend her days in a kind of metaphorical suburban household. Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity. Watch her put that ability to use in the new trailer. Read more",

    "description": "I’ve lived in the Bay Area practically all of my life and had no idea that this gorgeous place existed. Fioli Historic House and Gardens is just about an hour away from where I live Marin county. It’s in the peninsula, south of San Francisco. Back in the day, it was a private residence, but now you can visit it and explore the mansion and the grounds. I went a couple weeks ago with my friends, Jen and Cindy; you might remember them from the MAC Evolution Revolution launch from waaaay back when. 🙂 We had tea at the cafe, explored the gardens and caught up. Sometimes I can’t believe that I used to talk to these two and see them every day. That’s one of the magical things of my childhood and teenage years that I didn’t fully understand the wonder of until I got older. To be able to say that I spent almost every day of my formative years with good friends was such a gift. Anywho, back to the gardens!

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Are you contemplating any limited edition holiday makeup releases? I usually prefer products in the permanent collections because in my experience holiday makeup performs differently for whatever reason. I do love a holiday fragrance set, though! 2. Are BB creams worth your time? My answer was no back in the day, but now that I’m into minimal base, I’m thinking it could be good if I find one that agrees with my skin. Hmm, maybe that will be my next makeup project – finding “the one.” I stumbled onto this one by Dr. Jart and it looks pretty good. 3. Your favorite video game? It’s all about old school Tetris on a Gameboy, baby! 4.Advice you wish you would’ve received as a young person? I wish someone[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 853 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
