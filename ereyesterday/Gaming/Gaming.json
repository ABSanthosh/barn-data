    "description": "Lego NES Set (2,646 pieces) $330 | Previously $270 | Retired Product See at Amazon See at Target See at Walmart See at Best Buy See at Lego Store The Lego Nintendo Entertainment System was officially retired near the end of 2024, though the 2,646-piece set had remained available to buy at multiple retailers up until the last few weeks. As of May 14, the only major retailer with stock is Amazon, and at first glance, it'd be easy to mistake it for a reseller listing. That's because the NES has become one of the rare Lego sets Amazon is selling for above MSRP.Amazon has increased the price of the Lego NES from $270 to $330. The current price is actually a \"deal\" compared to the $355 price Amazon had last week. If Amazon doesn't run out of units first, it's possible the price will return to $270. Over the past few months, the retailer has temporarily raised the price to as high as $360, but none of those spikes held for this long. It's worth noting that Target's sold-out listing also shows $330, so it's possible Amazon was price-matching a competitor.As shown above, the Lego NES is sold and shipped by Amazon.Though rare, this isn't the first instance of Amazon going above MSRP after a Lego set has been retired. We previously saw this with the Horizon Forbidden West Tallneck, which increased from $90 to $105 last year before selling out for good (it's ~$150 from resellers). Just like with the NES, Amazon was the only major retailer with the Tallneck in stock.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

But one of the biggest changes regards the open world. You won't freely explore the remote steppe town this time, but instead dander through isolated pockets, with lots of loading screens, map plotting, and fast travel.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What made you smile today? It’s early in the day (I just woke up 30 minutes ago), but so far petting Marnie and Rosie, and re-reading the homemade Mother’s Day card Connor made are two things that made me smile. 2. What’s the first thing you do when you get home and walk through the door? Hmmm, well, I want to say that I usually take off my shoes first thing because, hello, I need foot freedom (shoes are so oppressive), but I think what I technically do is lock the door behind me. 3. What’s your favorite cereal? Does oatmeal count? If it doesn’t then, it’s Kellogg’s Special K with the dried red strawberries. I don’t really eat it for breakfast, though. It’s more of a[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 878 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "It’s almost dusk here at Casa de MBB, and we’re getting cleaned up and ready for bed, but I still wanted to wish you a Happy Mother’s Day. There’s so much to say about Mother’s Day, isn’t there? It can be an emotional day in many ways for many reasons, different for everyone. People have such different relationships with their parents and their children and all of the creatures they care for, and life is fleeting. We all lose our care givers and loved ones someday, and days like today mean different things to all of us at different times in our lives. I pray and hope your day was good to you. Every Mother’s Day, just like every other day, I also think about Tabs. Oh! — sometimes when I see an old picture like this one below, I tear up, especially on Mother’s Day.
