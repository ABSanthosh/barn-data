    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-point-of-no-return-guide/2900-6209/",
    "description": "You tackle many quests in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. However, there are a select few that, once completed, also cause other missions to end abruptly. Likewise, there are those that prevent you from leaving hastily, lest these distractions lead you to abject failure. Here's our guide to help you with the points of no return in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Likewise, please be reminded that this article contains major spoilers.What are the points of no return in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2A point of no return is considered a pivotal moment in a game, one where you have no choice but to proceed onward until you reach a conclusion. During really important moments, you're also warned regarding events that are about to transpire. It's recommended that you keep a manual save handy by consuming your Savior Schnapps, just in case you want to try other objectives first.Here are what we classify as points of no return:Major - When you reach a major point of no return in the campaign, you'll see a notification that warns you before you proceed any further. Doing so (a) causes some side quests to end prematurely, and (b) \"railroads\" you through several missions. What this means is that you have to continue onward to tackle multiple quests in succession.Minor - Some quests will either have a hidden timer or an area-wide restriction where you're not allowed to leave until you're done with the key objective. Minor point of no return: Wedding CrashersA minor point of no return in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is Wedding Crashers, which is also the first proper main quest in the campaign given all the requirements and side objectives that you can undertake. Once you join the wedding celebrations at Semine, you have to complete the whole thing.Not only that, but this also leads to For Whom the Bell Tolls, a mission that's filled with tension and excitement due to the things you need to do to save a fellah. You also won't be able to fast travel for a while as you're doing these tasks. Major point of no return: For VictoryThe major point of no return in the game's first act happens during a quest called For Victory. After dealing with a certain problem while accompanied by soldiers, you have to report back to Von Bergow. An objective then appears, telling you to talk to Hans Capon in the evening, followed by a warning notification.Before you talk to Hans, make sure you complete the Demons of Trosky side quest, since it automatically fails if you proceed with For Victory. If you do decide to continue, you have to handle three huge quests in succession, culminating in Storm. Also, don't forget to romance Klara while you're at it. Minor point of no return: The King's GambitThe King's Gambit is a minor point of no return during the campaign's second act. You receive this quest right after Taking French Leave.The goal in The King's Gambit is to disguise yourself as a waiter, so you can join a council meeting that takes place in a few days in-game. Because the council will convene with or without you, it's imperative that you proceed with the main objective as soon as possible. Failure to do so actually leads to a game over. Major point of no return: OratoresThere's also another major point of no return in Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and it takes place during the Oratores main quest. Here's a quick summary:Your goal is to return to Ruthard Castle via the underground tunnel system. This also gives you an opportunity to romance Rosa.After dealing with the foes in the castle, you have to acquire a key and check out the crypts.Eventually, you have to catch a fellah who tries to escape on horseback. Prior to this stage, you need to make sure that you have a horse mount with gear pieces/armors that grant higher speed. Otherwise, you won't be able to catch up with your quarry.A warning notification will then pop up once you return to Ruthard Castle.Continuing past this segment causes several side quests to fail automatically. These include The Thunderstone, The White Roebuck, and Bellatores. Note that, as of the time of this writing, we're unable to confirm if other missions like The Fifth Commandment and The Devil's Pack end abruptly, too, as we had already finished them earlier in our playthrough.In any case, upon completing Oratores, you actually end up advancing toward the campaign's later stages and conclusion. That's also when you get to romance Katherine and romance Hans Capon.That does it for our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 point of no return guide. We hope this article helps you make the right decisions as you progress further into this wonderful and compelling campaign.If you need more tips as you explore Bohemia in the Middle Ages, be sure to visit our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 guides hub.",

    "description": "Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 takes you on a grand adventure across the regions of Bohemia. However, there's one individual who's been to more exotic and far-flung locales. Now, he needs your expertise after he's been accused of a crime that he did not commit. Here's our The Lion's Den guide to help you save Musa in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Likewise, please be reminded that this article contains spoilers.How to save Musa in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - The Lion's Den quest guideThe Lion's Den is a main quest that happens during the game's second act, which takes place in the Kuttenberg region. There are several objectives that you need to tackle here, including a murder investigation and subsequent trial, as well as an optional mission that furthers your romantic involvement with another character. At a certain point, you're also given a deadline to finish all your tasks. Part 1A: How to enter Sigismund's CampThe Lion's Den quest in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 occurs after the events of Exodus. The initial step involves talking to Jan Zizka at the inn, where he tells you that you need to infiltrate Sigismund's Camp. We recommend completing The Devil's Pack before getting to this point, since the mercenary band members that you've recruited will join the meeting, too.In any case, head to Sigismund's Camp, which is due northeast of Suchdol. Likewise, be sure to tag the fast travel point in the burned out village of Opatowitz to the north.Then, at the camp entrance, bribe the guard with 500 Groschen so you can pass. Turn left from the entrance to reach the baths and have a chat with Katherine. Part 1B: The Stalker side quest and Katherine romanceKatherine will tell you about your next move, but she wants you to wait until it's nighttime. Skip the time and talk to her to watch a cutscene, where you can also choose flirtatious responses. She then admits that a creep is watching her, which starts The Stalker side quest:You must complete The Stalker side quest before finishing The Lion's Den. Also, the creep who's been watching Katherine must not notice you.There are a few ways to handle this ornery fellah. In our playthrough, we simply commanded our dog companion Mutt to sniff Katherine's shoe. Mutt then tracked the scent, which led us to the tent of a soldier named Chakan.You can either pass dialogue skill checks (i.e. Persuasion or Presence), offer a bribe, or beat this dork to a pulp.When you're done, return to Katherine and tell her that the creep won't be bothering her anymore. Your help here nets a huge reputation boost, which is great if you want to romance Katherine later in the campaign. Part 2A: Meeting Musa and healing MyshekThe main objective here is to talk to Stephen Crow so you can join Sigismund's army. You're then introduced to the commander, Ditrich Katz. Katz wants you to find a lost charter that's supposed to be delivered by his soldiers, one of whom is actually being tended to by a foreign physician.So, who exactly is this Musa that you need to save in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2? Well, he's none other than an accomplished healer and scholar who's been everywhere in the known world, from the Iberia to the Holy Land and every place in between. Due to circumstances, Musa now serves King Sigismund. Meanwhile, the soldier that he's treating, Myshek, seems to be worse for wear.This is an optional task, but you can diagnose Myshek to learn about his condition. You then need to give him 1x Strong Cockerel. You can't find any of these bottles nearby, so you have to brew one on your own. We discuss the basic steps in our Alchemy guide, but here's the gist:Base: SpiritsGrind 2x Mint using the mortar and pestle, then put it in the cauldron.Boil for one turn.Add 1x Valerian.Boil for two turns.Hold the phial and interact with the still.Note: Completing the brewing process perfectly while using dried herbs isn't enough. You need to use fresh Mint and Valerian herbs if you want a better chance at getting Strong Cockerel. Part 2B: The lost charterIf you're able to give Strong Cockerel to Myshek, you'll rouse him from his coma and he'll tell you the exact location of his squad. If you give him regular or weak Cockerel, he'll die and you won't be able to hear more information from him.Either way, you have to travel to the mill in Old Lhota, which actually has its own fast travel point. It's just northwest of Maleshov, which you visited as part of Taking French Leave.Once there, a soldier will approach you. You can pass a skill check: Persuasion - \"Myshek told me about it (Lie).\" This lets you investigate the mill without worries. Alternatively, you can take out all of them.Regardless of your decision, enter the main building and climb up the ladder. The chest here contains the Lost Charter for King Sigismund quest item. Part 3A: The murder investigationReturn to Sigismund's Camp to continue the Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 The Lion's Den quest. The moment you talk to Katz, a cutscene will trigger, and that's followed by news that a veteran warrior named Chertan has been killed.Follow the trail of blood that leads you to a trough that you can investigate. Then, enter the medical tent to see the commotion. It looks like Musa has been accused of murdering Chertan.Note: At this point, you only have two in-game days to investigate all the clues and complete Musa's trial. After two days have passed, one of Sigismund's lawmen will arrive and the trial will proceed regardless of how you progressed. Part 3B: Musa under guardThe first order of business is to talk to Musa, who's being kept under watch in a tent next to the Alchemy bench. The guard here patrols the area back and forth. If he sees you, you can select certain replies:Domination: \"Katz sent me.\"Scholarship: I'm Musa's assistant.\"Drinking: \"Do you want to go for an ale?\"Domination: \"Get away from here, it's not safe!\"If you fail any of these skill checks, the guard will get annoyed. As such, it's better to wait for him to turn around, then stealthily crouch-walk toward Musa. He then tells you to investigate the corpse and acquire his Book of Poison. Part 3C: The Book of Poison - How to determine which poison was usedIf you want to save Musa in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, then it's important that you learn about the concoction that killed the victim. Examine the victim's body for any telltale signs. Then, open the nearby chest and grab The Book of Poison. Read it to find out about the different kinds of brews, as well as the symptoms and ingredients.BaneSymptoms: Black eyes, dry body, and loose muscles.Ingredients: Wine, Wormwood, Belladonna, and Fly Agaric.Pitohui Bird PoisonSymptoms: Tingling and tension in muscles; stiff body.Ingredients: Pitohui Bird Feather.Dollmaker PotionSymptoms: Numbness in body (especially the genitals), clogged intestines, and temporary blindness.Ingredients: Any strong liquor, Valerian, and Herb Paris. The decoction must be kept in cold temperatures.Kiss of DeathSymptoms: Stomachache, red and blistered skin, emptying of bowels, and broken nails.Ingredients: Arsenic, Oak Bark, Rose Water, and Red Copper; all boiled in a clay pot and tested on an iron nail.LullabySymptoms: Faintness and slurred speech; drowsiness and deep sleep.Ingredients: Oil, Thistle, Herb Paris, and Poppies. Part 3D: Finding the real culpritThe next part is very important, since you have to investigate the tents of your primary suspects: Lord Grozav, Stephen Crow, the two guards that discovered Chertan, and even Musa himself. Look for clues on their beds, chests, and other fixtures. One thing of note is that you can also sneak and steal from these NPCs. For instance, you can pickpocket a Strange Letter from Stephen Crow--it's a coded message that's tells of a devious scheme.As of the time of this writing, we're unable to confirm if the type of poison and the available evidence tend to differ among players. In our playthrough, we discovered the following:Chertan had reddish skin, broken nails, and empty bowels.Crow's tent contained Oak Bark, Rose Water, an iron nail for testing, and the aforementioned Strange Letter.There were several items in the other tents, but they were mostly inconsequential.Upon finding the necessary evidence, Henry remarked that Chertan was killed by the Kiss of Death poison, though he still expressed doubts. Part 4A: How to defend Musa at the trialYou can then talk to Katz to relay your findings. This leads to the Musa trial in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Here are a few tips from our campaign:If you keep responding out of turn or make accusations without any evidence, the lawman will grow tired of you. After three mistakes, Henry will be executed instead.When we handed Crow's Strange Letter, it was enough to paint him as the culprit.We also reloaded our save to present more evidence--i.e. \"You brewed a poison called Kiss of Death.\"It was also possible to accuse Grozav instead.Regardless of your choices, the person you accuse, assuming you have enough evidence, will be found guilty. They'll attempt to run away, but they'll get cut down for their troubles.Musa is safe, and he'll be glad for your help. He also becomes a master-level trainer who can teach you Alchemy, Scholarship, and Survival, each costing a whopping 5,000 Groschen. Part 4B: The ambushAfter Musa's trial is over, talk to Katherine to tell her that your group should proceed according to plan. Speak with Katz to trigger a cutscene where Sigismund's forces are ambushed. Eliminate the remaining hostiles and decide what to do with Katz. (We decided to spare him in our playthrough.)That does it for our guide on how to save Musa in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. We hope our tips help you make the right choices during The Lion's Den quest.If you need more tips as you explore Bohemia in the Middle Ages, be sure to visit our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 guides hub.",

    "description": "Roguelike deckbuilders need to do something pretty special to stand out nowadays, what with the Slay The Spileup of bangers over the past few years. Cobalt Core, Wildfrost, Samurai Showdown (if you squint). All excellent, but Diceomancer stands out above even those, thanks to a clever gimmick and a hefty dose of chutzpah. It’s there in the strapline, you know the deal, but to emphasise: you can reroll ANY number on your screen. Your health, enemy health, attacks, blocks, buffs, mana, gold - all fair game. The numbers in encounters. On Relics. Have at ‘em! Heck, and that’s before you start scribbling in the rulebook. Read more",

    "description": "After years of making a live service Suicide Squad game that was roundly panned on arrival, the studio behind Batman: Arkham Asylum and its sequels are \"looking to return to Batman for a single-player game\", according to a report by Bloomberg. Rocksteady Studios haven't said so publically, and Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier claims \"the new project is years away from landing\", so this is in no way official. But the possibility might come as a ray of hope to fans of the studio's open world Batman games. Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What would you rather do on a rainy day: go to the movies with a friend, cozy up at home with a good book and a cup of tea, or go on an adventurous and fun (and very wet) hike? Right now movies with a friend sounds like it would be fun! Of course we’d have to have all the snacks – popcorn, M\u0026Ms and bubbly water. 2. What game show would you absolutely dominate: Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy or The Price Is Right? I’d have the best chances at The Price Is Right. Can’t say I’d dominate it, though. Hahaha! 3. Do you wear more makeup now or less makeup than you did a year ago? I wear a little less these days, but that’s mostly[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 867 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "It has rained for almost a week! I’m getting kinda over it, but Tabs sure would have loved it. That cat LOVED the rain. His favorite thing about it? Rainbows. 🌈 Mind you, I also like the rain. But Tabs didn’t just like the rain. He loved it! I think what he liked about it was all the movement. My theory is that with his heightened cat senses, he could actually track the falling of individual raindrops. Rosie, however, is not a big fan of rain. In fact, she doesn’t particularly enjoy anything about it. Scratch that — I’m mistaken. There is one thing about rain she agrees with Tabs on. Rainbows are fantastic! 🌈😺 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 849 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
