    "description": "Earlier this month, Digital Foundry had the opportunity to go hands-on with PlayStation 5 Pro at Sony's London office, walking away with high quality capture from The Last of Us Part 2 and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart. You've already seen our analysis pieces on how each of those games compares on Pro against the standard model, along with a breakdown of PSSR upscaling quality up against DLSS and FSR. However, one piece of feedback we received loud and clear was the demand just to see more of the games running, without any of our customary head-to-head comparisons. Read more",

At Digital Foundry, we're excited to see this kind of technology reach into the console space and so as part of our recent exclusive PS5 Pro capture opportunity, we spent some time using PS5 Pro and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart to grab a series of reconstruction-based shots that we know from prior experience truly puts reconstruction technologies through their paces.
