    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Butter on your toast – yes or no? Yes please! And if it’s Kerrygold Salted Butter, then woo hoo. 2. Your two favorite seasons? Fall and spring. 3. Pick your red lipstick for the day – what’s the name? Rouge Dior 999. 4. A Thanksgiving dish you don’t like? Soggy gray green bean casserole. 5. A color that makes you happy? Yellow (hence the picture of the butter at the top, ha). Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon. 1. Butter on your toast – yes or no? 2.

Take, for instance, last summer’s crisis over her favorite treats, the aptly named Temptations, in tasty chicken flavor. She wanted more of them than I could provide. To be honest, she wanted them all — all of the Tasty Chicken Temptations nationwide.
