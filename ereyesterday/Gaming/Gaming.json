    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which is the hardest to do: engage in small talk with strangers, ask for directions, paint your toe nails or cook a meal without a recipe? For the life of me, I can’t make most meals without having a recipe to follow. I’m not one of those people who can cook from the heart and throw ingredients together with abandon. I need precise measurements (because one person’s pinch of salt might mean something completely different to someone else) and guidelines, otherwise I’ll short circuit. 2. Do you wanna go dancing at the pink pony club? Sure, why not? I’m gonna keep on daaaaaan-cing… 3. What language would you like to be fluent in: French, Cantonese, Arabic or sign language? All of them. LOL! I think sign language[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 872 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Yup, the boss lady wants us to tighten our belts around here. It looks like the economy is slowing down a bit, so no more Tuesday all-you-can-eat turkey or free five-egg omelets in the cafeteria. She wants everyone in the company to cut back, and that includes Rosie and Marnie. Starting immediately, there will be no more kibble showers! The leadership committee is hard at work identifying opportunities for process improvement… Rosie and CHO (Chief Hugging Officer) Whiskers are upping the napping quota by a staggering 15%! That means more hugs for everyone! Or else!!! It’s gonna be rough for a while. Hopefully things turn around soon. I have faith in Rosie’s leadership ability. And where many leaders lack empathy, she really goes out of her way to show she cares about people. It’s very motivating! Marnie is totally fired up about it. I sure wish Tabs were still around because he was so good at business. He would have known how to navigate a downturn better than anyone. 😊 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict,[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 855 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
