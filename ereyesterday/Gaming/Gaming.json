The mode allows you to create your own player and ascend the ranks of Major League Baseball to eventually reach the big leagues and make a true name for yourself. There are plenty of different factors that go into making it to the Show, and your player's batting stance can be one of them.While it might not sound like a major factor, some players die on the hill that your batting stance can make a huge difference at the plate. Whether it's due to timing, the look of the swing, or the starting position of the bat, a particular batting stance can be considered \"better\" than others.To help you narrow down your choices from the hundreds of batting stances in MLB The Show 25, we've listed our top seven stances and why you should use them.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What eye makeup products have been on repeat with you lately? Maybelline Lash Sensational Sky High Mascara (eh, it’s just OK), Stila Liquid Liner Micro Tip (it’s pretty good) and good ol’ Anastasia Brow Pencil. 2. How good are you about finding clothes that fit you well? I used to be OK at it, but now, I don’t really enjoy in-person shopping as much as I used to, so I don’t spend the time that one really needs to find the things that fit great. There’s always something a little off with my clothes and I just kinda live with it. Blergh! On the bright side, at least my outfit is always ironed and somewhat matching. 3. How good are you about resisting impulse purchases?

    "description": "Tabs was a natural born optimist. He always saw the up side to everything, sought out the silver linings and took advantage of every opportunity to spread hope and joy. That might be why he liked holidays so much — because they were an opportunity to play Santa “Claws,” so to speak, and spread good tidings to everyone. Perhaps for the obvious reasons, St. Patrick’s Day was a fave. Obviously, with those gorgeous green eyes, he loved the color scheme. ☘️ And then, of course, the gold… He was also a big fan of that. 😊 Rosie has her own reasons for celebrating St. Paddy’s Day. For starter’s, alchemy… In fact, she did her PhD dissertation in turning lead into gold through targeted meows in the ultra-low frequency range, the so-called “smoker’s meow” spectrum. Marnie, however, did not get the memo regarding St. Patrick’s Day this year. Or rather, she did get the memo, but she didn’t read it.
