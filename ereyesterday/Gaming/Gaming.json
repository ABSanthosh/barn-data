No seriously, I full-on rolled down a hill. We live in a neighborhood with tons of oak trees that produce these gigantic acorns, and as I was walking Connor down the hill to school I guess I wasn’t really paying attention to where my feet were landing, so when I stepped on an acorn, which basically was like a massive marble, my right ankle rolled underneath me. That set off a chain reaction of me falling to the ground, and right as I hit the pavement, I reflexively tucked into a round ball, which then caused me to tumble down the steep hill even more as I clung onto Connor’s little pink backpack with dear life!

While I'm throwing my weight around, let me also instantly rebut the pedants who are even now racing to leave a comment saying that, actually, Remedy did work on Smilegate's multiplayer shooter CrossfireX.
