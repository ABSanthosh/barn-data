The massive modding project that’s remaking The Elder Scrolls 4 in Skyrim’s engine has been in the works for over a decade. Having not had their hard work torpedoed by Bethesda and Virtuos’ own Oblivion remaster, its team are currently grafting hard to ensure they’re ready when the time comes to pull the release trigger. With the mod now confirmed by GOG to be arriving on the PC storefront in 2025, assuming it makes its current release goal, I reached out to Skyblivion project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel and GOG themselves. We chatted about what went into the decision for the same PC storefront that hosted Fallout: London’s release last year to handle this Oblivion-remaking Skyrim mod, and where progress is at on the road to release.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What time do you usually wake up in the morning? These days, 6 in the morning. Ideally my day would start off at 5:30, though. 2. How organized is your purse? It’s on the verge of haphazard, always, LOL! I mean, I can find the usual things I absolutely need – my phone, wallet, keys, medication, lipgloss. But do I find those things in an efficient manner? No. 3. If you could make one rule that everyone around you had to follow, what would it be? Make your deadlines. I can’t stand it when people are casual about due dates! 4. How do you feel about wearing makeup when it’s hot? I’ll do it, but I don’t like to do too many layers. I’m happy with cream[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 881 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Tabs always said that in kitty modeling, the best defense is a good offense. If you just rest on your laurels, sooner or later a hungrier up-and-coming cat (or Australian Shepherd) will take what’s yours, and you won’t be walking the catwalk at feline fashion week anymore. Nope, if you’re lucky, you’ll get a page in the Petco catalog. Every once in a while Tabs went into kitty ninja mode, and instead of just patrolling the neighborhood, he conducted more advanced cat recon… He’d inspect the houses on the circle more closely to look for signs of canine or feline incursion. One day, he picked up a new cat’s scent around an air conditioning filter a couple houses down. He sniffed the area for a long time, gathering intelligence, and then used the data to compile a cat profile. According to Tabs, the new cat was a three-year-old male tabby with green eyes and a crooked tail… Moderate kitty modeling potential. Of course, he was added to the database. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict,[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 863 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
