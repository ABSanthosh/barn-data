    "description": "Logos: The World of Final Fantasy XVI $39.80 (was $45) | Releases March 31, 2026 Preorder at Amazon Every mainline Final Fantasy game introduces its own lore and cast of characters to the franchise, and Final Fantasy XVI is no exception. Set in Valisthea, a world of magic, cruel gods, and powerful Eikons, Final Fantasy XVI features one of the most mature and gritty settings of the mainline series--but still offers the expansive worldbuilding and fantastical themes the series is known for, along with unique interpretations of Final Fantasy staples like Moogles, Chocobos, crystals, and more. If you want to learn more about Valisthea, you can revisit Final Fantasy XVI's setting with the upcoming Logos: The World of Final Fantasy XVI. As the title implies, this hardcover book will offer a deeper look at Final Fantasy XVI's many kingdoms, factions, and characters when it launches on March 31, 2026. Preorders are discounted to $39.80 (normally $45) at Amazon. Logos: The World of Final Fantasy XVI $39.80 (was $45) | Releases March 31, 2026 Logos: The World of Final Fantasy XVI is a massive 368-page hardcover book, explores everything from history to geography, music to cooking, and much more. Rather than simply being an encyclopedia cataloging the world of Valisthea, the book is written from the perspective of Valisthean scholar Harpocrates II Hyperboreos--a character you'll encounter frequently in Final Fantasy XVI--with numerous in-world journal entries, letters, and character conversations presented in illustrated full-color pages. Many of the entries are even penned by Final Fantasy XVI voice actors Ben Starr (Clive), Stewart Clarke (Dion), and Christopher York (Gav). Preorder at Amazon If you're looking to build your own Final Fantasy library, you can pair Logos: The World of Final Fantasy XVI with the The Art of Final Fantasy XVI. Published last year, the massive hardcover art book offers hundreds of pages of concept art, illustrations, and behind-the-scenes development materials for the game. The book is currently on sale for just $22, a nice 45% discount compared to its normal $40 price. There's also the Final Fantasy XVI Poster Art Collection book, which collects 33 posters featuring illustrations from the games, including pieces of the main characters, the Eikon summons, and more. Normally $35, it's on sale for $20.44.Of course, the best way to experience Final Fantasy XVI's world first-hand is with the games itself. If you're on PS5, you can grab it for $24.88 (was $40) at Amazon, while PC players can get it for $50 on GMG. While this gets you the base game--which will take you through the main story featuring Clive's struggle to free the world of Valisthea from the control of the giant, magical Mothercrystals--Final Fantasy XVI has also received two paid DLC expansions, Echoes of the Fallen and The Rising Tide, that add additional side stories that flesh out the world with new characters, dungeons, side-quests, and unlockable abilities for Clive to master. These are available as separate purchases on PS5 via the PlayStation Store, while PC players can purchase the $70 Complete Edition, which includes the base game, both DLC chapters, and a few extra in-game items.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What time of the day are you at your best? From 5:30 until about 11 in the morning. Everything is downhill after lunch, which is when I turn into Sleepy Spice, hahaha! I don’t know when it happened, but somewhere along the way in the last 10 years, I became a morning person. 2. Things you like in your smoothie? Greek yogurt, vanilla protein powder, raspberries (for fiber!) are my favorites. I also like bananas or apples for sweetness. 3. Something about your current makeup routine that bugs you? Ugh, the concealer I’ve been using from MAC just doesn’t seal well after I use it. Bits and bobs of it end up all over the place. It’s super messy and it bothers me. 4.

To quickly recap, Stop Killing Games aim to stop publishers rendering online games unplayable after the cessation of official support. They were inspired to take action by Ubisoft themselves 'sunsetting' online racer The Crew. Ubisoft's response to their campaign comes around the time the group's petition to the EU to take action against the mass extinction of online games hits 1.4 million signatures. Despite some doubts about potential signature spoofing, the petition's recently attracted support from EU politicians and industry trade bodies, so it's no surprise Guillemot's fielding questions about it from moneyfolk.
