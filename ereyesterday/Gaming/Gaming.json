    "description": "Walmart+ 1-Year Membership $49 (was $98) Sign up for Walmart+ Walmart's biggest sale of the year (so far) kicks off alongside Amazon Prime Day on July 8. While you don't need a Walmart+ subscription to shop the discounts during Walmart's sale, members get five-hour early access starting July 7 at 4 PM PT / 7 PM ET. Ahead of the sale, Walmart is offering a 50% discount on a full year of Walmart+, dropping the price to only $49 (was $98). Walmart+ 1-Year Membership $49 (was $98) Considering some of the best gaming, tech, and collectible deals routinely sell out during the early access portion of Walmart sales--or within minutes of the official start time--the membership can make it a lot easier to secure the deals you're eyeing. Outside of being able to shop Walmart Deals 2025 five hours early, a Walmart+ membership has proven useful for restock events on popular products. In recent weeks, this has included the Nintendo Switch 2 and Pokemon Trading Card Game releases.But there are other, year-round benefits that make Walmart+ a great subscription service. Here are the highlights:Free shipping on all online ordersFree delivery from local stores ($35 minimum)1-Year Paramount+ Essential membership ($60 value)Save 10 cents per gallon on fuelEarly access to big sales and product restocks Sign up for Walmart+ The free shipping on online orders is similar to Amazon Prime. Orders are typically delivered within two days, though one- and even same-day delivery are regular occurrences.The free delivery from local stores perk is an even larger benefit, depending on your proximity to a brick-and-mortar store. Many subscribers can get their entire grocery orders delivered. But even if your Walmart doesn't have a full supermarket, it's still nice to be able to get free delivery on random products you'd normally have to drive to the store to buy. Local delivery is often fulfilled the same day you place your order, and you can schedule the time slot when making your purchase.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Kindle Scribe Essentials Bundle with Premium Pen Save up to $220 See at Amazon Kindle Scribe with Premium Pen Save $140 | Additional 20% off with eligible trade-in See at Amazon A bunch of Amazon devices are already discounted to official Prime Day 2025 prices, including the priciest electronic reader in the ubiquitous Kindle lineup. The newest Kindle Scribe has received a massive $140 price cut, dropping the hybrid ereader and journaling e-ink tablet to its best price since launching last December. But you can save even more--up to $220 total--by opting for the Kindle Scribe Essentials Bundle.New Kindle users will almost certainly want to go with the bundle, but if you're upgrading to a new Kindle, you might want to skip the bundle due to a trade-in deal outlined below. The Kindle Scribe deals are exclusive to Prime members.See all Kindle Scribe Prime Day DealsBrowse Prime Day Kindle Book Sale Kindle Scribe Essentials Bundle with Premium Pen Save up to $220 The Kindle Scribe Essentials Bundle comes with Amazon's Premium Pen ($80 value), the official Fabric Folio Cover ($60 value), and a 9W power adapter for Amazon devices ($20 value). You can choose between Black, Denim, and Rose colors for the cover, while the tablet itself is Tungsten. The cover protects the screen and includes a built-in stand with multiple viewing angles.All three storage configurations are eligible for the Prime Day deal: 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB. Each tier is separated by only $15-$25, so if you plan on using your Kindle Scribe to store and listen to audiobooks via Audible, you may want to opt for 32GB or 64GB model.16GB Kindle Scribe Essentials Bundle -- $270 ($480)32GB Kindle Scribe Essentials Bundle -- $285 ($500)64GB Kindle Scribe Essentials Bundle -- $310 ($530)The Kindle Scribe has a 10.2-inch front-lit display with anti-glare coating, so you can read in any lighting setting. With 300ppi (pixels per inch) and 94 nits of brightness, text is crisp and clear.The Scribe doubles as a physical notebook. With the Premium Pen, you can create handwritten notes and email them to other devices. It feels remarkably similar to writing on actual paper. You can also take notes in books and documents you're reading. If you like writing in the margins of novels, the Scribe is the ereader for you. See at Amazon Kindle Scribe with Premium Pen Save $140 | Additional 20% off with eligible trade-in 16GB Kindle Scribe -- $260 ($400)32GB Kindle Scribe -- $280 ($420)64GB Kindle Scribe -- $310 ($450)At first glance, it doesn't make much sense to purchase the non-bundle version of the Kindle Scribe during Prime Day. The 16GB model is only $10 less than the bundle version; the 32GB model is $5 less; and the 64GB edition is actually the same price. So why would you willingly give up the $60 Fabric Folio and $20 AC adapter?You probably shouldn't unless you have a device that's eligible to trade in toward the new Scribe. The non-bundle version is eligible for an additional 20% discount when you trade in a device. Your old Kindle is the obvious choice, but Amazon also accepts other devices, including Fire tablets, Fire TV Sticks, and even some Apple products.With a trade-in, you'll get the value of that device and an additional 20% discount on your new purchase. That's a substantial savings. Trade-in values vary considerably, but the extra 20% is worth $52 to $62--and that's automatic. Here are the new prices, not including your trade-in.16GB -- $20832GB -- $22464GB -- $248It doesn't matter if you trade in a Fire Stick worth $3 or the original Kindle Scribe 16GB model for $85. But it is worth noting that if you own the original 2022 Scribe and want to upgrade, that $85 figure is what Amazon offered me, effectively lowering the price of the 2024 model to $123.

Now, you can crap on their efforts by slapping together rad illuminated pages in seconds in a video game editor.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you have a favorite vegetable? Yes! Carrots, for sure. The fact that you can turn them into a cake is a big deal! I mean, come on, have you ever heard of a broccoli cake? Or an okra cake? Yeah, I didn’t think so, LOL! I also love that you can put them in salads, roast them or just eat them plain with a variety of different dips. 2. A song that’s been stuck in your head lately? “Top of the World” by The Carpenters has been on repeat in my car. 3. Something you’ve been avoiding lately? Social media and the news cycle in general. 4. Lip masks: yes or no? Yes, but only if we’re talking Laneige. 5.

    "description": "This time of year, Tabs was always pretty stoked about showing off his summer bod, which as you know, was curvy, Rubenesque and voluptuous. With this being the official weekend of the summer solstice, this morning I asked Rosie if she had any big plans for summer, and she just stared at me blankly and meowed something under her breath that sounded like “science waits for no one.” I took that as a “no.” 😂 Marnie’s sure been enjoying these longer summer days. In fact, she insists on waking me up at the crack of dawn so that she can go running with me, and by running I mean sprinting circles around me as I shuffle along… I believe she thinks that I am her sheep. 🐑 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 865 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
