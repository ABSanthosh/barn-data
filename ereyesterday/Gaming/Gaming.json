    "description": "Released in late 2023, Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume 1 was a promising but ultimately frustrating, buggy, and visually lacklustre effort from Konami. However, the good news is that improvements have been made, with version 2.0 taking aim at several key issues on console and PC. It's a relief to see, because it's a project worth salvaging - being an all-in-one package containing seven core games in the series, with some beautifully presented extras. Today, I'm focusing on the Metal Gear Solid trilogy - the more demanding full 3D entries that first released on PlayStation 1 and 2 - since that's really where the bulk of the problems arose in this collection. So just what has changed, and is the Master Collection now the definitive way to play? Read more",

    "description": "It's fitting that the new trailer for The Last of Us Season 2 begins with Joel and Ellie at a physical distance, because there's an emotional gulf between them by the final scene shown. The upcoming season starts five years after Season 1, and Ellie doesn't know what Joel did to save her yet. Once she finds out, things are never going to be the same between them.The latest trailer is light on context if you've never played The Last of Us Part II. But Joel and Ellie found some relative peace in the intervening years. That's coming to an end because their sanctuary isn't as safe as they believed, as both the infected and outside forces are in play. That includes the newly introduced Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), who will play a major role this season. The trailer also features an early look at Joe Pantoliano as Eugene, a character who was only hinted at in the game. The Last of Us Season 2 panel is currently underway at SXSW, and it's being live-streamed on YouTube. Series stars Pedro Pascal, Bella Ramsey, and Gabriel Luna are on hand with Season 2 newcomers Young Mazino, Isabela Merced, and Kaitlyn Dever. Showrunners and series co-creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann also joined the panel as they unveiled the new trailer for Season 2. You can watch the panel below.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The original Dreamcast controller was a revolutionary device when the console launched in the late '90s, but in 2025, it might feel dated for retro gaming fans. Luckily, the Retro Fighters D6 wireless controller just launched, which aims to give Dreamcast fans a more modernized gamepad. It's also compatible with the Dreamcast, Nintendo Switch, and PC, making it a great device for playing on original hardware or playing ports of Dreamcast games, such as the upcoming inclusions of Power Stone 1 and 2 in the Capcom Fighting Collection 2 launching later this year. Retro Fighters D6 Dreamcast wireless controller $55 Available in both black and white models, the Retro Fighters D6 Dreamcast wireless controller features a six-button design and a D-pad with dedicated Kailh micro-switches. There are also two customizable modes for the C and Z buttons, including a classic Dreamcast mode. It also uses 2.4 Ghz wireless technology via a dongle that can be inserted into a Dreamcast or other compatible devices. This makes it well-suited for fighting games on the Dreamcast, like Street Fighter Alpha 3, Soul Calibur, and Marvel vs Capcom 2. The Retro Fighters D6 Dreamcast wireless controller also works on PC and Nintendo Switch. See at Amazon (Black) See at Amazon (White) If you're looking for other modern-style gamepads that are great for playing older video games, the upcoming 8Bitdo 64 Bluetooth controller is worth checking out. The wireless controller is geared toward people who are planning to pick up the new Nintendo 64 FPGA console, the Analogue 3D, but it will also be compatible with PC, Switch, and Android devices. The controller features a similar layout as the original N64 controller but with several improvements, including anti-drift Hall Effect sticks, a more modern ergonomic design, wireless Bluetooth connectivity, and support for 8BitDo's desktop app that lets you customize button layouts and more.The 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth controller is scheduled to launch for $40 on June 30 and will be available in black and white models. However, it's likely that the launch date could change, considering the Analogue 3D console was recently delayed. Nevertheless, you can preorder both models at Amazon.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

I’m not sure any have managed it, but I’m always glad to see fresh blood spilled in the house of Westwood. Which brings us to Project Citadel, a new space-me-do from Last Keep, a studio founded by former staff of Stranger Things devs BonusXP and Age Of Empires outfit Ensemble. It pitches you against an alien empire, and blends squad mechanics redolent of Halo Wars with a roguelike format that aims to support shorter play sessions, while still supposedly allowing for vintage strategy gambits like booming and rushing.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which would you rather collect: vintage clothes or vintage furniture? I could do both, but if I could only pick one, I’d have to go with vintage clothes, mostly because I don’t have a big enough house to collect furniture pieces. Sigh! Oh, and also, I don’t want to worry about my furniture being beat up by the pets and the kids playing in my house, you know? 2. How good are you with keeping secrets? If you tell me something in confidence, it’s going to the grave with me, babe; however, I do have an exception policy. If I believe someone’s in danger, then I’m gonna say something. 3. Who’s the coolest Jennifer: Jennifer Hudson, Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Garner or Jennifer Coolidge? Jennifer Coolidge, all the[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 869 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "That little girl in the picture above turned nine years old today. Yup, today is Connor Claire’s ninth birthday! Wow. I remember that day up there like it was yesterday. Poor Tabs… He was slightly confused about the overall gist of the festivities. I think he thought it was a get-together to celebrate him. We didn’t want to burst his bubble, so we took a brief interlude to sing him the birthday song. “Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear tabby… Happy birthday to you!” 🙂 Connor Claire didn’t mind, and there was more than enough food, fun and love for everyone. It was kind of weird, but for the most part, Tabs wasn’t as social as he usually is. He spent most of the afternoon napping at the top of the stairs, away from the party. I checked in on him from time to time and gave him chin scratches and whispered that I love him.
