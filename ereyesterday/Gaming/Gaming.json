    "description": "Halloween is close than you think, making now a great time to prep for spooky season by picking up this new compilation featuring two horror stories by Stephen Graham Jones. Graham Jones is a big name in the world of horror novels, winning numerous writing awards like the Ray Bradbury Award and the Bram Stoker Award. If you're seeking an introduction to his work, the new Saga Doubles two-novel compilation featuring The Killer on the Road and The Babysitter Lives is a solid place to start. Not only does it include two of Graham's stories in one, but you can also grab the book at a slight discount for $18.59 at Amazon (normally $20). Saga Doubles: Killer on the Road \u0026 The Babysitter Lives $18.59 (was $20) Combining two novels into one, the 480-page paperback double pack features full versions of Graham's books Killer on the Road and The Babysitter Lives. If you're unfamiliar with these book, The Baby Sitter Lives is a haunted house tale while Killer on the Road is a thriller that follows a high-school student targeted by a serial killer. Along with both books, this Saga Doubles edition sports unique dual-sided binding with new cover art for both books. See at Amazon On the fence? A short sample of the book is available on Amazon, giving you a chance to read through a few pages before making a purchase. Graham Jones' unique writing style is bound to appeal to most readers--but be sure to give the digital sample a look if you're not quite sure you want to add it to your shelf.This double-pack is part of a new series of compilations from Saga Press, which pull together two books into a single package. There are several other compilations joining the Saga Doubles line soon, including Saga Doubles: Red Star Hustle + Apprehension that includes crime stories from award-winning authors Sam J. Miller and Mary Robinette Kowal. It releases for $20 on October 21.

    "description": "Epic Games apparently removed passive XP gains from Fortnite's main Battle Royale and Zero Build modes on Thursday afternoon, in the midst of its Summer Road Trip event that will award a free Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 car body for gaining XP to complete a series of daily quests. Playing Battle Royale had awarded 550 XP per minute, or a little less than half a level per hour, just for existing in the game mode--but that's no longer the case.While this certainly is a bit of a nerf, it's actually not typical for Battle Royale and Zero Build to give passive XP. In fact, passive XP was only just added to those modes at the beginning of the current season--before then, we lived without it. The change had made leveling the battle pass this season meaningfully faster.Assuming the change will stick for a while, there are two fairly obvious potential reasons for the change. The Summer Road Trip event is one of them, since its quests simply require gaining XP to complete. You only need to gain eight total levels across these quests, so the lack of passive XP in BR probably won't slow anyone down very much. Another possibility is that we're approaching the end of Chapter 6 Season 4, and this change will make it a little tougher for folks who are just now getting started on the battle pass to catch up before the season ends on August 7.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What time of the day are you at your best? From 5:30 until about 11 in the morning. Everything is downhill after lunch, which is when I turn into Sleepy Spice, hahaha! I don’t know when it happened, but somewhere along the way in the last 10 years, I became a morning person. 2. Things you like in your smoothie? Greek yogurt, vanilla protein powder, raspberries (for fiber!) are my favorites. I also like bananas or apples for sweetness. 3. Something about your current makeup routine that bugs you? Ugh, the concealer I’ve been using from MAC just doesn’t seal well after I use it. Bits and bobs of it end up all over the place. It’s super messy and it bothers me. 4.
