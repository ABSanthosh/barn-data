    "description": "Clown in a Cornfield 4K Steelbook Edition $40 | Release Date: TBA Preorder at Amazon Clown in a Cornfield Blu-ray $26 | Release Date: TBA Preorder Blu-ray at Amazon Preorder DVD at Amazon Released in theaters on May 9, Clown in a Cornfield was a big success for IFC. Grossing nearly $4 million, it set an opening weekend record for the production company, surpassing its previous horror hit, Late Night with the Devil. Despite the niche success, there’s a good chance horror fans missed out on the slasher flick's short theatrical run. Luckily, for those who missed out and fans who want to revisit the movie, preorders are now open for the upcoming Clown in a Cornfield Blu-ray release. Several different formats are up for grabs, including a premium 4K Steelbook Edition Blu-ray--though we’re still waiting on a firm release date. Nevertheless, preordering now locks you in for Amazon's preorder price guarantee, and you won't be charged until your order ships. Clown in a Cornfield 4K Steelbook Edition $40 | Release Date: TBA We’re still waiting for specific details, but we do know that the Clown in a Cornfield 4K Steelbook includes both 4K Blu-ray and standard Blu-ray formats of the film. You’ll also get a few sheets of magnets, featuring Fredo the clown and a bunch of accessories. The main attraction, however, is the steelbook case featuring creepy wrap-around artwork. No bonus materials have been confirmed, but we expect it will likely include the same extra content as the standard Blu-ray that is also available for preorder. Preorder at Amazon Clown in a Cornfield Blu-ray $26 | Release Date: TBA The standard Blu-ray version of the film is quite a bit cheaper than the 4K Steelbook Edition. It also doesn't have a firm release date, we do know it’ll come with a nice bonus feature--commentary from director Eli Craig, author Adam Cesare, and actors Carson MacCormac and Katie Douglas. It's also worth noting that a DVD edition is available for $23 as well, in case you're looking for the most affordable way to own the horror flick on disc. Preorder Blu-ray at Amazon Preorder DVD at Amazon Clown in a Cornfield 4K SteelbookThe Clown in a Cornfield film is based on a series of novels by the same name by Adam Cesare. Most of these are discounted right now, and you’ll find both paperbacks and hardcovers for most of the books. The storyline is chronological, so be sure to start with the original book, Clown in a Cornfield, before moving on to Frendo Lives and The Church of Frendo. A fourth novel is also in the works, making this a good time to catch up on the series.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Rosie should have known better than to trust Marnie with Rosie’s investments. After all, Marnie doesn’t have any background or credentials or expertise in financial planning. There was no reason to think Marnie would be able to manage Rosie’s assets, but Rosie wanted to give her a chance. Oh, well. Bad move on Rosie’s part. Even someone of Rosie’s intellectual stature screws up sometimes. Sure, she may understand quantum physics better than any other cat on the planet, but that doesn’t mean she understands compound interest. Sigh… Now Rosie has to think of a way of to recoup all those losses. Hmm… What could she invent? I’m sure she’ll think of something. 🐱 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 866 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you keep backups of your favorite products? These days, the only backups I buy are things I know I’ll finish on a regular basis (like shampoo and conditioner, or body lotion). I don’t even bother with makeup backups anymore, though. If I finish something like a blush or an eyebrow pencil, great, and if it’s still around when it’s time to restock, that’s even better.
