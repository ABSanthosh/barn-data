    "description": "Amazon has a bunch of stellar storage device deals for Black Friday, including steep discounts on high-capacity SanDisk microSD cards. Most notably, you can get the SanDisk Ultra 1.5TB microSD card for $89 (was $150). This is a great option for those looking to expand the storage capacity of their Steam Deck. Amazon also has its first-ever discount on the newly released SanDisk 2TB Extreme microSD card. And Nintendo Switch owners who love Pokemon enough to pay a slight premium for a microSD card with Snorlax's face on it can get a Black Friday discount on an officially licensed 1TB SanDisk microSD card.Quick look: Best Black Friday microSD Card DealsSanDisk Ultra 1.5TB microSD (150MB/s) -- $89 ($150)SanDisk Extreme 2TB microSD (190MB/s) -- $180 ($210)SanDisk Gameplay 1TB microSD (190MB/s) -- $90 ($125)SanDisk 1TB microSD - The Legend of Zelda Edition (100MB/s) -- $85 ($150)SanDisk 1TB microSD - Pokemon, Snorlax Edition (100MB/s) -- $90 ($150)Samsung Pro Plus 1TB microSD (180MB/s) -- $90 ($120)TeamGroup A2 Pro Plus 1TB microSD (160MB/s) -- $58 ($75)Lexar Play 1TB microSD (160MB/s) -- $66 ($130)Cards from other major brands, including Samsung, are also discounted for Black Friday. The high-end Samsung Pro Plus 1TB microSD is on sale for $90, and the 512GB model is only $40. For a budget-friendly high-capacity card, check out the Lexar Play 1TB for $66 or TeamGroup A2 Pro Plus for $60. SanDisk Ultra 1.5TB microSD Card $89 (was $150) The SanDisk Ultra works without a hitch on Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch, and it's also one of the most reliable and popular microSD cards around. It's graded for speeds of up to 150MB/s, which is faster than the officially licensed Nintendo microSDs by SanDisk and plenty fast enough for PC games installed to it on your Steam Deck. See at Amazon See at Best Buy SanDisk Extreme 2TB microSD Card $180 (was $210) Up until very recently, the 1.5TB card was the largest SanDisk offered, but now there's a 2TB SanDisk Extreme, and it's also on sale for Black Friday. Listed for $210, the SanDisk Extreme 2TB is discounted to $180 at Amazon. This is the first price cut for the newly released card. The Extreme offers up to 190MB/s transfer speeds.If you want the faster speeds but don't want to spend $180, the 1TB SanDisk Extreme is on sale for $80. See at Amazon See at Amazon (1TB) SanDisk Gameplay 1TB microSD Card for Handheld Gaming $90 (was $125) There's also the SanDisk Gameplay microSD, which was designed specifically for handheld gaming on Steam Deck, Nintendo Switch, and other devices. In terms of specs, the Gameplay is in the same class and offers the same 190MB/s speeds as the SanDisk Extreme. While we haven't compared performance between the two, we suspect they are identical. The SanDisk Gameplay does look snazzy, though. The 1TB model is on sale for $90 at Amazon for Black Friday. See at Amazon Pokemon-themed SanDisk 1TB microSD Card $90 (was $150) SanDisk has a range of officially licensed microSD cards imprinted with characters and emblems from popular Nintendo franchises. One of the newest additions to that lineup is this 1TB Pokemon-themed card, which appropriately features Snorlax.All of the Nintendo-themed cards carry higher prices than the regular SanDisk cards. You're saving over $50 off this card's launch price, but you're essentially paying the same price for 1TB as you would for 1.5TB. This card has a read speed of up to 100MB/s, so it's not as fast as the Ultra either. On Nintendo Switch this won't make a difference, but if for some reason you want a Pokemon-themed microSD for your Steam Deck, the drop in speed is worth keeping in mind. See at Amazon See at Best Buy Zelda-themed SanDisk 1TB microSD Card $85 (was $150) Amazon is also offering a big discount on the 1TB SanDisk card featuring the Royal Crest from The Legend of Zelda. In terms of performance, the Zelda-themed microSD card is identical to the Snorlax model, but it's on sale for only $85. See at Amazon Black Friday microSD Card Deals for Steam Deck \u0026 Nintendo SwitchWe rounded up all of the best early Black Friday microSD card deals below. Smaller capacity SanDisk cards are available for discounts as well, including the 512GB Ultra for $32. You can also save on Samsung's highly rated Pro Plus microSD cards, which offer read speeds of to 180MB/s. The 1TB Samsung Pro Plus is on sale for $90, while the 512GB is up for grabs for only $40.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Butter on your toast – yes or no? Yes please! And if it’s Kerrygold Salted Butter, then woo hoo. 2. Your two favorite seasons? Fall and spring. 3. Pick your red lipstick for the day – what’s the name? Rouge Dior 999. 4. A Thanksgiving dish you don’t like? Soggy gray green bean casserole. 5. A color that makes you happy? Yellow (hence the picture of the butter at the top, ha). Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment. Talk to ya soon. 1. Butter on your toast – yes or no? 2.
