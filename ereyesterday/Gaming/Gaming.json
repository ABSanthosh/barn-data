    "description": "Hey, hey Saturday! I’m still around, and I’m still alive, and I’m still wearing Candy Yum Yum lipstick by MAC! I found it last week while I was rooting around inside a makeup drawer and decided that even though it’s fall, hot pink is still wildly appropriate for the season, ha ha ha! I’m just realizing right now that I’ve yet to wear any dark, rich and cozy wine, burgundy, brown, garnet or red fall lip colors, hmm. In fact, my lipstick game has been pretty MIA for a while now. Still, I gotta give props to myself and to all the makeup lovers out there who are doing a decent job filling in brows, curling lashes and basically doing the bare minimum to look somewhat undead. LOL! It’s funny to me that I haven’t really been wearing anything on my lips because lipstick and gloss are usually my favorite part of the makeup process. Lately, I’ll paint on some base and blush and whatever else I have time for in the mornings, and by[Continue reading...] The post Life Lately: Candy Yum Yum | Breakfast Cheese and Fruit | Lipstick Challenge for Next Week? appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last person who complimented you on your makeup? My coworker last week. I was wearing a little more coverage than usual, so I think the overall look was more polished than the bare bones FOTDs I’ve been wearing for months now. Amazing what a difference a little bit of concealer makes! 2. Last dream you can remember? Marnie and I were like the Scooby Doo detectives in our neighborhood, ha ha ha! We were working a case to unveil who had stolen all the tuna sandwiches in our circle. 3. Today the temperature in my neighborhood is/was ____. The Bay Area is experiencing a heat wave, ugh!
