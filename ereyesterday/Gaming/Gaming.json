    "description": "Releasing just prior to the PlayStation 5 Pro hardware launch, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 features a set of unique enhancements over base PS5 - where we have equally unique insights thanks to a recent trip to meet the series' Principal Rendering Engineer, Michal Drobot, and the talented team at Infinity Ward Poland. Black Ops 6 is developed by multiple studios – chiefly Treyarch and Raven Software - but at IW's Poland office I was able to get a behind-the-scenes tour of the tools used to make the game. So in essence, this piece serves two purposes: to discuss the Pro upgrades with input from the developers - and to talk about some of the wider enhancements made to the engine. Read more",

    "description": "Earth Defense Force 6 is the pinnacle of a series that many people view as being a fairly mindless shooter. Despite that, it also has the best use and interpretation of time travel of any game I've played. It does that without leveraging new-fangled fancy graphics, instead relying on quality storytelling and some very cool meta decisions that change up the usual “just pick the next mission” grind that’s present in these games. EDF 6 uses all of these things to great effect, and it makes the time-travel concept almost feel believable.Earth Defense Force 6 spoilers follow.The fact that time travel is ingrained into basically every aspect of the story means that, while it's not as visually striking as the time travel offered in something like Dishonored or Titanfall, it's more engrossing. The way it's interwoven into the mechanics as well makes for an incredibly novel take on the concept I’ve not seen before, especially when it ends with somehow being more over-the-top than killing a god.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Since it's the festive season, Epic is once again giving away a free game every day. The Epic Games Store continues to give away a free game each week, and this week is another nice find with a price that can't be beaten. Every Thursday at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET, Epic offers at least one free PC game (and sometimes even as many as two or three). All you need to do to claim the free games is create a free Epic account and enable two-factor authentication. You have a week to add the freebies to your library before the new one(s) take their place. At this point, Epic has given away hundreds of free games, and there's no sign that the program will stop any time soon. We keep this article up to date weekly to highlight both the current free games and next week's offerings.Current free game at EpicSifu Sifu is the final free game of 2024 from the Epic Games Store. A roguelike brawler, Sifu is a tough game with a great story that asks you how far you'd be willing to go to exact revenge on the people who murdered your family. If you fall in battle, a magical amulet will bring you back to life, but there's a steep price to pay with every revival.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

With eight adult fantasy novels and two YA romantic comedies under her belt — including the bestselling Atlas series — it’s a little hard to believe that.

    "description": "Unlike a lot of the team I'd imagine, my opinion is this: I thought the year was quite middling for games. Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn't. One I hadn't even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn't stop thinking about. Anyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year. I hope Santa bought you some nice warm socks or a chocolate orange so dense, you could tee it off at your local golf club.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What do you need to do the most: rest, get organized or connect with others? All of the above! Right now, the thing I need most is to get organized, though. Since October, I’ve felt like I’ve been pulled along by external forces, and I don’t want to feel like that anymore. I want to feel like I’m in charge of where my life is going, you know? 2. Who would you rather hang out with: Santa Claus, Snoop Dog, the aliens (let’s assume they’re friendly) or Cupid? Santa Claus, of course! He’s my homeboy. Together we make magic happen. 3. Which would you rather do: visit a haunted house, fly a plane, sing in front of an audience or try rock climbing on actual rocks?
