See at Amazon See at Best Buy SteelSeries gaming headset deals aren't all that uncommon, but discounts on the manufacturer's gaming earbuds? Those have been practically nonexistent since SteelSeries launched the Arctis GameBuds last October. But now, ahead of Prime Day 2025, Amazon is offering a great deal on the best model of the best all-around gaming earbuds we've tried. For a limited time, you can get the Arctis GameBuds with universal compatibility for $148 (was $200).This model is officially licensed by Xbox and is technically marketed toward Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Windows players.

    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mecha-break-classes-tier-list-best-strikers-to-use/2900-6732/",
    "description": "Mecha Break is a new multiplayer shooter that allows you to take control of your own mech and battle it out against real players in PvP or NPCs in PvPvE game modes. Regardless of the game mode you select, you're able to choose over a dozen different mechs to play as in Mecha Break. The different mechs are called Strikers, and you can think of these as classes that offer a variety of strengths and weaknesses.When choosing which Striker to pilot, you want to consider a few factors: your playstyle, the game mode you're playing, and the overall effectiveness of the mech's attributes and abilities. While you're free to make any choice that suits your preferences, you might also have some questions about which Striker to use. You can see a complete tier list of the available Strikers in Mecha Break in the guide below so you know exactly what kind of choice you're making. Mecha Break Tier ListOur tier list for the Strikers in Mecha Break will be divided into three categories: S tier, A tier, and B tier. There's not really a place for any Striker below B tier, but you could make a case for a couple of them depending on your individual playstyle and preferences. In total, there are 15 Strikers to choose from in the full launch of Mecha Break, which is slightly more than what we saw in the various alpha and beta tests of the game earlier this year. You're able to unlock all 15 Strikers from the main menu, and as you'll notice when unlocking a specific Striker, they all have one of five classifications: Attacker, Defender, Brawler, Support, or Sniper. The Strikers will also be considered \"Light,\" \"Medium,\" \"Heavy,\" or \"Ultra Heavy\" depending on their overall size. Their size affects how quickly they can move and how much damage they can deal, while their classification gives them access to different weapons and attributes. Based on all of these factors, it can be difficult to establish a universal tier list for the Strikers since every player is going to have a different preference. However, we'll do our best to give you a tier list based on the effectiveness of each Striker as it relates to their role in Mecha Break. You can see each tier, what Strikers are in it, and why we selected those Strikers for that tier in the sections below: S Tier - Aquila, Inferno, Stego, Tricera, WelkinA Tier - Alysnes, Pinaka, Stellaris, NarukamiB Tier - Luminae, Falcon, Panther, Hurricane, Skyraider, Serenith S TierOf course, we're starting with S tier, which is considered the best of the best in Mecha Break. In our opinion, five Strikers make it into S tier, being Aquila, Inferno, Stego, Tricera, and Welkin.Out of these five, Welkin is sort of the dark horse pick, as the Striker hasn't been consistently one of the most popular, unlike the other four. However, in the full version of Mecha Break, Welkin is a terrific Brawler that certainly feels like a \"Heavy\" Striker. The mech makes up for that by having one of the best combos in Mecha Break. You can leap forward towards an enemy with your massive axe and lock an enemy into a forcefield with you, effectively trapping and forcing them into close range combat with you. If you pick your fights right, you can deal a ton of damage with Welkin.The other picks are the classic S-tier Strikers that have maintained their spots amongst the elite in Mecha Break. Out of the remaining four, we have two Attackers, one Defender, and one Sniper. The only non \"Ultra Heavy\" Striker of the group is Aquila, which is a \"Heavy\" Sniper that can be arguably the best Striker in the game if you can hit your shots from a long distance.Inferno and Stego are the two Ultra Heavy Attackers, and both are incredibly difficult to take down but are able to deal massive amounts of damage using different weapons. Stego utilizes missiles and turrets while Inferno is more of a close-range Striker that uses shotguns and boosters to beat foes down.Finally, we have Tricera, who is the best Defender Striker in Mecha Break. You have to spend oodles of time to take Tricera down, as it's an absolute tank that can self-heal and regenerate its shields. Mix that in with a Gatling gun that can deal damage from anywhere, and you have one impressive Striker. A TierThe A Tier Strikers are definitely serviceable and can even be better than some of the S Tier Strikes in some scenarios, but they're not the best overall in Mecha Break. In this tier, we have four Strikers: Alysnes, Pinaka, Stellaris, and Narukami.Out of these four, Alysnes is likely the one that players will get the most use out of, as it's the first Striker you have unlocked in Mecha Break. Alsynes is a Medium Attacker that relies on close-range melee attacks and evasiveness to defeat opponents. You could make a case for Alysnes in S tier based on its Armor Purge ability, which allows you to come back to life after dying with better speed, but weaker armor. This can be incredibly useful when you're up close and personal with enemies or if you're team is in a pinch. Behind Alysnes, there's the Light Sniper in Narukami, a Medium Support in Pinaka, and a Light Brawler in Stellaris. Pinaka is the highest-rated Support Striker we have on the tier list, and that's mainly due to the Striker's overwhelming number of healing abilities for both yourself and your teammates. You can repair shields, health, and even provide cover for your team. For a weapon, Pinaka has a shotgun that won't deal much damage, but it can get the job done if an enemy is at low health. As for Narukami and Stellaris, these are decent options that can both be considered glass cannons. They have light armor but pack a punch with their arsenal of weapons. Narukami has a deadly sniper as well as some movement abilities, but can be extremely difficult to master. Stellaris is a fast-moving Striker with a quick sword that combos enemies at close range. However, Stellaris' best trait is a grappling hook you can use to evade danger, get the jump on enemies, and quickly traverse a map. B TierFinally, there's the B tier of Strikers in Mecha Break. These Strikers still won't actively cause you to lose matches or perform poorly, but they're mostly outclassed by every other Striker in the game. The six mechs we have in B tier are: Luminae, Falcon, Panther, Hurricane, Skyraider, and Serenith.Out of these five, Falcon is arguably the most enjoyable to play, being a Light Attacker that relies on aerial combat to damage enemies and weave in and out of encounters. However, while Falcon does have some fun movement, it can hardly deal any damage to enemies with its abilities. If you opt for the Falcon, it's recommended to make use of its Recon Kit ability so you can provide some extra intel to your team. Moving on, both Luminae and Serenith are Light Support Strikers. Luminae focuses on raw healing ability, while Serenith makes use of some confusion abilities that are intended to complicate the battlefield for the enemy teams. Serenith also has some damage potential with an AoE attack that's called in from the sky, but the attack often takes too long to land before enemies have cleared out of the area. If you want to play with Luminae, you'll have to really hone in on trying to heal yourself and teammates, as the Striker takes a while to provide visible support. Luckily, the Striker does have some movement abilities you can use to avoid enemies while trying to support the team. Rounding out B tier are Panther and Hurricane, two Strikers that are fairly different from one another. Panther is a Medium Brawler that makes use of a few weapons through weapon switching, but ultimately gets outmatched by any other damage-focused Striker in Mecha Break. As for Hurricane, it's an Ultra Heavy Defender that lacks the damage capabilities of the other Ultra Heavy Strikers on the list. It's still a decent tank, though, so if that's your sole focus, Hurricane isn't an awful pick.",

Carrots, for sure. The fact that you can turn them into a cake is a big deal! I mean, come on, have you ever heard of a broccoli cake? Or an okra cake? Yeah, I didn’t think so, LOL! I also love that you can put them in salads, roast them or just eat them plain with a variety of different dips. 2. A song that’s been stuck in your head lately? “Top of the World” by The Carpenters has been on repeat in my car. 3. Something you’ve been avoiding lately? Social media and the news cycle in general. 4. Lip masks: yes or no? Yes, but only if we’re talking Laneige. 5.
