    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. What time do you usually wake up in the morning? These days, 6 in the morning. Ideally my day would start off at 5:30, though. 2. How organized is your purse? It’s on the verge of haphazard, always, LOL! I mean, I can find the usual things I absolutely need – my phone, wallet, keys, medication, lipgloss. But do I find those things in an efficient manner? No. 3. If you could make one rule that everyone around you had to follow, what would it be? Make your deadlines. I can’t stand it when people are casual about due dates! 4. How do you feel about wearing makeup when it’s hot? I’ll do it, but I don’t like to do too many layers. I’m happy with cream[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 881 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Tabs always said that in kitty modeling, the best defense is a good offense. If you just rest on your laurels, sooner or later a hungrier up-and-coming cat (or Australian Shepherd) will take what’s yours, and you won’t be walking the catwalk at feline fashion week anymore. Nope, if you’re lucky, you’ll get a page in the Petco catalog. Every once in a while Tabs went into kitty ninja mode, and instead of just patrolling the neighborhood, he conducted more advanced cat recon… He’d inspect the houses on the circle more closely to look for signs of canine or feline incursion. One day, he picked up a new cat’s scent around an air conditioning filter a couple houses down. He sniffed the area for a long time, gathering intelligence, and then used the data to compile a cat profile. According to Tabs, the new cat was a three-year-old male tabby with green eyes and a crooked tail… Moderate kitty modeling potential. Of course, he was added to the database. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict,[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 863 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Boss Monster is a retro-inspired card game that’s been around for more than a decade. It received a game-changing update this April with the release of Super Boss Monster, which introduces a new mode designed for solo play. Featuring SNES-style artwork, an arsenal of unique cards, and heaps of replayability, it looks like an excellent starting point for newcomers while also giving veterans plenty of new content to enjoy. It also works with all previous Boss Monster sets, though it’s perfectly fine to play the game on its own with no prior experience. See all Boss Monster games Super Boss Monster $40 Super Boss Monster is the next iteration of the Boss Monser card game, which tasks 1-4 players with building a dungeon, enticing adventurers inside, and then defeating them with a litany of traps and monsters lurking within.This new version features SNES-style artwork (a big change from the NES-inspired artwork of the original), and an all-new Solo Mode that's perfect if none of your board-game buddies can make it to game night. Veteran players, meanwhile, can play the new Challenge Mode, which ramps up the difficulty. Super Boss Monster is also fully compatible with all existing Boss Monster base games and expansions. See at Amazon Boss Monster Base Games Looking to check out the original Boss Monster game? A few different versions are available. Boss Monster: 10th Anniversary Edition gets you the classic card game plus 15 new cards, making it the most up-to-date way to enjoy the original version of the game.Boss Monster 2: The Next Level Card Game follows up on the original and features an all-new 160 card deck. Best of all, it can be played on its own or combined with the original Boss Monster for a massive campaign.Then there's Boss Monster: Rise of the Mini-Bosses, which offers a slightly different take on the game. The 160-card deck is both an expansion and standalone game, introducing promotable mini-bosses that modify how rooms in your dungeon behave and grant the player additional perks. It’s currently the cheapest of the trio at $20.70, so give it a look if you’re shopping on a budget. See Boss Monster at Amazon See Boss Monster 2 at Amazon See Boss Monster: Rise of Mini-Bosses at Amazon Boss Monster Expansions There's also an abundance of expansions available for Boss Monster. Some of these are designed for specific base games, while others can be used across the board.

The MLB Fan Cave was created by Pathway Studios, which released a short teaser video for the add-on. It's been a banner year for the Minecraft franchise, including 2025's highest-grossing film, A Minecraft Movie, which made just over $800 million worldwide.

    "description": "Hitman developer Io Interactive's James Bond game has been reannounced with a proper title, 007 First Light. It also has some new key art, which confirms some important Facts: unlike Hitman's depthless master mimic Agent 47, James Bond has hair, formed into a neat side-parting by the passage of a narrowly escaped bullet. He also has ears, a high-collared leather jacket, and a gun. Or what looks like a gun. He could be just doing a finger pistol to fake us out. I do not trust this particular James Bond. He is, after all, a cousin of Agent 47, that barcode-blazoned Fury peering out of every mirror. Io Interactive's James Bond doesn't even have a face right now. The face is hopefully forthcoming in the world premiere later this week during Summer Game Fest 2025, along with James Bond's legs and feet. Read more",
