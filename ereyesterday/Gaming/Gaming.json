    "description": "Cris Tales developer We Are Dreams has released a gameplay trailer for its next game, Prisma. The game's art direction is heavily inspired by Persona 5 but has plenty of mechanics to help make it stand out.Prisma follows a photojournalist named Alma who finds a magical camera that transfers her to another world called Domacon, filled with other Almas from the multiverse. Friend, foe, or NPC, each Alma has a Prism Shard that grants them magical abilities in battle, and rival Almas will try to steal them. The game's turn-based combat is inspired by Persona 5 as well, but has some key differences. Players are able to use Alma's camera filters to distort reality and apply buffs to the entire party of alternate Almas, such as using a fisheye lens to bypass enemy shields or a shattered lens to turn a single-target attack into a multi-target one.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Surprisingly, Bungie's letting them keep it.Players quickly noticed the upgrade was appearing in Destiny 2's in-game shop for free, with some even making videos and posts to spread the word about the free loot. Bungie quickly responded by disabling the upgrade, which had the unfortunate side-effect of also putting all Dawning 2024 Event Card Triumphs and related progression on hold.Due to disabling the Dawning Event Card, all Event Card Triumphs and progression are on hold until the main issue is resolved.We'll provide updates once we have more information. — Destiny 2 Team (@Destiny2Team) December 10, 2024 Naturally, some players grew frustrated that their Dawning progress had been halted, while others were more upset about the fact that their ill-begotten gains might not be sticking around. After all, Bungie had said that once the issue was resolved, \"players will need to re-acquire the Dawning Event Card Upgrade for 1,000 Silver.\"Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Where would you rather go on vacation: New Zealand, Alaska, Costa Rica or Switzerland? I’d love to go to all of these places, but right now Switzerland sounds pretty cool. 2. Ponytail or curls? Hmm. I like ponytails because they’re functional, but sometimes they give me a headache, so let’s go with curls. They’d have to be super loose ones, though. And kinda messy! 3. Did you ever have a job where you had to wear a uniform? Kinda. We had very specific guidelines for safety when I worked at the bakery, like close-toed shoes, no nail polish, hair tied back. 4. If you were in school, whom would you likely hang out with: the athletes, the drama crew, the band kids or the honors society?

    "description": "Seasons greetings! Hard to believe we’re in full-on Christmas season time now, isn’t it? Folks getting their tree (we did today!), putting up the Christmas lights (workin’ on it!), other decorations. I was looking back at December posts over the years, and when I came upon this one it made me smile. 🙂 Mt. Saint Tabby? That was SO Tabs. It was a quiet morning on our hill today. Nothing really exciting happened, except for some joggers running by, which made a certain someone’s tail poof up… While Tabs checked out the usual blades of grass, plants and trees, I spent some time thinking about how possessive and jealous Tabs gets now in his older age. And not just with his humans. He’s also like that with his domain outside. I may or may not have received a Post-It last week asking me to write the city about renaming our hill, “Mt. Saint Tabby,” because Tabs doesn’t like the thought of anybody, and by “anybody,” I mean any other cats, chilling on his hill.
