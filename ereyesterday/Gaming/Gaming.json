    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-racing-games/2900-5482/",
    "description": "The best racing games have always been technical showpieces on each generation of hardware, with most console makers having their own prestigious franchise to parade around in front of the competition. But the sheer breadth of options has never been wider than in 2025, with a sub-genre for everyone looking to get a high speed thrill.The beauty of the racing genre is that it can be so many different things to different players. If you want to kick back and enjoy some laps around a circuit, you can play anything from the highly successful Mario Kart 8 Deluxe to the gorgeous Forza Horizon 5, and enjoy a wealth of options in-between. If you crave something more grounded and challenging, there multiple strong choicesfor technical simulation racing that each have a degree of approachability to let you find the right fit. You've got options ranging from isometric camera views to stunningly detailed and dutifully recreated real-life tracks, letting you tear through rubber in whichever way suits you.Racing games have also transcended the simple nature of doing laps around a track. Games like Forza Horizon and The Crew Motorfest have given players the ability to explore massive open worlds, enjoying races of all varieties on the streets that pierce that gorgeous landscape. Modern hardware has also afforded a level of technical artistry that brings you even closer to the real thing, with highly accurate tracks and vehicles presented in incredible detail in games like Gran Turismo 7, Forza Motorsport, and more. Nostalgia is also well represented, with homages to visual styles of old and physics models that will have you recalling fond arcade racing memories.With so many options to choose from, it can be a little daunting to sort through which rise to the top as some of the best racing games to enjoy in 2025. We've selected what we think of the best of the best, in no particular order, spanning over a decade of releases that goes to show that a fantastic racing game rarely ages poorly. For more, check out our lists for the best RPGs, the best PS5 games, the best Xbox games, and the best Nintendo Switch games. Forza Horizon 5Developer: Playground GamesRelease Date: November 1, 2021Platforms: Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PCWith the Horizon series, developer Playground Games took the simulator racing roots of the Xbox-exclusive racing series and transformed it into one of the most dynamic and exciting open-world arcade racers on the market. Since its inception, Forza Horizon has repeatedly set new benchmarks for high-octane racing with gorgeous and varied vistas, and the fifth entry doesn't miss a beat. Taking place in a fictional amalgamation of various parts of Mexico, Forza Horizon 5 never takes a breath after dropping you into an active volcano to kick off a packed festival of furious racing fun. As a bonus, you can potentially play it for free, as it's on Game Pass. And if you happen to only have a PlayStation 5, it's out there soon too, as Xbox is porting the game on April 29. See on Amazon Forza Motorsport (2023)Developer: Turn 10 StudiosRelease Date: October 10, 2023Platforms: Xbox Series X|S, PCOn the other side of the Forza coin, Forza Motorsport (also on Game Pass) is a return to the series that started it all, with the latest entry in 2023 representing a reboot of sorts after a long time off for the franchise. Unlike Horizon, this is a gritty, grounded simulation racer, albeit with a range of settings to let you tune the experience to both your liking and experience level. Coupled with a compelling upgrade system that brings you closer to the machines you're throwing around some of the most iconic race tracks around the world, there's no question that the time off has helped produce something special in the long-running series. See on Amazon Gran Turismo 7Developer: Polyphony DigitalRelease Date: March 4, 2022Platforms: PS5, PS4Few games celebrate cars in a way that Gran Turismo has over its storied history on the PlayStation. Some of your earliest memories might be of struggling through license challenges or experiencing the slower-paced racing of this series on earlier PlayStation consoles, fostering a fondness for the beauty of the cars on show in the process. Gran Turismo 7 hasn't strayed too far away from that established formula, but it's still every bit the modern simulation racing experience you would want without losing any of its charm. See on Amazon F1 24Developer: CodemastersRelease Date: May 24, 2024Platforms: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PCCodemasters has been pushing out licensed F1 games annually for a long time now, so it's a wonder how it routinely keeps delivering an authentic and exhilarating replication of the high octane racing championship. The latest entry is no exception, with an updated driving model that rewards more aggressive (but fair) driving while also rewarding calculated risks. If you return to the series year-on-year then some of its newest modes might not be as enticing or groundbreaking. But if you're looking to get your first fix of F1 racing action, or just want the most up-to-date tracks and liveries, there's really nowhere better to look. See at Amazon Mario Kart 8 DeluxeDeveloper: NintendoRelease Date: April 28, 2017Platforms: Nintendo SwitchThere's not much that can be said about Mario Kart 8 Deluxe that hasn't already. Ported to the Nintendo Switch from the struggling Wii U, this has been the consistent seller for the hybrid system, racking up a frankly ridiculous number of sales since launch. And it's not hard to see why. Its approachable but deep kart racing is fun for all ages, its colorful and fun aesthetic bringing all of Nintendo's biggest characters into one place where they aren't punching each other in the face. It's a game that has been well supported with post-launch content too, making it a bounty of racing riches that will endure for years to come. See on Amazon Wipeout Omega CollectionDeveloper: XDevRelease Date: June 6, 2017Platforms: PS4We might never get another Wipeout game again, especially with its main developer having closed its doors, but if the Omega Collection is the last we'll see of this futuristic racer then it's a powerful note to go out on. Collecting three remastered games in the series--the PS3's Wipeout HD and Fury HD, and the PS Vita's highly underrated Wipeout 2048--it's a package filled to the brim with exhilarating, fast-paced racing content, which looks absolutely spectacular on the still todayPlayStation 5 thanks to a blisteringly fast frame rate and art direction that never ages. Its thumping techno soundtrack only accentuates a bygone era of Sony history, and one that many fans are eager for the publisher to return to at some point. See on Amazon TrackmaniaDeveloper: NadeoRelease Date: July 1, 2020Platforms: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PCWhen you think of the purest form of racing, it's likely games that take place on real tracks with hyper-realistic real cars. Trackmania is neither of those two, with toy-like racers zooming around complex tracks akin to Hot Wheels plastic circuits come to life. And yet it demands a level of skill and focus that you'll struggle to find elsewhere. This free-to-play title from Ubisoft homes in on the best parts of racing, where small but critical decisions can help you shave off tenths of a second in the pursuit of the perfect lap time. Coupled with regular seasons filled with new content, and Trackmania might just be the best racing game you just haven't tried yet. See on Green Man Gaming The Crew MotorfestDeveloper: Ivory TowerRelease Date: September 11, 2023Platforms: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PCUbisoft has long been chasing the success of Forza Horizon, with its series of open-world racers slowly changing from more RPG-style racing to the same exhilarating arcade action of Microsoft's premier title. Ubisoft's takeThat formula has never been better than in The Crew Motorfest, with Ubisoft finally nailing a driving model that feels extremely fun to engage with, whether it's through windy corners across its Hawaiian-inspired streets or via air and sea in its varied roster of vehicles to commandeer. Its festival format is a bit on the nose when comparing it to its inspirations, and the always-online component is still somewhat irksome, but you can't fault it when considering the amount of content Ubisoft keeps adding to this blossoming racer. See on Amazon Horizon Chase 2Developer: Aquiris Game StudioRelease Date: August 29, 2022Platforms: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, iOSIf you're in the mood for something more classically inspired, it's difficult to go wrong with the Horizon Chase series. Originally released on Apple devices through Apple Arcade, Horizon Chase 2 eventually found its way to Nintendo Switch and PC. And it's a blessing too, allowing more players to experience its wholesale improvements over the lauded original. With refined arcade racing, drastically improved visuals, and the return of all of the original's game modes. It does so without losing its captivating spirit, embodying the feel of classic '90s arcade racers in a package that feels attuned with modern expectations. Here's to hoping that it releases on more platforms in the near future. Hotshot RacingDeveloper: Lucky Mountain Games, Sumo DigitalRelease Date: September 10, 2020Platforms: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCHarkening back to the days of simpler arcade racers, Hotshot Racing trades in picture-perfect details for chunky, low-poly vehicles; bright, vibrantly colored tracks; and a driving model that would never survive the scrutiny of real-world physics. It's a racer that lives and dies on its combination of blistering boosts and slingshot drifting, taking inspiration from the likes of Burnout, Split Second, and more. It's a racer that's tough to put down once you start exploring its high skill ceiling, and still one of the best to bring out when you're looking for some of the best split-screen racing action out there. See on Amazon Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit RemasteredDeveloper: Stellar EntertainmentRelease Date: November 6, 2020Platforms: Xbox One, PS4, Nintendo Switch, PCIt's a remaster of a remake of a game that truly started it all for Need for Speed, which might sound like too many dips back into the same well for its own good. But Hot Pursuit remains one of, if not the, best Need for Speed title in more than two decades. Developed by former Burnout developer Criterion Games, this reels back the series into the classic cops vs. racer roots, with blindingly fast street racers punctuated with tricky law enforcement pursuits. It's got the classic multiplayer modes back too, where you can take on the role of either the hunter or the hunted and use your racing wits to trap or evade your foe. With this remaster comes some improved visual fidelity, cross-play support, and all previously released DLC, letting you experience the fast-paced fun all over again on today's latest hardware. See on Amazon Burnout Paradise RemasteredDeveloper: Criterion, Stellar EntertainmentRelease Date: March 16, 2018; June 19, 2020 (Nintendo Switch)Platforms: Xbox One, PS4, Nintendo Switch, PCSpeaking of some of the best from Criterion, it would be a crime not to mention another remaster of arguably its best game to date. Burnout will be fondly remembered for entries such as Burnout 3 and Burnout Revenge, but it's Burnout Paradise that stands head and shoulders above the rest. This open-world racer achieved so much before Playground Games refined the formula in the years after, with a delightfully varied and highly destructible sandbox for you to zip through in some of the series' fast fictional cars. It's a game that brought together all of the series' trademark features into a highly replayable package that stands the test of time thanks to a recent remaster, letting you reminisce on the glory days of this studio while longing for a return to the franchise that put them on the map. See on Amazon Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed CollectionDeveloper: Sumo DigitalRelease Date: November 16, 2012Platforms: Xbox 360, PS3, PC, Wii UIf you pretend that the early '90s console wars never concluded, then you might look at Sonic and All-Stars Racings as the natural competitor to Nintendo's Mario Kart. And it in fact is just that in 2024, with a striking similarity in format and presentation. But don't confuse this as an inferior knockoff; Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed Collection is an equally exhilarating arcade racers, with a robust roster of Sega characters, inventive tracks, transforming vehicles, and all the power-ups you desire to turn races on their heads in the blink of an eye. If you're not invested in Nintendo's consoles, crave another Mario Kart-like experience, or love Sega, this is a great option. See on Humble Assetto Corsa CompetizioneDeveloper: KUNOS-Simulazioni SrlRelease Date: September 12, 2018Platforms: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCAssetto Corsa has been a mainstay in the simulation racing community, and its latest interaction in Competizione has found a great deal of success now that it's on consoles. The series prides itself in the recreation of the popular GT Racing games, as well as hosting a large variety of racing formats that you can choose from for offline or online play. Its hyper-detailed driving model simulates a variety of racing conditions, with detailed physics models for aerodynamics and tire properties accentuating the highly technical racing on track. The series has been so impressive in its racing recreation that the FIA selected it as a replacement for Gran Turismo 7 in its 2022 FIA Motorsport Games Esports Cup, which should give you a strong indication of its exceptional racing quality. See on Amazon iRacingDeveloper: iRacingRelease Date: August 26, 2009Platforms: PCIf you've stuck to simulation racing games that exist predominantly in the wider consumer space, then it's likely you haven't heard of iRacing before. Which is a shame, considering how accurate and life-like the simulation racing game is, enduring as one of the go-to options for serious racing fans for nearly two decades. The subscription model has helped the game continually grow over the years, expanding to over 100 cars and tracks that have been meticulously recreated using advanced LIDaR scanning. It's a game that won't be to everyone's taste, with its focus on realism and high difficulty as a result. But for the purists out there, and those looking to venture into a more serious racing format, it's a staple that can't be ignored. See on Steam Project Cars 2Developer: Slightly Mad StudiosRelease Date: September 21, 2017Platforms:PS4, Xbox One, PCSlightly Mad Studios made a name for itself with the debut of Project Cars, a racer that skirted the line between arcade and simulation racing that is so prevalent in the market today. Project Cars 2 is an improvement in every way, with a highly accurate driving model that skews more towards simulation, supported by dynamic track conditions that alter temperature for you and your tires to contend with, as well as strategic pit stops to keep races exciting. It's a pity that this was followed up by a completely different type of game in Project Cars 3, which moved strongly towards more arcade-style action at the expense of what made this series so exceptional in the first place. And given that it would be the last in the series, it's at least fortunate that Project Cars 2 and its community still remains lively to this day. See on Amazon Art of RallyDeveloper: Funselektor Labs Inc.Release Date: September 23, 2020Platforms: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch PCFrom the outside, Art of Rally looks like a cute, minimalist take on dirt rally racing. But on the inside, that welcoming exterior gives way to one of the most complex and rewarding rally experiences on the market today. It's every bit as demanding as rally simulators, punishing overzealous braking points and a lack of route awareness in ways that the real sport will do to its competitors. Art of Rally wears its more playful aesthetic and presentation with pride, with minimalist detail in its tracks and car models accentuated with bright colors. But it's a devious veneer that shouldn't dissuade you if you're looking for one of the more complex simulators on the market today. See on Fanatical Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom. Parking Garage Rally CircuitDeveloper: Walaber EntertainmentRelease Date: September 20, 2024Platforms: PCRacing traditionally needs space, the open road to let you really sink your foot into the pedal and just see how quickly you can tear through tarmac. Parking Garage Rally Circuit asks, what if you can achieve the same adrenaline rush in…well, a parking garage. Harking back to the visual style of the SEGA Genesis, Parking Garage Rally Circuit is more than a gimmick. It's an exhilarating, oftentimes technically satisfying precision driving game, albeit with simple controls and familiar arcade physics. With a mix of rally and circuit racing, you're likely to find many reasons to stick to the parking and ignore the road for a little bit. See at Steam Super Woden GP 2Developer: VijudaRelease Date: November 10, 2023Platforms: Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5, Nintendo SwitchDoes it get any more nostalgic than an isometric view, local multiplayer, and arcade racing? If your answer is no, then Super Woden GP 2 is the injection of retro racing you've been hunting for. With pretty much every racing format your heart may desire, a staggering 180 vehicles from nine manufacturers, custom tuning, and a visual style that's sure to stir up some good memories, this arcade racer is a love letter to the racing games of yesteryear while offering a compelling and robust racing experience for the modern age.

I woke from a terrible nightmare last night. I'd just released a book and every three or so pages, the publisher had inserted a double page spread trying to sell the reader a wireless mouse with Minecraft movie Jack Black's gormless, gouty grin on it, turning my carefully curated atmosphere to shit! Phew. Thank goodness it was just a nightmare! Just an utter, utter nightmare. Anyway, never mind all that. The sun is out, and books still exist and are and mostly advertisement free! Here to talk about them this week is game maker, Dicey Dungeons writer, Now Play This festival founder, and The Husbands author, Holly Gramazio! Cheers Holly! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf? Read more",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which is the hardest to do: engage in small talk with strangers, ask for directions, paint your toe nails or cook a meal without a recipe? For the life of me, I can’t make most meals without having a recipe to follow. I’m not one of those people who can cook from the heart and throw ingredients together with abandon. I need precise measurements (because one person’s pinch of salt might mean something completely different to someone else) and guidelines, otherwise I’ll short circuit. 2. Do you wanna go dancing at the pink pony club? Sure, why not? I’m gonna keep on daaaaaan-cing… 3. What language would you like to be fluent in: French, Cantonese, Arabic or sign language? All of them. LOL! I think sign language[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 872 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Yup, the boss lady wants us to tighten our belts around here. It looks like the economy is slowing down a bit, so no more Tuesday all-you-can-eat turkey or free five-egg omelets in the cafeteria. She wants everyone in the company to cut back, and that includes Rosie and Marnie. Starting immediately, there will be no more kibble showers! The leadership committee is hard at work identifying opportunities for process improvement… Rosie and CHO (Chief Hugging Officer) Whiskers are upping the napping quota by a staggering 15%! That means more hugs for everyone! Or else!!! It’s gonna be rough for a while. Hopefully things turn around soon. I have faith in Rosie’s leadership ability. And where many leaders lack empathy, she really goes out of her way to show she cares about people. It’s very motivating! Marnie is totally fired up about it. I sure wish Tabs were still around because he was so good at business. He would have known how to navigate a downturn better than anyone. 😊 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict,[Continue reading...] The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 855 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
