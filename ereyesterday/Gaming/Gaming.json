    "description": "The Indiana Jones movies may be over, but Indiana Jones and the Great Circle may have more than enough content to satisfy fans of the films. According to MachineGames, the upcoming title will have nearly four hours of cut scenes, which is almost the length of two Indiana Jones movies.MachineGames' creative director Axel Torvenius was a guest on the MinnMax YouTube channel, and he revealed that The Great Circle has \"a lot\" of cut scenes that when combined run \"roughly three hours and 45 or 40 minutes or something along those lines.\" He added that it is \"the biggest and longest game that MachineGames have ever done.\" Torvenius also indicated that the story of The Great Circle is largely unchanged from the outline that Bethesda director Todd Howard pitched to George Lucas in 2009, three years before Disney purchased Lucasfilm. Additionally, Torvenius stated that The Great Circle won't have instant fails during stealth missions, which is something that another game based on a Lucasfilm property, Star Wars Outlaws, only recently fixed with a new patch.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Ubisoft is reportedly working on an Animal Crossing-inspired game called Alterra. In the game, players will build their home on an island inhabited by NPCs called \"Matterlings.\" Players can leave their home to discover new biomes, Matterlings, and materials out in broader environs.Insider Gaming first reported on Alterra's development. According to the report, the game will use voxels to generate its world. For the unfamiliar, voxel graphics display cubes on a grid, a la Minecraft. Alterra is also set to feature building and crafting mechanics, letting players construct items and locations out of materials they find out in the world. The report claims Alterra was developed from a cancelled project which also used voxel graphics.Insider Gaming claims they have seen images of Alterra's NPCs. The Matterlings are reported to resemble Funko Pops, i.e. cartoon figures with large heads, albeit in a voxel style. Some Matterlings resemble fictional creatures like dragons, others real-world animals like birds and polar bears.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Stuffing or mashed potatoes? Both speak volumes to my carb-loving heart, but I love mashed potatoes just a little bit more. 2. Apple pie or apple cider? Um, both? 3. Do you have any Thanksgiving day traditions? Not really, although I do short circuit if I don’t get at least one slice of pecan pie. I gotta have it! 4. Have you ever hosted Thanksgiving? Yes, a handful of times, and yes, there was pecan pie. HAHAHA! 5. Something you’re thankful for? So thankful to spend time with my little family of El Hub, Connor, Rosie and Marnie. Our house is full and so is my heart! Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen P.S. Here are the questions to copy/paste with your answers in a comment.

    "description": "As most people know, Tabs was a demanding employer. He was also very fair to his employees. More than generous, actually. In keeping with his holiday traditions, Rosie allowed us to take the next two weeks off (thank you so much, Rosie!). Consequently, the employees of Tabs the Cat Industries, LLC have been up to their vacation shenanigans, which for me meant blogging while dressed up as a cat lady lumberjack. Makeup, of course, has been on Connor’s agenda, but she’s still perfecting her technique… Marnie has been cruisin’ the streets of Novato looking for tiny dogs with short legs to bark at — that is, when Connor isn’t demanding that they play dress-up together. We’ve all been enjoying this joyful break before Thanksgiving. I hope things are going well with you, too. We’re here and we’re feisty (just tired). 😊 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 839 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
