    "description": "It's fitting that the new trailer for The Last of Us Season 2 begins with Joel and Ellie at a physical distance, because there's an emotional gulf between them by the final scene shown. The upcoming season starts five years after Season 1, and Ellie doesn't know what Joel did to save her yet. Once she finds out, things are never going to be the same between them.The latest trailer is light on context if you've never played The Last of Us Part II. But Joel and Ellie found some relative peace in the intervening years. That's coming to an end because their sanctuary isn't as safe as they believed, as both the infected and outside forces are in play. That includes the newly introduced Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), who will play a major role this season. The trailer also features an early look at Joe Pantoliano as Eugene, a character who was only hinted at in the game. The Last of Us Season 2 panel is currently underway at SXSW, and it's being live-streamed on YouTube. Series stars Pedro Pascal, Bella Ramsey, and Gabriel Luna are on hand with Season 2 newcomers Young Mazino, Isabela Merced, and Kaitlyn Dever. Showrunners and series co-creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann also joined the panel as they unveiled the new trailer for Season 2. You can watch the panel below.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Which would you rather collect: vintage clothes or vintage furniture? I could do both, but if I could only pick one, I’d have to go with vintage clothes, mostly because I don’t have a big enough house to collect furniture pieces. Sigh! Oh, and also, I don’t want to worry about my furniture being beat up by the pets and the kids playing in my house, you know? 2. How good are you with keeping secrets? If you tell me something in confidence, it’s going to the grave with me, babe; however, I do have an exception policy. If I believe someone’s in danger, then I’m gonna say something. 3.

    "description": "That little girl in the picture above turned nine years old today. Yup, today is Connor Claire’s ninth birthday! Wow. I remember that day up there like it was yesterday. Poor Tabs… He was slightly confused about the overall gist of the festivities. I think he thought it was a get-together to celebrate him. We didn’t want to burst his bubble, so we took a brief interlude to sing him the birthday song. “Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear tabby… Happy birthday to you!” 🙂 Connor Claire didn’t mind, and there was more than enough food, fun and love for everyone. It was kind of weird, but for the most part, Tabs wasn’t as social as he usually is. He spent most of the afternoon napping at the top of the stairs, away from the party.
