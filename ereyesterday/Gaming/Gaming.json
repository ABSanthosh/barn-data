It was later remade for PS1 and Sega Saturn as Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete, which is the version included in the Lunar Remastered Collection.

    "description": "You’re probably gonna laugh with how haphazard I am with makeup these days, but it’s the best I can do with the time I have, so here it is: I use a twist-up, long wearing gel pencil (MAC Colour Excess) and draw a messy line on my upper lash line with no concern about the precision at all, LOL! If it’s too thick, then I smudge it out. If it’s too thin, then I figure the makeup goddesses wanted it to look that way, so I go with it. I don’t even bother trying to line my waterline, either. I usually layer eyeshadow on top of it anyway, so I’m not overly concerned. Seriously, THAT’S IT! How about you? How do are you doing your liner these days?

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. When was the last time you spent a good amount of time outside? Yesterday morning. Connor had a sleepover with a friend the night before, and the girls wanted to play outside, so we all hung out in the circle. The girls played and did art projects; I walked Marnie and threw her ball for her about a billion times, LOL! 2. Do you sleep on your back, your tummy or your side? Usually my back. If my sinuses are stuffed up (hello allergy season), then it’s my side. 3. What’s something beautiful about today? Well, I get to spend it with the people I love the most – Connor, El Hub, Marnie and Rosie. 4. What’s one pair of shoes you wear a lot?
