    "description": "Lego Icons: Optimus Prime Transformers 2-in-1 (1,508 Pieces) $144 (was $180) See at Amazon See at Walmart See at Target Optimus Prime is one of the most popular and highly rated buildable models in the Lego Icons lineup--for good reason, too. The 1,508-piece collectible display set has an exceedingly clever 2-in-1 design that allows Transformers fans to convert the Autobot leader into his signature truck. Ahead of Prime Day 2025, multiple major retailers have restocked the 1,508-piece Optimus Prime set for $144, which is a 20% discount from its $180 MSRP. At the time of writing, Amazon is running low on units, but you can also snag this deal at Walmart and Target.Lego Icons: Optimus Prime Transformers 2-in-1 Display ModelAll three retailers have sold out of this display model, which is geared toward adults, several times already this year. And though it has returned once again, it's worth noting that Optimus Prime was out of stock everywhere from last holiday season until March. The Lego Store has units available at the moment, but it'll cost you the full $180 MSRP. Lego officially lists Optimus Prime as \"hard to find.\" This description combined with the prolonged stock shortages could mean that the Optimus Prime kit, which debuted in 2022, is close to retirement.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

While many of the deals are for children's books, there are a few fantasy and sci-fi collection deals for adult readers. On the fantasy side, the most notable deal is The Witcher Saga 5-Book Box Set for only $35 (was $90). This is the best price we've seen in a long time for the slipcased paperback set containing all five mainline novels in Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher series. The deal was originally only available to Prime members, but everyone can take advantage of this offer now.If you're a big fan of CD Projekt Red's games or the TV adaptations on Netflix, this deal is the perfect opportunity to check out the beloved source material. This is great timing for another reason, though. On September 30, the ninth book in the series, Crossroads of Ravens, will be available in English. Fans can preorder the standalone prequel novel at Amazon for $25 (was $30).Check out the box set as well as The Witcher's story collections and prequel novels below.

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you have a favorite vegetable? Yes! Carrots, for sure. The fact that you can turn them into a cake is a big deal! I mean, come on, have you ever heard of a broccoli cake? Or an okra cake? Yeah, I didn’t think so, LOL! I also love that you can put them in salads, roast them or just eat them plain with a variety of different dips. 2. A song that’s been stuck in your head lately? “Top of the World” by The Carpenters has been on repeat in my car. 3. Something you’ve been avoiding lately? Social media and the news cycle in general. 4. Lip masks: yes or no? Yes, but only if we’re talking Laneige. 5.

In fact, she insists on waking me up at the crack of dawn so that she can go running with me, and by running I mean sprinting circles around me as I shuffle along… I believe she thinks that I am her sheep. 🐑 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 865 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
