    "description": "Former WWE wrestler Dave Bautista has made a name for himself as an actor over the last decade, but now he's moving into the video game space as a producer. Bautista and Titan1Studios have agreed to partner up to bring Cat Assassin to life as a new media franchise including an upcoming video game.As announced on GameRant, Cat Assassin was created by Steve Lerner, the writer of the critically acclaimed indie game Stray. While that title put players in control of an adorable cat in a city of robots, Cat Assassin's lead character, Hugh, is considerably less cuddly. He's described as \"a skilled assassin navigating a chaotic world of warring cartels and corrupt power players.\" Presumably that's a role that Bautista may be interested in playing, but the announcement doesn't specify his involvement as an actor.Cat Assassin takes place in a \"neo-noir city populated by anthropomorphic felines.\" The video game is being planned as a stealth-action game with dark humor. The announcement notes that the Cat Assassin game is inspired by Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, and Sifu.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The animated adaptation of How to Train Your Dragon was a huge hit when it first hit the big screen in 2010, and now, 15 years later, Dreamworks is bringing that fantasy adventure back to theaters as a live-action adaptation. However, some may not know that both films are based on the 2003 novel series of the same name, written by author Cressida Cowell. The 12-book series offers a much more fleshed-out version of the story, and if you're looking to explore the source material before the new live-action film premieres on June 13, you're in luck, as the How to Train Your Dragon novels are available at Amazon. This includes a big discount on the How to Train Your Dragon: The Complete Book Collection, which is down to just $59.69 (normally $108). You can also grab the animated film and its sequels and spin-off on Blu-ray, and grab a new Toothless Lego set that's available to preorder. Check out all the How to Train Your Dragon deals below. How to Train Your Dragon: The Complete Book Collection $59.69 (was $108) All three versions of How to Train Your Dragon follow Hiccup Horrendous Haddock the Third, the son of a Viking chieftain whose clan has been at war with dragons for centuries. However, Hiccup secretly befriends a young dragon, whom he names Toothless, and the two form a bond that challenges the status quo of Viking society.Since the live-action movie looks like it'll be a faithful remake of the animated film, it might be best to start with the How to Train Your Dragon books. The books are much more detailed and feature entire story arcs that the movies don't include. You can pick up all 12 books with the How To Train Your Dragon: The Complete Collection, which is discounted to just for $59.69 (was $108) at Amazon. The box set includes paperback editions of all 12 books and a slipcase box to store them in. How to Train Your Dragon: The Complete Book Collection How to Train Your Dragon Hardcover Editions You can also buy each book on its own, as all 12 are available in standalone hardcover editions at Amazon--although buying all 12 separately will be more expensive than grabbing the discounted box set. That said, if you just want to dip into the literary version of How to Train Your Dragon, you can grab the first novel for just $9.19 (was $16).How to Train Your Dragon Hardcover EditionsHow to Train Your Dragon -- $9.19 ($16)How to Be a Pirate -- $26.70How to Speak Dragonese -- $16.89How to Cheat a Dragon's Curse -- $17.82 ($19.80)How to Twist a Dragon's Tale -- $19.80A Hero's Guide to Deadly Dragons -- $9.50How to Ride a Dragon's Storm -- $13.15 ($15)How to Break a Dragon's Heart -- $19.80How to Steal a Dragon's Sword -- $10.59 ($13)How to Seize a Dragon's Jewel -- $12.74 ($13)How to Betray a Dragon's Hero -- $19.80How to Fight a Dragon's Fury -- $8.38 See all books at Amazon How To Train Your Dragon: The Complete Book of Dragons $18 (was $20) While not a part of the series, there's also How To Train Your Dragon: The Complete Book of Dragons. This companion guidebook covers all of the dragon species from the How to Train Your Dragon series, plus several brand-new ones created just for this book, all realized with beautiful color illustrations. It's available for $18 at Amazon (normally $20) See at Amazon How to Train Your Dragon 4K Blu-rays The animated How to Train Your Dragon movie trilogy makes some big departures from the source material across the films, but they're still fun epics with fantastic animation that still holds up all these years later. These 4K Blu-rays also include the film on standard Blu-ray and digital streaming codes, as well as a selection of bonus materials, such as deleted scenes, documentaries, and commentaries from the cast and crew. There are even extra animated shorts featuring Hiccup and his crew.How to Train Your Dragon -- $18.25 ($23)How to Train Your Dragon 2 -- $15How to Train Your Dragon 3: The Hidden World -- $15 ($30) How to Train Your Dragon How to Train Your Dragon 2 How to Train Your Dragon 3: The Hidden World How to Train Your Dragon animated movies on standard Blu-ray In case you don't have a 4K TV to watch the How to Train Your Dragon, they are available in standard Blu-ray format. They still look great at 1080p, and you can get the entire trilogy in one bundle deal. You'll also get all of the bonus content that you'd find in the 4K editions, although it is worth noting that the How to Train Your Dragon: Ultimate Collection includes two TV specials as well, in case you're looking for a complete experience.How to Train Your Dragon Collection -- $12.69 ($30)How to Train Your Dragon: Ultimate Collection -- $19 ($38) How to Train Your Dragon Collection How to Train Your Dragon: Ultimate Collection How to Train Your Dragon TV series Dreamworks also produced an animated series based on \"How to Train Your Dragon,\" called \"Dreamworks Dragons,\" which takes place between the first two movies. The Show ran for 118 episodes across eight seasons, plus a direct-to-DVD movie called Mystery of the Dragon Eye. While each season saw DVD releases, the first two seasons--known as Dragons: Riders of Berk and Dragons: Defenders of Berk--are out of print. Seasons 3-8, which are titled Dragons: Race of the Edge, are available on DVD at Amazon, as is the Mystery of the Dragon's Eye movie. Additionally, all eight seasons are streaming on Peacock.Dreamworks followed up the Dragons series with two more How to Train Your Dragon animated spin-off shows--Rescue Riders on Netflix and The Nine Realms on Hulu. They haven't received a DVD or Blu-ray release yet, but are worth seeking out on Netflix and Hulu if you're looking to experience the entire How to Train Your Dragon animated universe.Dragons: Race to the Edge DVDDragons: Race to the Edge Seasons 1 and 2 (DVD) -- $12.96 ($23)Dragons: Race to the Edge Seasons 3 and 4 (DVD) -- $12 ($23)Dragons: Race to the Edge Seasons 5 and 6 (DVD) -- $11.79 ($23)Dragons: Race to the Edge: Mystery of the Dragon Eye (DVD) -- $9 ($15) See at Amazon Lego How to Train Your Dragon: Toothless Figure (784 pieces) $70 | Releases July 1 For one last recommendation, Lego recently announced a new building set based on the series' adorable iconic dragon, Toothless.

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Loose or fitted t-shirts? Generally, I like my tees slightly loose-y goose-y if I’m wearing them with jeans or shorts. If I’m layering with a sweater or a sweatshirt on top, then fitted. 2. What’s the oldest thing in your makeup bag right now? Hmm, the brushes? Oh, and I’m almost embarrassed to say this out loud, but I have an ancient Nordstrom Naturals MAC palette that I bust out every so often. 3. How’s your June going so far? It’s been very, very busy with end-of-the-year activities, dance things and whatnot. Things will kinda slow down after June 30, which I’m looking forward to. 4. How do you feel about walking around in sandals or flip flops without your toenails painted?

These days, 6 in the morning. Ideally my day would start off at 5:30, though. 2. How organized is your purse? It’s on the verge of haphazard, always, LOL! I mean, I can find the usual things I absolutely need – my phone, wallet, keys, medication, lipgloss. But do I find those things in an efficient manner? No. 3. If you could make one rule that everyone around you had to follow, what would it be? Make your deadlines. I can’t stand it when people are casual about due dates! 4. How do you feel about wearing makeup when it’s hot? I’ll do it, but I don’t like to do too many layers.
