    "description": "The next season of South Park, season 27, premieres on July 9, just a few days after making the jump to Paramount+ from HBO Max. Fans are a bit concerned about the move, however, as several episodes will be banned from the new streaming platform. This includes episodes from seasons 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16, and 17. It’s an unfortunate move, though it’s not without precedent for the streaming service. A controversial episode of Nathan For You--another Comedy Central series--is banned on Paramount+ even though it’s available on other networks like HBO. This has led to an increase in popularity for South Park Blu-rays and DVDs, which contain all episodes in their original, unedited format. More than a dozen episodes are likely to be banned from the streaming service, so if you’d like the most comprehensive collection of South Park content, you’ll need to spring for a physical Blu-ray. But with 27 seasons under its belt, there are a lot of different products to wade through. So, to help, we’ve put together a list of the best products to help you navigate all your options. From single-season releases and box sets to specials and movies, here’s a look at all the South Park Blu-rays available now. See all South Park Blu-rays at Amazon Note that, in some cases, it might be more affordable to pick up individual South Park seasons on DVD than it is to pick up the Blu-ray collections. Conversely, some Blu-rays are also on sale for less than their DVD counterparts. For example, Season 15 (Blu-ray) is discounted to $13.19 while the DVD version $15. Pricing is subject to change--Amazon frequently runs deals on Blu-rays--so be sure to check all formats before making a purchase.South Park: Season 15, Seasons 1-5, and Season 2South Park Box SetsIf you want to grab as many episodes as you can in a single bundle, check out the many South Park Blu-ray and DVD collections. These include multiple seasons each, making it easy to snag dozens of episodes along with some special features and exclsuive packaging. The only season not included in these box sets is the latest, Season 26, but you'll find Blu-ray and DVD versions of South Park Season 26 listed in the single-season section.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Speaking as the human grown from the ashes of a child who once built the Death Star out of LEGO, I do enjoy a good greeble now and then, but it very easily becomes a parody of itself - like turning a machine inside out, but none of the exposed parts are meaningfully connected. Liliana, founder of Eridanus Industries and lead developer of space tactics sim Nebulous: Fleet Command, has more practical objections to greebling, based on her eight years in the US Navy: excess surface details are an absolute dust trap for radar waves.

    "description": "Elden Ring had a starting class named the Wretch that gets a club and some ratty underwear filled with dreams and nothing else, and there's something special about the first few hours in Limgrave playing them, scavenging your first pieces of mismatched armour and build-defining treasures. The first time you hit a site of grace, that initial stat boost feels like a deific power surge. Insomuch as Elden Ring's most memorable stories run tangential and emergent to its static lore, this early fraught scramble is the player's self-woven tale at its most captivating. Soon enough, though, the feeling is gone. You're as powerful as god, desiring nothing but more bulbous Albinauric skulls to toss on the pile. Elden Ring: Nightreign feels unique among FromSoft's modern catalogue for its flippant attitude toward a convincing sense of place, and so regrettably sacrifices much of its studio's identity as committed worldbuilders, even while amplifying some of their more peculiar and interesting beats. It's tempting, then, to ask why it exists in the first place. On a generous day, I'd say that Nightreign exists to recreate - over and over - that same, wretchedly gratifying early-game feeling. Where every scrap of progress feels like a milestone, dull smithing stones shimmer like silver, and each incremental bonk stat increase is a hero's journey in miniature. Read more",

    "description": "You’re probably gonna laugh with how haphazard I am with makeup these days, but it’s the best I can do with the time I have, so here it is: I use a twist-up, long wearing gel pencil (MAC Colour Excess) and draw a messy line on my upper lash line with no concern about the precision at all, LOL! If it’s too thick, then I smudge it out. If it’s too thin, then I figure the makeup goddesses wanted it to look that way, so I go with it. I don’t even bother trying to line my waterline, either. I usually layer eyeshadow on top of it anyway, so I’m not overly concerned. Seriously, THAT’S IT! How about you? How do are you doing your liner these days?

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. When was the last time you spent a good amount of time outside? Yesterday morning. Connor had a sleepover with a friend the night before, and the girls wanted to play outside, so we all hung out in the circle. The girls played and did art projects; I walked Marnie and threw her ball for her about a billion times, LOL! 2. Do you sleep on your back, your tummy or your side? Usually my back. If my sinuses are stuffed up (hello allergy season), then it’s my side. 3. What’s something beautiful about today? Well, I get to spend it with the people I love the most – Connor, El Hub, Marnie and Rosie. 4. What’s one pair of shoes you wear a lot?
