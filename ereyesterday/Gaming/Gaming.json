In fact, the developer--founded by Suda51 and behind the No More Heroes franchise--decided to can an episode of its Dev Room series on YouTube because it may have led to even more fans randomly appearing at its office.Automaton reported that Grasshopper Manufacture explained the situation last week on X, noting \"it simply isn't possible for us to receive sudden visitors during work so often.\" As such, the developer is calling on fans to \"refrain from showing up at the studio without a business-related appointment.\"Announcement Re: The Dev Room: Ep. 49A few days ago we posted that the release of the 49th episode of The Dev Room would be delayed due to some last-minute editing issues. During editing, there was a lot of internal discussion regarding this particular episode, and we regret to… — Grasshopper Manufacture (@Grasshopper_EN) February 7, 2025 Founded in 1998, the studio is probably best known for No More Heroes, Killer7, and Lollipop Chainsaw.

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Shrimp or crab? Crab, but it can’t be imitation, and it has to be fresh. 2. Yoga or pilates? Both are equally as challenging for this very out-of-shape lady at the moment. LOL! (Been a rough 12 months.) I’ll pick yoga; I could use a good stretch. 3. Something that makes you feel sentimental? When my phone brings up baby photos of Connor or old photos of Tabs before he got sick. My heart swells up every single time. 4. What book are you reading at the moment? Nothing at the moment, boo. I need a good one. Got anything to suggest? I would like something not too heavy or scary. 5. Something you wish you said no to sooner? I wish I would’ve said no to[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 868 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

In fact, he won the Kitty Bowl a record eight times, making him more accomplished than even Tom Brady. Yes, Tabs was quite the cat athlete. Today’s game starts in a few minutes, and while Tabs is no longer here to watch the game with me, I’m sure he’ll be watching from up above. This happens to also be the last Sunday before Valentine’s.
