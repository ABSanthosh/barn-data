With this being the official weekend of the summer solstice, this morning I asked Rosie if she had any big plans for summer, and she just stared at me blankly and meowed something under her breath that sounded like ‚Äúscience waits for no one.‚Äù I took that as a ‚Äúno.‚Äù üòÇ Marnie‚Äôs sure been enjoying these longer summer days. In fact, she insists on waking me up at the crack of dawn so that she can go running with me, and by running I mean sprinting circles around me as I shuffle along‚Ä¶ I believe she thinks that I am her sheep. üêë Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Select Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 865 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

It‚Äôs just a list of more or less random questions I‚Äôve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you care about Labubus? Nah, I just don‚Äôt get the hype. 2. What‚Äôs your favorite summer dessert? Hmm, all of them? If pressed to pick one, then ice cream. 3. Do you have plans for the Fourth of July yet? Connor will be dancing with her dance team in the town parade, so that‚Äôs our main event during the day. We‚Äôll probably do a barbeque at home after the parade. Where we live doesn‚Äôt allow fireworks, so we may or may not go looking for a fireworks display. We‚Äôll see how ambitious we‚Äôre feeling! 4. How do you feel about maxi dresses? If it‚Äôs in a petite size and the print isn‚Äôt too overwhelming, then I‚Äôll rock a maxi dress, for sure. 5.

    "description": "The Elder Scrolls: The Betrayal of the Second Era Board Game $225 See at Amazon The Elder Scrolls: The Betrayal of the Second Era - Valenwood Expansion $50 See at Amazon Exciting news, a new Elder Scrolls game is now available. No, not that one. Or that one. We're talking about the board game, The Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era. The game is designed for 1-4 players who create their own custom hero and embark on an open-ended adventure filled with quests, monsters, and loot--just like in The Elder Scrolls video games. The game launched earlier this year, but it's already racked up strong critic and audience reviews. If you're interested in checking out this new, analog Elder Scrolls adventure, you can pick up The Elder Scrolls: The Betrayal of the Second Era for $225 at Amazon. The Elder Scrolls: The Betrayal of the Second Era Board Game $225 The Elder Scrolls: The Betrayal of the Second Era mixes elements of board games and tabletop RPGs, allowing for an open-ended and highly replayable guided experience without the need for a game master or tons of rulebooks. As the name indicates, the game is set during the Second Era of the world of Tamriel, which happens to be the same timeframe as The Elder Scrolls Online. The main storyline sees 1-4 players tasked with preventing the evil Order of the Black Worm from stealing the Amulet of Kings and unleashing a multi-dimensional disaster known as \"The Planemeld.\"The main campaign is designed to play out over three multi-hour sessions where players create their own character and build and customize them with unique skills to use in combat and exploration. Five of the major regions of Tamriel--Skyrim, Morrowind, Black Marsh, High Rock, and Cyrodiil--are explorable, and each offers its own unique side quests and activities. You can even join several factions, just like in the video games. The box comes with everything you need to play--including dice, play tokens, cards, character sheets, overland map boards, a set of modular hexagon exploration tiles, a rulebook, province quest books, and more. See at Amazon The Elder Scrolls: The Betrayal of the Second Era - Valenwood Expansion $50 The Elder Scrolls: The Betrayal of the Second Era is a big game, but if you're looking to bolster it with even more content, you can grab the Valenwood expansion, which adds the titular province as an explorable region, new encounters, new character classes, and more. It was originally offered as a perk for those who pledged a higher amount to The Betrayal of the Second Era's crowdfunding campaign, but a commercial release is now available. Stocks seem limited, so grab it soon. See at Amazon The box comes with everything you need to play, including dice, play tokens, cards, character sheets, overland map boards, a set of modular hexagon exploration tiles, a rulebook, province quest books, and more. However, it's worth noting that The Elder Scrolls: The Betrayal of the Second Era Board Game already has an expansion set, Valenwood, which adds the titular province as an explorable region, new encounters, new character classes, and more. It was originally offered as a perk for those who pledged a higher amount to The Betrayal of the Second Era's crowdfunding campaign, but a commercial release seem to be coming soon as it's listed at Amazon, but currently unavailable. It's worth keeping an eye on the listing in case it launches soon.The Elder Scrolls: The Betrayal of the Second Era Board GameThis isn't the first time The Elder Scrolls has been adapted into a sprawling roleplaying board game. There's also The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - The Adventure Game--yes, that's right, there's yet another port of Skyrim out there. Two, actually, as there's also the strategy wargame The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Call to Arms.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Hytale has been canceled by Riot Games and Hypixel Studios a decade after the project first started development.Hypixel Studios' co-founder Aaron Donaghey, better known by the Hytale community as Noxy, broke the news in a post on Hytale's website. \"Today, I shared some incredibly tough news with the Hypixel Studios team: we‚Äôre ending development on Hytale and beginning the process of winding down Hypixel Studios over the next few months,\" Noxy wrote. \"This is not the outcome any of us - at Hypixel or at Riot - wanted. But after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn‚Äôt bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise.\"Hytale is a standalone game project that sprouted from Hypixel, the popular Minecraft server from which Hytale's development team gets its name. It was planned to be a Minecraft-like sandbox game that was more modder-friendly, incorporated more RPG elements, and featured numerous minigames for players to try out alongside the basic sandbox experience. To better understand the project's ambitions, you should watch this developer diary that Riot Games released in 2021.Continue Reading at GameSpot",
