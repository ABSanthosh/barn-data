Around the same time as an ongoing redundancy process has reportedly seen all 300 of the studio's UK staff sent emails informing them they're at risk of losing their jobs, game director Leslie Benzies has allegedly told them BARB will somehow relaunch the troubled game. Yeah, exactly. You what, Leslie? That's the same Leslie who also reportedly blamed the rocky time MindsEye's had following its launch on what IGN calls \"internal and external saboteurs\" in its latest report. Read more",

Prices for both versions have dropped since then, but Amazon's current deal is by far the best yet for the remastered black-and-white collection. Fans can grab the six-volume set for only $74, which is a discount of 70% from its original $250 price. Alternatively, you can get the full-color edition of the 20th Anniversary Box Set for $116 (was $250).

    "description": "Samsung 990 Evo Plus 4TB NVMe SSD (7,250MB/s) $235 (was $328) See at Amazon A bunch of great tech deals are popping up ahead of next week's Prime Day sales event at Amazon, including a massive price cut on the Samsung 990 Evo Plus 4TB SSD. With this high-capacity NVMe SSD now up for grabs for its lowest price ever of $235 (was $328), this is a great opportunity to upgrade your storage on PC or PlayStation 5. Samsung 990 Evo Plus 4TB NVMe SSD (7,250MB/s) $235 (was $328) Samsung's 990 Evo Plus is a high-performing NVMe SSD with sequential read speeds of up to 7,250MB/s and write speeds of 6,300MB/s. It can be installed in desktop computers and laptops. Depending on your PC setup and cooling systems, you may want/need to add a heatsink during the installation process.To use the 990 Evo Plus on PS5, you'll need to attach it to a heatsink first. Thankfully, you can get a reliable heatsink for around $10. This SSD far surpasses PlayStation's 5,500MB/s minimum speed requirement for NVMe SSDs. And since the 990 Evo Plus is especially adept at transferring large files, it's an ideal choice for moving games between storage devices, whether you're buying this with your PC or PS5 in mind.It only takes a few minutes to install an NVMe SSD in the PS5 console's open M.2 2280 slot. Once the SSD is installed, your console will format the drive on its next boot. After that, you can decide if you want the new SSD to be the default location for downloads as well as transfer games between the two drives. Moving large game files from the PS5's internal storage to M.2 SSDs generally only takes a few minutes.Amazon also has deals on the 2TB and 1TB versions of the 990 Evo Plus. The 2TB model is on sale for $140 (was $177), and the 1TB is $80 (was $110). You are getting the most bang for your buck with the 4TB edition, though. See at Amazon While the Samsung 990 Evo Plus 4TB SSD is one of the best early Prime Day storage deals, it’s not the only SSD seeing a discount. For example, the Crucial P310 1TB is just $60 (was $74.80), and it’s fully compatible with PS5 (though it too needs a separate heatsink). But with speeds up to 7,100 MB/s, it’ll get you solid performance and save you a few bucks compared to the 1TB 990 Evo Plus.We’ve pulled together a few of our favorite PS5 SSD deals below, so be sure to give them a look before making a purchase. All of these exceed PlayStation's minimum requirements and also work on PC.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "So…what is the Monday Poll? Excellent question! It isn’t, contrary to its name, an actual poll, like with little clicky buttons. It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Do you have a favorite vegetable? Yes! Carrots, for sure. The fact that you can turn them into a cake is a big deal! I mean, come on, have you ever heard of a broccoli cake? Or an okra cake? Yeah, I didn’t think so, LOL! I also love that you can put them in salads, roast them or just eat them plain with a variety of different dips. 2. A song that’s been stuck in your head lately? “Top of the World” by The Carpenters has been on repeat in my car. 3. Something you’ve been avoiding lately? Social media and the news cycle in general. 4. Lip masks: yes or no? Yes, but only if we’re talking Laneige. 5.

    "description": "This time of year, Tabs was always pretty stoked about showing off his summer bod, which as you know, was curvy, Rubenesque and voluptuous. With this being the official weekend of the summer solstice, this morning I asked Rosie if she had any big plans for summer, and she just stared at me blankly and meowed something under her breath that sounded like “science waits for no one.” I took that as a “no.” 😂 Marnie’s sure been enjoying these longer summer days. In fact, she insists on waking me up at the crack of dawn so that she can go running with me, and by running I mean sprinting circles around me as I shuffle along… I believe she thinks that I am her sheep. 🐑 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post Sundays With Tabs the Cat, Makeup and Beauty Blog Mascot, Vol. 865 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",
