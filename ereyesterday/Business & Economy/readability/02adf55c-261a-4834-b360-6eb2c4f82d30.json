  "text": "The Taihuttus on a ski trip to Sierra Nevada in southern Spain. They sold everything they owned in 2017 to bet on bitcoin — and now travel full-time as a family of five.Didi TaihuttuA wave of high-profile kidnappings targeting cryptocurrency executives has rattled the industry — and prompted a quiet security revolution among some of its most visible evangelists.Didi Taihuttu, patriarch of the so-called \"Bitcoin Family,\" said he overhauled the family's entire security setup after a string of threats.The Taihuttus — who sold everything they owned in 2017, from their house to their shoes, to go all-in on bitcoin when it was trading around $900 — have long lived on the outer edge of crypto ideology. They travel full-time with their three daughters and remain entirely unbanked.Over the past eight months, he said, the family ditched hardware wallets in favor of a hybrid system: Part analog, part digital, with seed phrases encrypted, split, and stored either through blockchain-based encryption services or hidden across four continents.\"We have changed everything,\" Taihuttu told CNBC on a call from Phuket, Thailand. \"Even if someone held me at gunpoint, I can't give them more than what's on my wallet on my phone. And that's not a lot.\"CNBC first reported on the family's unconventional storage system in 2022, when Taihuttu described hiding hardware wallets across multiple continents — in places ranging from rental apartments in Europe to self-storage units in South America.The Taihuttu family dressed up for Halloween in Phuket, Thailand, where they recently moved homes after receiving disturbing messages pinpointing their location from YouTube videos.Didi TaihuttuAs physical attacks on crypto holders become more frequent, even they are rethinking their exposure.This week, Moroccan police arrested a 24-year-old suspected of orchestrating a series of brutal kidnappings targeting crypto executives.One victim, the father of a crypto millionaire, was allegedly held for days in a house south of Paris — and reportedly had a finger severed during the ordeal.In a separate case earlier this year, a co-founder of French wallet firm Ledger and his wife were abducted from their home in central France in a ransom scheme that also targeted another Ledger executive.Last month in New York, authorities said, a 28-year-old Italian tourist was kidnapped and tortured for 17 days in a Manhattan apartment by attackers trying to extract his bitcoin password — shocking him with wires, beating him with a gun, and strapping an Apple AirTag around his neck to track his movements.The common thread: The pursuit of crypto credentials that enable instant, irreversible transfers of virtual assets.\"It is definitely frightening to see a lot of these kidnappings happen,\" said JP Richardson, CEO of crypto wallet company Exodus. He urged users to take security into their own hands by choosing self-custody, storing larger sums on hardware wallets, and — for those holding significant assets — exploring multi-signature wallets, a setup typically used by institutions.Richardson also recommended spreading funds across different wallet types and avoiding large balances in hot wallets to reduce risk without sacrificing flexibility.That rising sense of vulnerability is fueling a new demand for physical protection with insurance firms now racing to offer kidnap and ransom (K\u0026R) policies tailored to crypto holders.But Taihuttu isn't waiting for corporate solutions. He's opted for complete decentralization — of not just his finances, but his personal risk profile.As the family prepares to return to Europe from Thailand, safety has become a constant topic of conversation.\"We've been talking about it a lot as a family,\" Taihuttu said. \"My kids read the news, too — especially that story in France, where the daughter of a CEO was almost kidnapped on the street.\"Now, he said, his daughters are asking difficult questions: What if someone tries to kidnap us? What's the plan?One of the steel plates the Taihuttu family uses to store part of their bitcoin seed phrase. Didi etched it by hand using a hammer and letter punch — part of a decentralized storage system spread across four continents.Didi TaihuttuThough the girls carry only small amounts of crypto in their personal wallets, the family has decided to avoid France entirely.\"We got a little bit famous in a niche market — but that niche is becoming a really big market now,\" Taihuttu said. \"And I think we'll see more and more of these robberies. So yeah, we're definitely going to skip France.\"Even in Thailand, Taihuttu recently stopped posting travel updates and filming at home after receiving disturbing messages from strangers who claimed to have identified his location from YouTube vlogs.\"We stayed in a very beautiful house for six months — then I started getting emails from people who figured out which house it was. They warned me to be careful, told me not to leave my kids alone,\" he said. \"So we moved. And now we don't film anything at all.\"\"It's a strange world at the moment,\" he said. \"So we're taking our own precautions — and when it comes to wallets, we're now completely hardware wallet-less. We don't use any hardware wallets anymore.\"To throw off would-be attackers, Didi Taihuttu encrypts select words from each 24-word seed phrase — then splits the phrases into four sets of six and hides them around the world.Didi TaihuttuThe family's new system involves splitting a single 24-word bitcoin seed phrase — the cryptographic key that unlocks access to their crypto holdings — into four sets of six words, each stored in a different geographic location. Some are kept digitally through blockchain-based encryption platforms, while others are etched by hand into fireproof steel plates using a hammer and letter punch, then hidden in physical locations across four continents.\"Even if someone finds 18 of the 24 words, they can't do anything,\" Taihuttu explained.On top of that, he's added a layer of personal encryption, swapping out select words to throw off would-be attackers. The method is simple, but effective.\"You only need to remember which ones you changed,\" he said.Part of the reason for ditching hardware wallets, Taihuttu said, was a growing mistrust of third-party devices. Concerns about backdoors and remote access features — including a controversial update by Ledger in 2023 — prompted the family to abandon physical hardware altogether in favor of encrypted paper and steel backups.While the family still holds some crypto in \"hot\" wallets — for daily spending or to run their algorithmic trading strategy — those funds are protected by multi-signature approvals, which require multiple parties to sign off before a transaction can be executed.The Taihuttus use Safe — formerly Gnosis Safe — for ether and other altcoins, and similarly layered setups for bitcoin stored on centralized platforms like Bybit.Didi Taihuttu during a recent visit to Sierra Nevada, Spain. The family’s lifestyle — unbanked, nomadic, and all-in on bitcoin — makes them outliers even in the crypto world.Didi TaihuttuAbout 65% of the family's crypto is locked in cold storage across four continents — a decentralized system Taihuttu prefers to centralized vaults like the Swiss Alps bunker used by Coinbase-owned Xapo. Those facilities may offer physical protection and inheritance services, but Taihuttu said they require too much trust.\"What happens if one of those companies goes bankrupt? Will I still have access?\" he said. \"You're putting your capital back in someone else's hands.\"Instead, Taihuttu holds his own keys — hidden across the globe. He can top up the wallets remotely with new deposits, but accessing them would require at least one international trip, depending on which fragments of the seed phrase are needed. The funds, he added, are intended as a long-term pension to be accessed only if bitcoin hits $1 million — a milestone he's targeting for 2033.The shift toward multiparty protections extends beyond just multi-signature. Multi-party computation, or MPC, is gaining traction as a more advanced security model.Didi, Romaine, and their three daughters live largely off-grid, managing crypto through decentralized exchanges, algorithmic trading bots, and a globally distributed cold storage system.Didi TaihuttuInstead of storing private keys in one place — a vulnerability known as a \"single point of compromise\" — MPC splits a key into encrypted shares distributed across multiple parties. Transactions can only go through when a threshold number of those parties approve, sharply reducing the risk of theft or unauthorized access.Multi-signature wallets require several parties to approve a transaction. MPC takes that further by cryptographically splitting the private key itself, ensuring that no single individual ever holds the full key — not even their own complete share.The shift comes amid renewed scrutiny of centralized crypto platforms like Coinbase, which recently disclosed a data breach affecting tens of thousands of customers.Taihuttu, for his part, says 80% of his trading now happens on decentralized exchanges like Apex — a peer-to-peer platform that allows users to set buy and sell orders without relinquishing custody of their funds, marking a return to crypto's original ethos.While he declined to reveal his total holdings, Taihuttu did share his goal for the current bull cycle: a $100 million net worth, with 60% still held in bitcoin. The rest is a mix of ether, layer-1 tokens like solana, link, sui, and a growing number of AI and education-focused startups — including his own platform offering blockchain and life-skills courses for kids.Lately, he's also considering stepping back from the spotlight.\"It's really my passion to create content. It's really what I love to do every day,\" he said. \"But if it's not safe anymore for my daughters ... I really need to think about them.\"WATCH: 'Bitcoin Family' tracks moon cycles to make crypto investment decisions",

MPC takes that further by cryptographically splitting the private key itself, ensuring that no single individual ever holds the full key — not even their own complete share.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe shift comes amid renewed scrutiny of centralized crypto platforms like \u003cspan data-test=\"QuoteInBody\" id=\"RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-12\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/COIN/\"\u003eCoinbase\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\" data-analytics-id=\"-WatchlistDropdown\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, which recently disclosed a\u003ca href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/blog/protecting-our-customers-standing-up-to-extortionists\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e data breach\u003c/a\u003e affecting \u003ca href=\"https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/f61fae18-f669-499e-9a87-f4d323d281f8.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etens of thousands\u003c/a\u003e of customers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaihuttu, for his part, says 80% of his trading now happens on decentralized exchanges like Apex — a peer-to-peer platform that allows users to set buy and sell orders without relinquishing custody of their funds, marking a return to crypto\u0026#39;s original ethos.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile he declined to reveal his total holdings, Taihuttu did share his goal for the current bull cycle: a $100 million net worth, with 60% still held in bitcoin.
