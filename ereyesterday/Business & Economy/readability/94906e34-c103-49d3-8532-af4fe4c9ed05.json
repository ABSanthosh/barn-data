Kent Nishimura | ReutersPresident Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" cleared a key procedural hurdle in the U.S. Senate late Saturday night, pushing the massive spending package one step closer to the president's desk.The vote on a motion to proceed to final debate on the bill passed with 51 yeas and 49 nays. Every Democrat and two Republicans, Sens. Thom Tillis, N.C., and Rand Paul, Ky., voted against it.The actual voting took hours and the measure only passed after three Republican holdouts — Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Rick Scott of Florida and Cynthia Lummus of Wyoming — folded and voted yes.Sen. Ron Johnson, Wis., an outspoken critic of the bill, ultimately changed his vote to a \"yes\" from a \"no.\" That additional Republican vote gave the bill 51 yeas, so Vice President JD Vance did not need to cast a vote to break a tie.The ultimate vote was a victory for Republican Majority Leader John Thune, S.D., who has pledged to get the bill to Trump for his signature by July 4.Trump hailed the late-night vote passage and she he was \"VERY PROUD OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TONIGHT\" in an all-caps, late-night Truth Social post.But the hours of uncertainty and last-minute wrangling underscore the tricky path ahead for the controversial package.Saturday's procedural vote tees up a final Senate vote on the megabill that will likely happen sometime Sunday or Monday.Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are forcing the 940-page bill to be read out loud once it heads to full debate on the Senate floor Sunday.\"We will be here all night if that's what it takes to read it,\" Schumer wrote Saturday on X.Read more CNBC politics coverageElon Musk rips into 'utterly insane' Trump-backed megabillTrump loses latest bid to get Central Park Five defamation lawsuit tossedWho stands to benefit from the Senate's version of Trump's spending billGOP Rep.
