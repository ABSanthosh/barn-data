Upgrade Now In This Article: Cathie Wood is back in the spotlight, and so is her flagship ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK). After a rough year, the fund is showing signs of life—but is this the start of a real comeback, or just another short-lived rally? Investors are split, and the numbers tell an interesting story. So far this year, ARKK is up 6%—a solid lead over the S\u0026P 500's 2% gain and the Nasdaq's 1% increase. That's a welcome shift after 2024, when ARKK returned 12%—not bad, but nowhere near the S\u0026P 500's 24% surge. Don't Miss: The $1.3 Billion Startup Investment Boom: How This Company's Explosive Growth Is Opening Doors For Everyday Investors With A New $500 Minimum ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Looking at the bigger picture, ARKK's longer-term numbers tell a more complicated story. Over the past three years, its annualized return is -5.89%, and its five-year return barely hits 1.03%. By comparison, the S\u0026P 500 has delivered 13.14% and 14.27% over the same periods. That's why some investors are still wary—last year, ARKK saw nearly $3 billion in outflows, as Yahoo Finance reports. Michael Burry, best known for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, has been one of ARKK's loudest critics. He argues that many of its holdings burn through cash at unsustainable rates, and at one point, he even shorted the fund. Burry sees ARKK as too dependent on speculative growth stocks with shaky profitability. Trending: This 12,000 RPM Spinning Battery With Over $100 Million In LOIs Could Be The Missing Link For Green Energy — Here’s Why Early Investors Are Flocking To Invest Before Funding Closes Morningstar analyst Robby Greengold has also been skeptical of ARK Invest. Greengold downgraded the ARK Innovation ETF to a negative rating, citing concerns over risk management and portfolio concentration. He believes the firm lacks structured risk management and relies too much on aggressive forecasting. The strategist outlines his concerns, pointing out that while Wood's strategy is bold, it also lacks a benchmarking strategy. But Wood isn't backing down. She believes that regulatory rollbacks and technological advancements will fuel long-term innovation, and she's sticking to her guns. On Feb. 20, ARK Invest bought another 170,778 shares of Beam Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:BEAM), a move that reinforces her faith in genomics and precision medicine.",
