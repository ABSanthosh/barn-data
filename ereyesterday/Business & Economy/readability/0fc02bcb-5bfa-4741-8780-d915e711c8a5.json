They have taken on more urgency as subscribers leave the carrier for larger rivals like Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.   A successful loan raise would help Vodafone Idea fund its capital expenditure and roll out a speedier network as it looks to reclaim market share.  In April, the government had increased its stake in the money-losing carrier to 48.99 per cent after converting a part of its spectrum payment dues into equity. A representative of Vodafone Idea declined to comment while State Bank of India did not immediately respond to Bloomberg’s email seeking comments.  Global banks too are expected to join the consortium, the people said, adding that the fund raising drive would be concluded in an year.  In response to media reports suggesting relief on outstanding federal dues, Vodafone Idea said on June 24 that it had not received any official communication from the government. In May, the company’s board had approved raising of 200 billion rupees through equity or loans. More From This SectionDon't miss the most important news and views of the day.
