  "text": "Covid-19 cases are on the rise across India, with 3,395 active infections as of Saturday, May 31. According to latest data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), the highest number of active cases has been recorded in Kerala (1,336), Maharashtra (467), Delhi (375), Gujarat (265), Karnataka (234), West Bengal (205), Tamil Nadu (185), and Uttar Pradesh (117).  In the last 24 hours, four deaths (all men) have been reported — one each from Delhi, Kerala, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh.  The country witnessed a steep increase in active Covid-19 cases, rising from 257 on May 22 to 1,010 by May 26, and further surging to 3,395 by May 31. In the past 24 hours alone, 685 new infections were recorded.   Officials have urged the public not to panic, noting that most cases remain mild in nature. According to data, 265 people have been discharged from hospitals over the past 24 hours.  Delhi currently reports 375 active cases — an increase of 81 since the yesterday — and one death. The deceased was identified as a “71-year-old male with pneumonia, septic shock with  acute kidney injury.” On May 23, the Delhi government issued an advisory instructing hospitals to ensure sufficient availability of beds, oxygen, essential medications, and operational equipment, including ventilators and BiPAP machines.  Several state governments have issued advisories to address the evolving situation.  New Sub-Variants Identified: NB.1.8.1 and LF.7 The recent spike in Covid cases across certain states is being linked to the emergence of two new sub-variants — NB.1.8.1 and LF.7. These variants show genetic variations from earlier strains and are under close watch by health authorities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has categorized them as “Variants Under Monitoring,” not yet as “Variants of Concern\"  due to their growing global spread and ability to evade immune defenses.  Should you be concerned? These subvariants are more transmissible than its predecessors and have contributed to rising cases and hospitalisations in countries like China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Australia. While they have not been linked to increased severity, their rapid transmission has led health authorities to recommend caution—particularly for vulnerable and high-risk populations. Vaccination continues to be the most effective protection, experts emphasise, along with the use of masks in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces.",
