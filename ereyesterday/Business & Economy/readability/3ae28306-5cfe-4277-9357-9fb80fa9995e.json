  "description": "On a trip to Las Vegas, Chris Riccobono found himself wearing the same J.Crew shirt over and over; it was the only dress shirt he had that looked good untucked. All of his other button-downs were too long and looked sloppy. His buddies all said they had the same problem, so Chris decided to seize the opportunity and launch UNTUCKit with a friend. Keeping his day job as a  GE salesman, he embarked on a crash course in how not to make a shirt. Thousands of defective button-downs later, UNTUCKit hit its stride, and the big fashion brands began to copy the untucked look. In 2020, UNTUCKit came within inches of a lucrative acquisition, then nearly went bankrupt, but today has grown into a thriving brand.  This episode was produced by J.C.
