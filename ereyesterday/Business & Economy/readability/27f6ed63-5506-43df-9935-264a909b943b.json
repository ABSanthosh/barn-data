The fact that Americans are living longer has made the usual approach to financial planning incomplete, according to a new study of approximately 1,200 people and 10 focus groups by MIT AgeLab and Transamerica. The traditional three-part plan of education, work and retirement and aiming to ensure that people have enough to live comfortably in retirement, fails to take into account the growing longevity of Americans, it concludes. Instead, the researchers behind the report advocate focusing on three factors: well-being, work and finances as the three major phases of adulthood. Do you have questions about long-term planning for retirement? Speak with a financial advisor today. Americans are living much longer than their grandparents and great-grandparents, with the average life expectancy growing from 68 years in 1950 to nearly 79 years by 2009. With these longer lifespans come longer retirements. While a man retiring in 1970 lived less than 13 years in retirement, the average length of retirement for men in 2020 was nearly 19 years. Someone who’s 65 in 2023 has about a 50% likelihood of living two more decades. This trend is expected to continue. While there were approximately 92,000 octogenarians in America as of 2020, that figure is expected to nearly triple in less than 25 years, for an estimated total of 270,000 Americans older than 100 by 2045. In other words, if they stop working at age 67, they could spend as much as 33 years in retirement. To get a feeling for just how long 33 years can be, consider that in 1990 George H. W. Bush was president, Madonna was at the top of the music charts and the No. 1 TV show was “Cheers.” “While Americans are generally optimistic about their future, they may not fully appreciate how much their financial needs, priorities, and life circumstances will change over time,” said Dr. Joseph Coughlin, director of MIT AgeLab. “More than ever, planning for longevity means understanding what matters most at each stage of adulthood, finding balance, and supporting priorities with the behaviors and actions that lead to a better future.” Phil Eckman, president of Workplace Solutions at Transamerica, said that “the way we approach our lives and the way we work is changing. People want flexibility and choice in all parts of their life, both at work and home.” Traditional financial planning was built around what, by today’s standards, was a comparatively short retirement. That meant leisure was the focus, building a nest egg adequate to fund what now looks like a comparatively short retirement. But now that the length of retirement has grown substantially, this phase of life is dynamic rather than solely centered around leisure.",
