Mumbai: For the first time in nearly a decade, the budget prioritises consumption and savings over capital expenditure. While analysts debate whether this shift is a temporary adjustment or a broader paradigm change, several sectors including agriculture, capital goods, cement, consumer, financials, telecom, and utilities are poised to benefit from the measures in the budget. Here is a sector-wise breakdown of how they stand to gain: AutoThe revised income tax slabs are expected to boost disposable income, driving demand, particularly in the entry-level segment for two-wheelers and cars which have faced sustained weakness in recent years. Additionally, the government has added 35 capital goods to the list of exempted items required for lithium-ion battery manufacturing, providing a significant boost to electric vehicles (EVs).Top Picks: Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, M\u0026M, Samvardhana Motherson International, Happy ForgingsCapital GoodsCapital expenditure allocation has grown 10% year-on-year, with the capital outlay for defence increased to ₹1.8 trillion for FY26. The budget also includes incentives for electricity distribution reforms and intra-state transmission capacity expansion. A five-year Asset Monetisation Plan (2025-30) worth ₹10 trillion has been launched to reinvest capital into new projects. Additionally, the Jal Jeevan Mission received a higher allocation of ₹67,000 crore for FY26 after a limited outlay in FY25. Top Picks: L\u0026T, ABB, Bharat ElectronicsCementHigher budgetary allocations for housing schemes and infrastructure are expected to indirectly drive cement demand. The ₹1.5- trillion interest-free loans to states for capex and related incentives will further benefit cement manufacturers. Top Picks: UltraTech Cement, JK CementConsumersRevised tax slabs are set to enhance disposable income, supporting a broad-based consumption recovery. Staple companies stand to benefit the most, as savings are likely to be directed toward essential products. Other consumer segments including quick-service restaurants (QSR), innerwear, and liquor, are also expected to witness higher demand. Notably, cigarette companies received a reprieve, with no increase in tax rates. Top Picks: Trent, HUL, Titan, Page Industries, Metro BrandsFinancialsExpansion of the MSME credit guarantee scheme is projected to unlock an additional ₹1.5 lakh crore in credit over the next five years, serving as a tailwind for companies focused on MSME financing. Additionally, incentives for electricity distribution reforms aim to strengthen the financial stability of power companies.Top Picks: Shriram Finance, PNB Housing, PFC, RECMetalsInfrastructure capex has been increased from ₹10.2 trillion to ₹11.2 trillion in FY26. With infrastructure comprising 60% of domestic steel demand, along with construction (20%) and automobiles (8%), the sector stands to benefit from accelerated government spending. This is crucial for reviving subdued domestic steel demand due to factors such as the general election in 2024, slower pace of capex and elevated imports.Top Picks: JSW Steel, Coal India(Source: Motilal Oswal Financial Services)Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
