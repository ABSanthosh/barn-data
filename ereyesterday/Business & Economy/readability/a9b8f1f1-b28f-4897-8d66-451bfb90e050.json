Many of Trump's top picks have been confirmed by the Senate. “We're gonna solve a lot of problems,” Trump said at the top of the meeting.  (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
