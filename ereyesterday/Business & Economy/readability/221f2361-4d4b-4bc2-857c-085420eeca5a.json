Infosys said it had received communication from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) ‘closing’ the pre-show cause notice proceedings for the financial years 2018–19 to 2021–22. In a regulatory filing, the firm said: “With the receipt of today’s communication from DGGI, this matter stands closed.” In a separate regulatory filing to the National Stock Exchange, the company said: “It may be noted that the Company had received and responded to a pre-show cause notice issued by DGGI for the period July 2017 to March 2022 on the issue of non-payment of IGST under Reverse Charge Mechanism.”  Also Read The GST amount as per the pre-show cause notice for this period was Rs 32,403 crore. “The Company had on 3 August 2024 received a communication from DGGI closing the pre-show cause notice proceedings for the financial year 2017–18,” the company said in the filing.
