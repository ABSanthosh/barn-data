On the contrary, they have trimmed their stakes further since October, continuing their selling spree from most of the earlier part of 2024. Since October 1, when the market began declining, promoters of nearly 120 mid- and small-cap companies have sold shares worth ₹7,000 crore. Agencies\"The promoter selling since October is not out of the ordinary,\" said Sahil Shah, chief investment officer at Equirus. \"This happens even in subdued markets, where promoters and private equity funds liquidate holdings due to regulatory requirements, fund lifecycle completion, debt reduction at the promoter level, or personal reasons such as diversification or funding new ventures.\"In this period, founders of 80 firms mopped up shares to the tune of ₹700 crore.In the September quarter, promoters of nearly 180 companies cashed out holdings worth ₹38,000 crore amid the record-breaking run in the stock market as share valuations were considered elevated after the three-year bull run. Company founders or funds part of the promoter group sold shares worth more than ₹1,00,000 crore in 2024.Nifty fell 8% since October 1 while Nifty Midcap 150 and Small cap 250 indices declined 11% and 14%, respectively, during this period. Many stocks are down 30-50% from their peaks. In November, German auto component supplier ZF Group sold a 4.32% stake in its Indian subsidiary ZF Commercial Vehicles Control System for Rs 1,022 crore. The stock has plunged 33% since October1. Italian multinational FILA Group — one of the promoters of DOMS Industries — sold 4.6% stake for Rs 798 crore through an open market transaction in December. In the same month, Usha Madhukar Chandurkar, one of the promoters of Ipca Laboratories divested a 1.6% stake in the pharmaceutical company for Rs 600 crore through an open market transaction. Similarly, Awfis Space Solutions promoter Peak XV Partners Investments sold 53.50 lakh shares for Rs 378 crore. Promoters of Page Industries sold 1.66 lakh shares of the company to raise around Rs 750 crore during November and December. Feroze Azeez, Deputy CEO of Anand Rathi Wealth, said while investors should exercise some caution in companies where promoters are selling, there is no need to press the panic button. On the other hand, promoters of nearly 80 companies including Cigniti Technologies, Jindal Stainless, Poonawalla Fincorp, Quess Corp, Fairchem Organics, Jindal Drilling, Snowman Logistics, Mangalam Cement among others have bought shares worth Rs 700 crore.
