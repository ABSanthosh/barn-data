Shares of the crypto exchange jumped 8% in extended trading. The change will take effect before trading on May 19. Discover is in the process of being acquired by Capital One Financial.Since going public through a direct listing in 2021, Coinbase has become a bigger part of the U.S. financial system, with bitcoin soaring in value and large institutions gaining regulatory approval to create spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin spiked last week, topping $100,000 and nearing its record price reached in January. However, Coinbase has been a particularly volatile stock and is trading well below its peak from late 2021. The shares closed on Monday at $207.22, giving the company a market cap of $53 billion. At its high, the stock traded at over $357.Stocks added to the S\u0026P 500 often rise in value because funds that track the S\u0026P 500 will add it to their portfolios.The index, which is heavily weighted towards tech because of the massive market caps of the industry's heavyweights, continues to add companies from across the sector. In September, Dell and defense software provider Palantir were added to the S\u0026P 500, following artificial intelligence server maker Super Micro Computer and security software vendor CrowdStrike earlier last year. To join the S\u0026P 500, a company must have reported a profit in its latest quarter and have cumulative profit over the four most recent quarters.Coinbase last week reported net income of $65.6 million, or 24 cents a share, down from $1.18 billion, or $4.40 a share a year earlier, after accounting for the fair value of its crypto investments. Revenue rose 24% to $2.03 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago.Also last week, Coinbase announced plans to buy Dubai-based Deribit, a major crypto derivatives exchange for $2.9 billion. The deal, which is the largest in the crypto industry to date, will help Coinbase broaden its footprint outside the U.S.Coinbase shares are down 17% this year, underperforming bitcoin, which is now up about 10% over that stretch.
