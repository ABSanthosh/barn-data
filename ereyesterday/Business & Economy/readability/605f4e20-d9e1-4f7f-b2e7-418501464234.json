  "description": "Sweetgreen’s co-founder Jonathan Neman joins Guy on the Advice Line to answer questions from three early-stage founders. Plus, Sweetgreen’s plans to automate salad assembly in the coming years. First, we meet Dini from Maryland, who's learning how to maintain her brand’s character and product quality as her pie company scales. Next we hear from Matt in Massachusetts, who’s leaning into success growing premium mushrooms for local chefs without getting too big, too fast. Then Joey in Chicago, owner of a restaurant specializing in fried chicken wings and fresh-cut fries, who’s deciding whether to introduce new products or double down on what’s already working.Thank you to the founders of Dini’s Divine Pies, Underground Mushroom Co. and Dak Dak Korean Wings for being part of the show.
