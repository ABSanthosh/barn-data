The trust you put in me is humbling. I will look back fondly on my years of serving as your voice in Washington,\" Green wrote in a post on X.With his resignation, Republicans are down to a 219-212 majority in the House, at least until his seat in the solidly red district is filled.His resignation will be effective July 20, Fox News reports from a letter Green sent to House Republican leadership.Green's resignation is a blow to House Speaker Mike Johnson's already narrow majority in the lower chamber, a fact that was on stark display this week as he was trying to pass President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\"Johnson struggled to coalesce his conference around the megabill, and the narrow majority gave him little wiggle room for defections. With Green's resignation, Johnson's could face an even more challenging road ahead.Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, said he was returning to the private sector to start his own business, but did not provide details about the business.\"While I cannot give the details here, I will be doing something specifically designed to help America compete against the CCP [Chinese Communist Party], but this time in business,\" Green said in a video on X.Green was elected to serve in Congress in 2018, succeeding Sen. Marsha Blackburn.Read more CNBC politics coverageBessent: Tariffs will 'boomerang' back to April levels by Aug. 1 for countries without dealsRep.
