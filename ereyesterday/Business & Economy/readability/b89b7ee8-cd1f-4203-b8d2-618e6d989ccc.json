  "text": "BFSI's double-digit Q2FY25 earnings growth versus Nifty's 4% year-on-year net profit uptick makes it a preferred D-Street sectoral bet for brokerages and analysts who remain bullish on large banks and NBFCs.Having underperformed the broader Nifty since July, experts see the rally to begin once the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) starts cutting interest rates. But the Q2 performance provides a much-needed tailwind, they opine. Banks’ profits remain strong despite moderation while net interest margins (NIMs) seem to be stabilising on a sequential basis though they are still down on a YoY basis, Nuvama said, adding that benign credit costs also augurs well for the sector. \"The earnings growth was driven by BFSI (+15% YoY) with PSU Banks (+34% YoY against expected 17% growth) and NBFC non-lending (+92% YoY versus expectations of 85% growth) leading from the front,\" a Motilal Oswal note said.Calling Q2 a decent quarter for banks with a few exceptions, Kranthi Bathini, Director-Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities said that large banks should be a long term bet for investors as they would be instrumental in taking the Indian economy forward. Between NBFCs and banks, he prefers the latter, saying that regulator hurdles and liquidity issues are expected to weigh on the former.The next trigger could be a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which is desired by the sector but is not likely to manifest in the near term. Large banks are more equipped to handle liquidity issues, he opined. Expert Nilesh Jain, who is Head (VP), Equity Research Technical and Derivatives at Centrum Broking is also bullish on financials, especially NBFCs and private sector banks.Banks' Q2, returns report cardETMarkets analysis finds 25 banks out of 41, posting a net profit growth in double digits while Yes Bank delivered a 145% YoY surge.

It is followed by Manappuram Finance (-25%) and L\u0026T Finance (-24.05%).Stocks to buyNuvama remains overweight on banks and has picked ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, State Bank of India (SBI). While it sees Q2FY25 earning \"soft and mixed\" for most lenders, a sharper slowdown in unsecured loans is positive from a capital conservation and risk perspective, it opined. The brokerage alo highlighted superior performance by state lenders versus their private peers.IndusInd Bank, SBI Card and AU SFB are a no go area for Nuvama.Top buys of Motilal Oswal are HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, AU SFB, IndusInd Bank, SBI, Bank of Baroda (BoB), Canara Bank and Union Bank.
