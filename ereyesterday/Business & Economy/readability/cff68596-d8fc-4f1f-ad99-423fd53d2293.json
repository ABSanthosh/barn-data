  "text": "For much of 2024, Americans from across our great nation have been focused on Election Day. Although not every aspect of the legislative process has a bearing on Wall Street, the officials who are elected, and the party ultimately in charge, help to shape the fiscal policy that affects the U.S. economy and the businesses that make it tick. While most of the focus has been placed on which candidate will win the race for the Oval Office — as of this writing on Nov. 6 at 2:05 a.m., ET, former President Donald Trump has a greater than 95% chance of victory, per the Associated Press (AP) — the makeup of Congress often proves far more important. This is because votes in the House of Representatives and Senate are needed to pass bills. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » In the early morning hours, AP made the call that Republicans would control the Senate, beginning Jan. 3, 2025 — and that's generally good news for Wall Street, based on what history tells us. Image source: Getty Images. Although the final tally could still be hours or days away, what we know right now is that Republicans hold at least 51 seats in the 100-seat Senate, with seven races yet to be called. This marks the first time in four years that the GOP will control the upper house. At the moment, it's too early to speculate what a Senate win for the Republicans might mean in terms of fiscal policy. If the GOP wins the House and the presidency, a unified government may make it easier to pass certain legislation. But if Congress ends up divided, with Democrats in control of the House of Representatives, we could be looking at more political gridlock. Perhaps the closest thing to certainty for Wall Street and businesses is that corporate tax rates are unlikely to increase anytime soon from a historically low 21%. Democratic Party presidential nominee Kamala Harris had campaigned on the idea of increasing the corporate tax rate by 33%, from 21% to 28%, to raise additional revenue and lower the federal deficit. A Republican-controlled Senate effectively takes tax hikes for businesses off the table. A historically low corporate tax rate has played a key role in enticing Wall Street's biggest businesses to conduct substantive share buybacks. The companies that comprise the S\u0026P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) spent nearly $236 billion on share repurchases in the June-ended quarter, and have tallied more than $7 trillion in buybacks over the trailing-10-year period, according to S\u0026P Global.",
