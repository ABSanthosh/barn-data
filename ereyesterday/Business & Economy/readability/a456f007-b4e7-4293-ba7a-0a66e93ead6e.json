  "description": "This week marks a huge milestone for the HBR IdeaCast: our 1000th episode! Since the podcast launched in 2006, so much has happened. What hasn’t changed is our commitment to sharing in-depth conversations with expert thinkers on key business, management, and leadership issues. To celebrate, hosts Alison Beard and Curt Nickisch have scoured the archive for ten episodes with top-notch insights to give your career a rocket boost. The curated selection features a diverse group of academics—from business strategy icon Michael Porter to burnout researcher Christina Maslach—and practitioners, such as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Oscar-winning director Ron Howard. Their powerful ideas and timeless advice cover a range of communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills that are essential for success—whether you’re in your first job, managing a team, or leading an organization. Listen to the episodes: #677: Why People — and Companies — Need Purpose (2019) #114: Speaking Well in Tough Moments (2008) #371: Lead Authentically, Without Oversharing (2013) #924: How One F-35 Fighter Pilot Makes Decisions Under Pressure (2023) #949: Making Peace with Your Midlife, Mid-career Self (2024) #889: Ron Howard on Collaborative Leadership and Career Longevity (2022) #596: Microsoft’s CEO on Rediscovering the Company’s Soul (2017) #595: Transcending Either-Or Decision Making (2017) #771: Why Burnout Happens — and How Bosses Can Help (2020) #229: How to Fix Capitalism (2011) The IdeaCast team would like to thank all the guests who've contributed their voices and expertise as well as all the people who've made the show possible behind the scenes.",
