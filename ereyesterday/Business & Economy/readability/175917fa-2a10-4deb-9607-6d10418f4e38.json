However, since February 1, 2025, is a settlement holiday, trades and fund transactions from January 31 and February 1 will be settled on Monday, February 3, 2025. The T+0 settlement session will also be suspended for the day.Why is the stock market open on Budget day?The decision to keep the markets open on a Saturday aligns with past practices, when markets opened on Saturdays for budget announcements, notably in 2020 and 2015. This allows investors to react promptly to the fiscal policies, tax reforms, and sector-specific allocations announced in the Union Budget, which can significantly influence market movements.Historically, the Union Budget was presented on the last working day of February. However, in 2017, then-Finance Minister Arun Jaitley moved the date to February 1, providing the government more time to implement its policies within the current financial year. Since then, the Union Budget has been presented on this date each year.Also read | Time to buy the dip?
