Fortune will be reporting on the election as it unfolds throughout the night and into the following morning. We'll have results, maps, reactions, and much more. As we wait for the first results to arrive, here's some important information as Election Day turns to Election Night. What are the results looking like so far? Our official tally: Kamala Harris has been declared victor in 1 state—Vermont—capturing 3 electoral votes. Donald Trump has been declared victor in 3 states—Indiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia—capturing 23 electoral votes. Remember, you need 270 electoral votes to win the U.S. presidential election. When do polls close? Below is a complete rundown of when polls will close for every U.S. state.
