The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), the largest Canadian investor in India, has been trimming its stakes in Indian stocks over the past year, while other funds Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec (CDPQ) and British Columbia Investment Management have kept their holdings in the country unchanged.CPPIB, which held listed equities worth ₹45,000 crore ($5.46 billion) as of March 31, has sold shares worth ₹8,500 crore ($1 billion) so far in FY25.The selling by some of these funds could have more to do with the rich share valuations of Indian stocks or reshuffling of their underperforming holdings than on account of diplomatic friction between the two countries, said analysts. Agencies\"Foreign funds like CPPIB will continue to invest and stay invested in India unless diplomatic relations between the two countries completely break down and their governments take drastic measures, which seems unlikely at this point,\" said VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist, Geojit Financial Services.CPPIB held more than 1% stake in five listed Indian companies as of June 2024. Several companies are yet to disclose their latest shareholding patterns.The fund's largest investment in India was in Kotak Mahindra Bank in which it held a 2.68% stake in the bank as of March 2024. In June it sold about 3.3 crore shares or 1.6% stake through open market transactions for ₹6,123 crores. In July, CPPIB sold a 0.52% stake in Nykaa for ₹256 crore and a 3.18% stake in Delhivery for ₹910 crore. Earlier in February CPPIB sold a 2% stake in the telecom tower infrastructure services provider Indus Tower for ₹1,223 crore.\"Considering India's status as the world's fastest-growing economy, Canadian funds are unlikely to sell their stakes in a hurry unless tensions escalate and the government enacts policies against investing in India,\" said U R Bhat, co-founder of Alphaniti. \"Most of these funds are pension funds and long-term investors, so they are unlikely to change their investment strategies based on short-term events.\"CPPIB held a stake in nearly 139 stocks as of March 31, 2024, worth $5.46 billion, according to Refinitiv data. They held 11.61 million shares in Reliance Industries worth $414 million as of March 31, 2024, while their other large investment includes 21.58 million shares in Infosys, 149 million shares in Zomato, 6.11 million shares in Tata Consultancy Services.AgenciesCDPQ has invested in 216 stocks with an asset under management of $2.3 billion as of March 2024 which has increased by $91 million in a year. Some of its largest investments include HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, Axis Bank, Adani Ent, Mahindra and Mahindra among others. \"India has been the best-performing emerging equity market over the last ten to twenty years, and no other emerging market offers the same level of diversity and growth prospects as India,\" said Vijayakumar. Three Canadian funds such as CPPIB and pension funds for Quebec workers and Ontario school teachers have opened their offices in Mumbai or New Delhi in recent years.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
