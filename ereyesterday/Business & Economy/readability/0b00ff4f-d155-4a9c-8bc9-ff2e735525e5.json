Domestic institutions were buyers to the tune of ₹5,185.65 crore.\"The IT sector was the major contributor to Monday's fall as the weak macro data in the US has led to the expectations of an economic slowdown, which weakened the sentiment for Indian IT companies,\" said Sunny Agrawal, head of research at SBI Securities.He said the Nifty has cracked below a crucial support of 22,800.Asian markets ended weak Monday after US indices fell 1.5-2.2% Friday - posting their biggest fall of 2025 - after economic data showed weakness.

Sheth said the market breadth is already in the oversold territory with only 14.2% of stocks out of the Nifty 500 now trading above their 40-week moving average, compared to 20% in June 2022. NSE’s Volatility Index, or VIX, popularly known as a fear indicator of the market, fell 0.6% to 14.44 levels on Monday. “A relief rally is expected as we enter the next series. We would suggest investors buy precious metals, focus on large caps and continue their SIPs at this stage,” said Sheth. Agrawal said the cement sector provides a good contrarian bet at this time, along with hotels and auto ancillaries, which are providing valuation comfort and a better outlook at this point.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
