Going forward, State Department operations in Canada would \"fall under a significantly reduced team delegated as the North American Affairs Office\" within Secretary of State Marco Rubio's office.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the draft order.The New York Times first reported on the document. Rubio, in response to the article, wrote on X: \"This is fake news.\"The draft order also calls for the termination of offices and positions within the department focused on climate, women's issues, democracy, human rights, migration and criminal justice.In addition to the consolidation of embassies and consulates, the order would make fundamental changes to the hiring practices at the department.The longstanding Foreign Service Officer Test would be scrapped in favor of an evaluation based in part on whether candidates show \"alignment with the president's foreign policy vision.\"The draft order says that the \"full structural reorganization and transition\" should be completed by Oct. 1.It also says that any current foreign services officers or civil service personnel who do not want to take part in the new regional organization structure or \"serve the interests of the administration may elect to voluntarily separate from the department through a one-time buyout and transition program\" until Sept. 30.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump is 'shredding' credibility with allies while China benefits, former advisor John Bolton saysSingapore announces general election on May 3, dissolves parliamentU.S. businesses sue to block Trump tariffs, say trade deficits are not emergencyDOJ charges man in arson attacks on Tesla showroom, Republican HQ in New MexicoHarvard has $2.2B in grants frozen by Trump administration after rejecting demandsTrump administration says it lacks authority to get Abrego Garcia backTrump economic aide Hassett says tariff deals are coming, not recessionWhy Trump's nuclear talks with Iran could be far more successful than Biden's",
