  "text": "Mumbai: Citi said Indian equities appear 'relatively well placed' after the recent declines. It has set a Nifty price target of 26,000 by December, implying an upside of 13.3% over Tuesday's close. The brokerage said the estimated Price to Earnings ratio - a popular valuation measure - at 19 times is near its five-year average, while foreign investors are most underweight in 15 years. HDFC Bank, Kotak, Maruti, Endurance, HDFC Life and Torrent Pharma are among its top picks.\"With a pickup in central govt. capex in the past few months, budgetary support to consumption and the start of rate cuts, growth should pick up, but the impact of reciprocal tariffs from the US will be something to watch out for in select sectors,\" said Citi.",
