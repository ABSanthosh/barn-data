Flows through systematic investment plans (SIPs) into equity mutual funds-the equivalent of recurring fixed deposits in banks-crossed a record ₹25,000 crore every month in the past three thanks to strong returns. But amid forecasts for a tough year for stocks in 2025, market participants are wondering whether individual investors will pour money into equity schemes.Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsSIPs have been a convenient way for retail investors to put small amounts into mutual fund schemes every month. Of this, 90-95% went into equity-oriented funds. The numbers speak about their popularity. In FY21, flows through SIPs were ₹8,007 crore, doubling from ₹3,660 crore in FY17. One reason for their popularity is strong returns from equity mutual funds. Investments made in Nifty 50 through SIPs have returned an average 14.36% over the last three years. That from the Nifty Midcap 150 was 29.89% and 31.85% from the Nifty Small cap 250 index against 7-7.5% from fixed deposits.The Nifty has gained in each of the past nine years. But with foreign investors turning sellers in local stocks and concerns over corporate earnings-considered a key reason for the recent bull run-there is uncertainty over the winning run continuing in 2025.The real test for SIP flows would be a market drawdown or low-single-digit returns. Though such instances are the best time to deploy capital, it needs to be seen if investor behaviour will be any different this time.",
