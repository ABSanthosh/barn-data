  "text": "In This Article: Getting keys to a house by AndreyPopov via iStock Once a penny stock struggling to keep its head above water, online home flipper Opendoor Technologies (OPEN) is staging an astounding comeback. The company’s shares have exploded more than 430% in just one month, transforming OPEN stock from a Wall Street underdog into one of the hottest names on the tape. The meteoric rise gained ferocious momentum starting on July 14, when EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson disclosed a new position in OPEN. Jackson called the stock a potential “100-bagger” and projected the company would post its first positive EBITDA as early as next month. The vote of confidence set the spark, but what followed was an outright blaze.

Daily double-digit surges followed, culminating in a fresh 52-week high of $4.97 on July 21. At one point that day, OPEN stock skyrocketed as much as 115% intraday before triggering a Nasdaq volatility halt. As the dust settles, investor eyes are fixed on what comes next. Opendoor operates as a full-stack iBuyer. With a market capitalization of $2.3 billion, its core business revolves around purchasing homes directly from sellers, carrying out necessary upgrades, and selling them at a premium. The company also runs an integrated ecosystem that includes a digital marketplace and agent services to support the buying and selling experience. Over the last 52 weeks, OPEN stock has delivered a respectable 14% return. However, that performance pales in comparison to what has unfolded in recent months. In the last six months alone, the stock has surged 105%. In just the past three months, shares have skyrocketed roughly 190%. www.barchart.com On May 6, Opendoor released its fiscal 2025 first-quarter results, handing Wall Street an earnings report that outperformed expectations. Although revenue dropped 2.4% year-over-year (YOY) to $1.15 billion, the company still beat the consensus estimate of $1.06 billion. Yet in Opendoor’s business model, revenue alone tells only part of the story. The company can generate revenue by flipping homes, regardless of whether it books a profit, which is why analysts tend to focus more on profitability and cash flow.",
