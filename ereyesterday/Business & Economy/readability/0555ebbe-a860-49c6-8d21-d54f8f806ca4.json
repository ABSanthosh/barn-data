Analysts at the investment firm raised the price target from $590 to a Street high of $680 because of surrounding optimism regarding the company’s Bitcoin (BTCUSD) operations. The company has been acquiring Bitcoin at a steady pace. In fact, Strategy recently purchased 4,225 more BTC for $472.5 million. This announcement also came at a time when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, climbing above the $123,000 mark.

TD Cowen highlighted that the company stands out as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, and while competitors might try to emulate Strategy, the company has a significant cost of capital advantage. Incorporated in 1989 and headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia, Strategy is an enterprise analytics and business intelligence company. Originally known for its software solutions that enabled organizations to analyze vast datasets, the company has transformed into the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin under the watchful eye of Executive Chairman Michael Saylor. In 2020, the company shifted its focus from analytics to become a significant holder of cryptocurrency, aggressively buying Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, thereby positioning itself at the forefront of corporate crypto adoption. Now, the company can almost act as a proxy for holding crypto. The firm currently has a market capitalization of $115 billion. This year, given the conducive environment that has emerged in the cryptocurrency market, Strategy has been increasing its Bitcoin holdings, which has given a boost to its stock. Over the past 52 weeks, MSTR stock has gained a massive 172%. The stock is also up 46% year-to-date (YTD). While MSTR is about 28% lower than its 52-week high of $543, the stock reached a YTD high of $457.22 on July 16. www.barchart.com However, Strategy stock is currently trading at an eye-watering valuation. Its price sits at 266 times sales. Needless to say, this valuation is highly stretched compared to the industry average.",
