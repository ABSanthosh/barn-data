  "text": "Mumbai: Overseas investors sold Indian equities worth ₹32,411 crore across 19 sectors between March 1 and 15, according to data from NSDL.The information technology (IT) sector witnessed the highest outflows at ₹6,934 crore after receiving flows worth ₹805 crore in February. In 2024, foreign investors pumped over ₹14,000 crore into the sector.\"The IT sector hasn't performed well since the tariff talks have gotten serious and the US-based IT companies have also not reported great earnings,\" Siddarth Bhamre, head of institutional tesearch at Asit C Mehta Intermediates. \"This could have resulted in higher foreign outflows in the sector.\"If the US really wants to impose tariffs on India, then it may look for sectors that have more exposure to the US, which are IT and pharma, said Bhamre.Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) too saw outflows worth over ₹5,106 crore. Foreigners had sold shares worth ₹6,904 crore in the sector in February.\"Unless there are visible signs of pickup in rural pockets, with urban spending also slowing down, a positive take on FMCG is likely to be short lived,\" said Akshay Chinchalkar, head of research, Axis Securities. \"This could be the driver for higher foreign outflows in the sector.\"Foreign investors offloaded shares worth over ₹3,000 crore in automobile and financial services sectors. In healthcare, they were sellers worth ₹2,049 crore.Agencies\"While the US Federal Reserve has taken a pause which was anticipated, they warned of higher inflation which means the one-way rally in the dollar could take a backseat,\" said Bhamre. \"While no reversal of foreign flows is likely, there could be a pause in selling.\"Chinchalkar said while foreign selling across sectors in the first half of March has tapered off, the Fed Chair's comments on the risks of potential stagflation and slowdown in economic growth indicates that global uncertainty could linger on for longer.\"The slowdown in the US as indicated by the Fed Chair could lead global investors to reduce foreign exposure overall and invest in domestic companies instead,\" he said. Overseas investors purchased shares worth ₹2,398 crore across four sectors in the first-half of March. Metals and mining sectors witnessed foreign inflows worth ₹1,179 crore in the first-half of the month while the sector earmarked as 'Others' and services received foreign flows worth ₹771 crore and ₹305 crore.",
