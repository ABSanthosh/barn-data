These US Bridges Face High Risk of Catastrophic Ship Strikes Just days before the end of a quarter that’s set to be the worst for the S\u0026P 500 since 2023, the gauge slipped anew.

Friday’s inflation data will provide a snapshot of price pressures and economic activity leading up to Trump’s planned April 2 announcement on reciprocal tariffs — which he has dubbed “Liberation Day in America.” General uncertainty about the impact of the duties help explain why Fed officials kept interest rates unchanged last week. “The threat of further tariff escalation remains a key concern, but our economic forecasts do not call for a recession in the US,” said Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management.",
