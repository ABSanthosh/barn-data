Housing affordability has become a pressing issue in America — with studies suggesting that buyers now need a six-figure salary to comfortably cover the mortgage on a typical home. Yet millions of Americans already own their homes outright. According to Fortune, citing a recently published Goldman Sachs note, the share of U.S. homeowners without a mortgage rose from 33% in 2010 to 40% in 2023. Assuming there are 86 million homes nationwide, the outlet estimates more than 30 million are now owned free and clear. As more Americans pay off their homes, equity continues to build. ICE Mortgage Technology estimated that heading into the second quarter of 2025 U.S. mortgage borrowers held $11.5 trillion in “tappable” home equity — or equity available for borrowing while maintaining at least a 20% cushion. Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

A major driver of this growing equity is the sharp increase in home values. Over the past five years, the S\u0026P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index has climbed more than 50%. That may be good news for existing homeowners — but for first-time buyers, the picture is far more challenging, especially with mortgage rates still elevated. According to the National Association of Realtors, the share of first-time home buyers in the U.S. fell to just 24% in 2024 — a record low — down from 32% a year prior. Fortune called the situation both “a warning sign” and a “chicken-and-egg” dilemma — noting that many older homeowners who bought their properties decades ago aren’t downsizing, largely due to fears of today’s higher mortgage rates.
