Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Dividend kings and dividend aristocrats get a lot of attention from investors and the media due to their prolific track record of delivering passive income. That said, there is an abundance of other stocks that can generate passive income streams. One is AGNC Investment (Nasdaq: AGNC), a mortgage REIT. This stock may not be familiar, but it has paid investors a 14% dividend for almost the last six years. Don't Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? The Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. Earn a 1% return boost on your first EquityMultiple investment when you sign up here (accredited investors only). Mortgage REITs function by purchasing large tranches of mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), many of which are backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Because these loans are secured, their profit yield is relatively low. Mortgage REITs generate extra profit by aggressively borrowing money to acquire as many MBSs as possible. AGNC Investment, like all mortgage REITs, ability to generate profit hinges on their ability to borrow money at a lower interest rate than the borrowers whose loans are in the MBSs are paying. If the portfolios are large enough and most borrowers pay on time, mortgage REITs can generate solid income for investors. However, the post-COVID run-up in interest rates has created difficult market conditions for many Mortgage REITs. Trending: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends Despite that, AGNC Investment has successfully paid its expected dividend through the Federal Reserve's rate increases. This is not to say that higher interest rates haven't impacted AGNC Investment in the past. There have been dividend cuts in this Mortgage REIT's history. However, AGNC's management has hedged its portfolio and stockpiled enough cash to outlast the recent rise in borrowing costs.
