  "text": "James W. Lokey, a director at Community West Bancshares (NASDAQ:CWBC), has recently acquired shares of the company through a dividend reinvestment plan. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated November 22, 2024, Lokey purchased 60.291 shares at an average price of $21.44 per share, totaling approximately $1,292. Following this transaction, Lokey holds a total of 12,652.276 shares directly. This acquisition reflects Lokey's ongoing investment in the company, which operates in the state commercial banks sector. InvestingPro Insights James W. Lokey's recent share acquisition through Community West Bancshares' (NASDAQ:CWBC) dividend reinvestment plan aligns with the company's consistent dividend history. According to InvestingPro Tips, CWBC has maintained dividend payments for 13 consecutive years, demonstrating a commitment to shareholder returns that Lokey appears to value. The director's investment comes at a time when CWBC is experiencing strong market performance. InvestingPro data shows a significant 20.82% price total return over the past month and an impressive 32.09% return over the last six months. This positive momentum is further supported by the stock trading at 91.13% of its 52-week high, suggesting investor confidence in the company's prospects. However, potential investors should note that CWBC is trading at a relatively high P/E ratio of 51.26, which InvestingPro Tips flag as \"trading at a high earnings multiple.\" This valuation metric, combined with the tip that \"RSI suggests the stock is in overbought territory,\" indicates that careful consideration may be warranted before following Lokey's lead in acquiring shares at current prices. For a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 11 additional tips for CWBC, providing deeper insights into the company's financial health and market position.
