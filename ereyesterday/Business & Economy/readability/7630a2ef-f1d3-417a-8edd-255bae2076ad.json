If someone told you that millionaires have seven different income streams, your first thought might be: Seven? I'm struggling to keep up with one paycheck and these people are out here collecting seven like Pokémon cards? But according to the IRS, that's exactly what the average millionaire does. The logic is straightforward. Relying on one income stream is like balancing on a tightrope with no safety net – one wobble or layoff and you're in trouble. But with multiple streams of income, you've got a financial safety net that turns moneymaking into a game of \"the more, the merrier.\" Don't Miss: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here’s how you can earn passive income with just $100. Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate — This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! So, what are these magical income streams and how do millionaires make them work? Let's break them down – and spoiler alert, they're not as unattainable as you might think. The 7 Streams of Income Millionaires Use Here's what the IRS data reveals about where millionaires get their cash flow: 1. Earned Income: Yep, that's your good old paycheck. This is the starting point for most people, but millionaires don't stop here. 2. Dividend Income: Money from stocks that pay you for owning them. It's like being on a company's VIP list, except the perks are cold, hard cash. 3. Rental Income: Owning property others pay to live or work in. Think of it as becoming the landlord of your financial dreams. 4. Business Profits: Running or investing in income-generating businesses. It could be anything from a tech startup to a local coffee shop. See Also: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. 5. Royalty Income: Money from intellectual property – books, music, inventions, you name it. Write a hit song and you could get paid forever. 6. Capital Gains: Selling assets like stocks or real estate for more than you paid. It's not predictable but can be a game-changer. 7. Interest Income: Earnings from money lending through savings accounts, bonds or other vehicles. Rental Income As A Power Move Rental income isn't just another paycheck – it's freedom. Once you have enough rental income, you can step back from your job (if you want) and have time to build those other streams. TIME becomes your most valuable asset.",
