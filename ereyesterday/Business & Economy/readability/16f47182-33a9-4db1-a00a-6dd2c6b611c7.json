I currently move $10,000 from my 401(k) to my IRA every time it increases $10,000 in value. Is it wise to do this or should I let the 401(k) grow until I have to take my mandatory RMD? The IRA is 100% cash and is used for emergencies only. I don’t really have any large bills other than a HELOC and a car payment ($700 per month combined). Health insurance is currently costing $580 per month but Medicare will be available in six months. -Neal There are many good reasons for rolling over money in a 401(k) to an IRA or converting portions of a 401(k) into a Roth IRA. However, keeping the full balance of an IRA in cash may undermine some of the benefits of its tax-deferred growth. If you don’t need that money to cover regular monthly expenses, it may serve you better by keeping it invested in your 401(k). You’ll eventually have to take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from all traditional retirement accounts – both 401(k)s and IRAs – whether you need the money or not. Keeping that money in cash and not investing it could result in lost earnings and diminished purchasing power over the years. Funding a separate emergency fund with any disposable income you have and keeping it in a regular taxable account (such as a high-yield savings account) could serve the same function while allowing your retirement accounts to continue to grow tax-deferred. Giving your retirement savings as much time to compound and grow gives you the best chance for enjoying a more financially comfortable retirement. A financial advisor can help you plan and save for retirement. Connect with a fiduciary advisor today. A 62-year-old retiree looks over his 401(k) balance and contemplates rolling funds over into his IRA.

While you’re working for an employer that offers a 401(k) plan, it makes good financial sense to contribute to the plan – especially if the employer offers matching contributions. But once you’re no longer at that job, it can be financially beneficial to move the balance of your 401(k) into an IRA. The advantages of making this move can include: more investment options more control over your retirement account reduced costs low- or no-fee trades inside the account direct access to account information optional tax withholding on withdrawals Once you’ve decided to move money from a 401(k) into an IRA, you’ll have two options: roll it over to a traditional IRA or convert it to a Roth IRA. Direct rollovers to traditional IRAs are tax-free transactions, but eventual withdrawals will be subject to income tax. Converting to a Roth IRA will result in a current tax bill on the full amount that’s converted, but qualified withdrawals will be tax free. (Talk to a financial advisor to determine which options makes the most sense for your unique situation.)",
