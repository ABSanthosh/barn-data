The deal, for which the financial terms remain undisclosed, is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close within three months, according to KMBL.

Of that, personal loans, unsecured business loans (for non-personal use), and consumer durables loans represented Rs 20,317 crore, reflecting 1 per cent year-on-year growth.   “KMBL aims to leverage its technology expertise and quality customer service to ensure a seamless transition for existing Standard Chartered Bank Personal Loan customers, maintaining the high standards both institutions are known for,” the Indian lender said.   Meanwhile, Standard Chartered Bank explained that the decision to divest its personal loan portfolio aligns with its focus on the wealth management, affluent, and SME segments in India. Aditya Mandloi, head–wealth \u0026 retail banking, Standard Chartered Bank, India \u0026 South Asia, said: “India continues to be a key market for Standard Chartered network, with wealth \u0026 retail banking (WRB) and corporate \u0026 investment banking (CIB) as the cornerstones and we will continue to invest and grow in India. Together with Kotak (Mahindra Bank), we remain committed towards ensuring a seamless transition for our clients.”   Ambuj Chandna, head-products, consumer bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said with Kotak Group’s successful integration track record, the lender is committed to a smooth transition. “India’s unsecured lending market offers significant growth potential for Kotak, especially in the higher-end segment. Our strong risk management, customer-centric products, and technology-driven approach position us for sustainable growth,” added Chandna.
