  "text": "India, the most populous and largest democracy, is today also the world’s fastest-growing emerging economy, and World Bank projections show that it will remain so for the next two years. Though the focus of global attention, the country has the China factor to contend with, and take into account the opportunities and challenges Donald Trump’s US presidency might present. Leading personalities from the government, policy-making, economy and India Inc, among others, will discuss all this and more at the second edition of Manthan, the annual Business Standard summit, which kicks off on February 27 at Taj Palace, New Delhi. The two-day, high-profile event, which marks 50 years of Business Standard’s publication, will have Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman delivering the inaugural address on the theme, “The Great Reset: India in a New World Order”, on the morning of February 27. During a fireside chat after her address, Sitharaman will delve deeper into the subject of India’s unique position in the world. A conversation with Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal on integrating India with global value chains will follow on Day 2, February 28. The summit will also see Union Railways and Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw discussing India’s vast journey, from semiconductor chips to tracks, and Union Minister for Environment, Forests and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav speaking of the role of India’s climate actions amid a new America under Trump.  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, Railways \u0026 IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, and Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav among those who will discuss India’s position in a new world order at the second edition of Business Standard Manthan Also Read Among the galaxy of speakers who will share their thoughts on how the world now looks at India and how India leverages its position in the world will be PK Mishra, principal secretary to the Prime Minister, and Suman Bery, vice chairperson of NITI Aayog.
