Can that continue is the big question for investors.\" Qualcomm is trying to diversify its revenue as it braces for the end of a lucrative tie-up with Apple, which is working on its own modem chips to replace those made by Qualcomm. More From This Section While the deal to keep selling chips to Apple is until at least 2026, focus is on whether Qualcomm's efforts to break into laptops and artificial intelligence in data centers will ramp up quickly enough to offset declines in Apple revenue.  \"Qualcomm is starting to enjoy additional revenue from the other markets it is focusing on including automotive, internet of things, headsets and PCs,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.  President-elect Donald Trump has floated plans for blanket tariffs of 10 per cent to 20 per cent on virtually all imports as well as tariffs of 60 per cent or more on goods from China, in a bid to boost US manufacturing.  \"Higher tariffs, if they are applied to chips from Taiwan, which I would be very surprised if they happen ... that would be an incentive for Qualcomm to move manufacturing stateside,\" said O'Donnell.   (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
