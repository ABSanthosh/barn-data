Millions of Americans dream of early retirement, but it's becoming harder to exit the workforce amid rising costs and a lack of savings. A national survey shows that about 55% of Generation X – individuals aged between 44 and 59 – feel they won't be able to financially prepare for retirement. However, with planning, consistent savings and wise investments, one can retire early and gain control of their time. Don't Miss: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. During market downturns, investors are learning that unlike equities, these high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% are protected by resilient assets, buffering against losses. In January this year, someone asked on Reddit's r/Dividends community of over 600,000 members whether anyone was living entirely off dividends, what it's like to live such a life and how they spend their time. The poll received hundreds of comments, with many interesting success stories and insights. ‘We Travel The World Full Time' A Redditor said he was living solely off dividends with his wife. He, 42, retired in March 2022 while his wife, 47, retired in August 2021. The investor said he was earning about $74,824 per year in dividends. \"We travel the world full time. Utilizing the standard 90 days most countries allow on a tourist visa and then move on to the next country. We are currently in Porto, Portugal and have been here since November 30. We head to Montenegro next for three months,\" he said. See Also: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest TODAY for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. ‘Always Lived Pretty Frugal' The investor was asked how he was able to accumulate wealth for his initial investment. He said that he and his wife had careers in finance. \"We worked in finance for our careers. I started at a local credit union right out of high school and worked for a total of two credit unions and five banks during my career and my wife worked at three banks during her career. We always lived pretty frugal, maxed out Roths since 2002 and maxed out our 401(k)s since 2005.\" Never Made a ‘Ton of Money' Compared to Friends, Still Retired Early He said he and his wife were \"fairly aggressive\" in adding to their taxable brokerages. According to the investor, he did not make a \"ton of money\" when compared to his friends.",
