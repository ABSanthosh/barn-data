NO ONE GOES ON VACATION UNTIL IT'S DONE,\" he continued.Trump's demands come as the bill still faces an uphill climb ahead of Republicans' self-imposed July 4 deadline, as persistent policy clashes continue to divide Senate Republicans and questions remain over whether the House will ultimately accept the Senate version of the megabill.The bill is currently with the upper chamber, where Senate Majority Leader John Thune insisted Monday that he's pushing ahead with a vote this week, even as some GOP lawmakers continue to balk at key provisions, such as its effect on the federal deficits and the state-and-local-tax deduction cap, or SALT.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump says he's 'not happy' as Israel and Iran both claim ceasefire violationsCan Germany afford a 5% NATO defense spending target?'Fire up the deportation planes': Trump official praises Supreme Court rulingIran attacks U.S. military base in Qatar with missilesTrump slams Russia's Medvedev for saying countries will give Iran nuclear warheadsSenate to stay in DC until it passes Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' Thune saysU.S. intel found Iran didn't move nuclear material from Fordo, Sen. Mullin saysLesser of two evils: Why China won't mind a closure of the Strait of HormuzIran's parliament backs blocking Strait of Hormuz. Its closure would alienate Tehran furtherIn another blow to the bill's prospects, the Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, has ordered the removal of some key elements in the bill.MacDonough said some provisions violated a rule that allows budget provisions to pass with a simple majority, instead of the traditional 60-vote threshold. Given Republicans' 53-member majority in the Senate, they are relying on the budget rule process, known as reconciliation, to get the bill passed.Now, Senate Republicans are scrambling to rewrite the bill to comply with MacDonough's rulings, ensure that it can pass the House and also win over their own GOP skeptics.For instance, on one particular sticking point, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., has held talks with House Republicans on the SALT cap, Politico reports, which was set at $40,000 in the House bill.Even as Republicans are feeling the time crunch, GOP leaders are projecting confidence that they will pass the bill before the July 4 holiday.\"The July 4 deadline is an important one. The president is insistent about it,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday on Fox News Channel.\"I have been from the very beginning, and I think we can get this job done. I remain very optimistic that we will,\" he added.",
