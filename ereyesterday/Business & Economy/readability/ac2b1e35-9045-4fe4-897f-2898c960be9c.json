  "text": "ET Intelligence Group: The country's top five software exporters reported the sharpest sequential revenue drop in six quarters at the aggregate level for the December 2024 quarter amid seasonal weakness due to holidays and furloughs. The sample's revenue fell by 0.3% from the previous quarter to $20,207.5 million. In addition, the trailing 12-month (TTM) trend in revenue shows that after a spike between FY21 and FY22 amid the post-pandemic boom, the revenue growth for each of the five companies has fallen below the levels seen five years ago, impacted by a slack in the demand for discretionary projects - long-term contracts which are transformational in nature - amid the rising focus of clients to achieve cost efficiency for existing processes.The TTM method tends to smoothen out quarterly volatility thereby offering a better understanding of the long-term trend. Considering the TTM dollar denominated revenue, the aggregate revenue of the top five IT exporters recorded a year-on-year growth of 2.4% in the December quarter, led by 5.3% growth in the country's third largest IT exporter HCLTech's TTM revenue at $13,771.8 million and 4% in $30,077 million revenue reported by TCS, the largest IT exporter. On the other hand Wipro and Tech Mahindra, the fourth and the fifth largest Indian IT exporters by that order showed a drop of 3.6% and 2.1% respectively in their TTM revenues. For Infosys, the second largest IT exporter, TTM revenue rose by 3% to $6,263.3 million.Though the December quarter TTM revenue growth for the sample was the highest in four quarters, it has been on a gradual decline compared with the growth ten quarters ago. For instance, it peaked at 18.1% in the March 2022 quarter on the back of a tepid 1.7% increase in the year-ago quarter affected due to the Covid pandemic. However, since the March 2022 quarter, it has gradually fallen.The top line growth is expected to pick up in the coming quarters amid hopes of a revival in discretionary projects. Each of the top companies continued to report a sustained momentum in new deal wins in the December quarter thereby improving revenue visibility. In rupee terms, the sample's aggregate revenue rose by 0.9% to ₹1.7 lakh crore while net profit grew by 3.7% to ₹28,126 crore in the December quarter. HCLTech reported the strongest growth of 3.6% and 8.4% in revenue and net profit at ₹29,890 crore and ₹4,591 crore in that order.",
