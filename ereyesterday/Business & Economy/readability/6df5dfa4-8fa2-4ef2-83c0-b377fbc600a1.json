Putin's apology came amid mounting allegations that the plane had been shot down by Russian air defences attempting to deflect a Ukrainian drone strike near Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya. An official Kremlin statement issued on Saturday said that air defence systems were firing near Grozny airport as the airliner repeatedly attempted to land there on Wednesday. It did not explicitly say one of these hit the plane. The statement said Putin apologised to Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev for the fact that the tragic incident occurred in Russian airspace. The readout said Russia has launched a criminal probe into the incident, and Azerbaijani state prosecutors have arrived in Grozny to participate. The Kremlin also said that relevant services from Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan are jointly investigating the crash site near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. The plane was flying from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, to Grozny when it turned toward Kazakhstan, hundreds of kilometres across the Caspian Sea from its intended destination, and crashed while making an attempt to land. There were 29 survivors. According to a readout of the call provided by Aliyev's press office, the Azerbaijani president told Putin that the plane was subject to \"external physical and technical interference,\" although he also stopped short of blaming Russian air defences. Aliyev noted that the plane had multiple holes in its fuselage and that the occupants had sustained injuries due to foreign particles penetrating the cabin mid-flight. On Friday, a US official and an Azerbaijani minister made separate statements blaming the crash on an external weapon, echoing those made by aviation experts who blamed the crash on Russian air defence systems responding to a Ukrainian attack. Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia's civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic. Yadrov said that after the captain made two unsuccessful attempts to land, he was offered other airports but decided to fly to Aktau. Earlier in the week, Rosaviatsia had cited unspecified early evidence as showing that a bird strike led to an emergency on board. In the days following the crash, Azerbaijan Airlines blamed physical and technical interference and announced the suspension of flights to several Russian airports. It didn't say where the interference came from or provide any further details. More From This SectionDon't miss the most important news and views of the day.
