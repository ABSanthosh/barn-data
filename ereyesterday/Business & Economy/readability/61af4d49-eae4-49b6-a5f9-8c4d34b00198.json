  "text": "Before a last-minute intervention by a federal judge, Trump administration officials were planning to strip apart the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau until there was nothing left of the agency but a room with “five men and a phone in it,” according to current and former employees. Their written testimony was contained in documents submitted Thursday as part of a lawsuit aimed at halting mass firings at the besieged bureau. They offer new step-by-step details of how insiders say the administration planned to decimate the regulator charged with policing the way large banks, mortgage lenders, and other financial services companies treat customers. They also describe how key functions the agency is required to carry out under federal law, such as operating a consumer complaint portal, have largely ceased to function thanks to the cancellation of virtually all its outside contracts and the stop-work order issued by acting director Russell Vought. Senior Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia temporarily blocked Trump officials from laying off CFPB staff two weeks ago in response to a legal challenge by a union representing federal employees, which claimed the administration was planning to effectively eliminate the agency by terminating 95% of its originally 1,700-strong workforce, ending its leases, and canceling its outside contracts. The Trump administration is seeking to lift her order and argued in a motion this week that it is only trying to “streamline” the CFPB rather than do away with it entirely, and that it has continued to keep its statutorily required functions operating. But according to Thursday’s filings, the Trump team — with support from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency — planned to leave in place a rump version of the CFPB that existed in name only. Chief Operating Officer Adam Martinez told employees that the agency was in “wind down mode,” according to two of the declarations submitted by anonymous current employees. Senior executives explained to staff “the writing was on the wall” and allegedly “shared that the intention of the leadership was to fire everyone but the five positions required by the Dodd-Frank Act,” which established the CFPB. “One Senior Executive said that CFPB will become a ‘room at Treasury, White House, or Federal Reserve with five men and a phone in it,’” an employee identified as Drew Doe testified. Trump officials planned to fire staff in three phases, according to the filings, starting with recent hires who were on probation or term-limited. A DOGE team member named Jordan Winck allegedly ordered the CFPB staff to terminate another 1,200 of its workers by Feb. 14. Most of the remaining employees were to be cleared out 60 to 90 days later.",
