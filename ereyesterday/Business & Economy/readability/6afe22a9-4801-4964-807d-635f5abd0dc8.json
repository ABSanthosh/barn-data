The move is aimed at easing the liquidity conditions and prevent the call money rates from shooting sharply above the current repo rate of 6.5%.AgenciesMarket participants also expect some durable liquidity measures via open-market operations or foreign exchange buy-sell swaps versus the temporary measure of VRR auctions.Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India on Monday injected ₹75,772 crore into the banking system, increasing liquidity through a variable rate repo (VRR) operation, and said it would hold a ₹1.5-lakh crore auction through the same instrument on Tuesday.The ₹75,772-crore liquidity will be reversed on Tuesday. The move is aimed at easing the liquidity conditions and prevent the call money rates from shooting sharply above the current repo rate of 6.5%.The central bank held a VRR auction on Monday to inject ₹1.25 lakh crore in the system, but it received offers for nearly half the amount - ₹75,772 crore. It accepted all bids at 6.51%.The weighted average call rate (WACR), which indicates the banks' overnight cost of borrowing, closed at 6.60% on Monday, 10 basis points higher than the RBI's current repo rate of 6.50%, due to deficit liquidity conditions in the banking system.System liquidity as of January 19 stood at ₹1.93 lakh crore, with an average deficit of ₹1.61 lakh crore in January, RBI data showed.After the first two daily auctions of Rs 50,000 crore each, the RBI increased the quantum to ₹1.25 lakh crore on Monday and ₹1.5 lakh crore Tuesday, gauging deeper deficit in system liquidity.VRR auctions allow the RBI to inject temporary liquidity into the system. The bank has been holding daily VRR auctions since January 16. This announcement of daily VRR operations by the RBI drove overnight yields lower.System liquidity was also pressured due to monthly tax outflows that took place last week, money market dealers said. \"Liquidity conditions remained tight last week on account of foreign exchange intervention by the RBI. Core liquidity also reached negative territory, a first since March 2019. Although GST outflows at the start of this week could tighten liquidity conditions further,\" ICICI Bank said in a report.Market participants also expect some durable liquidity measures via open-market operations or foreign exchange buy-sell swaps versus the temporary measure of VRR auctions.\"The RBI's spot foreign exchange intervention has drained banking system liquidity by ₹3.8 lakh crore in the fourth quarter of 2024. To offset this, the RBI has various tools at its disposal like VRR auctions beyond 14 day tenors, FX swaps and OMO purchase,\" Nomura said in a report.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
