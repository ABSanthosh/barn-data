  "text": "In This Article: Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is one of the top 10 S\u0026P 500 winners of the day that Jim Cramer highlighted. During the episode, Cramer said that he prefers another stock but SMCI is also doing well. He commented: “There was another data center play. This time, it’s Super Micro, an important partner of NVIDIA. Now I think that… Not Super Micro, I think Dell is the right investment in the space, but there’s no denying the stock is doing quite well.” Jim Cramer on Super Micro: \"No Denying the Stock is Doing Quite Well\" A team of technicians in a server room, testing and managing the newest server solutions. Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) designs and sells high-performance server and storage systems built on modular, open architecture, and it provides a range of hardware, software, and support services. The company’s products serve markets such as data centers, cloud computing, AI, 5G, and edge computing through various sales channels. During a May episode of Mad Money, Cramer said that the stock is cheap compared to other stocks related to the industry, but he prefers Dell more. He commented: “No, no. To tell you the truth, I mean, this one had some accounting issues. They do seem to be now long enough behind them that analysts are starting to recommend the stock again. It’s relatively cheap versus the whole cohort. If you want to consider the cohort… like a CoreWeave or, of course, an NVIDIA, and I would tell you, it is more expensive than Dell. I do like Dell more, but I think you could do a lot more… with Super Micro. But let me tell you something, you’ve got more product knowledge than I do, and I like what you had to say.” While we acknowledge the potential of SMCI as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
