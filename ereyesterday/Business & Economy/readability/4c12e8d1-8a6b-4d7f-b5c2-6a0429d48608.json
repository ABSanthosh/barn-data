The US President's announcement of reciprocal tariffs hit export-oriented sectors hard, particularly the pharma space.During the week, over 400 smallcap stocks delivered negative returns with 23 of them falling in double-digits. Suratwala Business Group was the top loser with a negative 53% return, followed by Best Agrolife (-31%), Dee Development Engineers (-27%), and PTC Industries (-21%).On the flip side, 52 stocks including KDDL, Sandur Manganese, Pennar Industries, Taj GVK Hotels, IKIO Lighting, Benares Hotels have offered returns between 10-40% during the week.In the BSE500 segment, nearly 225 stocks ended with cuts. Mahindra Logistics, Carborundum Universal, Vakrangee, CreditAccess Grameen, Natco Pharma, Crisil, Mahindra and Mahindra, Jamna Auto, The India Cements were among the worst losers.From the Sensex pack, NTPC topped the charts with 8.6% returns, followed by Zomato at 7% and Tata Steel at 5%.

The RSI (14) also has entered a bearish crossover.\"On the lower end, a correction towards 22,500 looks possible in the short term, while on the higher end, 22,850 might continue to remain a strong resistance,\" said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
