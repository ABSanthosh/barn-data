Although not all legislation on Capitol Hill ultimately impacts the U.S. economy or stock market, the lawmakers voted into public office help to shape the fiscal policy that affects corporate earnings. Not long after the polls closed on Election Night, the Associated Press called the upper House of Congress for Republicans, as well as announced that former President Donald Trump had secured enough electoral college votes to become America's next president. Trump secured 312 of a possible 538 electoral college votes, with Democratic Party presidential nominee Kamala Harris earning the remaining 226.

Despite navigating the short-lived COVID-19 crash in February-March 2020, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), broad-based S\u0026P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and growth stock-propelled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) respectively gained 57%, 70%, and 142% while Trump was in the White House. Former President and President-elect Donald Trump gesturing to reporters. Image source: Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead. The prevailing question, from the standpoint of Wall Street and investors, is: What should be expected from Trump's second term in the Oval Office? Perhaps the closest thing we have to a certainty at the moment is an effort to further reduce taxes. To be clear, there's a lot we don't know about what policy proposals we might see from the incoming administration. Even though President-Elect Trump will oversee a unified Republican Congress, the margin of majority is small enough in the House that there's no guarantee of any bill being passed. With the above being said, one proposal that could rapidly gain steam once Trump takes office for his nonconsecutive second term on Jan. 20 is further lowering the corporate income tax rate for businesses that make their products in the U.S. Donald Trump's flagship Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which was passed during his first term, lowered personal income tax rates (which are set to sunset on Dec. 31, 2025), as well as permanently reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This 21% peak marginal tax rate for businesses is the lowest since 1939. While on the campaign trail, the now-president-elect suggested a plan that would slash the current peak corporate income tax rate by 29% -- from 21% to 15% -- for companies that make their products domestically. This proposal, along with tariffs on imported goods into the U.S., is designed to promote domestic manufacturing and make U.S. goods more price-competitive with products being imported from overseas markets.",
