  "text": "Through the first nine months of 2024, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway unloaded $133 billion worth of stocks. Buffett reduced Berkshire's massive stake in Apple and sold nearly a quarter of its Bank of America holding. In the third quarter, Apple, American Express (NYSE: AXP), Bank of America, and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) made up 70% of Berkshire's $271 billion stock portfolio. Buffett is raising cash at a time when the S\u0026P 500 is trading at 30 times earnings, which is historically high for this popular market barometer. However, it's worth looking at the stocks Buffett is choosing not to sell right now. Buffett continues to hold shares of Coca-Cola and American Express, which says a lot about what he thinks of their competitive advantages and growth prospects. Warren Buffett has often invested in top consumer brands over his investing career. When Buffett sees a quality business trading at an attractive valuation, he pounces, and his 1988 investment in Coca-Cola is a great example. Coca-Cola stock fell sharply in the 1987 Black Monday crash. But the company was growing earnings at double-digit rates, and it still had a tremendous international growth opportunity. In the aftermath of the sell-off, the shares traded at around 16 times earnings, which prompted Buffett to invest a fifth of Berkshire's equity in Coke stock. Buffett has never sold a single share of Coca-Cola. The stock has split a few times over the last 30 years, leaving Berkshire with 400 million shares at the end of the 2024 third quarter. Those shares are worth $25 billion at current share prices, and paying $776 million in annual dividends. Coca-Cola is not the high-growth company it was when Berkshire originally invested, but the company should continue to grow earnings as it gains market share. Coca-Cola experienced a slight decline in unit case volume last quarter, reflecting a weak consumer spending environment. But over the long term, management expects to grow revenue marginally faster than the 4% historical growth rate of the global beverage industry. The stock trades at 21 times 2025 earnings estimates and offers a high dividend yield of 3.14%. Assuming the company grows earnings faster than revenue, it probably won't be enough to outperform the S\u0026P 500 over time. However, Coca-Cola's strong brand and consistent sales performance make it a great stock to hold if you want to boost your passive income. Berkshire has held a large stake in American Express stock for 30 years, and as of Q3 2024, it still held 151 million shares. After adding to the position in 1998, Buffett has continued to patiently hold the stock and let it compound in value with the growth of the business.",
