According to the Federal Reserve's latest data from the end of 2022, the number of millionaire households in the U.S. is rising – and it's not just inflation making the numbers look bigger. Even when adjusting for inflation, the percentage of households with a net worth of at least $1 million surged from 2019 to 2022 after being relatively flat for nearly two decades. Don't Miss: Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? – How does it compare to the average? A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. So, just how many millionaires are out there? According to the Federal Reserve's 2022 survey, approximately 18% of U.S. households had at least seven figures net worth. That's roughly 23.7 million millionaire households across the country. And with the stock market and real estate values performing strongly since then, even more households will likely join the ranks of millionaires in 2024. While these numbers are exciting, they also come with some interesting insights into building that kind of wealth. Millionaire households share certain characteristics that offer clues for boosting their net worth. See Also: I’m 62 Years Old And Have $1.2 Million Saved. Is This Enough to Retire Stress-Free? Common Traits and Characteristics of Millionaire Households Most millionaires don't fit the luxury-laden stereotype. Many built their wealth through disciplined saving and investing, often in employer-sponsored retirement accounts like 401(k)s. Roughly 70% of millionaires accumulated their wealth this way and a surprising 73% have never carried a credit card balance. The majority aren't high earners either – most didn't hit six-figure salaries during their careers. According to MillennialMoney, most millionaires are 60-79 years old, which shows that it takes time for most people to accumulate wealth. Trending: Studies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do — to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor. Real estate also plays a big role, with primary residences contributing about 32% of a typical millionaire's net worth. Millionaires also prioritize education, with over 60% holding a degree from public universities and only 8% from Ivy League schools.",
