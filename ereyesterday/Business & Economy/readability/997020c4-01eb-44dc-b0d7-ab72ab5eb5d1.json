Other companies are feeling the pressure but have strong long-term growth drivers. 10 stocks we like better than Honest › Investors are always on the lookout for the next Amazon or Nvidia, a stock you can find before the market catches on and sends it soaring. Today, investors may see the greatest opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). But Amazon started off as a bookseller before it took over e-commerce, and Nvidia used to be known for gaming technology. You can find excellent stocks to buy in all categories if you're looking for the right qualities. Here are 10 under-the-radar consumer goods stocks that have incredible growth potential. Image source: Getty Images. The Honest Company (NASDAQ: HNST) makes personal and baby care items with clean ingredients and sustainable practices. It's a small but growing company, with $97 million in revenue in the 2025 first quarter, a 13% increase year over year. It was only the company's third time posting a quarterly profit, and it's well-positioned to begin reporting profitable growth. Out of the seven Wall Street analysts covering Honest stock, they all think it will rise over the next 12 to 18 months, with the lowest target price 25% higher than today's price. Stride (NYSE: LRN) is a technology-based learning company that offers different programs for all ages. In today's day and age, there's a huge need for its services, and as the world keeps moving toward digital, it has an edge in this industry. Revenue increased 18% year over year in its fiscal 2025's third quarter (ended March 31) to $613 million, and profits grew to $99 million. All seven covering analysts anticipate Stride to rise over the next 12 to 18 months, with a median price target of 14%. Revolve Group (NYSE: RVLV) is an online fashion retailer that has used AI throughout its operations from its beginnings 20 years ago. It uses social media and celebrity influencers to reach its core audience, and its AI algorithms and low physical presence make it easy to meet changing demand and charge full price for most of its merchandise. Sales increased 10% year over year in the first quarter, with net income up 5%. Analysts are mixed on this one, with a median target price just slightly higher than today -- while the most optimistic share price is 46% higher. Long term, Revolve represents the future of fashion retail.",
