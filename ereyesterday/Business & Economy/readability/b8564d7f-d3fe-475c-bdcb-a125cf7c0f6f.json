  "text": "Stocks with high profitability and earnings visibility will offer growth opportunities and investors should focus on earnings and not Trump tariffs, HSBC Global Research said in a note. The brokerage firm has picked five stocks viz. TVS Motor Company, Reliance Industries (RIL), Shriram Finance, ICICI Bank and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) based on structural merits, arguing for them to do the trick.Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsNifty has fallen over 3% since US President Donald Trump assumed office on January 20, this year. HSBC sees limited impact of trade tensions on growth of Indian companies as low foreign holdings reduce the risk of further outflows. The London-headquartered bank and financial services company also believes that the macro risks have declined, though concerns over high earnings expectations remain intact. The US has imposed a 26% tariff on India. The Indian government has said that it is in wide consultation with the US administration while preferring to not take a retaliatory route.The stocks identified by HSBC could rise based on multiple levers. Here’s what is expected of these stocks:Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsTVS Motor CompanyThe risk-reward is favourable in TVS Motor shares now, said HSBC in its note as it forecasts the company's Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) margin to expand from 12.1% in FY25 to 13.3% in FY27. The reason behind this optimism is an expectation of normalisation in 2W demand in FY26 on a high base. \"A favourable monsoon season may produce rural demand recovery, and we believe that new launches will help the company defend its market share,\" HSBC said.TVS arguably has the most established R\u0026D capacity amongst the 2W OEMs, this brokerage claimed.Shares of TVS Motors have corrected 20% since September 2024. So far this year, it has managed to give nearly 3% returns.RILHSBC upgraded Reliance Industries stock to buy in its January 17 stock review. The stock has corrected by around 25% since market’s peak in September 2024 on scepticism of its performance in telecom, retail, and lack of catalysts for O2C and no news on New Energy. At current valuations, it makes it an attractive entry price, said HSBC.The retail business is set to turnaround as the company implemented a cleansing exercise in FY25. Furthermore, it has beefed up its presence in E/Q commerce and improved product quality in fashion and lifestyle.On telecom, HSBC said that despite tariff hikes it expects ARPU (average revenue per user) growth over the next quarter. Moreover, acceleration in the pace of adoption of AirFibre should also drive revenue growth in the telecom business.As for the O2C business, it expects margins to stabilise at current levels and new capacity to likely drive earnings growth. Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsOn new energy, the company is expected to launch its cell and module products and progress on battery storage technology.Also Read: Metal stocks tank up to 18% in a week amid tariff woes, sector braces for more painICICI BankHSBC has a buy view on ICICI Bank. The counter offers an optimal combination of the positive triggers like stronger-than-sector-growth, superior asset quality versus peers, consistent earnings delivery, and healthy profitability.\"We expect such all-round performance to sustain. This should sustain the healthy valuation premium for ICICBC over peers for its core banking business.While the pressure on loan growth or NIM compression is visible, given its scale and the toughness of the operating environment, we believe these have been better managed than its peers,\" the brokerage note said.Shriram FinanceHSBC finds Shriram Finance in a safer space. The vehicle financier has the ability to maintain mid-to high-teens AUM growth given the wider product penetration within branches and reduced cyclicality due to lower dependence on vehicle finance.Stable yields and lower incremental funding costs are likely to drive NIM (net interest margin) expansion for the company over FY25-27e and HSBC expects stable asset quality and credit costs given the low exposure to unsecured loans.Adani PortsHSBC views APSEZ as a long-term proxy for India’s trade and infrastructure growth and the addition of the Vizhinjam and Colombo terminals could strengthen its capacity and pricing power. A ramp-up of the logistics business and international operations (ports and marine) will further reduce sensitivity to domestic cargo volume trends, in our view.For FY26, management indicated over 20% growth in group EBITDA, driven by a ramp-up of new port projects, international operations, and logistics businesses. \"We forecast FY24-27 EBITDA CAGR of 16% and earnings CAGR of 22%,\" HSBC said.Also Read: Domestic-focused plays remain safer bets amid global uncertainty: Amnish Aggarwal(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
