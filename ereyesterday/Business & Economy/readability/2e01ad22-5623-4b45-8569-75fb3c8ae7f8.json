  "text": "Despite the sell-off on Friday, technical analysts remain positive with the Nifty expected to touch 24,400-24,500 in the near future. This implies an upside of as much as 2% over Friday’s closing of around 24,000. The action will most likely be stock-specific, while analysts said the downside is a good time to accumulate large-cap stocks.Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsDHARMESH SHAH HEAD OF TECHNICAL, ICICI SECURITIESWhere is Nifty headed? On expected lines, the Nifty managed to hold the long-term rising trend line that coincided with the 200-day EMA, despite the depreciating rupee and consistent FII sell-off. This highlights buying demand at the elevated support base, further validated by a positive divergence on the daily RSI. The overall price structure reiterates our positive stance with a target of 24,400 for the coming weeks. We expect volatility to remain elevated at the onset of the third-quarter earnings season, policy measures from the Trump government and Union budget expectations. Strong support is placed at 23,300 which we expect to hold as it is the confluence of 61.80% retracement of the June-September rally (21,281-26,277) coinciding with the 52-week EMA at 23,350. Buying on dips in quality stocks would be the prudent strategy. What should investors do? We expect BFSI, Auto, Pharma, IT and PSUs to be in focus. Capital Goods \u0026 Infra, PSU Banks offer favourable risk-reward. Among large caps, RIL, Infosys, Bajaj Finance, M\u0026M, Titan, BEL, United Spirits, PNB and PFC look good for 5-6%. In midcaps IREDA, JK Cement, Rallis, EIH, NCC, Latent view, PNB Housing, Federal Bank, Jubilant Food look good for 8-10% upside.Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsMEHUL KOTHARI TECHNICAL ANALYST, ANAND RATHI INVESTMENT SERVICESWhere is Nifty headed? Various technical factors triggered a relief rally of 600 points from the lows, bringing the Nifty back near the 24,000 mark. Despite this bounce, the FII long-short ratio remains below 20%, suggesting that the Nifty might not sustain at lower levels for long. Over the past 23 years, there have been 11 instances where Nifty declined for three months in a row. Interestingly, in each case, the subsequent fourth month delivered an average positive return of 6.07%. On the technical front, 24,200 remains a crucial resistance and a decisive close above this could trigger a short-covering rally towards the 24,800 zone. Support is seen at 23,400–23,200. What should investors do? Be stock-specific until there is confirmation of trading above 24,200. LIC and Tata Consumer look promising. We expect a decent run-up of around 10% to 15% in the coming months, Stop loss for LIC is `799 and `830 for Tata Consumer.SUDEEP SHAH HEAD - TECHNICAL \u0026 DERIVATIVE RESEARCH, SBI SECURITIESWhere is Nifty headed? Amidst mixed global cues, Nifty has established a solid base around its 200-day EMA zone of 23,650-23,700. The underlying trend remains strong, with bulls actively defending key support levels. Dips are likely to attract buying interest, reinforcing the overall positive outlook for the near term. Going ahead, the 50 and 100-day EMA zone of 24,200-24,250 to act as an immediate hurdle for the index. Any sustainable move above 24,250 will lead to a sharp upside rally up to the 24,500 level leading to a major reversal. In that case, the index is likely to test the level of 24,800. On the downside, the support has shifted higher in the zone of 23,750- 23,800 level. What should investors do? The current consolidation phase presents a strong opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate quality large-caps and midcaps at attractive prices. Traders should focus on the the Auto, Pharma, and Oil \u0026 Gas sectors, which may show relative resilience. IT and Pharma could also enter a consolidation phase. Large-caps such as Bajaj Fin, M\u0026M, DMart, and Eicher Motors can be looked upon on dips, while select midcaps such as Jubilant Ingrevia, APL Apollo, and Firstsource are likely to outperform.",
