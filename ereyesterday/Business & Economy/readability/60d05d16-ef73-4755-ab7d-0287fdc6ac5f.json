  "text": "(Bloomberg) — DeepSeek’s breakthrough in artificial intelligence is helping drive a rotation of stock funds back into China from India. Most Read from Bloomberg Progressive Portland Plots a Comeback Why American Mobility Ground to a Halt A Filmmaker’s Surreal Journey Into His Own Private Winnipeg How to Build a Neurodiverse City SpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in May Hedge funds have been piling into Chinese equities at the fastest pace in months as bullishness on the DeepSeek-driven technology rally adds to hopes for more economic stimulus. In contrast, India is suffering a record exodus of cash on concerns over waning macro growth, slowing corporate earnings and expensive stock valuations. China’s onshore and offshore equity markets have added more than $1.3 trillion in total value in just the past month amid such reallocations, while India’s market has shrunk by more than $720 billion. The MSCI China Index is on track to outperform its Indian counterpart for a third-straight month, the longest such streak in two years. DeepSeek has shown “that China actually has companies that are forming a vital part of the whole AI ecosystem,” said Ken Wong, an Asian equity portfolio specialist at Eastspring Investments. His firm has been adding Chinese internet holdings over the past few months, while trimming smaller Indian stocks that had “run up way past their valuation multiples.” The rotation marks an about-face from the pivot into India seen over the past several years, luring funds away from China. That was based on an India’s infrastructure spending splurge and its potential as an alternative manufacturing hub to China. Domestic-focused India has also been seen as a relative haven amid Donald Trump’s tariff plans. China looks to be regaining its former appeal on a fundamental reevaluation of its investability, especially in tech. After scaring investors with corporate crackdowns not long ago, Beijing may actually help push the new AI theme, as indicated by the news that entrepreneurs including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA, 9988.HK) co-founder Jack Ma have been invited to meet the nation’s top leaders. DeepSeek-related developments are likely to help boost China’s economy as well as its markets, providing an extended boost, said Vivek Dhawan, a fund manager at Candriam. “If you put all the pieces together, China becomes more attractive than India in the current set-up on a risk-reward basis.” The valuation differential adds to China’s allure as well. The MSCI China Index is trading at just 11 times forward earnings estimates, compared with about 21 times for the MSCI India Index.",
