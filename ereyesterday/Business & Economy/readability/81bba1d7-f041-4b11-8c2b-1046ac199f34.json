The new revenue range implies expansion of 18% growth, down from the 200% growth Super Micro delivered a year ago.\"During Q3 some delayed customer platform decisions moved sales into Q4,\" the company said in the statement. Super Micro said it also saw \"higher inventory reserves resulting from older generation products.\"The company had previously called for revenue of $5 billion to $6 billion and earnings per share of 46 cents to 62 cents. Super Micro said its gross margin for the quarter was 220 basis points lower than the prior period. Shares of server competitor Dell were down almost 5% in after-hours trading, while Hewlett Packard Enterprise fell about 2%. Nvidia shares dropped roughly 2%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSuper Micro shares over the past year.The pre-announcement is the latest blow for Super Micro, which has been mired in controversy for the past year due to delayed financial filings and troubling reports from short sellers. In February, the company filed its financials for its fiscal 2024 year and the first two quarters of fiscal 2025, just in time to meet Nasdaq's deadline to stay listed. Last year, after Super Micro delayed its annual report, it lost its auditor, Ernst \u0026 Young, citing governance issues. In November, the company named BDO as its new auditor. After more than tripling in 2023, thanks to the company's position in the AI boom and its sales of servers packed with Nvidia's processors, Super Micro shares plummeted in the second third and fourth quarters last year, wiping out more than 80% of its market cap.Read more CNBC tech newsUber raises in-office requirement to 3 days, claws back remote workersAmazon launches first Kuiper internet satellites in bid to take on Elon Musk's StarlinkOracle engineers caused dayslong software outage at U.S. hospitalsPalantir is soaring while its tech peers are sinking.
