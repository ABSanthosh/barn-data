But it warned that there would be a temporary pick up in inflation and that a possible global trade war could weigh on the economy. Policymakers cut the key rate a quarter point to 4.5% as the bank lowered its forecasts for economic growth this year, after months of stagnation.\"We live in an uncertain world, and the road ahead will have bumps,\" said Andrew Bailey, the governor of the central bank.Though he said that inflation was also likely to rise through most of this year, policymakers still expected the inflation rate to return to the 2% target in the next few years.Policymakers expect to cut rates further, Bailey said. \"But we will have to judge meeting by meeting how far and how fast.\"The inflation rate slowed slightly to 2.5% in December, when economists had been expecting it to hold steady. Crucially, inflation in the services sector, which has been particularly stubborn, slowed to 4.4%, from 5% in November, opening the door to Thursday's rate cut.Even as inflation has dropped substantially from its double digit highs just a couple of years ago, the Bank of England has been particularly cautious in easing monetary policy. Last year, it cut rates by less than its counterparts in the United States, Canada and the eurozone.British policymakers remained concerned about lingering inflationary risks, particularly as wage growth remained relatively strong, and uncertain about the impact of recent spending and tax changes by the government.On Thursday, the bank said it expected inflation to accelerate this year, peaking at 3.7% in the third quarter, in part because of rising energy costs. That's nearly a full percentage point higher than the forecast three months ago. But policymakers said they did not expect a jump in inflation to persist for a long time.In the past few weeks, central bankers in Britain and elsewhere have been grappling with the risk of a global trade war. Economists say that President Donald Trump's threats of higher tariffs and any retaliation would be a drag on economic growth, although the impact on inflation would be harder to predict.Britain has not been the target of threats from Trump, unlike the country's largest trading partner, the European Union. But a trade war between the United States and Europe could weigh on the British economy, which has already been experiencing lackluster growth. The central bank said that more uncertainty could make businesses cautious about investing in the short term.The bank downgraded its growth forecasts for the year, to 0.75% from 1.5%. Bailey said the economy would be \"notably weaker\" at the start of the year before picking up again midyear.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
