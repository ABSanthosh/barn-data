Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » In the third quarter, Berkshire Hathaway reported holding $325 billion in cash, its highest level ever. It was also a net seller of stocks, a pattern that's been ongoing for several quarters. Buffett has generally been transparent about his investing approach, and it's pretty simple, amounting to buy low and sell high, with some added details. He's a proponent of the value approach to investing, and he doesn't buy a stock unless he sees it as a great deal that could provide tremendous value to his organization. You don't have to see Buffett's public filings to understand that the market is looking bloated today. The S\u0026P 500 is up 26% this year and trading at record highs. Stocks are trading at high valuations, and at current levels, they could be due for a correction. That doesn't mean it's going to happen tomorrow; Buffett has been getting ready for a while now. But it will happen. I say that not because I can see into the future, but because that's the nature of the market. There are bear and bull markets, dips and corrections, and even crashes. The question no one can answer is when. But it's important to be prepared when it finally happens. Here are three things every investor should do. It's important for everyone to keep cash ready outside of your investments. First of all, you should keep an emergency fund for a rainy day. Aside from that, you should have funds available for investment on a consistent basis. The most successful way to invest might be boring, but it's safe, and it works: Invest consistently and let the magic of compounding do its work. Whether it's $50 a month or more, each dollar you put in compounds over time and creates gains that are otherwise unachievable. If the market is starting to look expensive, you might want to be more choosy about your investing and keep more funds available for the inevitable dip. \"What goes up must come down\" doesn't apply to everything; but it applies to unreasonable valuations. I didn't say high valuations, or even rich valuations, because some premium valuations are warranted. A company growing by leaps and bounds can carry a higher valuation than a mature, slow-growing enterprise.",
