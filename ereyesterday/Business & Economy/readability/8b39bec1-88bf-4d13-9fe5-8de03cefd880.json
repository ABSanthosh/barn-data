  "text": "In This Article: Chevron Corp_ gas station- by MattGush via iStock Chevron Corp (CVX) stock boasts a handsome 4.6% yield, significantly higher than its historical average. As this article will show, CVX stock could be worth between 11% to 20% more. Moreover, selling short put options expiring in just over one month can provide investors a 1.67% monthly yield at out-of-the-money strike prices. Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines. With CVX's closing price on July 3 of $148.37, CVX is still well off its recent highs in mid-April. But it could still have room to rise further. This article will show how to play this. CVX - last 6 months - Barchart - July 3, 2025 I discussed CVX stock's average yield in my last article on June 16 (\"Chevron Stock Looks Cheap Based on Its Average Yield - Shorting Puts Works\"). For example, with its annual dividend per share (DPS) of $6.84 (i.e., $1.71 quarterly x 4), the yield is 4.61%. But this is higher than its 5-year average. As a result, CVX is worth between $165 and $181. Let's see why. Over the next 12 months (NTM), an investor can likely expect Chevron will raise its quarterly dividend rate. Let's estimate that the next rate will be $1.78 per share, +4% YoY. That means the NTM DPS rate will be $6.98 per share, and so today's NTM yield is actually over 4.7%: $6.98 / $148.37 = 0.04704 = 4.704% (NTM Yield) That is well over its 5-year average yield: Yahoo! Finance.……4.36% Seeking Alpha …….4.21% Morningstar ……….4.17% Average 5-yr Yield  4.25% As a result, we can project CVX stock's value should it revert to its historical mean, using the NTM dividend per share (DPS): $6.98 NTM DPS / 0.0425 = $164.24 target price That is almost 11% higher than the July 3 closing price: $164.24/$148.37 = 1.1069 -1 = +10.7% upside This also coincides with analysts' target prices. Analysts surveyed by Yahoo! Finance (25) have an average price target of $163.23 per share, or +10% higher than today.  Similarly, Barchart's mean price target is $161.73, and StockAnalysis.com says the average from 15 analysts is $164.79 (close to my price target). However, AnaChart.com, which covers recent analyst write-ups, shows that 21 analysts have an average of $181.20 per share. That is +22% higher than today. The bottom line is that the median of these surveys is $164.01, very close to my dividend-yield-based target of $164.24. As a result, there seems to be +10-11% potential upside in CVX stock, and potentially up to 22% more.",
