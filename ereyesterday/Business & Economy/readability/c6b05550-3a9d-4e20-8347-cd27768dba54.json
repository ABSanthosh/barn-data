With six startups and over $34 million in product launches under his belt, Keith brings a sharp, practical lens to how AI can be used to transform marketing and business operationsâ€”especially for small business owners and agencies. During our conversation, Keith broke down the real-world applications of AI marketing and how itâ€™s not here to replace peopleâ€”but to remove bottlenecks, automate repetitive tasks, and unlock creativity. By shifting the way we think about tools like ChatGPT and agent-based workflows, Keith challenges small businesses to stop treating AI like search and start viewing it as a team of collaborators. He also shares how his own company operates without a traditional org chartâ€”thanks to the power of strategic marketing tools and automation.
