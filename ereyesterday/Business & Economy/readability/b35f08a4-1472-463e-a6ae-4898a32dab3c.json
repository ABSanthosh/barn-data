  "text": "Warren Buffett and Cathie Wood typically don't agree on much when it comes to assembling a portfolio. Only rarely have they owned the same company. But there's one growth stock that both of these investors love -- Latin American fintech Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU) -- so much so that they have invested nearly $1.5 billion combined into the business. And yet many investors have never heard of this company. You can use this ignorance to your advantage by snapping up shares at an incredible discount. This growth stock is a proven winner It's not often that you can buy a proven growth stock at a reasonable valuation, nonetheless a discounted valuation. That's because once a growth trajectory has begun, the market rushes to price that proven potential into the stock. This is, in part, what makes growth investing so challenging. You can buy and hold a stock that grows revenue by 500% over your holding period. But if the market had been pricing in 600% growth, you could still end up underperforming the market. How do you get a discount on a proven growth stock? Just look at one that the market is ignoring -- like Nu Holdings. And that might be the reason shares trade at just 32 times forward earnings, even though its bottom line has skyrocketed in recent years. The issue for Nu isn't a lack of famous investors. Buffett owns a bit more than $1.4 billion in shares through his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway -- a position it has held since Nu's initial public offering (IPO) in 2021. And through her company ARK Invest, Cathie Wood owns around 1.5 million shares of Nu, worth roughly $20 million. The issue isn't scale, either. Right now, Nu has more than 100 million customers. The issue is simply that Nu operates in just three countries: Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. Unless you live in one of these nations, you likely have never heard of Nu -- and certainly have never used its services. What exactly is Nu's business? It's a fintech that offers a suite of financial services directly to customers through their smartphones. This might not sound so innovative today, but it was in Latin America in 2013. Back then, a few stodgy incumbents controlled most of Latin America's banking industry. Nu took the market by storm, offering more advanced services at a lower cost, available to anyone instantly through the device in their pocket. There was clearly a lot of pent-up demand. Nu's customer base went from essentially zero to more than 100 million over its first decade in business. And new product lines like its crypto trading platform surpassed 1 million users in its first month of operation.",
