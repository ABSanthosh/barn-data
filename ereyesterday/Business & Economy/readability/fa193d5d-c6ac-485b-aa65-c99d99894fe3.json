  "text": "In This Article: We recently published an article titled What Happened After Jim Cramer Talked About These 13 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. During a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer offered his perspective on the day’s market rally as he delved into the impact of the ongoing dynamic between President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. “All day, I heard that today’s rally was just a bear market rally, okay? That it was a phony spike, and the market will go right back down the moment the president posts that there’ll be no compromise on tariffs. Who knows, maybe Fed Chief Jay Powell should be deported.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer Got These 10 Stocks All Wrong and Jim Cramer Nailed These 11 Stock Picks However, Cramer pointed out that the tone shifted significantly just after the market closed. In his words, “We get incredible news that is sure to drive this market higher.” The news came directly from the President, who clarified that he had no intention of firing Powell, a rumor that Cramer identified as a major factor in the prior day’s market slide. Trump’s statement, “Never did, never will,” regarding any plans to remove Powell effectively erased the cloud of uncertainty that had been hanging over the markets. Given this reversal, Cramer questioned whether the rally could still be called a bear market bounce. In his view, it now looked like something more substantial. He explained that real recoveries are often mischaracterized at first. According to Cramer, they typically begin with what appear to be bear market rallies, short-lived, suspicious upticks that many investors brush off due to repeated disappointments in the past. He stressed that the early stages of genuine market turnarounds are often marked by disbelief and hesitation, with only the boldest or most reckless traders recognizing their potential early on. He added: “Now look, just because the President doesn’t want a constitutional crisis and is going to keep Powell doesn’t mean we have more to go on. For example, there’s been no sign of change from the administration on the trade wars.” For this article, we compiled a list of 13 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on April 22, 2024. We then calculated their performance from April 22nd, 2024, market close to April 23rd, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them.",
