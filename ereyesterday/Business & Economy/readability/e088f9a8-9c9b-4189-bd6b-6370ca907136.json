  "text": "In This Article: Home Depot Inc. (NYSE:HD) traded higher Tuesday after reporting first-quarter 2025 results and reaffirming its full-year outlook. Sales rose 9.4% year over year to $39.86 billion, topping the $39.33 billion consensus. Adjusted earnings per share fell 3% to $3.56, missing the $3.60 estimate. Overall comparable sales declined 0.3%, with U.S. comps gained 0.2% year-over-year. Foreign exchange weighed on total comp sales by about 70 basis points. Customer transactions grew 2.1%. Home Depot did not explicitly mention tariffs in its first-quarter press release, but updated its forward-looking statement compared to the fourth quarter by expanding risks to include \"tariffs, trade policy changes or restrictions, or international trade disputes\" and supply chain diversification in multiple clauses.
