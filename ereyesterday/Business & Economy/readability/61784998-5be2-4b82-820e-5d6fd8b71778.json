  "description": "Scott and Missy Tannen knew nothing about bed linens when they dreamed up the idea of launching a bedding company, but that didn’t stop them from setting ambitious goals: super soft sheets, 100% organic cotton, and a supply chain that was traceable from end to end. Thanks to an article in the Wall Street Journal and a $2 million advertising bet on The Howard Stern Show, Boll \u0026 Branch grew rapidly, but also faced crippling cash crunches, forcing the Tannens to scramble for loans and borrow against their own home. Today, Boll \u0026 Branch is one of the most popular luxury linen brands in the U.S., with over $200 million in revenue. This episode was researched and produced by Katherine Sypher, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
