The biggest exchange-traded fund tracking long-dated Treasuries swung violently in 2024 before finishing deeply in the red. AgenciesSo numerous were the cross-currents that a strategy built for all-weather success, the multi-asset portfolio model known as risk parity, ended the year roughly unchanged, as measured by the RPAR Risk Parity ETF.New York: For all the Trump Trade triumphalism and hysteria for AI, it's been a tough year to make money across markets. Now even the trade that powered US stocks is starting to show signs of wavering.A fickle Fed and inflation's refusal to go quietly has been a recipe for cross-asset malaise. The biggest exchange-traded fund tracking long-dated Treasuries swung violently in 2024 before finishing deeply in the red. Commodities rode the hopes and dreams of Chinese stimulus, up and down. Gains were even squeezed in the safest credits, where spiking yields pushed BlackRock's $30 billion investment-grade ETF to its worst fourth quarter in eight years.The one bright spot was equities, and US companies again stole the show. The advance was the furthest thing from a uniform march, though - including Friday, when a normally sleepy year-end session saw the S\u0026P 500 fall as much as 1.7% on no obvious news. That drop capped a year when value and small-cap shares struggled, and the S\u0026P 500's 25% return masked a gain of half that in its average member.Ominously, it was also the second shellacking in as many weeks for the one equity strategy that has worked reliably in 2024: momentum investing, or riding the market's winners. A record year for momentum has rewarded its faithful handsomely - while also raising risk that blowups like Friday's will become more common.\"Momentum is great until it's not, until something changes,\" said Melissa Brown, head of applied research at SimCorp, which offers factor risk models.Even with this week's pullback, the popular quant trade that buys the past year's top names and sells the losers has gained 31% in 2024, set for the best year ever in data going back to 2002, a S\u0026P Dow Jones index shows. In short, the stock leaderboard proved remarkably consistent, with Big Tech favorites like Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. sitting steadily at the top. While that's handed an easy gain to anyone with an index fund, the all-too-familiar setup is adding fuel to concerns that stock gains have become too concentrated and crowded.That's against a backdrop of too many twists to count, starting with a US central bank that was at times dovish, then hawkish again, and encompassing everything from worldwide election drama and simmering geopolitical tension to China's varying postures toward economic stimulus.So numerous were the cross-currents that a strategy built for all-weather success, the multi-asset portfolio model known as risk parity, ended the year roughly unchanged, as measured by the RPAR Risk Parity ETF.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
