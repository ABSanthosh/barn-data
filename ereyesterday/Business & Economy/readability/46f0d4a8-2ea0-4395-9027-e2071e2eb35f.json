  "text": "Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable tech companies, is undergoing a sweeping internal transformation punctuated by mass layoffs, even as its financial performance soars and its ambitions in artificial intelligence reach unprecedented heights. In a memo sent to employees on July 24, CEO Satya Nadella outlined the paradox at the heart of Microsoft’s current moment: ongoing job cuts amid record profits, bold AI investment, and a corporate culture in flux. The scope of Microsoft’s 2025 layoffs is considerable. More than 15,000 positions—about 7% of the company’s global workforce—have been eliminated since January, making this the company’s largest personnel reduction since the 2014 cuts following the Nokia acquisition. The latest and most significant wave came in July, when roughly 9,000 employees, or 4% of staff, were informed their roles were being eliminated. These latest reductions followed prior rounds in May and June, which saw thousands more let go as the company aggressively reshaped itself for the AI era. The memo: confronting the ‘enigma of success’ In his July memo, Nadella directly addressed the seeming contradiction at the heart of the layoffs. “By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving—our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right,” he wrote, noting the company’s capital expenditures, largely fueled by investments in AI and cloud infrastructure, are at historic highs. Despite these investments, he said headcount “is relatively unchanged,” given the simultaneous reduction of jobs. Nadella called this tension the “enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value,” arguing that success in tech is not permanent or evenly distributed. “Progress isn’t linear. It’s dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it’s also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before.” Expressing gratitude to those let go, Nadella acknowledged the human cost. “Their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today. And for that, I am deeply grateful.” Resetting Microsoft’s mission Nadella rooted Microsoft’s new direction in three core business priorities: security, quality and AI transformation. He said in the era of AI, Microsoft’s mission must move from building static tools to empowering every person and organization to build their own. Nadella described a vision where “all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips.” The company, he said, is pivoting from a “software factory” to an “intelligence engine”—an acknowledgment that AI is now the lens through which Microsoft will view every product, service, and business unit. This transition comes with heavy investment: Microsoft is pouring $80 billion into AI infrastructure this fiscal year, redeploying capital and, crucially, shifting a portion of the workforce to make room for these new bets. Nadella issued a call to action to stem anxieties around job security and morale, urging employees to maintain a “growth mindset” and approach the messiness of transformation with humility and resolve. “It might feel messy at times, but transformation always is. Teams are reorganizing. Scopes are expanding. New opportunities are everywhere,” he wrote, describing the current focus on AI as similar to the 1990s tech revolution in PCs and productivity software. Microsoft’s sweeping job cuts echo a wider trend among tech giants in 2025, as companies recalibrate for a post-pandemic market increasingly defined by AI-driven automation. By one count, more than 80,000 jobs have been slashed in the tech industry this year. Nadella’s memo did not rule out further layoffs and also did not promise stability, seeking to unify staff around the mission to “empower others to build now.” For this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.
