  "description": "Dr. Dennis Gross was worried about putting his name on his skincare brand: would the word “gross” turn shoppers away? But Dennis and his wife and business partner, Carrie, realized that the key to the brand’s success lay in another part of the name – “Dr.” Dennis was able to use his experience as a dermatologist to develop effective skincare products, starting with a peel that could be done at home without causing blotchy skin. Later, the brand introduced an LED face mask, which looked like C-3P0 and lit up TikTok in glowing red and blue. In 2023, after being bootstrapped for much of its existence, the business was sold to cosmetics giant Shiseido in a deal worth $450 million.This episode was researched and produced by Alex Cheng and edited by Neva Grant, with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.
