Trading stocks successfully is a skill that many of the world's best fund managers have honed for decades. That's why tracking the public records of stock trades by large investment firms and successful traders can give you some great ideas about how to build your portfolio. After all, nothing succeeds like success, right? Keep reading to discover three stocks that some of the world's biggest billionaire fund managers are backing to have a big 2025. Don't Miss: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum.  Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate — This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! The Amazon online retail and e-commerce platform is one of the world's largest. Still, CEO Jeff Bezos has done an equally effective job expanding his company's footprint into other business sectors. Public filings show that Amazon's bread and butter business (e-commerce) accounts for nearly 40% of its revenue. Still, the advertising sector has analysts excited about Amazon's future. According to Amazon's Q3 2024 earnings report, the company generated $158.9 billion in revenue. That was an 11% increase over the previous year, but the advertising revenue was particularly strong. Amazon brought in $14.3 billion in advertising revenue, which bested the Q3 2023 figures by nearly 20%. That helped Amazon increase its free cash flow by 128% to $46.1 billion. See Also: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. More importantly, there is every expectation that Amazon will continue growing revenue from non-retail services (with higher profit margins) such as advertising and cloud computing. Amazon stock is trading at $226.09, but the consensus among Benzinga analysts sees Amazon hitting $239.08 by early 2025. This may help explain why heavyweights like Ken Griffin and Ray Dalio have been loading up on Amazon. Mark Zuckerberg's Meta (formerly known as Facebook) has been ubiquitous on the internet for most of the century. Like Amazon, Meta's Q3 2024 earnings show the company successfully leveraged its global customer base to create significant advertising revenue. The Meta Family of Apps (Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram) generated $39 billion in revenue, which beat 2023's numbers by 19%.",
