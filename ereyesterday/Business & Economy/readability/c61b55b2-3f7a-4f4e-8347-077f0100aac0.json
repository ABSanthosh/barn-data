InvestingPro Insights As Eric M. Sprink, CEO of Coastal Financial Corp (NASDAQ:CCB), recently sold shares, it's worth noting that the company's stock has been performing strongly. According to InvestingPro data, CCB has seen a robust 49.75% price total return over the past six months, and is currently trading near its 52-week high at 96.37% of that peak.

For those seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 10 additional tips for CCB, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.
