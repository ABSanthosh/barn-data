Imagine you have $50,000 to give to your daughter and her husband for a down payment on their new home. The question is, will you owe gift taxes because of your generous gesture? Despite popular framing, the federal gift and estate taxes only apply to very wealthy households. Unless you have approximately $13 million to give away over your lifetime, these taxes likely won’t apply to you. A financial advisor can help you navigate and plan for gift and estate taxes. Find an advisor today. To be very clear, these are the rules for federal taxation. Every state also has its own tax laws and every tax profile is different, so make sure to speak with a financial or tax professional before making any plans for your own assets. However, there are two main issues to consider within this scenario: the mortgage process and potential gift tax implications. A person signs a check. With the mortgage and lender process, you want to ensure that you fill out all forms and requirements correctly. It is extremely unlikely that you can complicate the title to this property, but you can certainly complicate or invalidate the loan by making a mistake. When your daughter applies for her mortgage, the lender will go through her finances in detail. They want to know what assets she has, where they came from, what income she has and any other information related to how she will repay this debt. The down payment is intended as an indicator of this financial stability, so receiving it from a third party can raise concerns. Many lenders have rules around who can provide the money for a down payment. It’s common for them to reject a mortgage with a gifted down payment unless that money comes from someone with a longstanding relationship to the borrower. Among other issues, this is intended to prevent fraud and money laundering. Since the borrower is your daughter, that shouldn’t be a problem. If you are giving the money directly to your daughter you will typically either need to “season” the money or provide a gift letter. Seasoning the money means transferring it more than 60 days in advance, again as an indicator of legitimacy against fraudulent transfers. A gift letter is a document signed by both the giver and the recipient confirming that this is a unilateral transfer with no right to repayment. The specific format of the gift letter will vary based on lender and jurisdiction, so consult an attorney about this document. A financial advisor can also potentially help you through this process.",
