Santiago | Getty ImagesThe Melania Trump movie deal came to light two days after Ann Telnaes, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist at The Washington Post — which is owned by Bezos — said she had resigned from the newspaper because her bosses blocked the publication of a satirical cartoon depicting Bezos and other billionaires kneeling before Trump.The cartoon features satirical drawings of Bezos, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg holding up bags with dollar signs to Trump, who is on a pedestal. Another man seen kneeling before Trump, holding up a lipstick tube, represents Patrick Soon-Shiong, the billionaire publisher and owner of the Los Angeles Times newspaper.Soon-Shiong in October blocked the LA Times' planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election against Trump.Satirical drawing by Washington Post cartoonist Ann Telnaes, who resigned after it was rejected.Courtesy of Ann TelnaesThe Washington Post's news section previously reported that Bezos decided that the paper would not publish its own planned editorial page endorsement of Harris.Telnaes in a blog post Friday wrote that it was the first time that the Post killed one of her cartoons \"because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at.\"\"The cartoon that was killed criticizes the billionaire tech and media chief executives who have been doing their best to curry favor with incoming President-elect Trump,\" Telnaes wrote.Washington Post editorial page editor David Shipley said the cartoon was rejected because \"we had just published a column on the same topic as the cartoon and had already scheduled another column – this one a satire – for publication.\"\"The only bias was against repetition,\" Shipley said in a statement.Post publisher Will Lewis has denied that Bezos played a role in killing the Harris endorsement.Several members of the Post's editorial board resigned from that board due to the decision to spike the endorsement.NPR on Saturday reported that 300,000 people canceled digital subscriptions between that news outlet breaking the news of the killed endorsement on Oct. 24 and Election Day. That tally \"represents about 12% of all digital subscriptions,\" according to NPR.",
