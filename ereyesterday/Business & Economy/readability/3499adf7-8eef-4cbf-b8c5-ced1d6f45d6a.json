  "text": "In This Article: Palantir by Hiroshi-Mori-Stock via Shutterstock As the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution reshapes industries and global tensions rise in 2025, Palantir Technologies (PLTR) stands at the nexus of data analytics and digital warfare. More than just another AI software company, Palantir powers real-time decision systems for defense, intelligence, and high-stakes enterprise. Founded in the post-9/11 urgency, the firm's roots run deep with U.S. federal agencies — and now, it’s storming the commercial arena with its AI-driven platforms. Invest in Gold Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. The geopolitical storm intensified in June with the Israel-Iran conflict, amplifying a global climate that was already heating up from Russia-Ukraine tensions and flashpoints across the Taiwan Strait. Nations turned to technology that could process chaos at speed, and Palantir delivered. Trusted by the U.S. government and now adopted by NATO across all 32 member states, Palantir’s influence has expanded in lockstep with global instability. Elon Musk’s Tesla Makes History With ‘First Time That a Car Has Delivered Itself to Its Owner’ This Defense Stock Could Be the Next Palantir. Should You Buy It Now?

There's no surprise, then, about PLTR stock’s impressive rally fueled by investor confidence in its relevance and reach. Yet, the stock's premium valuation remains a point of contention, with market optimism often outweighing near-term fundamentals. As the calendar flips to July, can PLTR stock’s high-flying run continue? Or is it time for investors to wait it out — or even cash out — before reality hits? Founded in 2003, Palantir began with a bold mission to support national security through smarter data. Fast forward, and it now powers decision-making across governments and industries through Gotham, Foundry, and its newest force multiplier launched in 2023, the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). This is not just software, but strategic infrastructure. Palantir enables institutions to transform fragmented data into operational clarity and action. With a market capitalization of $308 billion, the firm is a software titan in the large-cap arena. PLTR stock has been on a tear of late. Up 80% year-to-date (YTD), PLTR stock brushed a 52-week high of $148.22 on June 26 before cooling off slightly. Even in a shaky macro environment, Palantir is wearing the crown as the S\u0026P 500’s ($SPX) top performer so far this year. Zooming out, PLTR has skyrocketed a jaw-dropping 438% over the past 52 weeks, 789% over the past two years, and a mind-blowing 1,240% over the past three years.",
