The move is expected to lower borrowing costs for NBFCs, support loan growth, and ease margin pressures, with analysts seeing strong tailwinds for credit expansion and consumption demand.ETMarkets.comShares of Bajaj Finance jumped 5.5% to hit an intraday high of Rs 9,425.5 on the BSE in Friday’s trade, as the Reserve Bank of India's 50 basis point repo rate cut and 100 basis point CRR cut sparked broad optimism in the lending sector, especially among non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).While the aggressive repo rate cut is expected to weigh on net interest margins (NIMs) for banks in the near term, the RBI’s simultaneous move to reduce the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 100 bps, unlocking Rs 2.5 lakh crore of liquidity, has emerged as a game-changer for the credit ecosystem.For NBFCs like Bajaj Finance, which rely on borrowing from banks and capital markets to fund lending, this dual move of easing both rates and liquidity is expected to lower funding costs and support loan growth.Analysts noted that NBFCs stand to benefit disproportionately from the rate cut as falling interest rates reduce borrowing costs, enabling lenders to offer more competitive loan products and expand their credit books.Also read: RBI’s bazooka sends Sensex, Nifty soaring. What does it mean for stock market investorsLive Events“This move is likely to enhance liquidity in the system, making borrowing cheaper and encouraging companies to pursue capital expenditure,” said Divam Sharma, Founder of Green Portfolio PMS. “With FPI inflows slowing down, this infusion of liquidity is a timely and welcome move.”According to Arsh Mogre, Economist at PL Capital, “By lowering both the price (repo) and quantity (CRR) of money, the RBI has flattened the transmission curve. The CRR cut in particular offsets short-term pressures on margins from falling lending rates.”For a lender like Bajaj Finance, improved liquidity and falling interest rates are likely to aid credit disbursal, support margins, and revive consumption-led demand, especially in retail and SME segments.“Tailwinds for NIMs from improving systemic liquidity and deposit rate cuts are visible,” said Naveen Kulkarni, CIO at Axis Securities PMS.However, he said, even as H1FY26 will see a more pronounced impact of the rate cut on NIMs, some respite is expected over H2FY26.“Asset quality concern appears to be steadily waning with unsecured segment stress showing gradual signs of stability, while the secured segment asset quality continues to hold up well. At present, we would prefer banks with promising growth prospects, healthy deposit franchises, stable asset quality metrics and strong and steady management teams.”Also read: RBI slashes rates by 50 bps: What it means for debt mutual fund investorsWith the RBI maintaining a neutral stance and indicating scope for further easing if inflation remains benign, NBFCs and banking companies could continue to benefit from the evolving rate cycle.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
