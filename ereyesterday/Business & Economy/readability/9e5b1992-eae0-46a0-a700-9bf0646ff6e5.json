  "text": "As he prepares to step down as CEO, it's time to look at the lessons learned. To me, the biggest lesson is to look at stocks as businesses, not just shares. Being able to handle one's emotions is key to long-term investing success. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway › I won't lie. It was an emotional experience to hear that Warren Buffett plans to step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. It truly marks the end of an era. The man has been rocking the stock market for decades. According to a piece by CNN, Buffett created returns of 5,500,000% during his investment career. Given all that time and experience, there is some investment wisdom we could all stand to learn from the Oracle of Omaha. Here are five pieces of his advice. Image source: The Motley Fool. In a New York Times op-ed, Buffett wrote about investing in America. When you look at Berkshire's holdings, the vast majority of its stocks (as a percentage of total capital in play) are American companies. Despite some of the current woes over trade wars and high prices on consumers, America remains the largest economy in the world, and arguably the most innovative. Where better to invest your dollars? This quote is incredibly meaningful, and makes perfect sense. Everyone wants that crystal ball telling them when to go to cash, and when to be heavily involved in stocks. In many ways, it comes down to seeing when the market is getting ahead of itself from a valuation standpoint. That, of course, is an oversimplification of a very complex dynamic. However, when you watch Buffett, some of his biggest moves have happened when he swoops in when things are bad. He bought up stocks in the 2008 financial crisis, and is currently sitting on a massive pile of cash of nearly $350 billion, indicating that the company is prepared perhaps for an event in the future. He has largely attributed it to learning from longtime partner Charlie Munger, but Buffett advocates buying \"wonderful companies at fair prices, rather than fair companies at wonderful prices.\" Sometimes, it's easy to get caught up in a stock that is trading below book value, but you also have to ask yourself why is it trading below book value. Buffett made a huge bet on Apple that paid off handsomely, but it wasn't necessarily the cheapest stock. He saw the value in the power of its brand, and what it was doing with the utility of an iPhone.",
