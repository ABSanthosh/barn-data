He also said that he will ask the administration to invoke 'Aliens Enemies Act of 1798, and will direct the government to use the \"full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement\" to end \"foreign gangs on US soil\". Trump further said that he will change the name of Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America. Trump's return to the White House is marked by his promise to push the limits of executive power, deport millions of immigrants, and to transform the role of America on the world stage. Trump has promised a flurry of actions, including imposition of tariffs on countries such as Canada, China and Mexico, as soon as he takes office.   Only men and women  Trump said that he will ask the administration to recognise only two biological sexes, and not transgenders.  The move is seen as an attempt by Trump to dismantle the 'woke culture' which he promised during his campaigning.  'The future is ours' Trump ends his speech  Trump ended his speech by acknowledging his political comeback and said that  \"the American people have spoken\". \"I stand before you as proof that you should never believe something is impossible to do.

From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign and independent nation,\" he said. \"The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun,\" Trump ended.",
