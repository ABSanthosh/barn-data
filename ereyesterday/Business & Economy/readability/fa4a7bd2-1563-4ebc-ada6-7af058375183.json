According to the TTD Chairman, Naidu conducted a teleconference and expressed dissatisfaction over the temple employees and said such an incident was unfortunate. There is some suspicion that it happened due to (the temple) administration, he said and added that the CM is coming to Tirupati on Thursday to comfort the injured persons. \"The CM directed us that these kinds of incidents should not recur\", he said. \"Taking this as a lesson, it is incumbent upon all of us to avert these kinds of incidents in the future,\" said Naidu, adding the CM will announce exgratia on Thursday. Terming the stampede as unfortunate, TTD board member Bhanu Prakash sought the forgiveness of Srivari (Lord Venkateswara Swamy) devotees over the incident. There was some lacuna and stringent action will be taken but lost lives cannot be brought back, he said.
