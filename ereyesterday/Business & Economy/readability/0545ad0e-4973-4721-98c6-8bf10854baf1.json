  "text": "Investing.com-- President-elect Donald Trump made several promises, including an immigration crackdown and government deregulation when speaking at a Washington rally on Sunday evening, as he prepares to take office this week.  Trump reiterated several of his campaign promises, most notably his harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration, as marked a victory lap rally ahead of his inauguration on Monday. It was also Trump’s first major address in Washington since 2021.  “We will expel every single illegal alien, gang member and migrant criminal operating on American soil,” Trump said, speaking at the “Make America Great Again Victory Rally” at the Capital One (NYSE:) Arena.  He vowed to withdraw all executive orders issued by President Joe Biden, and said he was preparing for a landmark first day in office. Fox News Digital reported Trump plans to sign over 200 executive orders when he takes office on Monday.  Trump also vowed to lessen regulations on the American energy industry, reiterating his plans to reduce government oversight. He also flagged plans to cut government spending in an effort led by Tesla (NASDAQ:) CEO Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, under the Department of Government Efficiency.  Missing from Trump’s remarks were his plans to impose trade tariffs, particularly on China. The President-elect had maintained a harsh rhetoric against China during his campaigning efforts, and had vowed to impose an up to 60% import tariff on all goods from China.  Trump’s plans for tariffs have been a major point of concern, amid fears that they could underpin inflation and keep interest rates high in the long term. But Trump on Sunday vowed to bring down inflation and cut taxes.  Despite his hawkish stance against China, Trump had earlier on Sunday vowed to delay a ban on popular social media app TikTok with an executive order on day one of his presidency.  TikTok began restoring some of its services in the U.S. after Trump’s comments, with the President-elect calling for a joint venture with TikTok owner Bytedance to keep the app in the U.S. Sunday’s rally was marked by appearances and performances by several celebrities, including popular actor Sylvester Stallone and musician Kid Rock. Tesla’s Musk also made an appearance at the rally.",
