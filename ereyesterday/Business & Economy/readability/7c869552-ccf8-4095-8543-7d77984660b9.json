  "description": "In this episode of the Duck Tape Marketing Podcast, I had the pleasure of being interviewed by Sara Nay. Sara Nay is the COO of Duct Tape Marketing. She oversees day-to-day operations to support the growth of Duct Tape Marketing and the Duct Tape Marketing Consultant Network. She focuses on strategic planning, goal setting, and directing the company's operations in support of its goals. And on a personal note, she’s also my daughter—which makes me “Pop Pop” to her kids! In this episode, we change it up a bit as I become the interviewee. We explore my journey into entrepreneurship, why I started my own business, why I didn’t work for someone else (the answer will surprise you), my passion for small businesses, and the evolution of marketing over the years. I reveal lessons from my polar opposite parents and my former fears about running a business. We also dive into my favorite topic: the impact of AI on small businesses, the opportunities and challenges they face, and the importance of curiosity and innovation in business. I wrapped up with a glimpse into my future aspirations—what might life look like after Duct Tape? And I answered the timeless question: What’s my all-time favorite business book?

I wrapped up with a glimpse into my future aspirations—what might life look like after Duct Tape? And I answered the timeless question: What’s my all-time favorite business book? Key Takeaways: I started my entrepreneurial journey due to a lack of confidence in traditional employment. Working with small businesses is both terrifying and gratifying. Curiosity drives me to explore new marketing trends and technologies. AI is not just a tool but a foundational element in marketing. Small businesses can leverage AI for efficiency and personalization. The buying intent of consumers remains strong despite market changes. Experience helps entrepreneurs navigate ups and downs in business. Marketing and innovation are the two pillars of a successful business. Reading outside of business literature can inspire innovative ideas. I envision a future where I write a work of fiction.
