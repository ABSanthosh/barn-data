While the HNI portions were undersubscribed for Swiggy, Hyundai India, Niva Bupa Health and Godavari Biorefineries, another four barely managed single-digit subscriptions. This is a stark contrast to an average of 116 times HNI subscriptions in the preceding 10 IPOs.The Sensex has declined more than 11% since September 27 after hitting a record high. In India's largest public issue - Hyundai India's ₹27,870-crore IPO - only 60% of the HNI portion got bids, while in case of Sagility India, it was a modest 1.93 times.Mumbai: A correction in the secondary market and a sharp decline in grey market premiums have driven wealthy investors away from the primary market, leaving institutional investors to ensure the success of initial public offerings. Of the last 10 IPOs, eight saw limited to little participation from high-net-worth individuals (HNIs). While the HNI portions were undersubscribed for Swiggy, Hyundai India, Niva Bupa Health and Godavari Biorefineries, another four barely managed single-digit subscriptions. This is a stark contrast to an average of 116 times HNI subscriptions in the preceding 10 IPOs. In Niva Bupa Health Insurance's public issue, just 71% of the shares reserved for HNIs were subscribed, though the overall subscription was 1.9 times. Swiggy's ₹11,327-crore IPO saw subscriptions for the HNI portion at 41%, even as the share sale got bids for 3.59 times the offer size. HNIs bid for the entire quota (1.02 times) earmarked for them in the ₹2,900-crore ACME Solar Holdings offer, where the subscriptions were 3.25 times for the retail portion and 3.72 times from institutional buyers.AgenciesCooling markets, collapsing grey market premiums, and rising funding costs have significantly dampened HNI interest in IPOs, bankers said.\"If you look at the Sebi study on IPOs, the clear revelation was that most HNIs that subscribed to IPO flipped on the listing. Essentially, the subscription level in an IPO is a function of the grey market premium,\" said Nikhil Ranka, chief investment officer-equities at Nuvama Asset Management. \"As markets cooled off and grey market premiums collapsed, the interest in IPO has waned to a large extent.\"The Sensex has declined more than 11% since September 27 after hitting a record high. In India's largest public issue - Hyundai India's ₹27,870-crore IPO - only 60% of the HNI portion got bids, while in case of Sagility India, it was a modest 1.93 times.“An overall correction in the Indian equity market on the back of local and global concerns has led to softness in non-institutional demand in recent IPOs,” said Ranvir Davda, cohead of investment banking at HSBC India. “This shift in sentiment can be mainly attributed to Indian corporate earnings being under pressure in Q2, a sharp spike in the inflation print in October coupled with geopolitical issues, volatility in the run-up to US elections and uncertainty around the timing of a Fed rate cut.” The 13 IPOs launched in September recorded an average HNI subscription of 180 times, while the 10 IPOs in August saw an average HNI subscription of 128 times. Manba Finance led with an HNI subscription of 512 times, followed by KRN Heat Exchanger and Gala Precision, both exceeding 400 times. Even the Rs 6,560 crore IPO of Bajaj Housing Finance saw robust HNI interest, with the category subscribed 44 times.According to investment banker Ravi Sardana, recent IPOs were aggressively priced amid a buoyant market. However, with the secondary market correction and rising funding costs, HNIs found little value left on the table. Bankers remain optimistic that HNIs will return to the primary markets once volatility in the secondary market subsides. “Once there is more visibility and predictability around these issues and markets witness a few IPOs with a strong after-market, one can then expect non-institutional demand to come back healthily,” said Davda of HSBC IndiaRead More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
