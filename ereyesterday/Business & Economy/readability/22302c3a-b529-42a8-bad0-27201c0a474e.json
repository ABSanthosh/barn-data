  "text": "Billionaire hedge fund manager Israel Englander co-founded Millennium Management in 1989 with $35 million. Today, Millennium has over $70 billion in assets under management and is one of the world's largest hedge funds. Englander has done well and has one of the best investing minds in the game. That's why investors anxiously await Millennium's quarterly 13F filing, a form required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosing a fund's holdings. Investors should understand that Millennium is a \"pod shop,\" which means it allocates capital to different teams (or \"pods\") that all have their own strategies and a lot of autonomy. So, an investment at Millennium may not have come directly at Englander's order. However, as the CEO, Englander likely still has a certain amount of control and a hand in big hiring decisions, so he certainly has faith in his portfolio managers. So don't follow these managers blindly -- but they can serve as sources for picking up new ideas and checking investment theses. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop?  Breakfast News delivers it all in a quick, Foolish, and free daily newsletter. Sign Up For Free » In the third quarter, Millennium sold large portions of its stakes in artificial intelligence (AI) companies Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) and bought a new stock that Wall Street thinks can soar. Millennium is not the only big fund selling the chipmaker Nvidia and analytics platform Palantir -- it's definitely been a trend in the third quarter. Millennium sold 13% of its stake in Nvidia in the third quarter, although it still owns 11.15 million shares and put and call options. Millennium sold 90% of its shares in Palantir but increased the company's call and put options on the stock, which could be a straddle options strategy. The sales appear to be more of a valuation call in a market many view as overbought and frothy. The market has ripped higher for the last two-plus years, spurred mainly by themes like tech, growth, and AI. NVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts As you can see above, these are astronomical valuations, despite AI's ability to disrupt life as we know it. I don't think institutional fund managers doubt the potential of AI, but an important yet difficult lesson for investors is that valuation does matter. The best businesses with unlimited potential can be bad purchases if bought at extremely high valuations. On the other hand, bad businesses with high debt loads can make great investments if bought at low enough valuations.",
