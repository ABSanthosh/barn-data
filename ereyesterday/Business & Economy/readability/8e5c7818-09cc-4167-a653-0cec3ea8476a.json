Edited excerpts:Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsWhat is your evaluation of the market at this juncture?Initially, I was a little worried about what foreigners would do given the lower earnings growth. They have sold about ₹1.5 lakh crore but the Nifty has fallen only about 1,200 points. And now they are also tired of selling. What is happening now is that the US is trading at the same valuations as India. It may be a little higher. This means that now there is a new benchmark for the valuation of the countries. I would not like to compare India with China because we are a growth country. So, now we are not that badly priced globally.And with so much liquidity in the global system, I think that we are fine, but you should always be ready for a 10% correction.What should investors expect from the market in 2025?The fact is that investors must be prepared for lower returns. In the US, it is possible that over the next 10 years, their return will be 4-5%. But the point is who wants to leave the party? Everybody wants to live in this moment.Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsA lot of people understand that they have got excessive returns and that future returns are going to be very low. But nobody is bothering about that. I look at only one thing: Earnings growth. If there are earnings, everything is fine. If there are no earnings, everything is wrong. Given that, we should be in for further correction but the domestic flows are so strong that the market is holding up.Do you see earnings growth weakening further?December quarter results will decide whether the earnings trajectory is changing. The issue is we are left with only three weeks now. I don't know how much push the government can give in this period. Businesses that are in slow mode, remain in that state.One big problem is there is no demand. RBI has become very tough with the lenders, which is very good. The banking system is in very good shape, but now the economy is lacking demand in general for consumer goods and services. Maybe inflation is biting.The recovery from Covid is over. Now we need a fresh push and give new purchasing power in the hands of the people. That is still not visible.My sense is that you will get some of a revival in the fourth quarter because, by that time, the bulk of the government expenditure will be in full flow. And that may change the outlook for earnings growth for 2025-26.People say it's a stock-picker's market now because of the valuations and earnings slowdown. What's your take?Absolutely. In fact, the theme of our wealth creation study this time is about turnaround stocks. It's about how to make money out of bruised blue chips which are in a bit of trouble at the moment not entirely because of their own doing. For instance, companies like Asian Paints and D Mart are getting bruised but they're authentic blue chips.How have you zeroed in on bruised bluechips?Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsThe first thing is that the bruised blue chip is down more than 50% of its all-time high. We have defined a bluechip as the top 50 Nifty companies plus the top 250 companies which generated an average 20% ROE (Return on Equity) for the last 10 years. So, there are about 107 companies in the current 250 that are blue chips. Classic examples of bruised bluechips of the past were Mahindra and Mahindra and Bharti Airtel.Which are the bluechip stocks that are bruised now?At the moment, I think 10 or 11 companies that are more than 30% bruised from the all-time highs. You will see there are two or three Adani companies, then Asian Paint is down by 30-33%. Avenue Supermarket is down by 30-33%, Tata Elxsi is down by 40-45%, and Berger Paints is also down by 37-38%.For us, a fall of 50% is very important. Right now, except for a few Adani companies, none of the other companies have crossed 50%. Now, what is the importance of 50% or 70%? It is the asymmetric payoff. When 100 becomes 50 and my blue chip goes back to 100, it’s a doubler for me. So, if it happens two years after my purchase, it’s a 40% return. If it happens in three years, it’s a 25% return and in four years, it is 18%. But the beauty is that I am buying an option into future prosperity. Do you see a bluechip like Asian Paints falling 50%? The problem for Asian Paints now is that the Birla Group has launched Birla Opus. The second-quarter profit of Asian Paints was down over 40%. The initial fear had already pulled down the Asian Paints share price by around 30%. The profitability in the next quarter could also be down. So, investors, who came in now or earlier, may come in to sell the stock again. The war in the paint industry will not be over in one year. Then there will be a point of maximum pessimism, and the important part will be to buy the stock around those levels. Now, it's easier said than done to identify that level because bottoms are made for fools and liars. But the idea is don’t look at the stock till it loses 50%. Asian Paints is down already 33%. So, if it falls another 10-15% which is not very unlikely, it will become a buy at Rs 1,700-1,800 levels. Now, I don’t know if it will fall to Rs 1,500, but one thing is for sure, for the asymmetry to work, I have got enough margin of safety now. How are you approaching bank stocks now? HDFC Bank in the last 15 days has gone to a new high but nobody seems to have noticed that because it has happened very silently. When it crosses Rs 2,000, that is when people will wake up. So, my sense is we are at the bottom of the cycle of the underperformance of private sector banks.Smaller lenders with MFI exposure are indeed seeing some stress. But I think 2025-26 will be a very good year following a very bad 2024-25. What will be your advice to investors? This is the market which is going to give you a return over a period of time but people want to make money very quickly. I don't think there is quick money here. In the next five years, markets won't go up three times, like in the past, the returns could be two times.",
