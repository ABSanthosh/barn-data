But, it may be too early to confirm the uptrend, said some analysts.ANIIn the past week, the mid-cap and small-cap indices slumped over 3.5%.Mumbai: India's equity indices bounced back on Monday, snapping their five-day losing run, as traders cut some of their bearish bets with the view that the markets were oversold. The Nifty, however, failed to breach the 200-day moving average (DMA) - a long-term trend indicator, suggesting that the undertone is still weak.The NSE Nifty gained 0.70%, or 165 points, to close at 23,753. The BSE Sensex advanced 0.64% or 498 points to close at 78,540.\"The markets were in oversold territory and the bounce-back today followed the rebound in global markets,\" said Vikas Jain, head of research at Reliance Securities. \"If Nifty holds above the 23,550 levels, then it could be a sustainable up- move.\"Both indices declined over 3% in the last five trading sessions.If the Nifty crosses the 200-DMA at 23,850, traders could cover their short positions, pushing the markets higher, said Jain.AgenciesThe Volatility Index or VIX - the market's fear gauge - plunged 10.3% to 13.52 on Monday, suggesting traders see lesser risks in the near term. But, it may be too early to confirm the uptrend, said some analysts.The rebound was a blip in the downward trend and not a sustainable up move, said Rohit Srivastava, founder, indiacharts.com.\"The gains came at the heels of the rebound in global markets on Friday but it is not a signal as the bond yield and dollar trends remain elevated and are likely to dictate macro trends,\" said Srivastava. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong advanced 0.82%. Taiwan moved 2.64% higher while Indonesia and South Korea gained 1.61% and 1.57% respectively. China declined by 0.5%.\"The markets are expected to head lower to 23,000 level,\" said Srivastava. \"On the higher side, it can move to around 24,000 level.\"Nifty Realty Index gained 1.47% on Monday while the FMCG Index moved 0.96% higher. Bank Nifty rose 1.1% while PSU Bank and Private Bank indices advanced 1.08% and 0.88%, respectively.\"Bank Nifty is holding its 200-day average at 50,500 level and could be at 52,000 levels post some short covering in banking stocks,\" said Jain.Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net ₹168.71 crore on Monday. Their domestic counterparts bought shares worth ₹2,227 crore. So far in December, overseas investors have bought to the tune of ₹19,747 crore after selling shares worth ₹1.15 lakh crore in the last two months.Jain said that investors will take cues from the upcoming result season in mid-January followed by Donald Trump taking charge as the US President.\"As foreign investors are on holiday at the year end, no major selling is anticipated and markets are likely to remain in a 1,500-point range with 23,550 as the support level amid some time wise corrections,\" said Jain.Srivastava said that pharma and healthcare is the only sector that has been holding out in the last few days as it is a defensive play and could do well in the near term as well.The Midcap 150 index advanced 0.12% while the Smallcap 250 index ended 0.4% lower on Monday. Out of the 4,218 shares traded on the BSE, 1,636 advanced, while 2,452 declined.In the past week, the mid-cap and small-cap indices slumped over 3.5%.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
