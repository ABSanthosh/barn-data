  "text": "Mumbai: Rating agencies are fishing for information to figure out how to factor the sudden disclosure of derivatives losses by IndusInd Bank last Monday into the company's ratings, said people aware of the development.According to Sebi regulations, rating agencies must review the rating of a borrower within seven working days of a 'material event'. Depending on the extent of information they obtain from the bank management, rating agencies may either decide to simply give a 'credit rating update' or place it on 'rating watch' with developing implications,' feel industry circles. Financial market would, however, take note of the commentary and rationale in the statements of the rating companies.Rating officials said that while they took note of the Reserve Bank of India's statement over the week-end that the bank was well-capitalised, they would keep a track on the bank's security prices, liquidity position, reports of any deposit withdrawal, and assess the bank and its promoters' ability to raise equity.If agencies, which have turned more vigilant since the IL\u0026FS default in 2018, put a company under 'watch' with developing implications, it indicates that review would be done based on further information. In case of IndusInd Bank, the rating companies would do the review and take a final stand on the rating based on their detailed interactions with the bank management and findings of the forensic report to be prepared by an external agency. Any rating watch with negative implications indicates that there is at least one-third chance of a downgrade in the next one year. Agencies\"It is also possible that rating agencies may bargain for more time by stating they would continue to watch the liquidity position over the next few days,\" said a debt market dealer.While declining to speak on IndusInd rating, Amish Mehta, MD \u0026 CEO of India's largest rating agency CRISIL, said, \"Stock price reaction does not mean that every agency involved needs to put out something. We have to take the company's point of view and see how best we can articulate the impact. Say, if you are talking about a bank, just the share price falling on one day may not have a major impact. Maybe the next day it may pick up. So, we need to evaluate whether it is a temporary phenomenon or a structural phenomenon.\"Crisil and IndiaRatings have assigned ratings AA+ on the bonds of IndusInd bank, while Care Ratings rated the certificate of deposits as A1+. Moody's also rates long-term foreign and local currency debt of IndusInd Bank.After certain discrepancies were disclosed in the accounting book of the bank’s derivatives portfolio, the bank stock fell 27% on Tuesday and 54% on a year-on-year basis. According to Sebi, a significant decline in the share prices or bond prices of the issuer or group companies is a material event that requires rating action and a press release within seven days. IndusInd Bank disclosed at an analyst’s call last Monday evening that it identified “some discrepancies in the accounting of some of the trades in September and October 2024,” following which the bank hired an external agency to start reviewing its business. ET reported on March 15 that the bank had appointed PwC as an external auditor. MP Chitale \u0026 Co and MSKA \u0026 Associates have written to the bank’s board requesting a forensic audit of the derivatives portfolio. The question has cropped up as to why the bank disclosed the discrepancies in March when it was discovered in September-October. Besides, the resignation of CFO Gobind Jain in January, and RBI granting just one-year extension to CEO Sumant Kathpalia despite board approving a three-year period have also raised eyebrows. According to IndusInd, Jain had left for a different reason. On March 10 evening, the bank also said an internal review estimated an adverse impact of 2.35% on its net worth as of December 2024.",
