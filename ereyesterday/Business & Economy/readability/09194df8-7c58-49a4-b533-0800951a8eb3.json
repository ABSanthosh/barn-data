On November 4, 2024, Hindenburg Research (\"Hindenburg\") published a report based on a 5-month investigation that included interviews with 18 former PACS employees, competitors, and an analysis of more than 900 PACS facility cost reports. The report alleged that the Company had \"abused a COVID-era waiver\" in a \"scheme\" that involved falsely submitting false Medicare claims which \"drove more than 100% of PACS' operating and net income from 2020 “ 2023, enabling PACS to IPO in early 2024 with the illusion of legitimate growth and profitability.\" The report further alleged that the Company engaged in a scheme to maintain revenue by \"billing thousands of unnecessary respiratory and sensory integration therapies to Medicare Part B regardless of clinical need or outcomes.\" The report also alleged that PACS engaged in a widespread practice of falsifying documentation, including by engaging in a \"scheme whereby PACS attempts to fool regulators by 'renting' licenses from third parties to 'hang' on buildings\" and then \"either employs unlicensed administrators or has administrators manage multiple buildings in excess of state mandated limits.\" Similarly, the report alleged that the Company engaged in a scheme related to licensure and staffing of nurses, whereby \"PACS secretly lists uncertified nurse aides (NAs) as certified in the system, in an apparent scheme to cheat staffing ratios\" and \"retroactively add fake RN hours\" in order \"to meet minimum staffing requirements, boost star ratings, and avoid costly penalties.\" Following publication of the Hindenburg report, PACS's stock price fell $11.93 per share, or 27.78%, to close at $31.01 per share on November 4, 2024.  Then, on November 6, 2024, PACS announced that it would postpone its fiscal third quarter 2024 earnings release. The Company further disclosed it had  \"received civil investigative demands from the federal government regarding the Company's reimbursement and referral practices that may or may not be related to this week's third-party report.\"   On this news, PACS's stock price fell an additional $11.45 per share, or 38.76%, to close at $18.09 per share on November 6, 2024.
