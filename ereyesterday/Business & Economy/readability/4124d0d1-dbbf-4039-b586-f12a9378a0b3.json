  "text": "In This Article: Warren Buffett's investment track record -- a 5,789,503% cumulative return over six decades -- has made him Wall Street's most-followed money manager. Thanks to an acquisition 27 years ago, Berkshire Hathaway is the parent company of a specialty investment firm, New England Asset Management. Two of the 122 securities held in Buffett's secret portfolio have lofty quantum computing ambitions. 10 stocks we like better than Alphabet › For the better part of the last six decades, billionaire Warren Buffett has been running circles around Wall Street as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). In his tenure as CEO, he’s overseen a 5,789,503% cumulative return in his company’s Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on July 7. For the sake of comparison, the benchmark S\u0026P 500 has returned around 41,400%, including dividends, over the same span. The Oracle of Omaha’s jaw-dropping long-term outperformance is what draws 40,000 investors to Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meetings. It’s also the reason investors attempt to mirror the buying and selling habits of Berkshire’s billionaire chief by closely tracking Berkshire’s quarterly Form 13F filings. This is the form that concisely details the buying and selling activity of Wall Street’s leading asset managers. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool. But here’s something you might not know about the stock market’s most-followed money manager: Berkshire’s 13F offers an incomplete picture of which stocks are held by Buffett’s company. Though we often think of Warren Buffett as an investor of mature, brand-name businesses, you’re about to discover that, indirectly, Berkshire’s billionaire investor is wagering on the quantum computing revolution to make his company’s shareholders richer. With the exception of the “confidential treatment” tag, which was affixed to Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F filing for the March-ended quarter, you’d be under the impression that all the securities (stocks and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs) held by Buffett’s company are listed in its 13F -- but you’d be wrong. In 1998, Berkshire Hathaway acquired General Re in a $22 billion all-stock deal.  Although the crown jewel of this transaction was General Re’s reinsurance operations, it also owned a specialty investment firm known as New England Asset Management (NEAM). When the buyout of General Re closed in December 1998, Berkshire Hathaway became its new parent company. To be crystal clear, Warren Buffett doesn’t directly oversee NEAM’s assets under management in the same manner that he oversees the buying and selling activity in Berkshire Hathaway’s primary investment portfolio, which tipped the scales at $292.3 billion, as of the closing bell on July 7. Nevertheless, the securities held by NEAM are, ultimately, under the umbrella of its parent company, Berkshire Hathaway. This makes New England Asset Management Warren Buffett’s “secret” portfolio.",
