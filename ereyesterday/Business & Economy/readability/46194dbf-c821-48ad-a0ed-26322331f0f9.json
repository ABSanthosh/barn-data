What should I do to make sure that doesn't happen? An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a standard retirement savings tool that is quite popular in America. According to the Investment Company Institute, 55.5 million U.S. households — roughly 42% of households throughout the country — reported having an IRA in 2023. IRAs undoubtedly play a crucial role for millions of Americans preparing for retirement, but what many people don’t realize is that IRAs are not a set-it-and-forget-it type of investment. In fact, if you have an IRA and you don’t know how to properly manage it, you could be setting yourself up for financial losses in the long term. I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 5 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Nervous about the stock market in 2025? Find out how you can access this $1B private real estate fund (with as little as $10) Americans with upside-down car loans owe more money than ever before — and drivers can’t keep up. Here are 3 ways to cut your monthly costs ASAP Unlike 401(k) accounts, IRAs give you a great deal of flexibility. You can invest in virtually anything you like, and you can open an account with a vast number of different brokerage firms and financial institutions. This flexibility can be both a blessing and a curse: if you manage the IRA well, you can grow your savings into a sizable nest egg — but if you mismanage the account, you could end up jeopardizing your future financial stability. So, let’s say you're in your 60s and you’re wondering what to do with your IRA. Your late spouse, who’s passed away, used to take care of your collective investments but managing the IRA is now your responsibility. Your bank recently sent you an email asking how you’d like to invest the funds in your IRA, and you have no idea what to do. The good news is there are a few proven strategies you can use — as well as some mistakes you should try to avoid — to get the most out of your IRA. One of the biggest mistakes to avoid is withdrawing money early. If you take money out of your IRA before the age of 59 ½ — and you don't fall within a limited number of exceptions — you will be charged a 10% penalty on the withdrawn funds. Furthermore, you'll also miss out on all the gains the invested funds could have made from the time of the withdrawal until the time that you retire, which could be a large amount of money. For example, if you withdraw $5,000 from your IRA at age 50, that money would have turned into $18,500.09 by age 67 — assuming an 8% average annual return on investment (ROI) — if you had left the $5K in the IRA.",
