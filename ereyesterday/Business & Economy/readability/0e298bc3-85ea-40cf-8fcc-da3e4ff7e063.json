The so-called “Liberation Day” announcement included tariff rates higher than hoped, forcing investors to reset expectations for the U.S. economy and corporate earnings. Given recent data, a potential slowdown in the U.S. economy may already be underway, and the risk that tariffs could push us into an outright recession casts a long shadow over stocks, given that stock prices' valuation is largely determined by future expectations for revenue and profit growth.

Gross has been navigating markets since 1971, and he co-founded Pacific Investment Management Co, or PIMCO, a massive firm with $2 trillion under management. He formerly managed over $270 billion via PIMCO’s Total Return Fund, earning him the “Bond King” nickname before moving to Janus Henderson Investors from 2014 to 2019. Gross has seen a lot over his 50-year career, and he offered a blunt message about the stock market this week.

For example, raising interest rates slows economic activity, crimping inflation. However, it also leads to layoffs, which we're currently experiencing.

However, delaying the inflation fight contributed to 8% inflation in 2022. While inflation has since retreated, it is cumulative, so the damage associated with hesitancy is still being felt. A weakening job market partly caused by higher rates keeping a lid on economic activity prompted the Fed to cut rates in the fourth quarter. However, inflation has crept higher to 2.8% in February from 2.4% in September, leading the Fed to press pause further cuts.",
