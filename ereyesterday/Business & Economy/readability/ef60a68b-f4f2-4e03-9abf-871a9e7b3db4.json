Bitcoin spiked to trade as high as $109,225, an intraday record, according to a CoinDesk index, before slipping back. It traded below $105,000 shortly after Trump was sworn in. Trump has positioned himself as a cryptocurrency champion, vowing moves such as establishing a U.S. bitcoin stockpile. Since he was elected, bitcoin has surged more than 50%. The president-elect and his wife, Melania, began selling new cryptocurrencies in recent days, meme coins named $TRUMP and $MELANIA. The projects quickly drew disapproval, with some critics saying the tokens create significant conflicts of interest. Ahead of the inauguration, The Wall Street Journal reported Trump doesn’t plan to levy tariffs on his first day in office—a scenario that many trading partners feared. The dollar extended losses, with the WSJ Dollar Index sliding 0.8% to a near-two-week low, while currencies of economies that were expected to be hit hard by tariffs strengthened. As of around midday, the British pound, the euro, the Mexican peso, the Canadian dollar and the offshore Chinese yuan had each gained 0.8% or more against the dollar. Investors were bracing for Trump to issue a blitz of executive orders hours after becoming president, spanning border control, energy and government overhauls. “Once those executive orders start coming through and the implications of those are analyzed, that’s where you’ll see sway on markets,” said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. That will likely keep asset prices volatile, Streeter said. “It could be that some of the worst fears may not materialize; on the other hand, there could be a move that comes out of the blue.” Many investors are bracing for potential turbulence as a result of Trump’s promised policies. - Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images U.S. stocks made big gains last week, following strong bank earnings and an inflation report that suggested underlying price pressures are easing. But many investors are bracing for potential turbulence, worrying that Trump’s promised policies, including hefty tariffs, could reaccelerate inflation—with far-reaching consequences for markets and Federal Reserve policy.",
