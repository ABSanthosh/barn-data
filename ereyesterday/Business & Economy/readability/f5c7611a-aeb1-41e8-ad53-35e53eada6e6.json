  "text": "In This Article: Most Americans never think about their country’s currency. They don’t have to. The US dollar (DX=F) has been a global benchmark for decades, conferring unique advantages to those lucky enough to live in its ecosystem. Yet as President Trump disrupts everything and anything, the once sacrosanct US dollar is looking like an unintended victim. If so, that means millions of Americans could end up losing privileges such as lower-than-average interest rates, stability long taken for granted, and an economy that everybody once wanted to be a part of. The trouble started — get ready for it — with Trump’s tariffs. The tariff playbook changes nearly every day, but it seems to have settled into a giant trade war with China and lesser skirmishes with the rest of the world. The war now entails enormous 145% tariffs on most Chinese goods, along with 25% tariffs on imported cars, car parts, steel, and aluminum. There’s also a new “baseline” tariff of 10% on most imports not covered by those other tariffs. China has retaliated with a 125% tariff on imports from the United States and other limits on American goods. Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet Overall, the average import tax on $3 trillion worth of imported goods will soar from 2.5% when Trump took office to about 27%, according to the Yale Budget Lab. Trump’s China tariffs will massively raise costs for some American businesses and prices for hundreds of everyday products. Those added costs for businesses and consumers will damage corporate profits, push inflation higher, and possibly cause a recession with rising unemployment. That’s why there’s been a huge stock sell-off as investors try to price in falling corporate profits and the economic damage of a downturn or recession. But something worse has been happening. Global investors seem to be dumping all US assets denominated in dollars and moving their money to other parts of the world or to gold. That’s showing up in some peculiar and potentially alarming market developments. When stocks fall, investors normally put more money into safer bonds, especially US Treasury securities. When demand for Treasuries rises, the price does too, and the interest rates fall since borrowers issuing bonds can pay a lower return when demand for bonds gets stronger. What has started happening in the Trump sell-off is that stocks are falling, but long-term interest rates, which would normally fall, have been rising instead. Since April 2, for instance, the S\u0026P 500 (^GSPC) stock index has fallen about 5.5%. During the same time, the rate on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond (^TNX) rose by three-tenths of a percentage point. That might sound like a small change, but amid a “flight to safety,” with investors seeking safe havens for their money, it’s anything but.",
