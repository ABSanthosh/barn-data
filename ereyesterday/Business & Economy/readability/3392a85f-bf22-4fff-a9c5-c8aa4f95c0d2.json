  "text": "U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, is doggedly working toward rallying votes for the GOP on Election Day, but she's certainly not losing sight of her investments. Greene continues to make additions to her portfolio as she has steadfastly done over the past few months. Consistent with her previous rounds of buying activity, Greene recently added to her artificial intelligence (AI) exposure, picking up shares of Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT), ASML (NASDAQ: ASML), Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL), Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). But it wasn't only AI stocks that caught her attention. Greene also clicked the buy button on Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST). Although the exact amounts that Greene invested in each of the stocks is not clear, her regulatory filing acknowledges that each transaction on Oct. 4 was valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Taking even a cursory glance at Greene's trading history, investors will find that the representative from the Peach State often builds positions over time, practicing a dollar-cost averaging approach. In July, for example, Greene bought shares of both semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials and Dell, a stalwart in building computers and data centers. On the day that Greene bought Applied Materials and Dell in July, they closed at $219.65 and $125.85, respectively, and it's likely she lowered the average price she paid for them. On Oct. 4, Applied Materials closed at $201.97, while Dell ended the trading session at $120.42. Similarly, Greene increased her position in semiconductor powerhouse ASML during her latest buying round. On June 24, when Greene first bought ASML stock, shares ended the day at $1,002.01, having climbed about 37% since the start of the year. The latest purchase, however, was considerably less expensive. Shares of the semiconductor equipment maker have suffered recently as analysts have espoused bearish stances of ASML stock. This helped Greene to lower her average price paid for the stock as she picked up shares on a day when the stock ended the trading session at $833. Not every repeat purchase for Greene during this latest buying round required a stock to be at a lower price. Initially, Greene gained exposure to Lam Research, which provides wafer fabrication equipment and services to semiconductor manufacturers, on Sept. 20, when shares closed at $77.32 (adjusted for the recent stock split). On Oct. 4, shares of Lam Research closed at $81.54.",
