These are the three things Yang mentions in a recent TikTok. Don't Miss: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart \u0026 Target – Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.30/share! Yang was quick to mention that you should avoid lending money to your friends and family. He makes this point clear within the first five seconds of the video and explains that lending money to friends and family can create unnecessary awkwardness and drama. Imagine giving $10,000 to a family member who promises to pay it back but then they don't follow up on paying it back. It's going to make the relationship feel uncomfortable, especially if a friend or family member gives you a hard time when you ask for your money. You can set a hard line and not lend a dollar to anyone. However, if you still want to give some money, you can give a much smaller amount as a gift. For instance, if a friend or family member asks for $10,000, you can give them $100 on the condition that they never ask you for money again. It may be better to set a hard stance and not give anyone any money right from the start, but each person is different.

Then, you won't have to sell your stocks and other assets to cover an emergency. However, the bank account you use plays a big role in how much interest you earn. Many big banks rely on their branding and long history to attract customers. However, many of these same financial institutions have checking and savings accounts with low or no interest. If you explore your options and consider online banking, it's easier to find high-yield savings accounts that offer up to 4% APY. If you save $10,000 at 4% APY, you will earn $400 during that year. However, big banks usually have much lower rates, meaning you'll receive far less than $400 with the same $10,000 balance.",
