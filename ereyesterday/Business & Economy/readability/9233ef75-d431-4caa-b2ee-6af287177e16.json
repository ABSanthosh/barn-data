The midpoint of the fourth-quarter guidance, $1.135 billion, trailed analyst estimates of $1.143 billion.Pinterest CFO Julia Donnelly told analysts during an earnings call that ongoing weaknesses from food and beverage advertisers, which are part of the broader consumer packaged goods market, has negatively impacted the social media company's overall sales. The slump by this sector will likely continue into the fourth quarter, she said.Pinterest also said in a filing Thursday that its board authorized a $2 billion share buyback.Sales in Pinterest's third quarter rose 18% from $763.2 million a year ago.Pinterest said it had 537 million global monthly active users in the third quarter, topping analyst estimates of 532.6 million.  The company's net income grew a whopping 354% year over year to $30.56 million. Its total cost and expenses for the quarter were $904 million, up 17% compared with $768 million the previous year.Donnelly attributed Pinterest's rising expenses to investments in research and development and hiring for employees with expertise in artificial intelligence.Pinterest's latest quarterly earnings follows the recent U.S. presidential election earlier in the week in addition to multiple earnings reports from other tech companies with online advertising businesses.Last week, Amazon said its ads business grew 19% year over year to $14.3 billion in the third quarter, and Meta said its third-quarter sales rose 19% year over year to $40.59 billion. However, Meta shares dropped slightly on weaker-than-expected user numbers and warned of a significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses in 2025.",
