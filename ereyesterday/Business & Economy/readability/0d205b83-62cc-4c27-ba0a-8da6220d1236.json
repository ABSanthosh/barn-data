  "text": "New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - January 23, 2025) - WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of common stock of Dentsply Sirona Inc. (NASDAQ: XRAY) between May 6, 2021 and November 6, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), of the important January 27, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Dentsply Sirona common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Dentsply Sirona class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=31762 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than January 27, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action (WA:) Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material facts necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not false and misleading. In truth, Byte aligners had been causing serious injuries to patients since at least May 2021, as revealed in backlogged injury reports that Dentsply Sirona filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") over the course of 2024. At least part of the problem was that customer service employees and overseeing dentists were incentivized to enroll contraindicated patients who had other dental issues which should have made them ineligible for Byte treatment. As a result, defendants' positive statements concerning Byte's customer experience, and the expansive network of dentists overseeing and controlling each customer's treatment, were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. In addition, Dentsply Sirona concealed the fact that its high conversion rates were due to sales incentives to enroll contraindicated patients. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Dentsply Sirona class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=31762 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
