  "description": "If you’ve ever bought sports merch or bet on a big-league game, you’ve likely spent money on Fanatics. It’s a massive one-stop-shop for sports, founded by a guy who could barely read growing up. What Michael Rubin did know was how to spin a deal: by 15, he was making thousands of dollars trading in closeout sporting goods, and by his early 20’s, he was CEO of a public company. Since 2011, when he acquired Fanatics, Michael has focused his relentless energy into building his $25 billion sports branding business. Michael says he’ll run the company until he dies, but first has to figure out how to sleep.  This episode was produced by Devan Schwartz with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.
