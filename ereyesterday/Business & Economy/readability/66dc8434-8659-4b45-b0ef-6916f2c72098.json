Circle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL) has recently started to become a regular feature on Cramer’s morning and evening appearances. It is one of the more recent firms to list its shares on the market. Since its June IPO, the shares have gained 138%. Circle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL) is a financial technology company that primarily allows customers to conduct cryptocurrency transactions. However, despite strong post-IPO gains, the stock has suffered from the cryptocurrency sector’s characteristic volatility in June. Circle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL)’s shares lost 24.6% in just two days after investors wondered whether the firm could stand its ground amidst the expected growth in the stablecoin sector. For his part, Cramer commented on Circle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL)’s strong performance: “Look can I just say that these are some of the most bullish things I’ve seen in my career? . . . . That this Circle just keeps being bought, that Palantir keeps being bought. That a Broadom is going, that Goldman is going. . .” Circle Internet Group (CRCL) Is One Of The Most Bullish Things In My Career, Says Jim Cramer The CNBC TV host discussed Circle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL) in detail earlier. Here is what he said: “Finally, there’s Circle Internet Group. Again, I have conviction that this company has a bright future in the red-hot Stablecoin market. But I care about the stock price, not just the company. Less than three weeks ago, Circle Internet came public at $31. It’s now at $222 and change, and that’s after a 15% decline today. You may think you’ve made a fortune in this one. However, you’ve made nothing until you ring the register. I’m not questioning your conviction, I’m questioning your sanity. How can you not at least take your cost basis out? You can let the rest run. That way, you’re playing with the house’s money. That’s the ideal place to be because you’ll never lose.” While we acknowledge the potential of CRCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an extremely cheap AI stock that is also a major beneficiary of Trump tariffs and onshoring, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.
