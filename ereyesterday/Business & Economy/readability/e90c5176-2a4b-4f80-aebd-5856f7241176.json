  "text": "In This Article: We recently published a list of 15 Recent Activist Investor Campaigns. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against other recent activist investor campaigns. Economic uncertainty and market volatility are some of the factors fueling activist investor campaigns in 2025. In the first quarter alone, there was a 17% jump in activist campaigns, affirming how high-profile activist investors are becoming agitated and increasingly pushing for strategic changes aimed at unlocking shareholder value. “We are in a phase where activists continue to take advantage of all the uncertainties,” said Jim Rossman, global head of shareholder advisory at Barclays. “In early 2025 we have seen more fights, more settlements and more board seats won by the activists than we did this time a year ago.” The US remains the epicenter of shareholder activism, accounting for over half of the first quarter’s campaigns. Japan comes second with 16 campaigns, accounting for a 45% increase compared to the same period last year. The fresh efforts this year follow a record number of activist shareholders targeting businesses around the world in 2024. Additionally, the campaigns are on the rise owing to the market instability caused by President Donald Trump’s tariffs, widespread layoffs at U.S. government agencies, and recessionary fears.

According to a Barclays report, many activist investors remain focused on pushing for board changes. It also emerged that activists increasingly have their way as part of the campaigns, having won 51 board seats, up 34% from the same quarter a year ago. Secondly, activist investors are also agitating for strategic and operational changes, believing they could help unlock hidden value. Finally, 26% of the campaigns pushed for merger and acquisition activity, a significant drop from the historical average of 45%. Demands for merger \u0026 acquisition actions, such as selling a firm or selling business units, are still largely ignored, appearing in only around 25% of campaigns. Since the worldwide deal volume reached a record high in 2021, M\u0026A requests have decreased by around half. Although fewer activist campaigns were submitted by sustainability-minded shareholder activists to business annual meetings this year, conflicts on issues like corporate diversity initiatives still exist. As of February 21, investors pressuring corporations on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues submitted 355 shareholder proposals, compared to 536 at the same time in 2024 and 542 at the same time in 2023.",
