  "text": "“I look at rope flow as its own internal martial art.”— Nsima Inyang Nsima Inyang (@nsimainyang) is a strength athlete and movement coach and co-host of Mark Bell’s Power Project, one of the top fitness podcasts in the world. He is also one of the most freakishly athletic humans I’ve ever met. He’s a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, a professional natural bodybuilder (placed top five in the world), and an elite-level powerlifter (750-plus-pound deadlift, etc.)—but what sets him apart is how he blends all those worlds with unconventional training tools like kettlebells, maces, sandbags, and rope flow. After nearly 20 years of lifting and martial arts, Nsima has developed a unique way of helping people build muscle, move better, and stay pain-free for life. Nsima is also the founder of The Stronger Human, a growing online community focused on strength, movement, and resilience. With hundreds of thousands following his YouTube content, Nsima’s mission is simple: help people feel powerful in their bodies again—without relying solely on machines, cookie-cutter workouts, or the fitness industry’s outdated rules.

I often kickstart my mornings with their Pu’er Green Tea and Pu’er Black Tea, and I alternate between the two. This rare type of naturally fermented tea is more concentrated in polyphenol antioxidants than any other tea. It supports focus and mental clarity, healthy digestion, metabolism, and a healthy immune system. Their crystals are cold extracted, using only wild-harvested leaves from 250-year-old tea trees. Plus, they triple toxin screen for heavy metals, pesticides, and toxic mold—contaminants commonly found in tea. I also use the crystals for iced tea, which saves a ton of time and hassle.  ​For you, my dear listeners, Pique is offering 20% off—valid for the lifetime of your subscription—plus a free Starter Kit, which includes a rechargeable frother and glass beaker.

Anatomical/Physiological Terms Planes of Movement Sagittal Plane: a vertical plane that divides the body into left and right halves, where forward and backward movements occur. Frontal (Coronal) Plane: a vertical plane that divides the body into front and back halves, where side-to-side movements occur. Transverse Plane: a horizontal plane that divides the body into upper and lower halves, where rotational movements occur. Muscles/Body Parts Quadratus Lumborum (QL): a deep posterior abdominal wall muscle that stabilizes the lumbar spine and assists with lateral flexion and extension. External Obliques: the largest and most superficial abdominal muscle that assists with trunk flexion, lateral flexion, and contralateral rotation. Glutes: the group of three muscles (gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus) that form the buttocks and control hip movement and stability. Adductors: a group of muscles on the inner thigh that move the leg toward the body’s midline and stabilize the pelvis. Hamstrings: a group of three muscles on the back of the thigh that flex the knee and extend the hip joint. Quads: the four-muscle group on the front of the thigh that extends the knee and flexes the hip joint. Calves: the muscles on the back of the lower leg, primarily the gastrocnemius and soleus, that plantar flex the foot and assist with knee flexion. Scapula: the triangular shoulder blade bone that provides attachment points for muscles and allows arm movement at the shoulder joint. Lats: the large, flat muscles of the back that adduct, extend, and internally rotate the arm at the shoulder joint. Biceps: the two-headed muscle on the front of the upper arm that flexes the elbow and supinates the forearm. IT Band: the iliotibial band, a thick connective tissue structure that runs along the outer thigh from hip to knee, providing lateral knee stability. Vastus Lateralis: the largest of the quadriceps muscles, located on the outer thigh, that extends the knee and stabilizes the patella. Concepts Time Under Tension: a training method that involves slowing down exercise movements to increase the duration muscles are under strain, potentially enhancing muscle growth. Breathing: the process of respiration, with proper diaphragmatic breathing being essential for core stability and optimal exercise performance. Neutral Spine: the natural alignment of the spine maintaining its three curves (cervical, thoracic, lumbar) to minimize stress and optimize function. Spinal Engine: a biomechanical concept describing how the spine generates and transfers power through rotational movement patterns during locomotion. Contralateral Movement: movement patterns where opposite sides of the body work together, such as left arm with right leg during walking. Figure Eight Rotation: a three-dimensional spinal movement pattern that combines rotation, lateral flexion, and extension/flexion in a figure-eight motion. Disassociation (Upper/Lower Body): the ability to move the upper and lower body independently while maintaining core stability and proper alignment. Valsalva Maneuver: a breathing technique involving forced exhalation against a closed airway to increase intra-abdominal pressure and spinal stability. Intra-Abdominal Pressure: the pressure within the abdominal cavity that provides core stability and supports the spine during movement and lifting. Unilateral/Bilateral Movement: exercises performed with one limb (unilateral) versus both limbs simultaneously (bilateral), affecting balance, coordination, and strength development. Axial Loading: forces applied along the long axis of the spine, typically during weight-bearing activities, that compress the vertebrae and intervertebral discs. Butt Wink: the posterior tilting of the pelvis and rounding of the lower back that occurs at the bottom of a squat due to limited hip mobility. Hyperlordosis: an excessive inward curvature of the lumbar spine that can cause lower back pain and postural dysfunction. Dorsiflexion: the upward movement of the foot at the ankle joint, bringing the toes closer to the shin, important for walking and squatting mechanics. Sarcopenia: the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength that typically begins in the third decade of life and accelerates with aging. Bone Density: the amount of mineral content in bone tissue, which affects bone strength and fracture risk, influenced by weight-bearing exercise and nutrition.

MORE NSIMA INYANG QUOTES FROM THE INTERVIEW “I look at rope flow as its own, internal martial art.”— Nsima Inyang “I’ve had people that are in the Stronger Human community that, literally, after day one, they’re finding that they have better balance walking up the steps. And these were people in their fifties and sixties.”— Nsima Inyang “The thing that I would want to get you doing is, first, to make sure that you learn how to breathe while doing everything.”— Nsima Inyang “If you want to just get yourself a rope from Home Depot and cut it and make a rope, that’s fine. You can work that. You can even work with an exercise band you might have at home.”— Nsima Inyang “Many aspects of evidence-based fitness is that there’s a waiting game to wait for a paper to tell you something works that’s probably been done for centuries in many different cultures for a long time.”— Nsima Inyang The Tim Ferriss Show is one of the most popular podcasts in the world with more than one billion downloads.
