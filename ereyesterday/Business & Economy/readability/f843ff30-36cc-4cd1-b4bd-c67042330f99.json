The benchmark index traded volatile and closed with a bullish candlestick formation on the weekly chart. Nifty has a minor hurdle at 23,800, and a breakout above this level will trigger a short covering rally in the market towards the 24,250 level. The banking index has outperformed the benchmark index in the last two weeks and will continue this outperformance in the coming week. A breakout above 50,500 will trigger a rally towards 51,800. What should investors do? Private banks, like IndusInd and ICICI, are likely to outperform. The Nifty Metal index is likely to provide a strong upside in the coming days. Vedanta, Hindalco, and JSW Steel are the top picks. The auto sector could be a big beneficiary of government’s consumption push and recent RBI rate cut. M\u0026M and Eicher Motors are strongest in the pack, and both can be added on dips. Auto ancillary FIEM Industries and SJS should be added at the current levels.
