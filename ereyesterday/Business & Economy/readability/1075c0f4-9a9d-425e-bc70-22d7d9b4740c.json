Both \"0 Series\" vehicles are prototypes, which means they're intended for customer production but could still see some changes ahead.Honda said production models based on both prototypes are expected to launch in North America in 2026, starting with the SUV and then the Saloon. The automaker declined to release specific details about the new EVs such as expected pricing, range and performance.Honda 0 Saloon prototypeHondaThe exteriors of the vehicles are noticeably different than Honda's current models, featuring sleek, future-esque designs.
