Experts suggest that this underperformance is temporary, and a systematic investment approach over the next 3-6 months could be beneficial as the market regains its rhythm.AgenciesMomentum investing is an aggressive investment style and carries higher risk. Mutual funds manage ₹11,125 crore worth of assets in the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index strategy as of April 30, 2025.Mumbai: For aggressive investors, the recent underperformance of an index fund category that tracks the 30 fastest-rising stocks from the Nifty 200 universe may open up a window to invest gradually at lower levels.In the past year, the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index lost 9.75% against the 10.5% gains in the Nifty. In the last six months, the index lost 10.51%, while the Nifty 50 advanced 3.29%.\"Momentum factor has struggled in the last two quarters as markets came off after hitting a peak in September 2024,\" says Prateek Sinha, director, Deep MFD. He said the momentum strategy underperformed in 2009 and 2023 and it lasted for around 10-11 months.\"Once the market finds its rhythm, momentum strategies will outperform again,\" said Sinha.\"It would make sense to start systematically investing in momentum strategy over a 3-6 month period.\" AgenciesMomentum investing is an aggressive investment style and carries higher risk. Mutual funds manage ₹11,125 crore worth of assets in the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index strategy as of April 30, 2025.

Stock weights are based on a combination of the stock's normalised momentum score and its free-float market capitalisation with individual stock exposure capped at 5%.\"The recent underperformance of the momentum strategy provides a good entry point to long term investors,\" says Sharwan Goyal, head - passive, arbitrage, Quant Strategies, UTI Mutual Fund.“Based on historical trends, periods of underperformance are typically followed by significant outperformance, contributing to its consistent top-tier ranking.” In a bull market, momentum could outperform the broader markets and give far higher returns. “Whenever the broad markets gain 20%, momentum typically returns much more at 1.5-2 times” says Pratik Oswal, head — passives, Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund. Momentum has been one of the best performing strategies in India from a longer-term perspective. Amongst the four factors such as value, quality, momentum and low volatility, momentum has been among the top three performers for 16 out of 20 years. Over a 3-year period, the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 index gained 20.23% every year against the Nifty’s 15.49%. Since April 2005 (since inception), on a 3-year rolling basis, the index has outperformed Nifty 200 Index 85% of times.
