The company sold 21.7 million shares at ₹402 apiece.AgenciesGovernment of Singapore, Invesco India Midcap Fund, Government Pension Fund Global, Motilal Oswal SmallCap Fund, VQ Fastercap Fund, Canara Robeco Mutual Fund and the Prudential Assurance Company were among some of the anchor investors.ET Intelligence Group: Temasek- \u0026 TPG-backed Dr Agarwal's Health Care (DAHC) is the holding company of the listed Dr Agarwal's Eye Hospital (DAEH) with operations in India and Africa. It is rolling out an initial public offering of ₹3,027 crore comprising an offer for sale of ₹2,727 crore with the rest being a fresh issue that dilutes the promoter shareholding from 37.7% to 32.5%. Of the issue proceeds, ₹195 crore will be used to repay borrowings.Business: Incorporated in 2010, Chennai-based DAHC is India's largest eye care service chain run by fourth-generation ophthalmologists. It has the highest number of eye care facilities in the country at 193, and 16 in Africa which contributes around 10% of the total revenues. At the end of September 2024, the company had 737 doctors and earned 66% of its revenues from surgeries, 13% from diagnosis and non-surgical treatments and 21% through the sale of eye care-related products, opticals, contact lenses and accessories.DAHC has a 25% share of the Indian eye care service chain market. Its asset-light hub-and-spoke model has enabled it to grow through organic and inorganic expansion.Financials \u0026 Growth Prospects: The company's net sales have grown at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38% over the past three fiscals to ₹1,332 crore in FY24, while net profit has grown at 48.5% over the same period to ₹95 crore. The Ebitda margin steadily improved to 29.5% in FY24 but dropped to 27.3% for the six months ended September 2024. The company has been aggressive in inorganic growth - acquiring 21 smaller facilities in FY23 and 16 facilities in FY24. Consequently, the company's cash flow turned negative for FY24. Repayment of borrowings from the IPO proceeds is likely to reduce the company's interest payout and improve the bottom line.AgenciesValuations \u0026 Risk Factors: At an implied market cap of around ₹12,698 crore, the IPO values the company nearly 7 times its annualised revenues for FY25 and 164 times its annualised earnings for FY25. These expensive valuations factor in all the positives for the eye-care chain that faces competition from other similar chains, large multi-disciplinary hospitals, and standalone eye-care clinics. Besides, the company has been very acquisitive in the last three years - and may not grow at a similar pace going ahead. Incidentally, DAHC's listed subsidiary DAEH has lost 22% within five days ahead of the IPO. Given the rich valuations and the competitive landscape, the risk-reward assessment probably tilts the scales in favour of skipping this offer.Raises ₹875 cr from AnchorsDr Agarwal's Health Care raised ₹875.5 crore on Tuesday from 43 anchor investors, ahead of its IPO.
