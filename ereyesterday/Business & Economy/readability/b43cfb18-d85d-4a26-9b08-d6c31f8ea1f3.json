  "text": "Over decades of building Berkshire Hathaway into the massive conglomerate it is today, Warren Buffett has become the most renowned investor in the world. The Oracle of Omaha has done it all from building massive businesses in energy, railroads, insurance, and mortgages to crafting a roughly $300 billion equities portfolio. The proof is also in the pudding. Between 1965 and 2023, Berkshire's stock generated a whopping 4,384,748% return, equating to a 19.8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Meanwhile, the broader benchmark S\u0026P 500 generated a 31,223% gain including dividends, equating to a 10.2% CAGR. Given these impressive returns, investors should keep an eye on Berkshire's portfolio for new ideas although make sure to do your due diligence. Here are two Warren Buffett stocks to buy hand over fist in January. Buffett and Berkshire this year have sold tens of millions of shares in Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), the second-largest bank in the U.S. by assets. It's possible Berkshire continues to sell the stock. However, I think Berkshire sold too early, and shares are now a buy, especially after the stock pulled back in December. Banks were left for dead for two years due to an inverted yield curve, the failure of several large regional-size banks in 2023, and a very tough regulatory environment under President Joe Biden's administration. Bank of America also had balance sheet issues because the company invested too early in low-yielding, long-duration U.S. Treasury bonds, which fell deeply underwater after the Federal Reserve began to jack up rates in 2022. President-elect Donald Trump's victory on election night triggered a big rally for bank stocks, and I think the economic and regulatory environment has drastically improved. The yield curve has uninverted, with the yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury bond lower than that on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond. Even if the 10-year yield continues to climb, banks can perform well as long as the yield curve doesn't invert. (Banks generally make money by borrowing short and lending money into longer-maturity loans.) Banks also expect to see more favorable loan growth in 2025 and better investment-banking revenues. However, the biggest catalyst for banks, in my view, is the improving regulatory environment. Recently, large banks like Bank of America sued the Federal Reserve for not being transparent enough in their annual stress-testing exercise, a process used to determine a bank's regulatory capital requirements.",
