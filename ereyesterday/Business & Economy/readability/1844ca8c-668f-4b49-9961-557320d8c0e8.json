  "text": "By Chibuike Oguh and Alun John NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -A selloff in global bonds continued on Wednesday, pressuring Wall Street stocks and boosting the dollar as signs of continuing strength in the U.S. economy dimmed expectations for aggressive near-term interest rate cuts. The benchmark rose as high as 4.73%, a peak since April 2024, building on Tuesday's 7 basis point rise. It was last up 0.2 basis points to 4.687%. On Wall Street, benchmark traded lower for much of the session but finished higher. The Dow also closed higher, while the Nasdaq ended lower. Stocks in healthcare, materials, consumer staples, real estate, and industrials drove gains. Communication services and energy were the biggest losers.

The British 10-year gilt yield rose over 11 basis points to 4.82%, the highest since 2008. Strong U.S. economic data have weighed on U.S. Treasuries in recent weeks, with investors scaling back expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Markets are only fully pricing in one 25-basis-point rate cut in 2025, and see around a 60% chance of a second. Investors will watch Friday's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls data after data on Wednesday showed a lower than expected increase in private payrolls and jobless claims. \"One thing I'm worried about is, this bonfire of yields going higher tends to reinforce each other, particularly at times like this,\" said Michael Purves, CEO and founder of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. \"I'm concerned about is if you can buy a 10-year Treasury at 5% with zero risk and that's a higher yield than on the S\u0026P 500 that's going to beg a lot of asset allocation questions.\" The , which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro,rose 0.29% to 109.02, with the euro down 0.23% at $1.0315.

U.S. settled 0.3% higher at $2,672.40. \"Going into this first quarter that we're in right now, aside from earnings, I think a big risk for equities is if bond yields do get to 5%,\" said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at SiebertNXT in New York. \"Buyers are going to be a little bit more reticent. So the people that were powering the market higher, the bid is going to weaken.\"",
