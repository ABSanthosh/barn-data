Two people were airlifted in critical condition, according to Peel Regional Paramedic Services.Emergency crews responded at the scene. Flights to the airport were temporarily halted but resumed as of 5 p.m. ET.Delta said in a statement it was cancelling the remainder of its flights to and from Toronto Monday and issuing travel waivers to affected passengers.\"The hearts of the entire global Delta family are with those affected by today's incident at Toronto-Pearson International Airport,\" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in the statement. \"I want to express my thanks to the many Delta and Endeavor team members and the first responders on site.\"Delta Flight 4819, operated by the carrier's regional subsidiary Endeavor, originated in Delta's hub of Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport.The Toronto airport said it had been expecting a busy day and a storm that dumped more than 8 inches of snow on the region, with an expected 130,000 travelers on board around 1,000 flights.Weather reports showed wind of between 20 mph and 30 mph Monday, with gusts of up to 40 mph.The Transportation Safety Board of Canada will lead the crash investigation, the FAA said.
