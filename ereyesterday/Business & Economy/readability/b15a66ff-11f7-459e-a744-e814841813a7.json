  "text": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) abruptly dropped five of its own lawsuits against companies it had accused of victimizing customers on Thursday as the political and legal battle over the Trump administration’s efforts to radically downsize the agency raged on. The abandoned cases included actions against major corporate names such as Capital One Financial, the country’s ninth-largest bank, and the real estate referral site Rocket Homes. Others targeted a major student loan servicer and a pair of consumer lenders. Activity at the CFPB has been largely frozen thanks to a stop-work order by Trump officials, who appear to be targeting the watchdog for potentially crippling cuts. Last week, it dismissed a case against the online lender SoLo Funds, raising concerns among Democrats and consumer advocates that the administration might begin unwinding much of the agency’s legal docket. “There are certainly indications that they intend to dismiss a large number of cases, if not all cases,” said Eric Halperin, who resigned as the CFPB’s head of enforcement earlier this month after serving in the Biden administration. He noted that the agency had canceled its contracts with expert witnesses, who are essential to proving cases in court, while its work stoppage has made it impossible to move suits forward. CFPB lawyers did not explain their decision to drop the cases in their court filings, and the agency did not respond to a request for comment. All five cases were dismissed with prejudice, meaning they could not be revived in the future. The moves are in some ways unprecedented for the agency. Until this month, the CFPB had only ever dismissed one of its own lawsuits without first obtaining some sort of relief for consumers, former officials told Yahoo Finance. That occurred under the first Trump administration in 2018, when then-acting Director Mick Mulvaney ended a suit against the payday lender Golden Valley Lending. The case, however, was dismissed without prejudice, meaning it could have, in theory, been brought again. Several of the suits that the CFPB moved to end on Thursday were filed under former Director Rohit Chopra after Trump’s November election victory. The regulator sued Rocket Homes in December, alleging it had illegally provided real estate agents with kickbacks in order to steer customers toward its sister lender, Rocket Mortgage. In early January, it sued Berkshire Hathaway-owned Vanderbilt Mortgage \u0026 Finance, a mobile home lender it accused of illegally trapping customers in loans they couldn’t afford to pay.",
