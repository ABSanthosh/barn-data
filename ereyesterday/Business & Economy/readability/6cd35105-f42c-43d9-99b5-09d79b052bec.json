In this article, we are going to take a look at where Five9, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVN) stands against billionaire David E. Shaw’s other small-cap stock picks with huge upside potential. David E. Shaw is one billionaire investor whose record speaks for itself on Wall Street. Having founded D.E. Shaw \u0026 Co., L.P. in 1988 with $28 million in capital, the fund has grown to become one of the most successful and biggest, with a 13F portfolio worth $136.27 billion. Amid the growth, Shaw’s hedge fund D E Shaw has also returned significant returns to shareholders. The fund’s flagship Composite fund has achieved an annualized net return of 12.7% since inception in 2001, as the Oculus Fund has averaged 13.7% annually since 2004 and has never had a negative year. Shaw’s hedge fund was one of the earliest to leverage complex trading algorithms, followed by some form of human-run investing. Consequently, the multi-strategy fund remains the rage on Wall Street, given its solid returns over the years and the growing trend of returning gains to investors.

Composite hedge fund gained 18% in 2024, with Oculus outperforming the overall market, soaring 36% and recording its best gain since inception. The better-than-expected returns come on Shaw and the other fund managers deploying systematic and computer-driven trading strategies to identify stocks trading at discounted valuations before they explode. Following the impressive performance in 2024, reports emerged that the hedge fund was planning to return billions of dollars to external clients, as has been the trend. Amid the impressive performance last year, D.E. Shaw \u0026 Co. finds itself at a crossroads as the overall stock market has turned bearish. Major US indices have pulled back by about 6% from record highs amid recession concerns and deteriorating macroeconomics attributed to the US trade war. The US Federal Reserve holding interest rates unchanged, waiting to see the impact of President Donald Trump’s trade policy, continues to rattle sentiments in the equity market. The Federal Reserve held its benchmark rate unchanged at between 4.25% and 4.5%, much to the anguish of Trump. In its statement, the Fed noted the uncertainty around the economic outlook. “Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further,” the statement said. “The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have raised.”",
