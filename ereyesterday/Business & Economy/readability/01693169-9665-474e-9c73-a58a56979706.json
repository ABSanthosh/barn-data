  "text": "Featured at PACK EXPO International in Chicago, Illinois from November 3-6, 2024 LAKE FOREST, Ill., Oct. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Pactiv Evergreen Inc. introduces an innovative packaging solution with the launch of its patented SmartPour™ package. Made in the USA, SmartPour packaging features an easy-to-pour and resealable closure, making it the ideal container for pourable, dry ingredients like premium cereals, crackers, snacks, baking ingredients, pet food, powders or formulas, and powdered laundry or dish detergents. SmartPour containers eliminate the need for a plastic bag insert, preventing messy, bag-in-box spillage, while the resealable closure and barrier technology keeps contents fresh. With a sturdy design that maintains its shape, SmartPour is perfect for consumer-packaged goods companies looking to enhance product visibility on shelves and preserve the packaging integrity of products ordered via home delivery services. SmartPour packaging is food safe and FDA compliant and comes in six sizes, a vertical and horizontal layout, and three heights, offering a customizable solution for a variety of packaging needs. Pactiv Evergreen will showcase SmartPour containers at PACK EXPO International in Chicago, Illinois from November 3-6, 2024. In addition to SmartPour, Pactiv Evergreen will also have its two new beverage carton filling machines on display at the expo. This state-of-the-art equipment includes the N-200 designed for filling school milk cartons and the H-40M, a new half-gallon filling machine. Both innovative machines utilize Pactiv Evergreen's 60+ years of industry-leading experience in gable top carton filling equipment, exemplifying a longstanding dedication to excellence and providing advanced consumer solutions. Visit Pactiv Evergreen at booth N-5629 in the North Building to learn how its new filling equipment and SmartPour packaging can be a solution for your business. Pactiv Evergreen's SmartPour containers meet consumer demand for a pourable and resealable packaging solution for dry ingredients, benefiting food manufacturers, CPG companies, and retailers alike, said Eric Wulf, President of Pactiv Evergreen's Food and Beverage Merchandising business unit. We are proud to leverage our expertise in liquid beverage packaging “ specifically cartons, closures, and machinery “ to now offer the same dependable packaging solution for dry and pourable ingredients. Pactiv Evergreen's SmartPour packaging has been pre-qualified as ˜Widely Recyclable' by How2Recycle ®, said Lynn Dyer, Chief Sustainability Officer for Pactiv Evergreen. Moreover, SmartPour containers can be conveniently recycled through one-step curbside recycling, allowing consumers to place the entire container in their recycling bin. We are dedicated to supporting our customers in achieving their sustainability goals and are proud that the paper used in our SmartPour package comes from trees grown in forests that follow responsible forestry practices.
