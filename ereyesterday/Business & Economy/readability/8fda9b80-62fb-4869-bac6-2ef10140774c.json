The ministry promptly directed the Karnataka State Labour Department to investigate and protect affected employees,\" NITES said. It went on to say that on Tuesday around 800 employees were scheduled for an assessment, with results set for Wednesday. \"However, following NITES's intervention, government action, and strong media support, Infosys has now postponed the assessment. While this brings a sigh of relief for many employees, the fight for fair employment practices and job security is far from over,\" NITES had said.(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",
