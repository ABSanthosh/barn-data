(NYSE:CAH) is one of the biggest healthcare products and services providers in America. The shares are up by 36% year-to-date as they have benefited from strong earnings and other tailwinds. Cramer has discussed Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) several times in 2025. He believes that the firm’s specialty pharma business is a key differentiating factor and added that it could benefit if the Trump Administration decides to shake things up in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Here are his latest thoughts about Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH): “Okay, you know I got a company, I mentioned it yesterday, Cardinal Health. These, it’s not a middleman. Everyone thinks it’s just a middleman. Jason Hollar’s carving out a real place to make healthcare, let’s say better, streamlined, and cheaper. I just think this guy’s terrific, and I’m happy to have him on the show. He’s not a villain.” Cramer discussed Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) in detail in May. Here is what he said: “These stocks. . .are seemingly perpetual residents on the new high list. Over the long haul, they’re some of the best performers out there, and they’ve done great this year, as is pretty much always the case. And yet, doesn’t it always feel like the drug distributors are just one bad day away from falling apart… Let’s not forget that the drug distributors are making fortunes right now. Cardinal Health turned in an excellent set of numbers two weeks ago with double-digit earnings growth. Management put through a big boost in their full-year earnings forecast. Cardinal stock jumped 3% in response, climbing from $141 to $145, and it kept running for really a week after that, eventually setting at an all-time high of $154 just last Thursday. What a fabulous move… Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH) CEO Is \"Terrific,\" Says Jim Cramer A senior physician in a modern healthcare institution administering medication to a patient. Now, if you really want to own one, and I do like this one, Cardinal Health is the one to do it with because it provides a lot more value-added services than the others. Now, we’ve had Cardinal on several times, and I think they’re doing some very innovative things. They are impressive, they’re beyond middlemen.”",
