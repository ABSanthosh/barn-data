In This Article: Cybersecurity stocks have not been immune from the recent market sell-off, opening up some attractive entry points for some of the top companies in the space. Meanwhile, cyberattacks are not going away and are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. As such, these are the types of stocks you can buy and hold for a long time. Let's look at three cybersecurity stocks you might want to buy now and hold for the long term. While known for its next-generation firewalls, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) has transformed itself into more of a complete cybersecurity company. Seeing customers become frustrated using disparate point cybersecurity solutions, the company made a bold move last year when it introduced a new \"platformization\" strategy. Under this strategy, it stopped selling new point solutions and began consolidating customers onto one of its three main cybersecurity platforms. To incentivize customers to do this, it decided to let customers use some of its services for free while they had contracts in place with other cybersecurity companies for similar services. At the time, it said this was the equivalent of giving customers about six months of free product capabilities. The strategy thus far appears to be working. It ended last quarter with 1,150 platformizations within its top 5,000 customers, most of which are on its network security platform. It also noted that customers using two of its platforms increased by 50%, while it tripled the number of customers using all three of its platforms. Its two newer platforms are its comprehensive threat detection and response solution Cortex and cloud security solution Prisma Cloud. Its goal is to have between 2,500 and 3,500 platformization customers by fiscal year 2030. Overall, Palo Alto's platformization strategy is the right one and should help power the stock over the long run. Image source: Getty Images. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) is the leader in endpoint security with its Falcon platform. Endpoint security protects devices connected to a network -- such as smartphones, laptops, and servers -- from malicious attacks. The company benefits from the trend in the space of organizations looking to consolidate their cybersecurity onto a single platform with one vendor. This leads customers to continue to adopt more of its modules. In fact, 67% of CrowdStrike's customers deploy five or more of its modules, while 21% use eight or more. Customers are also drawn to the company's Falcon Flex solution, which is a flexible licensing and procurement model that makes it easier to have access to CrowdStrike's full cybersecurity portfolio. With Falcon Flex, customers can quickly deploy the CrowdStrike solution they need when needed. This gives customers greater flexibility when dealing with cybersecurity threats while allowing them to better manage their cybersecurity spending.",
