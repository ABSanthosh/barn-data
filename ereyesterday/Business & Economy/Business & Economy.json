    "description": "Vlada Lotkina noticed something wrong at her daughter’s school. So she built the solution and sold it for 8-figures. It’s called ClassTag, and it’s a platform where teachers, parents and school administrators can communicate and send out announcements. No flyers, no ridiculously long emails… My favorite part is that she’s a Mixergy listener herself. She literally called a previous guest of mine and got him to invest before her business took off. Vlada Lotkina is the co-founder and CEO of ClassTag, an edtech platform that simplifies communication between teachers and parents. She grew up in Ukraine and watched as her father pursued entrepreneurship during the fall of the soviet union. As a mother in the U.S., her own frustrations with poor school-parent communication inspired her. She eventually exited ClassTag for 8-figures.

    "description": "In this episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I had the pleasure of interviewing Marketing Hall of Famer and frequent guest, Seth Godin. A renowned expert in marketing, entrepreneurship, and strategic philosophy, Seth shares his invaluable insights once again on our show. With over 30 years of experience and multiple bestselling books to his name, Seth and I dive into my favorite topic—STRATEGY. In this episode, we explore how both businesses and individuals can transform their strategic approach for greater success. In his latest book, This is Strategy: Make Better Plans, and a little anecdote about a chef, an electric car, and 30 years of veganism, he defines strategy as a philosophy of becoming and explains how understanding systems, the art of choosing customers, and competition can lead to long-term success. Seth Godin challenges conventional strategy ideas, emphasizing empathy and awareness of the systems influencing customers and competitors. His thoughts on building sustainable, intentional strategies are a must-have for agencies, entrepreneurs and business leaders looking to stop running around in circles and make a meaningful impact.

    "description": "In this episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I interview Steve Oriola, CEO of Unbounce. Steve Oriola is a tenured CEO with over two decades of experience scaling dynamic B2B SaaS platforms, including Act!, Constant Contact, Pipedrive, and Julius. He recently led Unbounce through the acquisition of Insightly CRM, in which the two companies effectively merged. We discuss the findings of a recent benchmark report on CONVERSION RATES. That’s right—we tried to get rid of email, but it looks like it has entered the chat again. Our conversation covers the importance of simplified copy, the enduring effectiveness of email marketing, the dynamics of mobile versus desktop conversions, and the rise of Instagram as a leading platform for conversions. We also cover the significance of writing at (if you can believe it) a lower grade level for better engagement, the nuances of industry-specific language, and the role of conversion-rate optimization in marketing strategies.",
