    "description": "As a college basketball player, Missy Park was lucky to grow up during the early era of Title IX, the 1972 law that created new opportunities for young women in sports. But in the years before Lululemon and Athleta, activewear for women was either ill-fitting or non-existent. So in 1989‚Äîwith little experience in apparel or retail‚ÄîMissy launched a female version of Nike. She sent out a mail-order catalog of running shorts, tights, and (at the last minute) sports bras, naming her company for the law that had opened doors for her to compete. Over the years, Title Nine kept \"hitting singles,\" eventually growing into a $100 million business without ever taking outside investment. Today, Missy remains the sole owner.This episode was produced by J.C. Howard with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.
