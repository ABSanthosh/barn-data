    "description": "Many industries depend on the government to finance infrastructure and research before a true private market can develop. In the case of space, there is still a strong need for public-private collaboration. But as costs drop to reach space, more private-sector companies can enter the market. Matthew Weinzierl is a senior associate dean and professor at Harvard Business School, and Brendan Rosseau is a strategy manager at Blue Origin. They explain the evolving role of the U.S. government to foster innovation and competition as the space economy increasingly privatizes. They also identify the emerging opportunities for businesses and individuals. Weinzierl and Rosseau are authors of the book Space to Grow: Unlocking the Final Economic Frontier.",

    "description": "Cookware is a $73 billion global industry - awash in all kinds of pots and pans. Like, if you’ve ever cooked scrambled eggs, you've probably used a non-stick frying pan. They’re inexpensive and everywhere. But they’ve been dogged by complaints: many can’t handle high heat, like broiling or searing, and they scratch easily. So, when Danny Winer came across a new non-stick technology at a trade show overseas, he jumped on it, co-founding Hexclad with a buddy. Danny was convinced it could be adapted to the U.S. market - and be a hit. He was right! In just under ten years, Hexclad grew into a $500 million company.This episode was produced by Kerry Thompson, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
