    "description": "We all know the stereotypes of leaders who use charisma, manipulation, domineering behavior, or their status in the hierarchy to exert control. But there is another type of leader whose power isn’t necessarily related to their position on the org chart. Chris Lipp has spent years studying people who’ve developed this “personal power” that is rooted in their internal values. Lipp is a professor at Tulane University’s Freeman School of Business, an executive coach, and the author of the new book The Science of Personal Power. He’s investigated where this second type of power comes from, how it can enhance our lives, and how to tap into it using some simple strategies and tools.",

In this episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I had the pleasure of interviewing Marketing Hall of Famer and frequent guest, Seth Godin. A renowned expert in marketing, entrepreneurship, and strategic philosophy, Seth shares his invaluable insights once again on our show. With over 30 years of experience and multiple bestselling books to his name, Seth and I dive into my favorite topic—STRATEGY. In this episode, we explore how both businesses and individuals can transform their strategic approach for greater success. In his latest book, This is Strategy: Make Better Plans, and a little anecdote about a chef, an electric car, and 30 years of veganism, he defines strategy as a philosophy of becoming and explains how understanding systems, the art of choosing customers, and competition can lead to long-term success. Seth Godin challenges conventional strategy ideas, emphasizing empathy and awareness of the systems influencing customers and competitors. His thoughts on building sustainable, intentional strategies are a must-have for agencies, entrepreneurs and business leaders looking to stop running around in circles and make a meaningful impact.

    "link": "",
    "description": "The company behind the blockbuster acne fighter, Mighty Patch, was launched in 2017 with a single product sold exclusively on Amazon. It was inspired by similar patches Ju Rhyu had seen while living in Korea. Ju struggled with breakouts herself, and when she tried a patch and saw how well they worked, she was inspired to tailor a patch for the U.S. market. So, while the product wasn’t new, Ju recognized a niche to be filled.Over the next five years, Ju and her co-founders—brothers Dwight and Andy Lee—grew Mighty Patch from a niche product to a cosmetics industry sensation. Seemingly overnight, teens and young adults across America and all over social media could be seen proudly wearing patches on their faces. The Mighty Patch became so successful that in 2022 Hero Cosmetics sold for $630 million. And today, Hero is the number one selling acne treatment brand in the United States.This episode was produced by Chris Maccini with music by Ramtin Arablouei and Sam Paulson.Edited by Andrea Bruce, with research from Olivia Rockeman. Our engineers were Gilly Moon and Robert Rodriguez. You can follow HIBT on X \u0026 Instagram, and email us at hibt@id.wondery.com.
