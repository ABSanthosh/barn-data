This was before the rise of online social networks and the ubiquity of social media. But today, Roizen says that those developments have not fundamentally changed how she builds and maintains strong personal and professional relationships. Now a partner at Threshold Ventures and a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, she shares the biggest missteps that she sees people take. She also explains the impact of AI and remote work on networking, her most effective strategies for building relationships, and her frank advice for those just starting their careers.

With no knowledge of dairy, Koel forged an 8,000 mile partnership between the Australian yogurt-makers and a Colorado dairyman. Noosa Yoghurt faced a near-death experience as the founders scrambled to meet the pace of demand; but by 2018, the brand was available in 25,000 stores, with over $200M in sales. Today, the company is owned by the food conglomerate Campbell’s.This episode was produced by Devan Schwartz with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.It was edited by Neva Grant with research from Olivia Rockeman.Our audio engineers were Robert Rodriguez and Gilly Moon.See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
