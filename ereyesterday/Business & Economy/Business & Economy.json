    "description": "In this episode of the Duck Tape Marketing Podcast, I had the pleasure of interviewing David Edelman, a seasoned digital transformation and marketing expert. As CMO, Edelman guided Aetna (now part of CVS Health) through becoming a digitally oriented, customer-centric brand. He built McKinsey’s Digital Marketing Strategy Practice and had leadership roles at BCG and Digitas. Repeatedly recognized by Forbes as one of the “Most Influential CMOs in the World” and by AdWeek as one of the “Top 20 Marketing and Technology Executives,” his work has attracted over 1.1 million followers to his LinkedIn blog. Currently, David advises top executives on AI and personalization. In this episode, we dive into the ever-evolving world of personalization in business, uncovering the game-changing role of AI in redefining how companies connect with their audiences. Edelman emphasizes the importance of creating customer experiences at scale and the competitive advantage that effective personalization has. Edelman explores the advantages of personalization, while highlighting the ongoing challenges of overstepping boundaries—a pitfall many of us have encountered firsthand. He shares practical examples of how AI enhances customer interactions and tackles concerns about data privacy and the potential discomfort of overly personalized marketing. The conversation also touches on the challenges marketers face in content creation and the need for more thoughtful, effective communication strategies. Key Takeaways: Personalization is about creating customer experiences at scale. AI enhances personalization by analyzing customer data. The privacy factor in personalization must be managed carefully. 70% of consumers are comfortable with data use for value. Speed of learning is crucial for competitive advantage. Companies often have more data than they realize, but it's fragmented. AI can help integrate data from various sources effectively. Successful personalization can lead to increased customer satisfaction. Content should be bite-sized and easily digestible for consumers. Empowering customers with their data can enhance their experience.

It's hard to know how to lead gracefully in such turbulent times, but Karthik Ramanna, professor at the University of Oxford's Blavatnik School of Government, has some answers. Drawing on his work with government officials and corporate executives, he walks us through the root causes of our current crisis, explains how to effectively navigate through disagreement, and offers practical takeaways for managers at every level. Ramanna is the author of the book The Age of Outrage: How to Lead in a Polarized World.",

It’s called ClassTag, and it’s a platform where teachers, parents and school administrators can communicate and send out announcements. No flyers, no ridiculously long emails… My favorite part is that she’s a Mixergy listener herself. She literally called a previous guest of mine and got him to invest before her business took off. Vlada Lotkina is the co-founder and CEO of ClassTag, an edtech platform that simplifies communication between teachers and parents. She grew up in Ukraine and watched as her father pursued entrepreneurship during the fall of the soviet union. As a mother in the U.S., her own frustrations with poor school-parent communication inspired her. She eventually exited ClassTag for 8-figures.

    "description": "When Matt Meeker started sharing a Brooklyn apartment with a Great Dane, he didn’t know it would inspire him to launch a multi-million dollar company. But, disappointed by what pet stores offered for big dogs like his, Matt co-founded BARK, a subscription service for dogs of all sizes. After launching in 2012, the brand expanded to include food, furnishings, and luxury charter flights, where dogs roam free about the cabin. Along the way, Matt applied critical lessons from his past startups, including a failed text-messaging company, and the social platform Meetup.This episode was produced by Devan Schwartz with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei. This episode was edited by Neva Grant, with research by Olivia Rockeman. Our audio engineers were Patrick Murray and Maggie Luthar.
