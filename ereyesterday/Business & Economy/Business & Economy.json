    "description": "Often called the Oscars of the food industry, the James Beard Foundation Awards are among the most coveted for chefs in America. But what's sold and packaged as prestige can sometimes become a distraction from managing the business that got you there. Host Matt Brown is joined by The New York Times food critic Brett Anderson \u0026 chef Chintan Pandya (Dhamaka, Semma, Adda, Unapologetic Foods) to learn that an award can not only change a winner's life but an entire industry as a whole.",

    "link": "",
    "description": "While apple picking on a farm near Philadelphia, Abhi Ramesh learned that a massive amount of ‚Äúmisfit‚Äù produce goes to waste. He started running ads on Facebook to see if people would pay a discount for subscription boxes filled with twisted carrots and oddly-shaped squash. ¬† Demand was so strong that Abhi soon hired drivers on Craigslist to deliver produce around Philly from a rented warehouse. Four months in, Misfits Market had thousands of customers and landed $2 million in venture capital to expand. The pandemic turbocharged its growth and the business evolved into an online grocery store offering 1100+ items. Today Misfits Market operates in 48 states, and was most recently valued at $2 billion.This episode was produced by Casey Herman with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei, and edited by Neva Grant with research by Katherine Sypher.
