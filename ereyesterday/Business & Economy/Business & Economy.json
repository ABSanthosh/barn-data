It’s called ClassTag, and it’s a platform where teachers, parents and school administrators can communicate and send out announcements. No flyers, no ridiculously long emails… My favorite part is that she’s a Mixergy listener herself. She literally called a previous guest of mine and got him to invest before her business took off. Vlada Lotkina is the co-founder and CEO of ClassTag, an edtech platform that simplifies communication between teachers and parents. She grew up in Ukraine and watched as her father pursued entrepreneurship during the fall of the soviet union. As a mother in the U.S., her own frustrations with poor school-parent communication inspired her. She eventually exited ClassTag for 8-figures.

    "description": "There was a time when business leaders and managers didn't worry so much about psychology or other social science research. Malcolm Gladwell's writing played a big role in changing that. His popular exploration of tipping points — the phenomenon where small, incremental actions can suddenly fuse into a full-blown social behavior — brought research insights to life and made them mainstream. Now he's revisiting tipping points, this time looking at how they can be used for damaging results. In this episode, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius speaks to Gladwell about how the author’s ideas have changed, the importance of social science and journalism in today's world of virality, and the unexpected ways leaders should consider human behavior. Gladwell is the author of the new book Revenge of the Tipping Point: Overstories, Superspreaders, and the Rise of Social Engineering.",

But, as with any technology that sees widespread adoption, AI itself won't be enough to build a long-term advantage over competitors, says Jay Barney, professor at the University of Utah's Eccles School of Business. Yes, leaders need to deploy these new tools, especially those that use GenAI, to stay relevant. But they also need to think about how AI can be applied to their business' differentiating competencies and offerings to truly add value. Barney is the coauthor, along with Martin Reeves of Boston Consulting Group, of the HBR article \"AI Won't Give You a New Sustainable Advantage.\"",

    "description": "Coming in at number four of your favorite episodes lately: In this episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I interviewed Alyson Caffrey, the founder of Operations Agency and the co-creator of the operations simplified framework, which is aimed at streamlining the backend operations for digital and creative agencies. She also authorizes The Sabbatical Method: How to Leverage Rest and Grow Your Business. With a wealth of experience in helping agency owners find a balance between their work and rest, Alyson sheds light on how the Sabbatical Method can revolutionize how marketing systems are handled. Key Takeaway: Working less to achieve more is a paradigm shift in the traditional hustle culture, especially among agency owners in the marketing realm. Alyson Caffrey joins me in elucidating how the Sabbatical Method is transforming the marketing systems landscape. We delve into the concept of \"systematic rest,\" an innovative approach to interspersing work with adequate rest to prevent burnout and enhance productivity and creativity significantly. By embracing the Sabbatical Method, agency owners are discovering a potent strategy to scale their business while reducing the hours they traditionally grind away, making the notion of working less to achieve more a reality.

In the dynamic marketing world, strategies are ever-evolving, and staying ahead of the curve is crucial for success. Discover how adapting to the changing tides can lead to more tremendous success for businesses and marketing professionals; however, why might it not be for everyone? Key Takeaway: In marketing, focusing on a niche can be advantageous and limiting. While specialization can bring efficiencies and higher value to clients, it also leads to increased competition and the risk of being overshadowed by template-driven solutions.

    "description": "Every year, the US throws out roughly 125 million tennis balls. That's enough to fill 21 Boeing 737s to the brim. And until recently, tennis balls were impossible to recycle. That's right, every ball ever produced would eventually end up in a landfill where it could take 400 years to decompose. ﻿But no more. The Hustle’s Matthew Brown visits West Virginia to track down what happens to tennis balls when they die.

    "description": "Watch any major awards ceremony. Not right now. You’re busy. But what those keen couple of eyes of yours will quickly notice is the way the camera moves. You can also see it on every reality tv, news, and competition show. In fact, once you see it, you'll never stop noticing it. And while the big, sweeping camera technique of these jibs might be etched into our collective brain matters at this point, this way we experience a production wasn’t even possible until the 1990s. ﻿The Growth Show is a special series brought to you by The Hustle Daily Show about how to grow a business, an idea, or a movement.

    "description": "In 2007, when James Hirschfeld got the idea to start an online invitation company, the first person he turned to for help was his older sister, Alexa. Together, they were inspired to create a brand that combined the ease of digital correspondence with the beauty of paper.Along the way, the founders faced myriad challenges: convincing investors that people would pay for virtual paper, settling on the right business model, and—worst of all-- the existential threat of Covid. 15 years after launch - Paperless Post has sent over 650 million invitations, and has even been parodied on Saturday Night Live.This episode was produced by Kerry Thompson with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.
