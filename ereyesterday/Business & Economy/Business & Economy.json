But Prithriwaj “Raj” Choudhury, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, says it’s not a simple managerial choice between two options. He explains three main variations of hybrid work: quarterly, monthly, and weekly. And he shares three key challenges to remote work: isolation, communication, and socialization. And he breaks down the specific management practices necessary to make those hybrid arrangements succeed most effectively, adding that AI is making some of those practices easier and cheaper than ever. Choudhury’s new book is The World Is Your Office: How Work from Anywhere Boosts Talent, Productivity, and Innovation.",

    "description": "Christmas trees are big business in NYC. Running a tree lot takes grit and experience, and even then, it's a tough network to break into. All of the lots in the city are divided into separate territories, owned by only a handful of entrepreneurs. We spent the day working for NYC's busiest Christmas tree seller on Greg Walsh's busiest day of the year to better understand the wild logistics behind NYC’s Christmas tree economy and the tumultuous history of running a lot in this city.

    "description": "Often called the Oscars of the food industry, the James Beard Foundation Awards are among the most coveted for chefs in America.

    "link": "",
    "description": "While apple picking on a farm near Philadelphia, Abhi Ramesh learned that a massive amount of “misfit” produce goes to waste. He started running ads on Facebook to see if people would pay a discount for subscription boxes filled with twisted carrots and oddly-shaped squash.   Demand was so strong that Abhi soon hired drivers on Craigslist to deliver produce around Philly from a rented warehouse. Four months in, Misfits Market had thousands of customers and landed $2 million in venture capital to expand. The pandemic turbocharged its growth and the business evolved into an online grocery store offering 1100+ items. Today Misfits Market operates in 48 states, and was most recently valued at $2 billion.This episode was produced by Casey Herman with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei, and edited by Neva Grant with research by Katherine Sypher.
