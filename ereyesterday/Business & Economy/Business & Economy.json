    "link": "",
    "description": "When Wiliam Wang started selling flat-screen TV’s, he used a winning playbook: partner with an efficient manufacturer, cut out the middlemen, and price your product as low as you can. William used a similar strategy at his first company–making computer monitors–and he built it into a multimillion dollar business. But he wound up mismanaging it into the ground, and spent years working to pay off millions of dollars in debt. After surviving a catastrophic plane crash, William embarked on a new venture, Vizio, and returned to his “cut-out-the-middlemen” playbook to sell one of the world’s first internet-connected televisions. Today, Vizio is one of the top-selling TV’s in the US, and in 2024, sold to Walmart for $2.3 billion.This episode was produced by J.C.
