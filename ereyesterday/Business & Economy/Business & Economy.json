Alexandra Samuel is a tech speaker and journalist, and she says many leaders are still just scratching the surface of AI by using things like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot as supercharged search engines. Instead, she recommends managers at all levels start playing with AI at the next level, building assistants to help in all sorts of functions to not just find efficiencies, but help in decision-making and strategy as well. She explains the ways she uses AI tools for everything from training to project management to coaching and strategic advice - and how you can build your own assistants to do the same. Samuel is the author of the HBR article \"How to Build Your Own AI Assistant.\"",

He‚Äôs the founder of My Body Tutor and DoneDaily, two remote coaching services powered by daily accountability. I invited him to share how he turned simple check-ins into a multi-million dollar company. Adam Gilbert was a personal trainer who was frustrated by seeing clients not follow through on the diet and exercise programs they committed to. So he offered to be their accountability buddy by text. The service he created, My Body Tutor, was profitable from its first month and continues to generate millions 18 years later. His latest company, DoneDaily, offers a similar accountability and coaching program for entrepreneurs.

Instead of chasing enterprise clients or trying to build a CRM that does everything from web hosting to calendaring, Steli Efti focused on sales teams at small and mid-sized businesses. And he built a product with a tight set of features focused on more client conversations and less data entry. Steli Efti is the co-founder and CEO of Close, a CRM platform designed to eliminate manual data entry and make sales more human and efficient. Before launching Close, he co-founded Elastic Sales (a sales-as-a-service agency) and SwipeGood (a charitable micro-donation startup) Fun fact‚Äîhe once said he spent six years following up twice a year to finally buy the domain close.com.

    "description": "Rick Steves spent the summer after high school backpacking through Europe on two dollars a day‚Äîsleeping on the floor, sneaking into museums, and subsisting on a diet of bread and jam. When he came home, he found people were hungry for tips on how to visit Europe on the cheap, so he began teaching classes, and was soon hawking a self-published guidebook out of his car. Eventually, he started leading minibus tours and hosting a travel show on Public TV, steadily growing his business even though he was giving away most of his content. His no-frills approach to travel has persisted as a powerful brand, with 70 guidebooks, an ever-popular travel show, and‚Äîin 2024‚Äîan annual revenue of $120 million.This episode was produced by Rachel Faulkner-White, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.Edited by Neva Grant.You can follow HIBT on¬†Twitter¬†\u0026¬†Instagram, and email us at¬†hibt@id.wondery.com.
