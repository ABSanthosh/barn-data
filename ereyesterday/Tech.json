Node.js uses CommonJS, not AMD. ECMAScript also adds formal module support, which es6-module-transpiler lets you use today. To the great surprise of nobody except John, iPhones come with earbuds, and those earbuds come with clickers. To the great surprise of nobody, including John, the Bluetooth-pairing interface in a car was terrible, and both Marco and Casey missed an obscure reference. iOS games that support physical game controllers must also work without them. If the \"iPhone 6\" comes in two sizes, which do you buy? Possibility of resolution scaling modes. Would the cameras be different? (Marco on The Talk Show, starting around 01:26:00). WWDC product-announcement predictions: New MacBook Airs or a 12\" Retina MacBook Air? (Intel's Broadwell delay) Macworld's slow SSD speeds in the new Airs may just be from different SSD manufacturers. New Apple TV hardware or software? The Apple TV 3's CPU was originally a dual-core A5 with one die disabled, but not anymore. The iPod Touch still has an A5 LOL. There may not be any new hardware announced at WWDC, just like previous WWDCs in 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011. New sensors to be taken advantage of, like Pedometer++ did with the M7 last year. Craig Hockenberry on Apple wearables Wearables, sensors, and watches in fashion and reality. Bringing the new Mac Pro's dark-glossy-aluminum finish to more Pro hardware? Retina Thunderbolt Display? The Magic Mouse. Yes, we really talked about this. Drawing conclusions from the \"To Be Announced\" sessions in the WWDC schedule. WWDC predictions for Mac OS X 10.10: Just a visual refresh, or notable improvements to the core OS as well? Apple shuffling engineers around to work on the new hotness while neglecting its established platforms and applications. Modernization or replacement of AppKit, possibly by bringing the relevant parts of UIKit to Mac? Is there any hope for a new filesystem, possibly by evolving Core Storage? WWDC predictions for iOS 8: Better inter-app communication: A system like Contracts or Intents? Involving remote view controllers? Side-by-side iPad multitasking? Springboard enhancements? Please kill Newsstand. Please. Just make them normal app icons. Could Remote View Controllers and Background Refresh be used for widgets, live tiles, or dynamic icons? Customizable default browser, mail app, etc.? WWDC predictions for new or improved web services: Sponsored by: lynda.com: Learn at your own pace from expert-taught video tutorials. Free 7-day trial.

    "description": "New submitter ae4ax writes: North American buyers of JuiceBox EVSEs (chargers) received an email today declaring the imminent closure of Enel X Way USA, LLC, the maintainers of the software infrastructure behind their EVSEs. Customer support has already shut down, and apps will be deactivated and removed by October 11, 2024. The company claims economic headwinds from lackluster EV sales and high interest rates as the motivation for the closure. Enel X Way properties outside North America are not affected, they say. \"An experienced third-party firm will be appointed to manage the company's affairs and ensure that the closure is handled with the utmost care and professionalism,\" the company said in a statement. \"The appointed firm will be responsible for managing the remaining obligations and communicating directly with customers and partners regarding the closure.\" Customers will still be able to charge vehicles but all their connectivity features -- the Enel X Way app and all other Enel e-mobility apps in North America -- will stop working. Commercial charging stations will also lose functionality. \"So If you own a JuiceBox, you just got nine days' warning that your home charger can no longer be configured,\" reports Electrek. Electrek's Michael Bower, who uses a JuiceBox to charge his Chevy Bolt, said: \"I'm disappointed that Enel X Way is removing their apps -- and thus the ability to change the amperage -- for their EVSEs. I live in a condo with a 100A panel, so the ability to lower the amperage from 40 to 32 or 16 was beneficial when charging my EV while drawing power for laundry or the central A/C in the summer. It just shows how 'smart' EVSEs are too reliant on their respective apps.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Attackers are actively exploiting a critical vulnerability in mail servers sold by Zimbra in an attempt to remotely execute malicious commands that install a backdoor, researchers warn. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-45519, resides in the Zimbra email and collaboration server used by medium and large organizations. When an admin manually changes default settings to enable the postjournal service, attackers can execute commands by sending maliciously formed emails to an address hosted on the server. Zimbra recently patched the vulnerability. All Zimbra users should install it or, at a minimum, ensure that postjournal is disabled. On Tuesday, Security researcher Ivan Kwiatkowski first reported the in-the-wild attacks, which he described as \"mass exploitation.\" He said the malicious emails were sent by the IP address 79.124.49[.]86 and, when successful, attempted to run a file hosted there using the tool known as curl. Researchers from security firm Proofpoint took to social media later that day to confirm the report. On Wednesday, security researchers provided additional details that suggested the damage from ongoing exploitation was likely to be contained. As already noted, they said, a default setting must be changed, likely lowering the number of servers that are vulnerable. [...] Proofpoint has explained that some of the malicious emails used multiple email addresses that, when pasted into the CC field, attempted to install a webshell-based backdoor on vulnerable Zimbra servers. The full cc list was wrapped as a single string and encoded using the base64 algorithm. When combined and converted back into plaintext, they created a webshell at the path: /jetty/webapps/zimbraAdmin/public/jsp/zimbraConfig.jsp. Proofpoint went on to say: \"Once installed, the webshell listens for inbound connection with a pre-determined JSESSIONID Cookie field; if present, the webshell will then parse the JACTION cookie for base64 commands. The webshell has support for command execution via exec or download and execute a file over a socket connection.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "After fifteen years of fighting to make the web safer and more accessible, the World Wide Web Foundation is shutting down. From a report: In a letter shared via the organization's website, co-founders Sir Tim Berners-Lee -- inventor of the World Wide Web -- and Rosemary Leith explain that the organization's mission has been somewhat accomplished and a new battle needs to be waged. When the foundation was founded in 2009, just over 20 percent of the world had access to the web and relatively few organizations were trying to change that, say Sir Tim and Leith. A decade and a half later, with nearly 70 percent of the world online, there are many similar non-governmental organizations trying to make the web more accessible and affordable. The two founders thank their supporters over the years who \"have enabled us to move the needle in a big way\" with regard to access and affordability. But the issues facing the web have changed, they insist, and the foundation believes other advocacy groups can take it from here. Chief among the more pressing problems, claim Sir Tim and Leith, is the social media business model that commoditized user data and concentrates power with platforms, contrary to Sir Tim's original vision for the web. To address that threat, Sir Tim intends to dismantle his foundation so he can focus on decentralized technology. \"We, along with the Web Foundation board, have been asking ourselves where we can have the most impact in the future,\" the authors say. \"The conclusion we have reached is that Tim's passion on restoring power over and control of data to individuals and actively building powerful collaborative systems needs to be the highest priority going forward. In order to best achieve this, Tim will focus his efforts to support his vision for the Solid Protocol and other decentralized systems.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Law enforcement from 12 countries arrested four individuals linked to the LockBit ransomware gang, including a developer and a bulletproof hosting administrator. The operation also resulted in the seizure of LockBit infrastructure and involved sanctions targeting affiliates of both LockBit and Evil Corp. BleepingComputer reports: According to Europol, a suspected LockBit ransomware developer was arrested in August 2024 at the request of French authorities while on holiday outside of Russia. The same month, the U.K.'s National Crime Agency (NCA) arrested two more individuals linked to LockBit activity: one believed to be associated with a LockBit affiliate, while the second was apprehended on suspicion of money laundering. In a separate action, at Madrid airport, Spain's Guardia Civil arrested the administrator of a bulletproof hosting service used to shield LockBit's infrastructure. Today, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States also revealed sanctions against an individual the UK NCA believes is a prolific LockBit ransomware affiliate linked to Evil Corp. The United Kingdom sanctioned 15 more Russian nationals involved in Evil Corp's criminal activities, while the United States sanctioned six individuals and Australia targeted two. \"These actions follow the massive disruption of LockBit infrastructure in February 2024, as well as the large series of sanctions and operational actions that took place against LockBit administrators in May and subsequent months,\" Europol said.

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from NPR: A New Jersey appeals court says a couple cannot sue Uber over a life-altering car accident because of the app's terms and conditions, even though they say it was their daughter who agreed to those terms while placing an Uber Eats order. John and Georgia McGinty -- a Mercer County couple both in their 50s -- filed a lawsuit against the ride-hailing company in February 2023, nearly a year after suffering \"serious physical, psychological, and financial damages\" when the Uber they were riding in crashed into another car, according to court filings. \"There are physical scars, mental scars, and I don't think that they will ever really be able to go back to their full capacity that they were at before,\" says their attorney, Mike Shapiro. Uber responded by filing a motion to dismiss the complaint and compel arbitration, which would require the parties to resolve their differences outside court instead -- ostensibly benefiting the company by lowering legal costs and keeping proceedings private. Uber argued that Georgia McGinty, a longtime customer of Uber Rides and Uber Eats, had agreed to arbitrate any disputes with the company when she signed off on the language in the app's terms of use on three occasions over the years. The McGintys fought back, saying it was actually their daughter -- who was and remains a minor -- who had most recently agreed to the terms when she used Georgia's phone to order food on their behalf. A lower court initially sided with the couple, denying Uber's motion to compel arbitration in November 2023. Uber appealed the decision, and late last month, the appeals court ruled in its favor. \"We hold that the arbitration provision contained in the agreement under review, which Georgia or her minor daughter, while using her cell phone agreed to, is valid and enforceable,\" the three-judge panel wrote in September. \"We, therefore, reverse the portion of the order denying arbitration of the claims against Uber.\" Shapiro told NPR that the couple \"100%\" wants to keep pursuing their case and are mulling their options, including asking the trial court to reconsider it or potentially trying to bring it to the New Jersey Supreme Court. \"Uber has just been extremely underhanded in their willingness to open the same cabinets that they're forcing the McGintys to open up and have to peek around in,\" Shapiro says. \"It's unfortunate that that's the way that they're carrying on their business, because this is truly something that subjects millions and millions of Americans and people all over the world to a waiver of their hard-fought rights.\" \"While the plaintiffs continue to tell the press that it was their daughter who ordered Uber Eats and accepted the Terms of Use, it's worth noting that in court they could only 'surmise' that that was the case but could not recall whether 'their daughter ordered food independently or if Georgia assisted,'\" Uber said in a statement. The report cites another recent case where Disney \"tried to block a man's wrongful death lawsuit on behalf of his wife -- who died following an allergic reaction after eating at a Disney World restaurant -- because he had signed up for a trial of Disney+.\" After negative media coverage, the company backtracked on its push for arbitration.

    "description": "The Verge's Gaby Del Valle reports: New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who was indicted last week on charges including fraud, bribery, and soliciting donations from foreign nationals, told federal investigators he forgot his phone password before handing it over, according to charging documents. That was almost a year ago, and investigators still can't get into the phone, prosecutors said Wednesday. During a federal court hearing, prosecutor Hagan Scotten said the FBI's inability to get into Adams' phone is a \"significant wild card,\" according to a report from the New York Post. The FBI issued a search warrant for Adams' devices in November 2023. Adams initially handed over two phones but didn't have his personal device on him. The indictment does not mention what type of device Adams uses. When Adams turned in his personal cellphone the following day, charging documents say, he said he had changed the password a day prior -- after learning about the investigation -- and couldn't remember it. Adams told investigators he changed the password \"to prevent members of his staff from inadvertently or intentionally deleting the contents of his phone,\" the indictment alleges. The FBI just needs the right tools. When investigators failed to break into the Trump rally shooter's phone in July, they sent the device to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, where agents used an unreleased tool from the Israeli company Cellebrite to crack it in less than an hour.

    "description": "The small town of Spruce Pine, North Carolina, which supplies high-purity quartz essential for semiconductor production, is reeling from the damage caused by Tropical Storm Helene. An anonymous reader quotes a report from Axios: Spruce Pine is one of the only places in the world to mine high-purity quartz. The mineral is an essential ingredient of chips in countless products, including medical devices, solar panels, cellphones and the chips powering the latest tech craze: artificial intelligence. It's difficult to underscore the significance of Spruce Pine -- a town of about 2,000 people, known for its charming downtown and blossoming arts scene -- to the global economy. Economics editor Ed Conway put it best in his 2023 book \"Material World,\" writing: \"It is rare, unheard of almost, for a single site to control the global supply of a crucial material. Yet if you want to get high-purity quartz -- the kind you need to make those crucibles without which you can't make silicon wafers -- it has to come from Spruce Pine.\" The Quartz Corp and Sibelco both export high-purity quartz from Spruce Pine. While there are other places to find the material, such as Russia and Brazil, this mountain town has the highest quantity of the highest purity, says Conway. A few weeks of shutdown is not the end of the world, Conway tells Axios. However, longer than that could put the industry into \"another crisis.\" The semiconductor industry would need to find alternatives. [...] The mines in Spruce Pine are still accounting for their workers and families, the international companies stated. The level of destruction at the sites is unknown. However, even if the facilities are intact, the railroads that move the quartz will likely need drastic repairs. The Quartz Corp and Sibelco temporarily halted operations on Sept. 26 and haven't said when they might reopen. \"This is second order of priority,\" The Quartz Corp said in a statement. \"Our top priority remains the health and safety of our employees and their families.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Financial Times has more details on the new fundraise closed by OpenAI. From the report: OpenAI has asked investors to avoid backing rival start-ups such as Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI, as it secures $6.6bn in new funding and seeks to shut out challengers to its early lead in generative artificial intelligence. [...] During the negotiations, the company made clear that it expected an exclusive funding arrangement, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions. Seeking exclusive relationships with investors restricts rivals' access to capital and strategic partnerships. The move by the maker of ChatGPT risks inflaming existing tensions with competitors, especially Musk, who is suing OpenAI. Venture firms are party to sensitive information about the companies they invest in, and close relationships with one company can make it difficult or contentious to also back a rival. But exclusivity is rarely insisted on, according to VCs, and many leading firms have spread their bets in certain sectors. Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, for instance, have backed multiple AI start-ups, including both OpenAI and Musk's xAI. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "title": "Most Frequently Asked Questions About Affiliate Marketing",
    "link": "https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2022/06/most-frequently-asked-questions-about.html",
    "description": "There are lots of questions floating around about how affiliate marketing works, what to do and what not to do when it comes to setting up a business. With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing1. What is affiliate marketing?¬†Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!2. What is an affiliate program?¬†An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?¬†¬†Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.¬† Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?¬†Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.¬†5. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing? ¬†Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action.¬†6. Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?¬†Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.7. Where do I find qualified publishers?¬†The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius. These networks have a strict application process and compliance checks, which means that all affiliates are trustworthy.8. What is an affiliate disclosure statement?¬†An affiliate disclosure statement discloses to the reader that there may be affiliate links on a website, for which a commission may be paid to the publisher if visitors follow these links and make purchases.¬†9. Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?¬†Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.10. What is a super affiliate?¬†A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.¬† Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.11. How do we track publisher sales activity?¬†Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.¬†12. Could we set up an affiliate program in multiple countries?¬†Because the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country. Affiliate strategies that are set internationally need to be tailored to the language of the targeted country.13. How can affiliate marketing help my business?Affiliate marketing can help you grow your business in the following ways:¬†It allows you to save time and money on marketing, which frees you up to focus on other aspects of your business.¬†You get access to friendly marketers who are eager to help you succeed.¬†It also helps you to promote your products by sharing links and banners with a new audience.¬†It offers high ROI(Return on investment) and is cost-effective.¬†14. How do I find quality publishers?¬†One of the best ways to work with qualified affiliates is to hire an affiliate marketing agency that works with all the networks. Affiliates are carefully selected and go through a rigorous application process to be included in the network.15. How Can we Promote Affiliate Links?¬†Affiliate marketing is generally associated with websites, but there are other ways to promote your affiliate links, including:A website or blogThrough email marketing and newsletterSocial media, like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.¬†Leave a comment on blogs or forums.Write an e-book or other digital product.Youtube¬†16. Do you have to pay to sign up for an affiliate program?¬†To build your affiliate marketing business, you don't have to invest money in the beginning. You can sign up for free with any affiliate network and start promoting their brands right away.17. What is a commission rate?¬†Commission rates are typically based on a percentage of the total sale and in some cases can also be a flat fee for each transaction. The rates are set by the merchant.Who manages your affiliate program?¬†Some merchants run their affiliate programs internally, while others choose to contract out management to a network or an external agency.18. What is a cookie?¬†Cookies are small pieces of data that work with web browsers to store information such as user preferences, login or registration data, and shopping cart contents. When someone clicks on your affiliate link, a cookie is placed on the user's computer or mobile device. That cookie is used to remember the link or ad that the visitor clicked on. Even if the user leaves your site and comes back a week later to make a purchase, you will still get credit for the sale and receive a commission it depends on the site cookies duration19. How long do cookies last?¬†The merchant determines the duration of a cookie, also known as its ‚Äúcookie life.‚Äù The most common length for an affiliate program is 30 days. If someone clicks on your affiliate link, you‚Äôll be paid a commission if they purchase within 30 days of the click.Final SayingMost new affiliates are eager to begin their affiliate marketing business. Unfortunately, there is a lot of bad information out there that can lead inexperienced affiliates astray. Hopefully, the answer to your question will provide clarity on how affiliate marketing works and the pitfalls you can avoid. Most importantly, keep in mind that success in affiliate marketing takes some time. Don't be discouraged if you're not immediately making sales or earning money. It takes most new affiliates months to make a full-time income.",

    "link": "https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2022/04/what-is-blockchain-everything-you-need.html",
    "description": "If you want to pay online, you need to register an account and provide credit card information. If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old.Imagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don‚Äôt need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That‚Äôs exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.It‚Äôs like your computer‚Äôs hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.¬†Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called ‚ÄúBit Gold.‚Äù However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.So, What is Blockchain?A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:Blockchain collects information in ‚Äúblocks‚Äù.A block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.Blocks form chains, which are called ‚ÄúBlockchains.‚ÄùMore information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.Each block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.Let‚Äôs get to know more about the blockchain.How does blockchain work?Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" or DLT.Here‚Äôs how it works:Someone or a computer will transactsThe transaction is transmitted throughout the network.A network of computers can confirm the transaction.When it is confirmed a transaction is added to a blockThe blocks are linked together to create a history. if (typeof atAsyncOptions !== 'object') var atAsyncOptions = []; atAsyncOptions.push({ 'key': '8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7', 'format': 'js', 'async': true, 'container': 'atContainer-8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7', 'params' : {} }); var script = document.createElement('script'); script.type = \"text/javascript\"; script.async = true; script.src = 'http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ? 's' : '') + '://www.topcreativeformat.com/8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7/invoke.js'; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script); And that‚Äôs the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it‚Äôs done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.A new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.Once a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.How are Blockchains used?Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been‚Äîso they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.What is Blockchain Decentralization?Blockchain technology is safe, even if it‚Äôs public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?Blockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.Instead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called ‚ÄúDecentralization,‚Äù meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.Blockchain guarantees your data's authenticity‚Äînot just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory.Pros and Cons of BlockchainBlockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.¬†ProsAccuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process.One of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with.Safe, private, and easy transactionsProvides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal informationConsData storage has limits.The regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place.It has a risk of being used for illicit activities¬†Frequently Asked Questions About BlockchainI‚Äôll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.Is Blockchain a cryptocurrency?Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.Is it possible for Blockchain to be hacked?Yes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.What is the most prominent blockchain company?Coinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.Who owns Blockchain?Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It‚Äôs a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.What is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology?Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency¬†What is the difference between Blockchain and a Database?Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.Final SayingBlockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won't be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

I'll analyze each tool to see how they differ in interfaces, keyword research resources, rank tracking, and competitor analysis. User Interface Ahrefs and SEMrush both offer comprehensive information and quick metrics regarding your website's SEO performance. However, Ahrefs takes a bit more of a hands-on approach to getting your account fully set up, whereas SEMrush's simpler dashboard can give you access to the data you need quickly. In this section, we provide a brief overview of the elements found on each dashboard and highlight the ease with which you can complete tasks. AHREFS The Ahrefs dashboard is less cluttered than that of SEMrush, and its primary menu is at the very top of the page, with a search bar designed only for entering URLs. Additional features of the Ahrefs platform include: You can see analytics from the dashboard, including search engine rankings to domain ratings, referring domains, and backlinkJumping from one tool to another is easy. You can use the Keyword Explorer to find a keyword to target and then directly track your ranking with one click.The website offers a tooltip helper tool that allows you to hover your mouse over something that isn't clear and get an in-depth explanation. SEMRUSH When you log into the SEMrush Tool, you will find four main modules. These include information about your domains, organic keyword analysis, ad keyword, and site traffic.

This detail is beneficial for new marketers, who are just starting. WHO WINS? Both Ahrefs and SEMrush have user-friendly dashboards, but Ahrefs is less cluttered and easier to navigate. On the other hand, SEMrush offers dozens of extra tools, including access to customer support resources. When deciding on which dashboard to use, consider what you value in the user interface, and test out both. Rank Tracking If you're looking to track your website's search engine ranking, rank tracking features can help. You can also use them to monitor your competitors. Let's take a look at Ahrefs vs. SEMrush to see which tool does a better job. Ahrefs The Ahrefs Rank Tracker is simpler to use. Just type in the domain name and keywords you want to analyze, and it spits out a report showing you the search engine results page (SERP) ranking for each keyword you enter. Rank Tracker looks at the ranking performance of keywords and compares them with the top rankings for those keywords. Ahrefs also offers: You'll see metrics that help you understand your visibility, traffic, average position, and keyword difficulty. It gives you an idea of whether a keyword would be profitable to target or not. SEMRUSH SEMRush offers a tool called Position Tracking. This tool is a project tool‚Äîyou must set it up as a new project. Below are a few of the most popular features of the SEMrush Position Tracking tool: All subscribers are given regular data updates and mobile search rankings upon subscribing The platform provides opportunities to track several SERP features, including Local tracking. Intuitive reports allow you to track statistics for the pages on your website, as well as the keywords used in those pages. Identify pages that may be competing with each other using the Cannibalization report. WHO WINS? Ahrefs is a more user-friendly option. It takes seconds to enter a domain name and keywords. From there, you can quickly decide whether to proceed with that keyword or figure out how to rank better for other keywords. SEMrush allows you to check your mobile rankings and ranking updates daily, which is something Ahrefs does not offer. SEMrush also offers social media rankings, a tool you won't find within the Ahrefs platform. Both are good which one do you like let me know in the comment. Keyword Research Keyword research is closely related to rank tracking, but it's used for deciding which keywords you plan on using for future content rather than those you use now. When it comes to SEO, keyword research is the most important thing to consider when comparing the two platforms. AHREFS The Ahrefs Keyword Explorer provides you with thousands of keyword ideas and filters search results based on the chosen search engine. Ahrefs supports several features, including: It can search multiple keywords in a single search and analyze them together. At SEMrush, you also have this feature in Keyword Overview.Ahrefs has a variety of keywords for different search engines, including Google, YouTube, Amazon, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, and other search engines.When you click on a keyword, you can see its search volume and keyword difficulty, but also other keywords related to it, which you didn't use.

The Keyword Magic Tool also lets you to: Show performance metrics by keywordSearch results are based on both broad and exact keyword matches.Show data like search volume, trends, keyword difficulty, and CPC.Show the first 100 Google search results for any keyword.Identify SERP Features and Questions related to each keywordSEMrush has released a new Keyword Gap Tool that uncovers potentially useful keyword opportunities for you, including both paid and organic keywords. WHO WINS? Both of these tools offer keyword research features and allow users to break down complicated tasks into something that can be understood by beginners and advanced users alike. If you're interested in keyword suggestions, SEMrush appears to have more keyword suggestions than Ahrefs does. It also continues to add new features, like the Keyword Gap tool and SERP Questions recommendations. Competitor Analysis Both platforms offer competitor analysis tools, eliminating the need to come up with keywords off the top of your head. Each tool is useful for finding keywords that will be useful for your competition so you know they will be valuable to you. AHREFS Ahrefs' domain comparison tool lets you compare up to five websites (your website and four competitors) side-by-side.it also shows you¬†how your site is ranked against others with metrics such as backlinks, domain ratings, and more. Use the Competing Domains section to see a list of your most direct competitors, and explore how many keywords matches your competitors have. To find more information about your competitor, you can look at the Site Explorer and Content Explorer tools and type in their URL instead of yours. SEMRUSH SEMrush provides a variety of insights into your competitors' marketing tactics. The platform enables you to research your competitors effectively. It also offers several resources for competitor analysis including: Traffic Analytics helps you identify where your audience comes from, how they engage with your site, what devices visitors use to view your site, and how your audiences overlap with other websites.

The Market Explorer search field allows you to type in a domain and lists websites or articles similar to what you entered. Market Explorer also allows users to perform in-depth data analytics on These companies and markets. WHO WINS? SEMrush wins here because it has more tools dedicated to competitor analysis than Ahrefs. However, Ahrefs offers a lot of functionality in this area, too. It takes a combination of both tools to gain an advantage over your competition. Pricing Ahrefs Lite Monthly: $99/monthStandard Monthly: $179/month Annually Lite: $990/yearAnnually Standard: $1790/year SEMRUSH Pro Plan: $119.95/monthGuru Plan:$229.95/monthBusiness Plan: $449.95/month Which SEO tool should you choose for digital marketing?

    "title": "Most Frequently Asked Questions About NFTs(Non-Fungible Tokens)",
    "link": "https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2022/02/most-frequently-asked-questions-about.html",
    "description": "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the most popular digital assets today, capturing the attention of cryptocurrency investors, whales and people from around the world. People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.1) What is an NFT?NFT stands for non-fungible¬† token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.2) What is Blockchain?A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information‚Äîsuch as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts‚Äîin one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can‚Äôt be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.3) What makes an NFT valuable? The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn‚Äôt necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.4) How do NFTs work?One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.¬†As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can‚Äôt be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.¬†NFTs also contain smart contracts‚Äîsmall computer programs that run on the blockchain‚Äîthat give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.5) What‚Äôs the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you‚Äôll be able to upload and sell your creations6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?When you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain‚Äîthe bitcoin ledger of transactions‚Äîand that entry acts as your proof of ownership.7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.10) How do we buy an NFTs?There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.11) Can i mint NFT for free?To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it? if (typeof atAsyncOptions !== 'object') var atAsyncOptions = []; atAsyncOptions.push({ 'key': 'adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816', 'format': 'js', 'async': true, 'container': 'atContainer-adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816', 'params' : {} }); var script = document.createElement('script'); script.type = \"text/javascript\"; script.async = true; script.src = 'http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ? 's' : '') + '://www.topcreativeformat.com/adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816/invoke.js'; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script); The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.12) Why are people investing so much in NFT? ¬†Non-fungible tokens have gained the hearts of people around the world, and they have given digital creators the recognition they deserve. One of the remarkable things about non-fungible tokens is that you can take a screenshot of one, but you don‚Äôt own it. This is because when a non-fungible token is created, then the transaction is stored on the blockchain, and the license or contract to hold such a token is awarded to the person owning the token in their digital wallet.You can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.Final SayingThat‚Äôs a wrap. Hope you guys found this article enlightening. I just answer some question with my limited knowledge about NFTs. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to drop them in the comment section below. Also I have a question for you, Is bitcoin an NFTs? let me know in The comment section below",

    "title": "Most Frequently Asked Questions About Email Marketing",
    "link": "https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2022/01/most-frequently-asked-questions-about.html",
    "description": "1. Why is email marketing important?Email is the marketing tool that helps you¬† create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak¬† to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them. Along with the right message, email can become one of your most powerful marketing channels.2. What is benefits of email marketing?Email marketing is best way for creating long term relationship with your clients, and increasing sales in our company.Benefits of email marketing for bussiness:Better brand recognitionStatistics of what works bestMore salesTargeted audienceMore traffic to your products/services/newsletterBuild credibilityMost¬† bussinesses are using email marketing and making tons of money with email marketing.3. What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails?Again, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be¬† times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your¬† data to decide.¬†4. Which metrics should I be looking at?The two most important metrics for email marketing are¬† open rate and click-through rate. If your emails aren't opened, subscribers will never see your full marketing message, and if they open them but don't click through to your site, your emails won't convert.5. How do I write a decent subject line?The best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing¬† the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for¬† A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and¬† simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email,¬† then repeated¬† at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example \"Click here to download the premium theme for free. 6. Is email marketing still effective?Email marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site¬† hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans¬† see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely¬† see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience. 7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself?Buying an email list is¬† waste of time \u0026 money. These email accounts are unverified and not interested in your brand. The mailing list is useless if your subscribers do not open your emails. There are different ways to grow your mailing list.¬†Give them a free ebook and host it on a landing page where they have to enter the email to download the file and also create a forum page on your website, asks your visitors what questions they might have about your business, and collects email addresses to follow up with them. if (typeof atAsyncOptions !== 'object') var atAsyncOptions = []; atAsyncOptions.push({ 'key': '05a47ba863f62ec113e14b51b976d14a', 'format': 'js', 'async': true, 'container': 'atContainer-05a47ba863f62ec113e14b51b976d14a', 'params' : {} }); var script = document.createElement('script'); script.type = \"text/javascript\"; script.async = true; script.src = 'http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ? 's' : '') + '://www.topcreativeformat.com/05a47ba863f62ec113e14b51b976d14a/invoke.js'; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script); 8. How do I prevent audience from unsubscribing?If the¬† subject line of the email is irrelevant to¬† customers, they will ignore it multiple times. But, if it keeps repeating, they are intercepted and unsubscribed from your emails. So, send relevant emails for the benefit of the customer. Don't send emails that often only focus¬† on sales, offers and discounts.¬†Submit information about your business and offers so you can connect with customers. You can also update them on recent trends in your industry. The basic role of an email is first and foremost to¬† connect with customers, get the most out of this tool.9. What is the difference between a cold email and a spam email?Cold emails are mostly sales emails that are sent with content align to the needs of the recipient. It is usually personalized and includes a business perspective. However, it is still an unsolicited email. And all unsolicited emails are marked as SPAM.¬†Regularly receiving this type of unsolicited email in your users' inboxes, chances are¬† your emails will soon be diverted to¬† spam or junk folders.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html?src=rss",
    "description": "If vacuuming is your least favorite chore, employing a robot vacuum can save you time and stress while also making sure your home stays clean. While once most robo-vacs landed on the higher end of the price spectrum, that‚Äôs not the case anymore. Sure, you could pick up a $1,000 cleaning behemoth, but it would be incorrect to assume that you need to spend that much money to get a good machine. Now, you can get an autonomous dirt-sucker with serious cleaning chops for $500 ‚Äî sometimes even $300 or less. But you get what you pay for in this space; don‚Äôt expect affordable robot vacuum cleaners to have all of the bells and whistles that premium machines do. After testing dozens of robot vacuums at various price points, I‚Äôve narrowed down our top picks for the best budget robot vacuums you can buy right now. Table of contents Best budget robot vacuums in 2024 Are robot vacuums worth it? What to look for in a budget robot vacuum How we test Robot vacuum maintenance tips Best budget robot vacuums in 2024 Are robot vacuums worth it? Since I've tested dozens of robot vacuums, I'm often asked if these gadgets are \"worth it\" and I'd say the answer is yes. The biggest thing they offer is convenience: just turn on a robot vacuum and walk away. The machine will take care of the rest. If vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores, or you just want to spend less time keeping your home tidy, semi-autonomous robotic vacuum is a great investment. Many models, albeit more expensive ones, even come with features like self-emptying bases to further reduce maintenance. There are plenty of other good things about them, but before we dive in let‚Äôs consider the biggest trade-offs: less power, less capacity and less flexibility. Those first two go hand in hand; robot vacuum cleaners are much smaller than upright vacuums, which leads to less powerful suction. They also hold less dirt because their built-in bins are a fraction of the size of a standard vacuum canister or bag. Fortunately, some models include features like an auto-empty system, which helps with dirt capacity, especially in homes with pet hair. When it comes to flexibility, robot vacuums do things differently than standard ones. You can control some with your smartphone, set cleaning schedules and more, but robo-vacs are primarily tasked with cleaning floors. On the flip side, their upright counterparts can come with various attachments that let you clean couches, stairs, light fixtures and other hard-to-reach places. What to look for in a budget robot vacuum When looking for the best cheap robot vacuum, one of the first things you should consider is the types of floors you have in your home. Do you have mostly carpet, tile, laminate, hardwood? Carpets demand vacuums with more suction power that can pick up debris pushed down into nooks and crannies. Unfortunately, there isn‚Äôt a universal metric by which suction is measured. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger. But other companies don‚Äôt rely on Pa levels and simply say their robots have X-times more suction power than other robot vacuums. So how can you ensure you‚Äôre getting the best cheap robot vacuum to clean your floor type? Read the product description. Look for details about its ability to clean hard floors and carpets, and see if it has a ‚Äúmax‚Äù mode you can use to increase suction. If you are given a Pa measurement, look for around 2000Pa if you have mostly carpeted floors. Pay attention to the brush roll mechanism as well, especially if you're dealing with dog hair or other stubborn debris. Size is also important for two reasons: clearance and dirt storage. Check the specs for the robot‚Äôs height to see if it can get underneath the furniture you have in your home. Most robo-vacs won‚Äôt be able to clean under a couch (unless it‚Äôs a very tall, very strange couch), but some can get under entryway tables, nightstands and the like. As for dirt storage, look out for the milliliter capacity of the robot‚Äôs dustbin ‚Äî the bigger the capacity, the more dirt the vacuum cleaner can collect before you have to empty it. You should also double check the Wi-Fi capabilities of the robo-vac you‚Äôre eyeing. While you may think that‚Äôs a given on all smart home devices, it‚Äôs not. Some of the most affordable models don‚Äôt have the option to connect to your home Wi-Fi network. If you choose a robot vac like this, you won‚Äôt be able to direct it with a smartphone app or with voice controls. Another feature that‚Äôs typically reserved for Wi-Fi-connected robots is scheduling because most of them use a mobile app to set cleaning schedules. But Wi-Fi-incapable vacuums usually come with remote controls that have all the basic functions that companion mobile apps do, including start, stop and return to dock. And if you‚Äôre concerned about the possibility of hacking, a robot vac with no access to your Wi-Fi network is the best option. Obstacle detection and cliff sensors are other key features to look out for. The former helps the robot vacuum navigate around furniture while it cleans, rather than mindlessly pushing its way into it. Many also offer no-go zones, letting you block off areas you don‚Äôt want the robot to enter. Meanwhile, cliff sensors prevent robot vacuums from tumbling down the stairs, making them the best vacuum for multi-level homes. How we test When we consider which robot vacuums to test, we look at each machine‚Äôs specs and feature list, as well as online reviews to get a general idea of its capabilities. With each robot vacuum we review, we set it up as per the instructions and use it for as long as possible ‚Äî at minimum, we‚Äôll use each for one week, running cleaning cycles daily. We make sure to try out any physical buttons the machine has on it, and any app-power features like scheduling, robot mapping and more. Since we test robot vacuums in our own homes, there are obstacles already in the machine‚Äôs way like tables, chairs and other furniture ‚Äî this helps us understand how capable the machine is at avoiding obstacles, and we‚Äôll intentionally throw smaller items in their way like shoes, pet toys and more. With robot vacuums that include self-emptying bases, we assess how loud the machine is while emptying contents into the base and roughly how long it takes for us to fill up the bag (or bagless) base with debris. Robot vacuum maintenance tips First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum‚Äôs dustbin after every cleaning job, or use a self-emptying base if the model supports it. Simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning, and then reattach it so it's ready to go for the next time. It‚Äôs also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to its insides. In addition, you‚Äôll want to regularly examine the machine‚Äôs brushes to see if any human or pet hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it‚Äôs a good idea to check your robot‚Äôs brushes regardless ‚Äî both their main brush and any smaller, corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangled hair or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards. Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine‚Äôs user manual or the manufacturer‚Äôs website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like Amazon or Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Oura‚Äôs fourth-generation smart ring gets smaller and smarter",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ouras-fourth-generation-smart-ring-gets-smaller-and-smarter-070005477.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Oura, the Finnish company that has done more than most to put smart rings on the map, is ready to show off its fourth-generation Ring. The new model gets a sleeker design, longer battery life and smarter sensors producing even smarter insights for wearers. But the thing I really care about is that the company has finally made a perfectly-round ring that doesn‚Äôt include any ugly-ass etchings on the outside. The biggest change made to the Ring 4 is in the sensors, which were previously housed in raised bumps that kept contact with your finger. Now, the sensors are flush with the body, making the whole thing a lot smoother and sleeker than it was before. And while I haven‚Äôt seen it in the flesh yet, the press images seem to suggest it‚Äôs a decent chunk thinner than its predecessors. Those sensor improvements aren‚Äôt just focused on making them smaller, but also improving their ability to peer into our bodies. Oura says Ring 4 has 18 distinct signal pathways, up from eight in the Gen3, which is paired with its new ‚ÄúSmart Sensing‚Äù algorithm. The ring will automatically optimize which of those 18 pathways to use to maintain a constant reading, given how much jewelry moves around through the day. This is a real issue for some Oura users, because if the ring shifts around too much, you‚Äôll get inconsistent readings. The company claims that the new hardware offers a 30 percent increase in blood oxygen sensing, 31 percent fewer gaps in nighttime heart rate and seven percent fewer gaps during the day. Oura hasn‚Äôt said what battery size the Ring 4 has, but says the above tweaks should help it get up to eight days of life on a single charge. Oura Ring 4 is available in 12 sizes (4-15) and in six colors; Silver, Brushed Silver, Gold, Rose Gold, Stealth and Black. All bar the Stealth is clad in titanium with physical vapor deposition coating, with the outlier draped instead in titanium with diamond-like carbon coating. Much like its predecessor, its water-resistant to depths up 100 meters, and is suitable for saunas and swimming, but not deep-sea diving. The company is also redesigning its mobile app to group all of the data it collects about you into three distinct categories: Today, Vitals and My Health. The first two of those help you explore your vital signs for the day in aggregate or in detail. My Health, meanwhile, will offer longer-term insights including your cardiovascular age, cardio capacity, stress and sleep. This will start rolling out today for all users, regardless of which generation of ring they own. When I reviewed the third-generation Ring, I griped about the company‚Äôs decision to paywall features behind a monthly subscription. Look, I get you can‚Äôt build a sustainable hardware business on device sales alone and this sort of recurring revenue helps keep the lights on. But that only works if what you‚Äôre offering is compelling enough to justify the $5.99 a month, or $70 per year, which is why the Ring 4 is getting some new membership-only features. Oura That includes automatic heart-rate and activity detection for up to 40 different activities, removing the need for users to manually log their stats after a workout. When the app detects symptoms of high stress, it‚Äôll now place that data in context with your movement, activities and tags. There‚Äôs also a better-developed suite of features for people who menstruate, with new insights for fertility windows ‚Äî the company adding that this is designed to aid pregnancy, not prevent it. Of course, while Oura‚Äôs never been the only game in town, it‚Äôs now got competition from Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy Ring. You can see that Samsung got to the integrated sensors ahead of the company it‚Äôs drawing inspiration from, but the Galaxy Ring is fairly basic, features-wise. Oura CEO Tom Hale told Bloomberg he feels the Korean giants are two years behind his company as things stand.¬† Oura Ring 4 is available to pre-order today, with shipping expected to begin on October 15, 2024, with prices starting at $349. The first month of membership is free, with users asked to cough up $5.99 a month or $69.99 for the year. Even if you already have an Oura Ring sizing kit, the company urges you to get the new updated sizing kit before ordering your ring, which is available in sizes 4-15.¬† This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ouras-fourth-generation-smart-ring-gets-smaller-and-smarter-070005477.html?src=rss",

    "description": "One of the year‚Äôs scariest and most engrossing horror games is clawing its way to a new console. SFB Games‚Äô Crow Country will launch on the Nintendo Switch on October 16. Crow Country may look like a cheerier, grainier Animal Crossing but that just adds to the horror adventure‚Äôs creepy and dark atmosphere. You play as Mara Forest, a plucky young woman exploring the remains of an abandoned amusement park called Crow Country. Its owner Edward Crow mysteriously disappeared in his park and has been missing for two years. It‚Äôs up to Mara to uncover the mysteries behind the abandoned theme park and its long lost owner. Engadget‚Äôs Cheyenne MacDonald reviewed the game back in May and highlighted that it drew some inspiration from the aesthetics and horrific monsters of horror games on Sony‚Äôs first Playstation like Resident Evil and Silent Hill. She also described the game as ‚Äúcozy,‚Äù an odd word to describe a horror game. Crow Country‚Äôs ‚Äúcozy‚Äù nature adds to the horror by taking familiar seeming characters and putting them in the Lovecraft-ian atmosphere of terror and mystery. It‚Äôs so good that it even made our list of the best horror games of the year. Crow Country is also available on Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox X/S.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-creepy-crow-country-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-on-october-16-215954902.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Tesla's least expensive car is off the market: the Model 3 Standard Range Rear-Wheel Drive is no longer available in the online configurator. Electrek first reported on the absence of that Model 3 build. It was the cheapest option from the electric vehicle brand with a price tag of $39,000. Now the Model 3 Long-Range Rear-Wheel Drive takes that title with a retail price of $42,500. Tesla unveiled a refresh to its Model 3 line in the US in January. The company also posted numbers for the third quarter today, with 462,890 vehicles delivered between July and September. Sales were aided by price cuts and other incentives during the quarter, enough to reach a 6.4 percent increase from the previous year's deliveries. However, the figure fell short of analysts' predictions for more than 469,000 deliveries during the period. This quarterly result could also hamper CEO Elon Musk's projections for the company to surpass the 1.8 million vehicles it handed over in all of 2023. Tesla has also been struggling with recalls this year. Most of those issues were fixed with over-the-air updates, but the scope and number of the issues may also be leaving customers with doubts. Recalls impacted 200,000 vehicles in January, 2 million in February, 125,000 in May, 12,000 in June, 1.8 million in July, and more than 9,000 in August.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-has-stopped-selling-its-cheapest-car-212756966.html?src=rss",

Epic Games Store general manager Steve Allison announced at Unreal Fest in Seattle that it plans to expand the Epic Games Stores‚Äô mobile library with 10 to 50 new third-party games and start a free games program, according to mobilegamer.biz. Allison said the free games program and third-party titles will be available in ‚ÄúQ4‚Äù or the last part of the year.

    "description": "Meta is rolling out some of the previously announced features to its AI-powered Ray-Ban smart glasses for users in the US and Canada. CTO Andrew Bosworth posted on Threads that today's update to the glasses includes more natural language recognition, meaning the stilted commands of \"Hey Meta, look and tell me\" should be gone. Users will be able to engage the AI assistant without the \"look and\" portion of the invocation. Most of the other AI tools showed off during last month's Connect event are also arriving on the frames today. That includes voice messages, timers and reminders. The glasses can also be used to have Meta AI call a phone number or scan a QR code. CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated the new reminders features as a way to find your car in a parking garage in an Instagram reel. One notable omission from this update is the live translation feature, but Bosworth didn't share a timeline for when that feature will be ready. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck) Meta's smart glasses already made headlines once today after two students from Harvard University used them to essentially dox total strangers. Their combination of facial recognition technology and a large language processing model was able to reveal addresses, phone numbers, family member details and partial Social Security Numbers.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/metas-smart-glasses-can-now-tell-you-where-you-parked-your-car-195200826.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Amazon Prime Big Deal Days is back this year, returning on October 8 and 9. The ‚Äúfall Prime Day‚Äù of sorts has served as the online retailer‚Äôs unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season for the past few years. We expect most of the deals to be Prime exclusives, meaning you must be an active Prime subscriber to get the discounts. There are always a couple of deals available for everyone, though, so it‚Äôs worth perusing Amazon‚Äôs site even if you don‚Äôt pay for Prime. It‚Äôs also worth doing so now because we‚Äôve found a number of solid early Prime Day deals already available. These are the best of the bunch; we‚Äôll be updating this post regularly in the lead-up to October Prime Day, so check back for the latest deals. Prime Day deals: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods 4 for $119 ($10 off) Apple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off) Kindle Paperwhite Signature Essentials bundle for $203 ($55 off) Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) Amazon Echo Show 5 + TP-Link Tapo Smart Light Bulb for $50 ($65 off) Prime Day deals on Apple gear Photo by Billy Steele / Engadget While Apple deals are few and far between right now, you can save a bit on the new AirPods 4. AirTags have a slight discount as well, both in single and multi-packs. Apple AirPods 4 for $119 ($10 off): This is the first discount we've seen on the new AirPods 4 since launch; just know that right now, only the model with ANC is on sale. Apple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This stylus is a more affordable version of the new \"pro\" Pencil, and it works with most new iPads. Apple AirTag for $25 ($4 off): This is only $2 more than the record-low price we've seen on a single AirTag in the past. A four-pack is also on sale for $79. Apple Silicone MagSafe iPhone 16 case for $42 ($7 off): It's not a huge discount but this is the first real sale we've seen on first-party iPhone 16 cases. If you don't mind getting a third-party iPhone 16 case, you have plenty of other options, too. Prime Day deals on Amazon devices Valentina Palladino / Engadget It's a safe bet that we'll see even more Amazon gear discounted on October Prime Day, but for now, you can snag a Fire tablet on sale, as well as Ring and Blink security cameras for much cheaper than usual. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): This recently revived smart display is billed as a smart alarm clock, and it features a customizable screen, big sound for its size and all the perks for Alexa voice commands. You can also grab it bundled with a free TP-Link smart light bulb. Kindle Paperwhite Signature Essentials bundle for $203 ($55 off): This bundle includes one of the best Kindles you can get right now, along with its fabric cover and wireless charging pad. This is the lowest price we've seen all year on this trio. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off): Amazon's most powerful Fire TV dongle supports 4K, HDR content and Dolby Vision, plus Wi-Fi 6E and Dolby Atmos audio. A number of other Fire TV devices are on sale right now, too, including the Fire TV Stick Lite for only $18. Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet for $75 ($65 off): One of the more advanced tablets in Amazon's lineup, the HD 10 has a 1080p screen, an octa-core processor, up to 64GB of storage and a 13-hour battery life. Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet for $55 ($75 off): This is more than half off Amazon's 8-inch slab that we consider to be a good couch device, or a first-time tablet for a child. It joins a few other Amazon tablets that are discounted right now. Amazon Echo Show 5 + TP-Link Tapo Smart Light Bulb for $50 ($65 off): This bundle deal knocks 56 percent off a duo that includes one of our favorite compact smart displays and a smart light bulb that can be controlled via Alexa voice commands. Blink Outdoor 4 + Echo Show 5 bundle for $60 ($130 off): This Prime-exclusive bundle gives you a one-camera Blink system that can be used indoors or outdoors along with an Echo Show 5, which you can use to see camera feeds just by using Alexa voice commands. Blink Outdoor 4 + Blink Mini 2 bundle for $50 ($90 off): It's almost a guarantee that Blink security systems will be on sale for Prime Day(s) and this time is no different. This bundle is 64 percent off, and there are a bunch of other bundles on sale that include cameras, video doorbells and more. Ring pan and tilt security camera for $50 ($30 off): This security camera joined the Ring lineup only a few months ago, and this is the best price we've seen on it. It's part of a larger Ring sale that discounts home security gear by up to 50 percent. Amazon Music Unlimited three-month trial for free (four-month free trial for Prime members): Anyone who has never tried Amazon Music Unlimited before can get a three-month free trial right now. Amazon ups that to four months if you're a Prime member that's new to the music streaming service. That's a great deal considering Music Unlimited typically costs $11 per month without Prime or $10 per month with Prime. Prime Day deals on tech Will Lipman Photography for Engadget Early Prime Day deals on tech include discounts on power banks, webcams, smart plugs and more. Cosori 9-in-1 air frier for $90 ($30 off): This newer air fry from Cosori has nine preset cooking modes and a six-quart capacity that makes it just the right size to cook a good amount of food without taking up too much space on most countertops. Anker Nano Power Bank 10K for $32 ($8 off): This is the cheapest price we've seen for this 10K power bank that has a connecting USB-C cable built in. Baseus 30W/10000mAh MagSafe power bank for $28 ($18 off): Clip the 40-percent off coupon to get a record-low price on a power bank that earned a place in our guide to the best power banks you can buy. It quickly refills MagSafe-compatible phones and has a handy built-in cable. Logitech Brio 500 Full HD Webcam for $93 ($37 off): Our top pick for the best webcam you can buy right now is $37 off, a decent discount even if it's not a record-low sale. If you spend a lot of your day on video calls, this will be a solid upgrade to your computer's built-in cam. It has a wide field of view, auto-light correction and shoots 1080p video. Samsung T7 Shield (4TB) for $280 ($220 off): If you're looking for a high-capacity portable SSD that can take a beating, this deal is the best price we've seen on the 4TB T7 Shield since June. Kasa Smart Plug EP25 (4-pack) for $34 ($16 off): These are our top pick in our guide to the best smart plugs available right now thanks to their compatibility across all four of the main smart home ecosystems, their easy setup process and reliable connection. Everything you need to know about October Prime Day 2024 When is October Prime Day 2024? October Prime Day will be held on October 8 and 9 this year. What is October Prime Day?

How long is October Prime Day? October Prime Day will last two full days. What is on sale for Amazon Prime Big Deal Days? Most October Prime Day deals will not be revealed until the days of the event. However, in years past, we've seen everything from clothing to household essentials to outdoor gear go on sale during this event. Engadget cares most about tech deals, and in past fall Prime Days, we've seen things like phones, tablets, headphones, earbuds, robot vacuums, smart home gear and more receive deep discounts. Do I need an Amazon Prime membership to shop Prime Day deals? Yes, because most deals will be Prime exclusives. However, there are always a few decent deals available to all Amazon shoppers, so it's worth checking out Amazon's site during October Prime Day to see where you can save even if you don't pay for Prime. Expired early Prime Day deals Apple 24-inch iMac (M3) for $1,100 ($200 off): The discount plus clippable coupon bring the final price for this Apple desktop down to the lowest we've seen. Apple Magic Mouse (black) for $85 ($15 off): The white version of Apple's popular accessory is still cheaper at $68, but the black colorway rarely goes on sale. Both mice pair quickly and are relatively light with responsive touch gestures. Apple iPad Air (13-inch) for $720 ($80 off): The large model of our favorite iPad returns to one of its frequent sale prices. It's about $20 more than its record low, but it's still a good deal if you've been eyeing the 13-inch Air. Apple Pencil (1st gen) for $69 ($30 off): If you have a 10th-gen iPad or older, this is the stylus to get. We've seen this discount for a couple of weeks now, but it's still $10 below the average sale price. It's also discounted at Walmart.

Beats Fit Pro earbuds for $159 ($41 off): Our overall favorite pair of earbuds for running are on sale for $41 off. They've hit this price point often over the past few months, but it's a decent discount on buds we found to be comfortable with a secure fit and great audio quality. Beats Studio Buds for $99 ($51 off): They're a tad old at this point, but the Studio Buds remain a decent buy at under $100. Amazon Echo Show 5 + Sengled smart light bulb bundle for $60 ($50 off): This bundle gives you one of our favorite smart displays (which makes an excellent alarm clock) and a top pick in our best smart light bulbs guide at a 45-percent discount. iRobot Roomba Vac robot vacuum for $170 ($80 off): This affordable robo-vac is only $10 more than it was during July Prime Day right now, making it an even better option if you want a robot vacuum without spending a ton. 8BitDo Ultimate C wired gaming controller for $15 ($5 off): Now at $1 cheaper than it was during Prime Day in July, this 8BitDo accessory is an even better option for PC gamers or folks looking for a more comfortable Steam Deck controller. ASTRO Gaming A40 TR wired gaming headset for $100 ($30 off): Our pick for the best gaming headset is $30 off, a discount we've seen a few times this year. We found these to be comfortable with better sound than many headsets, but the mic performance is only OK. Anker 633 10K magnetic power bank for $40 ($40 off): This MagSafe-compatible charging bank has a built-in kickstand for propping up your iPhone, plus a 20W USB-C port for high-speed, wired charging.

TP-Link AC1200 WiFi Extender for $20 ($30 off): Our top budget pick in our best Wi-Fi extenders guide is more than half off right now. While not a rare deal, it's still a record-low price on a handy device that could help eliminate dead zones around your home. Samsung Pro Plus microSD card (512GB) with adapter for $30 ($54 off): Now 64 percent off, this high-capacity microSD card is a great buy for anyone who needs extra storage for their camera, tablet or Nintendo Switch (or other handheld gaming console). Google Pixel Buds A-Series for $64 ($35 off): This is one of the best prices we've seen on Google's budget-friendly wireless earbuds, which we praised for their solid sound quality, deep Google Assistant integration and small, comfortable design. Beats Studio Pro x Kim Kardashian headphones + 2 years of AppleCare+ for $279 ($100 off): If you're really into the muted colors in this collection, this is one of the best deals we've seen on Beats' pro-level headphones with AppleCore+ protection. Apple Watch Ultra 2 for $689 ($110 off): This is a record-low price on the Ultra 2, which remains Apple's most premium smartwatch and the one best for adventurers, ultramarathoners and the like. Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 + $30 Amazon gift card for $229: The brand new Pixel Buds that are a solid choice for Pixel phone owners include a free $30 Amazon gift card in this bundle. Google Pixel 8a smartphone for $399 ($100 off): If you're looking for an Android phone with a ton of advanced features and a reasonable price tag, the Pixel 8a is the best midrange smartphone you can get right now.

It's still selling for a record low right now. iRobot Roomba Vacuum and Mop Combo for $206 ($69 off): This Roomba can vacuum and mop floors all in one go, and it will automatically return to its charging base when it needs more juice.

An ereader can help to lighten the load and there's a good deal on a kid-friendly option at the minute. Just ahead of the October edition of Prime Day, Amazon has dropped the price of the Kindle Paperwhite Kids by $55, bringing it down to $115. That's close to the all-time-low price. Along with a Kindle Paperwhite with 16GB of storage, the bundle includes a year of Amazon Kids+ access, a kid-friendly cover and a two-year worry-free guarantee. If the ereader breaks for any reason in that timeframe, Amazon will replace it. Amazon says all of that equates to a value of up to $263. Amazon Kids+ typically costs $6 per month. It includes thousands of kid-friendly books, Amazon says. The Paperwhite is all about reading. So while Amazon Kids+ includes access to games, videos and apps on a Kindle Fire, there's none of that here. The Kindle Paperwhite Kids has a couple extra features called Vocabulary Builder and Word Wise to help youngsters develop their reading skills. The ereader also includes a font called OpenDyslexic, which Amazon says some readers with dyslexia prefer.

    "description": "Now that OpenAI is becoming a for-profit company, it‚Äôs making a tidy profit in the process. The Wall Street Journal reported that OpenAI has raised $6.6 billion in new funding from investors, nearly doubling its value to $157 billion. The new funding also makes it the largest venture capital deal in history. The new investors jumped on board after the artificial intelligence startup planned to switch from a charitable non-profit to a for-profit, product-focused company. If OpenAI fails to make the move to for-profit, investors have the right to pull their funding, according to Axios. The venture-capital firm Thrive Capital founded by Joshua Kushner, the youngest son of convicted-turned-pardoned real estate developer Charles Kushner, led the new round of funding with $1.25 billion. Other investors included SoftBank, Nvidia, Fidelity Management and OpenAI‚Äôs previous largest investor Microsoft. One name that was notably absent from the investor list is Apple. The tech giant was in the process of negotiating a funding deal but apparently the agreement fell apart. Funding isn‚Äôt the only thing that‚Äôs growing for OpenAI. Its AI app ChatGPT has attracted 250 million weekly active users, up from the 200 million announced at the end of August, and 11 million paying subscribers. The higher usage rate has OpenAI officials thinking they should raise the subscription price for ChatGPT to $22 a month by the end of the year and $44 a month in the next five years.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-rakes-in-over-6-billion-in-new-funding-192110908.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Can you hear the soft, cherubic voices of corporate executives singing in unison? That can only mean one thing. They‚Äôve figured out a new way to squeeze money out of our eyeballs. Amazon is adding even more ads to Prime Video, according to reporting by Financial Times. This uptick in corporate-sponsored splendor will go into effect early next year. This comes less than a year after Amazon forced ads onto its streaming video platform, which is something all of the major streamers do now. We pay money to watch ads. It‚Äôs pretty darn cool. In any event, it remains unclear as to how many more ads will infest that next episode of Reacher or where they‚Äôll be placed. Modern streaming shows aren‚Äôt made with advertisements in mind, so these ads just kinda pop up wherever. Ads have turned into a serious revenue stream for Amazon because, again, they sit on top of our monthly Prime memberships that we already pay for. It costs extra to go ad-free. The company recently crowed that it drew more than $1.8 billion in advertising commitments at an upfront event in September. This exceeded the company‚Äôs own targets. Amazon also revealed that the ad tier of Prime Video reaches 19 million monthly users in the UK alone. This tier is used by over 100 million people in the US each month. Kelly Day, vice-president of Prime Video International, told Financial Times that the platform launched with ‚Äúa very light load‚Äù of ads at first, so as to prepare consumers for the coming onslaught. She said the initial rollout was a deliberate ‚Äúgentle entry into advertising.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe know it was a bit of a contrarian approach to take,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut‚Äâit‚Äôs actually gone much better than we even anticipated.‚Äù Day added that the company has not seen ‚Äúa groundswell of people churning out or canceling\" after it brought in advertisements.¬† The company is also readying an interactive ad experience that will allow Prime Video watchers to add an item to their cart straight from the video stream. This will work with physical remotes and on the app. Sweet, sweet corporate synergy.

    "description": "It's little wonder that investors were clamoring to plow money into OpenAI. Alongside an announcement that the company had raised $6.6 billion in funding, OpenAI revealed that \"every week, over 250 million people around the world use ChatGPT to enhance their work, creativity, and learning.\" That's a sharp rise since late August, when OpenAI said the chatbot had 200 million weekly users ‚Äî double the number it had last November. As of June, 350 million people were using OpenAI's tools each month, according to internal documents obtained by The New York Times. It's unclear how many people are paying for access versus those using the free tier. It's not exactly clear why there was such a sharp increase in user numbers in just a couple of months. However, kids just went back to school and might be using the chatbot to cheat do some quick research. OpenAI can probably expect ChatGPT's user numbers to get another major boost when Apple eventually incorporates it into Apple Intelligence, which will happen in the coming months.

    "description": "An unsettling report from 404 Media has shed light on some ways that the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses could be used to violate people's privacy. Two Harvard students used facial recognition tech and a large language model to unearth a subject's name, occupation and other details. Their setup (dubbed I-XRAY) can use that information to pull together other data about the person including their address, phone number, family member details and partial Social Security Numbers from a variety of sources on the web. All of this is said to happen automatically. While this would be possible with a variety of cameras, AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio opted to use Meta's smart glasses since \"they look almost indistinguishable from regular glasses\" and have a camera built in. A demo video shows the students using the glasses to swiftly find out information about people they meet in public. Nguyen and Ardayfio address people who appear to be strangers by name, discuss their work and bring up a place where they may have met in the past, based on information gleaned through the facial recognition setup. Are we ready for a world where our data is exposed at a glance? @CaineArdayfio and I offer an answer to protect yourself here:https://t.co/LhxModhDpk pic.twitter.com/Oo35TxBNtD‚Äî AnhPhu Nguyen (@AnhPhuNguyen1) September 30, 2024 In the video, it's explained that the students stream video from the glasses to Instagram. The stream is monitored by a computer program. Once AI detects someone's face, their I-XRAY system pulls more photos of that person from the web along with public information about them. The program then feeds those details back to a mobile app that Nguyen and Ardayfio built. It can take just a couple of minutes for this process to play out. The students told 404 Media that they developed I-XRAY to make people aware of what's possible with this technology and they won't release the code that they used. Nguyen said that while some of the people they showed the tech to suggested they might use it to network or prank friends, others pointed out some serious safety concerns. ‚ÄúSome dude could just find some girl‚Äôs home address on the train and just follow them home,\" Nguyen pointed out. In a Google Doc that explains some of the tech behind their system, Nguyen and Ardayfio provide resources detailing how to remove your information from the services that they used for I-XRAY. Those concerned about their privacy may also want to consider using personal information removal services such as DeleteMe or Incogni. This kind of technology isn't inherently new ‚Äî 404 Media points out that Meta and Google have had the ability to apply facial recognition to a camera feed for years, but didn't release it publicly. But the ability to use it in off-the-shelf smart glasses that appear relatively innocuous (save for a light that is active when the camera is recording) may give cause for concern. When asked for comment, Meta referred Engadget to this section of its terms of service regarding Facebook View, an accompanying app for the smart glasses: Your responsibility for your use of Facebook View.

    "description": "A new joint venture between Serve Robotics sidewalk delivery robots and Alphabet‚Äôs Wing flying drone service will do a dual test run. Both tech companies hope that flying and sidewalk drones can cover areas its counterpart can‚Äôt and speed up delivery times. TechCrunch reported that Serve Robotics and Wing will start making deliveries in Dallas sometime in the coming months. The test will include a select number of customer orders being delivered by a combination of sidewalk robots and flying drones. One of the biggest challenges for drone delivery is coverage. Flying drones can only travel a certain distance away from its headquarters. Sidewalk drones can find it hard to navigate densely populated areas and certain rocky terrains. Drone companies often have to upgrade their facilities to meet these distances and obstacles. Wing Serve Robotics and Wing‚Äôs idea is to use both types of robots for delivering orders to cover areas traditional delivery services cannot. A road-based Serve bot picks up the order from a restaurant and carts the food to an ‚ÄúAutoLoader‚Äù where the Wing drone, a flying drone that can carry five pounds and fly at speeds up to 65 mph, picks up the order and completes the delivery. It‚Äôs not known which restaurants or merchants will be part of the test, the areas in Dallas where the drones will deliver orders and any post-test plans for the new drone delivery fleet. Serve Robotics already makes deliveries for 300 restaurants in Los Angeles. Wing also works with Walmart in Dallas and participated in a pilot program with DoorDash and Wendy‚Äôs in Virginia. Correction, October 2 2024, 1:00PM ET: This story originally stated that Serve Robotics was an Uber company. Originally, Serve Robotics was part of Uber but was spun out into an independent company several years ago.

    "description": "Garmin has just announced its Lily 2 Active smartwatch, which is currently the company‚Äôs smallest model with built-in GPS functionality. It boasts nine days of battery life when used without GPS and nine hours with GPS mode on. This sleek metal watch has two buttons and a display that activates with a tap or wrist turn. The buttons are used to select activities or switch screens. As with many smartwatches out right now, the Lily 2 Active can also gather information on your last night‚Äôs sleep and grant insights on improving sleep quality. The sleep function also records heart rate, sleep stages, stress and respiration, among other factors useful for calculating your sleep score. You can also use Body Battery monitoring to check your energy levels. For those who like to follow workout videos or routines, you can download workouts for strength, yoga sessions and high intensity interval training (HIIT). You can view these workouts on the watch screen to ensure you follow the planned workout correctly. One final feature that impressed us was the morning report. The Lily 2 Active can provide all of the information above in the morning, as well as ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs health tracking‚Äù information. For example, users can use the smartwatch to track their menstrual cycles and pregnancies. The Lily 2 Active is compatible with the Garmin Connect smartphone app on iOS and Android. The app lets you check data collected by the watch, and you can even challenge friends who have Garmin products. We didn‚Äôt forget to mention the colors. The Lily 2 Active smartwatch is available in two color schemes: Lunar Gold and Bone or Silver and Purple Jasmine. Those interested can purchase it now for $300.

    "description": "Did you think Amazon Fire tablets were exempt from generative AI tools? Think again. The company just announced a spate of AI-centric features that are rolling out to the just-announced Fire HD 8 refresh and a bunch of older models. None of these features are too surprising, but they seem useful and fun. There‚Äôs something called Writing Assist, which is exactly what it sounds like. This tool integrates with the on-screen keyboard and should be compatible with any app on the tablet. It provides grammar assistance and will transform copy into a number of pre-set styles. This is a quick way to turn ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up with my paycheck‚Äù into something a bit more professional. The appropriately-named Webpage Summaries offers up automatic summaries of websites. This tool will ‚Äúdistill the key points in an article or on a web page‚Äù to give concise summaries. Amazon says it will catch readers up to speed ‚Äúin a matter of seconds.‚Äù This kind of thing is generative AI 101, as there are plenty of pre-existing tools that mimic this functionality. Still, it‚Äôs nice to have it native on Amazon tablets. Amazon Finally, there‚Äôs Wallpaper Creator, which brings a chat prompt into the mix. Just type in what kind of background you want and let the power-hungry magic of AI do the work. Amazon says users can ‚Äúchoose from one of the curated prompts‚Äù or let their ‚Äúimagination run wild.‚Äù The company says the algorithm will create ‚Äúunique, high-resolution‚Äù images that can be used as a tablet‚Äôs wallpaper. All of these features will be available for the just-revealed Fire HD 8 refresh, but Amazon says they are also coming to other ‚Äúcompatible Fire tablets later this month.‚Äù As for compatibility, Writing Assist and Wallpaper Creator are coming to tablets released since 2022. Webpage Summaries goes a bit further back to Fire HD 10 and Fire HD 8 tablets from 2018 and newer.¬† This isn‚Äôt Amazon‚Äôs only dip into the exciting world of artificial intelligence. The company recently unleashed a shopping-focused chatbot and is working on another chatbot which has been codenamed Metis. It has also been reported that Alexa will soon be getting an AI-centric makeover, powered by Claude AI.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-tablets-are-getting-ai-tools-like-writing-assist-and-automatic-website-summaries-164809318.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Amazon updated its Fire HD 8 lineup on Wednesday. The 2024 version of the budget tablet has more RAM, a better rear camera and some built-in AI. The device, which will usually start at $100 (with lock-screen ads), is already on sale for October Prime Day. As its name suggests, the new Fire HD 8 has an 8-inch display with a 1280 x 800 resolution (189 ppi). One of the 2024 model‚Äôs big upgrades is 3GB of RAM in the base storage tier (32B). Meanwhile, the 64GB variant slides up to 4GB of RAM. Of course, this is a budget tablet, so those aren‚Äôt close to barrier-breaking numbers. But that‚Äôs still 50 to 100 percent higher than the 2GB of RAM in the 2022 model. Amazon rates the Fire HD 8 for up to 13 hours of battery life. The tablet‚Äôs rear camera is 5MP. (That‚Äôs the same as the ‚ÄúPlus‚Äù version of its 2022 predecessor, but it‚Äôs higher than the 2MP in the old standard version.) The tablets will include some generative AI capabilities. Like Apple‚Äôs early take on AI in its 2024 updates, these include a Writing Assist feature that can jot out messages based on prompts. It can also summarize web pages, make grammar suggestions and tweak brevity. There will also be two kids‚Äô versions of the tablet: the Fire HD 8 Kids and Fire HD 8 Kids Pro. As you‚Äôd expect from Amazon‚Äôs child-focused variants, these versions will include a ‚Äúkid-proof‚Äù case in Disney-branded designs (including Pixar Cars, Disney Princess or Marvel Avengers). They also come with a subscription to Amazon Kids+, the company‚Äôs content delivery service (including mobile games!) for the kiddos. The Fire HD 8 is available now from Amazon, starting at $55 for Prime Day (usually $100). The Fire HD 8 Kids tablet will typically start at $140 but is on sale for $70 for Prime Day.

    "description": "October Prime Day is nearly here, but you can already save on some tech, including a few of Amazon's own devices. Its most powerful streaming stick, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max, has dropped to a record low of $35. That's 42 percent off and a return to the discounted price we saw during July Prime Day. This is part of a larger sale on Fire TV sticks and streaming boxes. The popular Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite is available for just $18, too. Incidentally, this model made our list of the best streaming devices, due to its low price and robust suite of features. But the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is a great streaming device as well, with support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+. As the name suggests, it can stream content in 4K Ultra HD. The stick also supports Dolby Atmos audio, for added immersion. This streaming stick includes the company‚Äôs proprietary Fire TV Ambient Experience, which allows users to display art and photos on the screen. This mimics the functionality of something like Samsung‚Äôs The Frame TV. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max also boasts 16GB of storage, for downloads, apps and games. Speaking of games, this thing doubles as a highly functional cloud gaming box. It can stream Xbox games via Game Pass Ultimate and integrates with Amazon Luna. We singled out this device as a great option for retro gamers, as it can easily run many emulation apps. Finally, it ships with an upgraded remote that offers Alexa integration.

    "description": "Google is expanding Gmail‚Äôs summary cards, the service‚Äôs AI-driven contextual snippets extracted for things like incoming packages. Starting today, they‚Äôll include cards for purchases, events, bills and travel. In addition, a new Happening Soon section will live at the top of your inbox, showing upcoming time-sensitive cards. The company says it‚Äôs making the changes because ‚Äúemail habits have continued to evolve.‚Äù The new Happening Soon section will deliver ‚Äútimely‚Äù summary cards at the top of your inbox. For example, when you open Gmail, you might see a card showing that an order you placed last week is out for delivery today. Google says all its summary cards are dynamic and updated in real time. Gmail‚Äôs Happening Soon section will remind you about time-sensitive cards.Google Where appropriate, summary cards will also include action buttons. Google describes action buttons‚Äô appeal as ‚Äúno more digging for buried links.‚Äù Purchase summary cards will let you track packages, view order details and keep tabs on online orders. Event cards will let you view your upcoming events, invite friends or get directions to the venue. Bill summaries will let you see or pay them (or set reminders to pay them in Google Tasks). Finally, Travel summary cards will let you manage reservations, check in for flights and see details like hotel check-in and check-out times. Google‚Äôs release schedule for the new features is a bit complicated. Purchase summary cards for individual emails start rolling out ‚Äúgradually‚Äù beginning today (although some users already reported seeing them earlier this week) on Android and iOS. Cards for the other categories for individual emails and the Happening Soon section will arrive ‚Äúin the coming months.‚Äù And the four card categories showing everywhere (individual emails, Gmail search and Happening Soon) will come ‚Äúin the future.‚Äù So, you‚Äôll need to hang tight before you can try Google‚Äôs full summary card experience.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-is-making-gmail-summaries-more-useful-and-adding-a-happening-soon-tab-160026564.html?src=rss",

    "description": "We typically see some Amazon devices, including Blink cameras, drop in price ahead of both Prime Days in July and October. This time around, Prime members have an exclusive deal available to them right now on a bundle that includes the Echo Show 5 smart display and a Blink Outdoor 4 camera system for only $60. That's a whopping $130 off the standard price and a record low. It's part of a larger early Prime Day sale on Blink devices, including multi-camera systems, video doorbells and more. This bundle is one that makes a lot of sense. You'll be able to use your Echo Show 5 to get a live view of whatever the Blink Outdoor 4 camera is capturing with a simple Alexa command. We recommend both products individually in our guides. We believe the Blink Outdoor 4 is the best wireless security camera around. The name is a bit of a misnomer as you can easily place it inside your home too, not least because it runs on two AA batteries. You'll only need to replace the cells every two years or so. If you do place the camera outside, you can rest easy knowing that it's weather resistant. Other features include night vision, motion detection and two-way audio. You will need a Blink Subscription Plan to store clips in the cloud. Otherwise, you can save footage locally with a Sync Module 2 (which is available separately) and USB flash drive. As for the Echo Show 5, it's one of the best smart displays with Amazon Alexa (only beaten out by its larger sibling, the Echo Show 8). It's a compact, 5.5-inch smart display that works well as an alarm clock on your nightstand. The tap-to-snooze function comes in handy there, while there's a sunrise alarm that gradually brightens the screen. The Echo Show 5 does have a built-in camera, which might give you cause for concern if you want to place it by your bed. But the physical camera cover should sate any privacy concerns on that front.

    "title": "Polestar 3 first drive: The long-awaited SUV is finally here, and it's good",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/polestar-3-first-drive-the-long-awaited-suv-is-finally-here-and-its-good-154552543.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Few brands have needed a car as badly as Polestar needs the Polestar 3. The Polestar 1 was cool in a wholly irrational and impractical way, more of a statement of intent than a viable product. The Polestar 2 was a much more serious market proposition and a legitimately great car. But a tall, sporty sedan was never going to be more than a niche contender. It certainly wasn‚Äôt something to build a brand upon. The Polestar 3 was meant to be the thing that would really open doors ‚Äî a mass-market machine to fill the needs and wants of buyers looking for an all-electric SUV with proper dimensions, avant-garde styling and bright yellow seatbelts. But it was supposed to be here in 2023. Now, as the clock starts to wind down on 2024, it's finally arriving at dealerships. The good news is that it's great. But is it great enough? The Polestar 3 can be cynically thought of as the five-passenger flavor of Volvo's three-row EX90. The EX90 has likewise had a troubled gestation. It‚Äôs almost a fraternal twin to the Polestar, similarly tangled up in a mire of software delays, then further complicated by an evolving set of international tariffs targeting Chinese-built EVs. Tim Stevens for Engadget The Polestar 3 shares the same platform, motors, basic layout and technology as the Volvo. Its specs are, therefore, quite similar: The EX90 makes 402 horsepower and 568 foot-pounds of torque on the base model, stepping up to 510 hp and 671 lb-ft of torque in the Twin Motor Performance trim.The Polestar 3, meanwhile, makes 489 hp and 620 lb-ft in the base, Long Range Dual Motor version, or 517 hp and 671 lb-ft when you add on the Performance Pack. While the Polestar 3's base has considerably more shove, on the top-shelf flavor, they're basically neck-and-neck. The pricing is significantly different, though. Where the EX90 starts at $79,995 for a base Plus and goes up to $84,345 for the Plus trim with the Performance option, the Polestar 3 starts at $73,400 for the base Long range Dual motor model. When you factor in the Performance pack, that brings the starting price up to $79,400. You can also add on a few upgrades, including the Plus pack with a Dolby Atmos sound system from Bowers \u0026 Wilkins for $5,000. I drove both models, starting with a non-Performance Launch Edition, which includes the Pilot and Plus options packages, all the active safety goodies and many other lifestyle features. Add on $2,300 for 22-inch wheels, and that SUV came to $82,800 after a $1,400 destination charge. The Performance model that I drove had yet more options, including $1,300 for the metallic Thunder paint (an evocative name for dark gray). With a whopping $5,500 for the ventilated Nappa leather, the price goes up to $93,100 after the $1,400 destination charge. Why the price difference for basically the same car as the Volvo? The primary difference is the Luminar Lidar pod on the roof of every EX90. That'll be an option on the Polestar 3 for those who really want to spend $5,000 more. Its absence makes for a considerable cost reduction despite having no loss in immediate functionality. On the Volvo, that sensor won't even be switched on until sometime next year, and who knows when it'll actually start feeding into the safety system. Even without the Lidar, the Polestar 3 has a comprehensive set of sensors, including a 360-degree camera, ultrasonic sensors for parking and even active driver monitoring. The Pilot package, which comes standard, does a nice job of keeping the vehicle centered on roads of all sorts. It also includes active driver monitoring to ensure you stay focused on the road ahead and not the beauty of the Grand Tetons, which often distracted me on my day behind the wheel of this new SUV. Polestar The in-car experience is dominated by a 14.5-inch portrait touchscreen in the middle of the dash. The look and feel is quite similar to the current Polestar experience but with refreshed visuals and more comprehensive functionality. Thanks to Android Automotive, you have things like Google Maps, YouTube Music and Google Assistant baked right into the car. For the Android faithful, this is a boon. One sign-in means you have everything from your address book to your guilty pleasure music playlists at your fingertips, even if you forgot your phone in your office. The UI refinements are subtle but welcome, making it easier to get to common controls, like increasing brake regen or cycling the heated and ventilated seats. There's also a small gauge cluster behind the wheel, which has a few different views, and thankfully now includes a proper navigation view. If that's not enough, a heads-up display is standard on the launch edition. That's, again, all quite similar to the EX90. The most significant difference between the two is the look. While the Volvo has a clean and fresh exterior, which is a robust new face for the brand, its stately air won't resonate with everybody. The Polestar 3 is much more aggressive, from the cheeky wing on the hood to the pronounced fenders at the rear. Despite being roughly the same size, it looks far more svelte and offers a fair bit more character than the Volvo. The Polestar 3 also feels much roomier inside. That's the benefit of shifting from three rows to two. Obviously, it won't do you much good if you need to haul more than five people, but if your shuttling duties are less demanding, the Polestar 3 offers more commodious seating. It's also slightly more engaging to drive. While the throttle curve is surprisingly relaxed, requiring a deep application of the go pedal to get the car going, once you get in there the SUV leaps forward. The steering is wonderfully sharp, if a bit numb, paired with engaging handling for a machine of this stature. Polestar I have to say, though, that I didn't find the extra horsepower and torque of the Performance model particularly compelling. It definitely accelerates more quickly, but both models run out of steam at higher speeds, surging forward and then falling a bit flat. It was quick and fun when zipping through traffic though, or making the most of short passing zones. The Polestar 3 is just as good at cruising calmly. It's quiet and smooth at speed, providing a great sound stage for the optional 25-speaker, 1,610-watt Bowers \u0026 Wilkins sound system with Dolby Atmos. The front seats are supportive yet comfortable. Heating and ventilation are great, and the ability to enable both simultaneously is a rare treat, giving a bit more intensity to the warmth. The heated steering wheel is also quite toasty, but annoyingly, it is not a standard feature. It's part of the Plus pack. Thankfully, a heat pump is standard fare, something that should help this SUV deliver better range in cold weather. In ideal conditions, the Polestar 3 will do up to 315 miles on a charge, per the EPA, out of its 111-kilowatt-hour (107 usable) battery. Like on my first drive of the EX90, I did experience a few software glitches here. Early on in the drive, the Polestar 3 said it could not detect my hands despite them definitely being on the steering wheel. Thankfully, that issue righted itself quickly, but later in the day we got another, more troubling warning: \"Driver support system fault. Book a service.\" That alert, too, disappeared a moment later. As with the Volvo, I'm sure these issues will be fixed in short order. They'd better be, at least, because the first Polestar 3 SUVs are hitting dealerships any day now. The first shipment was built in China, but future models will come from Volvo's factory near Charleston, South Carolina, where they'll share a line with the EX90. Which is the better of the two SUVs? It really comes down to how many seats you need and whether you're willing to spend more for a Lidar sensor that might, someday, provide more advanced driver assistance functionality. Both models are shaping up to be solid SUVs, and that's excellent news for Polestar. It desperately needed this car to be great, and minus those few software glitches, it is.

    "description": "In 2017, Amazon launched the Echo Spot only to discontinue it two years later. This year, Amazon brought it back with new features and a fresh look. The 2024 edition is also $50 cheaper than its predecessor. But that $80 price tag is cut even more in a sale ahead of Prime Day. Right now, you can get the Amazon Echo Spot for just $45 ‚Äî a 44 percent discount. You can also opt for a bundle and get a TP-Link Tapo Smart Color Bulb with it for the same price.¬† The new Amazon Echo Spot forgoes the circular speaker of the original and instead offers a split look: the top half screen and the bottom half speaker. Amazon bills it as having improved sound and display quality. Otherwise, it has all the same basic features, like Alexa integration, music streaming, and displaying the weather forecast. If you were put off from getting an Echo Spot in the past due to the inclusion of a camera (it does feel a bit weird for a bedside device), then you're in luck.

    "description": "This February, NVIDIA released a one-stop graphical adjustments app in beta, succinctly named the NVIDIA App. The app isn‚Äôt a direct replacement for the existing GeForce Experience app since it also lets you install other NVIDIA apps like GeForce NOW (cloud gaming) and NVIDIA Broadcast (improved streaming experience), which GeForce Experience isn‚Äôt capable of. However, the latest NVIDIA App updates are slowly attempting to combine the two experiences into one, as the company announced today. For most gamers with NVIDIA GPUs, GeForce Experience is the most common option for adjusting game graphical settings, updating drivers, and some other quick settings. The new NVIDIA App can do all of that and more, such as activating AI-powered ray-tracing filters for supported games. It also features a new in-game overlay, among other features. One of the additions in today‚Äôs update is RTX HDR multi-monitor support. Those who own multiple HDR-certified monitors can now enable HDR on them simultaneously. You can also now configure G-Sync with the NVIDIA App, something you previously could only do with the NVIDIA Control Panel, which can be confusing to navigate to some people. Most importantly, NVIDIA is now working hard to integrate more Control Panel features into the NVIDIA app. Once the app exits beta around the end of the year, the company plans to migrate all GeForce Experience users to the new app. For now, users are highly encouraged to provide feedback.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-nvidia-app-currently-in-beta-will-replace-geforce-experience-soon-152853070.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Nintendo hates discounting its first-party games when they are five years old, let alone five days old. Woot is selling the just-released The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom for $52, which certainly breaks from tradition. This is a discount of $8 or 13 percent. It‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll find anything lower until the game starts showing up in used bins. This is a physical copy of the new Zelda game that we called ‚Äúboth familiar and fresh‚Äù in our official review. It‚Äôs familiar because this is a top-down adventure that calls to mind The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, among others. It‚Äôs fresh because of, well, everything else. This is the first game in the franchise that lets you control the titular princess (no I‚Äôm not counting the ancient Philips CD-i title.) This isn‚Äôt just a skin swap. Zelda is a completely different hero, with a unique moveset that changes just about every aspect of gameplay. Where Link is a standard sword-wielding warrior, Zelda is a mage/summoner. She can summon (literally) hundreds of items, including nearly every monster in the game. This means you can roll into battle flanked by an army of bloodthirsty Moblins, though lately I‚Äôve been going with crows. These monsters typically have a secondary use for puzzle solving and traversal, which is an absolute blast. There‚Äôs also a whole lot of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom in this game‚Äôs DNA. It looks like an old-school Zelda game, but kind of plays like a new one. There are traditional dungeons, which is great, but there‚Äôs no pressure to complete them. I‚Äôve only done one and I‚Äôve put in like 15 hours so far. Instead, I‚Äôm using wild and wacky mechanics to explore every nook and cranny of the (surprisingly) huge map, on the hunt for secrets and new summons. There‚Äôs only one downside that most reviews have touched on. There are a lot of summons in this game, which are called echoes. Picking and choosing from over a hundred monsters and objects can require some cumbersome menu navigation. As for this sale, Woot is only allowing one copy per customer, with a shipment date of October 11.

    "description": "Meta is consolidating its three creator monetization programs for Facebook to make it easier for users to start earning on the social network. The company has three ways for creators to earn on the website: Via In-stream ads, Ads on Reels and Performance bonuses. Each one has a different eligibility requirement and sign-up process. The new Facebook Content Monetization program will simplify things for creators who want to earn on the website, since they'll only need to apply and go through the onboarding process once.¬† In its announcement, Meta said it paid creators more than $2 billion for their Reels, videos, photos and text posts over the past year. However, it also said that creators aren't able to maximize what they could make on the platform, and only one-third of them earn from more than one of its programs. The consolidated scheme will work just like its older programs in that it has a performance-based payout model. Monetized users can still earn from the ads in their reels, longer videos, photos and text posts. Meta will give them access to a new Insights tab, though, which shows how much money they're making on different content formats. They can also see which videos and posts are making the most money. Previously, the company had separate insights tabs for each program.¬† The new monetization feature is still in beta mode and will be until next year. This week, Meta will start inviting 1 million creators already earning on the social network to take part in its beta testing, but it will continue sending invites to more people in the coming months. Creators don't have to take part in the test if they don't want to, but if they do, they can't rejoin Facebook's standalone monetization schemes. Those who don't get an invitation anytime soon but want to join the new program can express their interest through Facebook's official content monetization page.¬† Facebook This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-wants-to-make-it-easy-for-creators-to-earn-on-facebook-150037046.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (2024) review: A more affordable ANC ace",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-2024-review-a-more-affordable-anc-ace-150018195.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Believe it or not, Bose hasn‚Äôt been in the noise-canceling earbuds game very long. The company‚Äôs first ANC model arrived in late 2020, with two more to follow in 2022 and 2023. It successfully brought its powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) tech to the true wireless form factor from the jump, but has further improved with each new version. And perhaps the company‚Äôs greatest earbud triumph thus far was the debut of Immersive Audio last year: spatial audio that doesn‚Äôt need specially created content to be enjoyed. While other companies have been keen to offer multiple models at varying prices, Bose stuck to flagship-quality wares at premium prices. All three of its noise-canceling earbud models are priced around $300. So, while its competitors have created wireless earbuds that nail the basics for less money, but pack fewer premium features overall, Bose has stayed the course. Now, though, Bose is taking a shot at the mid-range market. The company revealed the QuietComfort Earbuds ($179) earlier this month, finally giving consumers a second option in its lineup. Bose‚Äôs ANC is onboard, with longer battery life than 2022‚Äôs QuietComfort Earbuds II and a new app with features that are unique to this new model. Has the company successfully managed to scale down its flagship formula or will these earbuds leave you pining for more? Design The first thing that struck me about the new QuietComfort Earbuds is their smaller size. It wasn‚Äôt clear from the marketing materials that this model was more compact than the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, which have a similar design to the QC Earbuds II. Bose has never been shy about bigger buds, and the size hasn‚Äôt been a problem. But, with the industry continuously trending smaller, it's nice to see the company take an opportunity to shave off some excess. The overall shape is more akin to Bose‚Äôs early (non-ANC) true wireless models than its recent ones. The oval-shaped stem isn‚Äôt here, as the circular exterior of the IPX4-rated QC Earbuds accept your taps and presses instead. The company is still using its so-called stability bands to help secure the fit, and there are three sizes of those to accompany the three ear tip options. During my tests, I never had an issue with the earbuds staying in place. Plus, the smaller size makes them more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. Bose went with a more common shape for the charging case this time. It‚Äôs larger than the one that came with the QuietComfort Ultra Open Earbuds, but about the same size as that of the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds ‚Äì even though the shapes are quite different. For this new model, the case is lighter with a relatively thin lid, although I never felt like the buds weren‚Äôt adequately protected. Features For a while now, all of the features and settings for Bose‚Äôs earbuds and headphones were accessible in the Bose app. For the QuietComfort Earbuds though, the company specifically designed the Bose QCE App, and said that it will be the only Bose product that uses it. Bose explained that this model uses different hardware and firmware to its previous earbuds (and other products), so it needed a new app to bring the QuietComfort Earbuds to market as soon as possible. While the overall look is similar to the other Bose app, the layout and interactivity is different. And that‚Äôs not a bad thing. For example, you get access to a lot more features on the main screen rather than having to dig into a more detailed settings menu. Pretty much anything you would need is right there, including advanced options like Voice Control, Low Latency Audio, Smart Calls and Battery Prediction. When you tap on a feature, a card pops up with the appropriate settings. I think it‚Äôs a cleaner implementation that helps you get to what you need a lot faster. Voice Control allows you to handle media playback, volume, ANC mode, calls and more with a ‚ÄúHey Headphones‚Ä¶‚Äù command. It‚Äôs not something I felt like using all the time, but it was nice to have when my hands were full. Plus, this is the only model in the Bose lineup to offer it at this time. The QC Earbuds support multipoint Bluetooth, which isn‚Äôt always a standard feature on Bose devices. There‚Äôs also a new Remote Selfie tool that lets you trigger your camera app with either of those Voice Controls or a tap on the earbuds. Low Latency Audio mode is here for gaming and there‚Äôs the option of assigning an onboard tap for a Fast Mute during calls. Of course, this main screen also shows standard settings: Battery percentages for each earbud, ANC modes, EQ and the ability to remap the touch controls. Sound quality Billy Steele for Engadget To me, Bose‚Äôs stock tuning has always been good, but not great. I typically notice a prevalence of treble and bass, with some lost fidelity in the mid range. For that reason, the company has lagged behind the likes of Sony and Sennhesier in terms of overall sound quality. But that changed on the QC Ultra Earbuds when Bose finally flexed its muscle with more robust, enveloping audio tuning. On the QuietComfort Earbuds, there‚Äôs still an emphasis on punchy highs and snappy bass. It creates a pleasant foundation, and there‚Äôs plenty of crisp, clean detail in the tone. However, I‚Äôd like a little more mids, which thankfully I can get with the Custom EQ settings that provides a 5-band sliding to tweak as you desire. With that active, I can hear more detail in the guitars on Balance and Composure‚Äôs ‚ÄúWith You In Spirit,‚Äù an alt-rock track with some crunchy riffs and layered interaction between those instruments. You get a great feel for the low-end thump the QC Earbuds can muster on Justice‚Äôs Hyperdrama. Songs like ‚ÄúOne Night/All Night‚Äù that have a driving, dance-y bass line thick with textured synths allow these buds to flex their bass chops. Something less intense, like Wyatt Flores‚Äô ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Wanna Say Goodnight‚Äù showcases the nuances in the sound from the acoustic guitar, fiddle and even the drums. You‚Äôll notice that I didn‚Äôt mention Immersive Audio, Bose‚Äôs take on spatial audio that debuted on the QC Ultra Earbuds and Headphones. Instead of relying on specially tracked content, the company uses software to do the heavy lifting. Immersive Audio isn‚Äôt available on the QuietComfort Earbuds right now, but the company‚Äôs website lists it as ‚Äúcoming soon.‚Äù For now, I‚Äôm only evaluating these earbuds on what they currently offer, but the addition of Immersive Audio could be significant in terms of overall sonic performance. ANC performance Billy Steele for Engadget Bose likes to throw around words like ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù and ‚Äúrenowned‚Äù when describing its ANC‚Äôs effectiveness. And rightfully so. The company has been among the best when it comes to blocking environmental noise for years. The QuietComfort Earbuds line has offered some of the best options for silencing distractions since its inception in 2020, culminating with the QC Ultra Earbuds that debuted last year. So, with its most affordable option yet, it would be understandable if Bose backed off a bit on the ANC performance. Thankfully, that‚Äôs not the case. I was pleasantly surprised at what Bose offers in a $179 set of earbuds. You‚Äôll have no problem combating low-to-mid-range noise sources, like fans and white noise machines, and the QC Earbuds even do a decent job with human voices. They won‚Äôt completely silence a chatty neighbor, but they will reduce the distraction even with no audio playing. And sure, you‚Äôll find more-robust ANC on the pricier Ultra model, but for most, this set will block what you need it to, and cost less doing it. Transparency mode, or Aware, sounds pleasantly natural, although you won‚Äôt hear your own voice as clearly unless you have Side Tones enabled. This provides adjustable voice amplification for calls and in-game chats, but isn‚Äôt applied universally when Aware mode is active. And even then, it‚Äôs not as good as Apple‚Äôs AirPods Pro, which are the best when it comes to ambient sound. Battery life Bose promises up to 8.5 hours of use with ANC on with two and a half charges in the case. A quick-charge feature gives you three hours of playback in 20 minutes. Unlike other recent models, Bose built wireless charging into the QuietComfort Earbuds case, which means you won‚Äôt have to buy an additional cover for that. During my tests with ANC enabled and the volume at a comfortable 60-70 percent, I still had 12 percent battery left after the stated 8.5 hours. There were a few times I used transparency mode for calls and chats, but otherwise it was all ANC, all the time. According to the app‚Äôs Battery Prediction feature, 12 percent would‚Äôve been good enough for another 45 minutes. I should note that Battery Prediction shouldn‚Äôt be solely relied on for an indication of how much time you have left. The number is calculated based on the current use conditions when you ask for the figure. For example, if you tap it as soon as you put the QC Earbuds in and haven‚Äôt activated ANC, it will tell you there‚Äôs over 12 hours remaining. That‚Äôs not really achievable under normal use, not to mention if you‚Äôve got active noise cancellation turned on. Call quality Billy Steele for Engadget For wireless earbuds, call quality can be really hit or miss. Companies either nail it with something that blocks a ton of background noise and keeps you sounding decent, or you end up with speakerphone-quality, fuzzy voice performance. Most of the time, earbuds land somewhere in the middle. Call quality wasn‚Äôt the absolute best on the QC Ultra Earbuds during my review, but it was solid enough to get the job done and handled background noise well. On the QuietComfort Earbuds, that wasn‚Äôt the case. My voice sounded slightly muffled during calls ‚Äì somewhat clear, but far from pristine. The earbuds also managed to diminish the sound of a loud fan when I wasn‚Äôt speaking, but it got slightly louder when I began to talk. If you‚Äôre making a ton of calls with your earbuds, these might not be the best option for you. However, if you‚Äôre only planning to use them occasionally, and not for important meetings, you‚Äôll probably be fine. The competition My pick for best wireless earbuds, Sony‚Äôs WF-1000XM5, is significantly more expensive than the QC Earbuds at nearly $300. Typically, when they go on sale, you‚Äôre looking at $248, although my deal-seeking colleagues have seen them as low as $228. So, even in the best-case scenario, you‚Äôre looking at an extra $50 over the QuietComfort Earbuds. For this reason, Sony‚Äôs LinkBuds S and Sennheiser‚Äôs Accentum True Wireless are more apt comparisons. The LinkBuds S carry a lot of the same features from the 1000XM5 earbuds, including the overall design. You‚Äôll still get Speak-to-Chat conversation awareness and Adaptive Sound Control that automatically adjusts settings based on activity or location ‚Äì among other tools. Battery life is shorter at six hours, but the LinkBuds S are still rated IPX4 so they should be fine for workouts. Sennheiser‚Äôs Accentum True Wireless serve the same purpose in the company‚Äôs lineup as the new QuietComfort Earbuds do for Bose. The Accentum model offers some of the attractive features of the pricier Momentum True Wireless 4 at a lower price. The key advantage here is better sound quality, which I‚Äôve found Sennehsier to be reliably churning out with each new set. You‚Äôll also get decent ANC, but not as good as the QC Earbuds, and 8-hour battery life. Wrap-up Bose has cracked the code for a compelling set of earbuds with its best features at a lower price. Effective ANC, great sound quality, extended battery life and loads of other handy tools are all here, including some you won‚Äôt find on the company‚Äôs other models. Sure, the noise cancellation, call quality and audio performance are better on the pricier QuietComfort Ultra, but there‚Äôs a lot to like here for $179. If Bose can quickly deliver Immersive Audio, the new QuietComfort Earbuds might become an even more compelling option.

    "description": "If you're on the hunt for a new ereader, early Prime Day deals might have just what you're looking for. The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Essentials bundle is down to $203 right now, which is $55 off and the best price we've seen all year. It includes Amazon's higher-end ereader with 32GB of storage along with a fabric cover and its own wireless charging stand, so you'll have an attractive and dedicated spot to place the ereader for charging when you're not using it. The Kindle Paperweight Signature Edition launched in 2021 and we called it \"The best e-reader. Period.\" While other e-readers have come into the picture, it's still a great option ‚Äî especially for Prime members. We gave it a 97 in our review thanks to features like a larger, more responsive screen and smaller bezels. The combination of the two gives this device an extra lux feel compared to alternatives. This edition also includes 17 individual LEDs, up from the five in its predecessor. The lights let you adjust the warm hue, similar to Apple's Night Shift. It also has some logistical benefits like USB-C charging and wireless charging ‚Äî with the e-reader lasting up to ten weeks on just one charge. The addition of the fabric case and wireless charging dock make it easy to keep your Kindle juiced up and damage free for only $13 more than buying the Paperwhite Signature Edition on its own.¬† Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice in the lead up to October Prime Day 2024.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-kindle-paperwhite-signature-essentials-bundle-drops-to-its-lowest-price-of-the-year-ahead-of-prime-day-141717270.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Palworld could be on its way to a mobile device near you. Krafton, the publisher of PUBG: Battlegrounds, has agreed a licensing deal with the game‚Äôs maker, Pocketpair, to bring the smash hit to mobile. Krafton‚Äôs PUBG Studios will develop the mobile version. No other details have been announced, other than to note that PUBG Studios will ‚Äúreinterpret‚Äù Palworld‚Äôs gameplay for mobile devices, per an automated translation of a press release (which is in Korean). So it‚Äôs not completely clear whether this will be a faithful port of the full game or a spinoff that has some of the same features. Palworld debuted in January and it was an instant hit, selling over a million copies in eight hours and 15 million on Steam alone within a month. It also quickly reached 10 million players on Xbox and was biggest ever third-party launch on Game Pass. Palworld then suddenly landed on PlayStation 5 in many markets last week. However, there‚Äôs a reason that Palworld isn‚Äôt available on PS5 in Japan for now. The game‚Äôs similarity to Pok√©mon (here, you also catch a variety of monsters, but some of ‚Äòem have guns and you can also eat them) caught the attention of Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company. The latter indicated in January that it was investigating the would-be rival. In September, the two companies filed suit against Pocketpair in Japan for alleged patent infringement.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/palworld-is-bound-for-mobile-thanks-to-the-maker-of-pubg-141104110.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Ring is rebranding its subscription products, ditching Ring Protect in favor of Ring Home, and to celebrate it‚Äôs bringing some new features along. The most notable change is the addition of 24/7 recording if you own select wired video doorbells, ensuring you don‚Äôt miss anything if a motion alert wasn‚Äôt triggered. You‚Äôll also get video clip previews sent through push notifications, rather than having to wait for the app to open. In addition, users can now get Extended and Continuous Live View options for their cameras, letting them keep an eye on what‚Äôs going on when they need it. Extended Live View, for instance, will up the time limit on watching a camera from 10 minutes to 30, while Continuous removes the limit altogether. You‚Äôll also get Doorbell Calls, which triggers a phone call that‚Äôll connect straight to your smartphone when someone‚Äôs at the door. The prices for each of the new Ring Home tiers will remain the same as their Ring Protect predecessors, at last for now. Home Basic is $4.99 a month, while Home Standard is $9.99/month, and Home Premium is $19.99/month. Unsurprisingly, Extended Live View and Doorbell Calls are available at the Standard tier, while the Continuous Live View and 24/7 recording are unlocked at the Premium level.¬† As for why the tiers were changed, it's to enable users to bolt-on additional packages from Ring's growing ecosystem of security products. It says that, when the change kicks in on November 5th, you'll be able to add Virtual Security Guard and Alarm Professional Monitoring to the same plan.¬†This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ring-brings-247-recording-to-some-of-its-wired-cameras-130003545.html?src=rss",

    "title": "The USB-C Apple Pencil is cheaper than ever in this early Prime Day deal",

    "description": "October Prime Day is just around the corner and we're already starting to see record-low prices return on some of our favorite gadgets. One such deal is on the USB-C Apple Pencil, which is $10 off and down to an all-time low of $69. While not a huge discount, it does represent a savings of 13 percent, and it is currently the most affordable Apple Pencil you can buy. Apple debuted this model last year as its most budget-friendly Apple Pencil so far, and this sale makes the peripheral even more wallet-friendly. However, Apple's long had a problem with making it clear to consumers which version of the stylus is compatible with their iPad. For the sake of clarity, here are all the iPad models with which the USB-C Apple Pencil works: iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation and later ) iPad Pro 11-inch (all models) iPad Air 13-inch (M2) iPad Air 11-inch (M2) iPad Air (4th generation and later) iPad (10th generation) iPad mini (6th generation) Although being able to charge the peripheral with a USB-C cable is handy, this version does lack some of the fancier features of the Apple Pencil Pro (which you can also snag on discount now for $116) and second-gen Apple Pencil. While you can attach it to the side of iPads with magnetic holders for safekeeping and convenience, there's no support for magnetic charging. Pressure sensitivity isn't available and you can't use Apple's nifty double-tap feature. However, the company says the USB-C Apple Pencil does support pixel-perfect accuracy, low latency and tilt sensitivity.

    "title": "The best digital frames for 2024",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-digital-frame-120046051.html?src=rss",
    "description": "You'd think making a good digital picture frame would be easy. All you need is a good screen and a seamless way to get images to the device. Combine that with an inoffensive, frame-like design and you're good to go.Despite that, Amazon is positively littered with scads of digital photo frames and I can tell you that many of them are awful. It's basically the 2020s version of what we saw with knock-off iPods back in the 2000s. There are loads of options that draw you in with a low price but deliver a totally subpar experience that will prompt you to shove the thing in a drawer and forget about it.The good news is that you only need to find one smart photo frame that works. From there, you can have a pretty delightful experience. If you're anything like me, you have thousands of photos on your phone of friends, family, pets, vacation spots, perhaps some lattes or plates of pasta and much more. Too often, those photos stay siloed on our phones, not shared with others or enjoyed on a larger scale. And sure, I can look at my photos on my laptop or an iPad, but there's something enjoyable about having a dedicated place for these things. After all, there's a reason photo frames exist in the first place, right? I tested out seven smart photo frames to weed through the junk and find the best digital frames worth buying. What to look for in digital picture frames While a digital photo frame feels like a simple piece of tech, there are a number of things I considered when trying to find one worth displaying in my home. First and foremost was display quality and size. I was surprised to learn that most digital photo frames have a resolution around 1,200 x 800, which feels positively pixelated in 2024. (That's for frames with screen sizes in the nine- to ten-inch range, which is primarily what I considered for this guide.) But after trying a bunch of frames, I realized that resolution is not the most important factor; my favorite frame has a 1,280 x 800 resolution. More important than sheer pixel density are things like reflectivity, brightness, viewing angles, color temperature and so forth. A lot of these digital photo frames were lacking in one or more of these factors; they often didn't deal with reflections well or had poor viewing angles. A lot of frames I tested felt cheap and looked ugly as well. That includes lousy stands, overly glossy plastic parts and design decisions I can only describe as strange, particularly for items that are meant to just blend into your home. The best digital photo frames don't call attention to themselves and look like an actual ‚Äúdumb‚Äù frame. Perhaps the most important thing outside of the display, though, is the software. Let me be blunt: a number of frames I tested had absolutely atrocious companion apps and software experiences that I would not wish on anyone. One that I tried did not have a touchscreen, but did have an IR remote (yes, like the one you controlled your TV with 30 years ago). Trying to use that to get on a Wi-Fi network was painful, and when I tried instead to use a QR code, I was linked to a Google search for random numbers instead of an actual app or website. I gave up on that frame, the $140 PixStar, on the spot. Other things were more forgivable. A lot of the frames out there are basically Android tablets with a bit of custom software slapped on the top, which worked fine but wasn't terribly elegant. And having to interact with the photo frame via touch wasn't great because you end up with fingerprints all over the display. The best frames I tried were smart about what features you could control on the frame itself vs. through an app, the latter of which is my preferred method. Another important software note: many frames I tried require subscriptions for features that absolutely should be included out of the box. For example, one frame would only let me upload 10 photos at a time without a subscription. Others would let you link a Google Photos account, but you could only sync a single album without paying up. Yet another option didn't let you create albums to organize the photos that were on the frame ‚Äî it was just a giant scroll of photos with no way to give them order. I can understand why certain things might go under a subscription, like if you're getting a large amount of cloud storage, for example. But these subscriptions feel like ways for companies to make recurring revenue from a product made so cheaply they can't make any money on the frame itself. I'd urge you to make sure your chosen frame doesn't require a subscription (neither of the frames I recommend in this guide need a subscription for any of their features), especially if you plan on giving this device as a gift. How much should you spend on a digital picture frame For a frame with a nine- or ten-inch display, expect to spend at least $100. Our budget recommendation is $99, and all of the options I tried that were cheaper were not nearly good enough to recommend. Spending $150 to $180 will get you a significantly nicer experience in all facets, from software to design to screen quality.

    "description": "Microsoft is discontinuing production of its HoloLens 2 headset, according a report from UploadVR. The company has no plans for a follow-up device, telling customers this will be the last chance to purchase the headset before stock runs out. At launch, it was advertised as a device for enterprise consumers, so it never really entered the mass market. The move isn‚Äôt that surprising, considering Microsoft scrapped plans for a HoloLens 3 headset back in 2022. We‚Äôre waiting for the official line from the company.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-stream-video-to-your-tv-via-a-vpn-143736234.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Licensing content from their vast libraries and back catalogs is how Hollywood studios make money. A TV show or movie that's on Max in the US may be on a totally different service in the UK or Korea, with the studio pocketing the extra pounds or won in the process. That‚Äôs why savvy viewers have long used VPNs ‚Äì virtual private networks ‚Äì to expand their options. Change your location from the US to the UK and, voila, you suddenly have access to Friends and The Office on Netflix again. That‚Äôs great if you‚Äôre watching on a phone, tablet or PC, where installing and activating a VPN is as generally as simple as visiting the device‚Äôs app store. But streaming through a VPN is a bit more challenging on a TV. Thankfully, there are quite a few ways to get that VPN-filtered content on the biggest screen in your home. Below, we‚Äôll walk you through unlocking geo-blocked content on your TV. If you don‚Äôt already have a VPN subscription, we‚Äôd suggest choosing a service from our list of best VPNs. And with the notable exception of Proton VPN, we‚Äôd strongly recommend avoiding any free VPN options. How to stream video to your smart TV using a VPN The easiest way to install a VPN on your smart TV is to download it from the built-in app store ‚Äì if your preferred VPN is available. Among the top smart TV platforms, Amazon‚Äôs Fire TV and Google TV are your best bets for built-in support. If your set doesn‚Äôt run those operating systems, you can add them to any TV with a free HDMI port for as little as $30. Meanwhile, the pricier Apple TV supports a growing list of VPNs as well. Roku, unfortunately, does not support built-in VPN apps. Fire TV Amazon‚Äôs Fire TV operating system has a wide range of content to binge-watch, as it comes with access to Prime Video‚Äôs expansive catalog. Thankfully, its user interface is easy to navigate, making installing a VPN a breeze. Amazon's Fire TV Stick line is a very VPN-friendly streaming platform. Amazon To set up a VPN, navigate to the Fire TV app store and search for the VPN service to which you‚Äôre subscribed. Fire TV has multiple options on the app store, including most of the services mentioned in our aforementioned best VPNs list. From there, the process is pretty simple: Download the app, log in and connect to the VPN. When you obfuscate your IP address using the VPN and connect to a different country, you‚Äôll unlock its Prime Video content library. Google TV Google TV is a smart TV operating system with a sleek user interface that supports thousands of apps, including VPNs and streaming platforms. As with Fire TV, just download your VPN app of choice, input your credentials and run it before activating the streaming service you‚Äôd like to check out. While Google TV doesn‚Äôt have as robust a VPN library as Fire TV, it currently has a wider selection than Apple TV (see below). Read How to stream using a VPN on your Google TV or Chromecast for more details.¬† Apple TV If you want to install a VPN on your Apple TV directly, you‚Äôll need tvOS 17 or later. If not, you can follow our alternative workarounds below. Apple TV boxes have become more VPN-friendly with recent OS updates.Devindra Hardawar/Engadget For those with tvOS 17 and later, setting up a VPN on your Apple TV is simple. However, it‚Äôs important to note that it doesn‚Äôt support many services, so you‚Äôll have to double-check that the VPN you subscribe to has Apple TV compatibility. Read How to use a VPN on your Apple TV for more details.¬† AirPlay or Google Cast from a VPN-enabled device There are two distinctions between screen casting and mirroring. The former is when you stream content on a device, cast it on your smart TV and still use the device for other purposes without interrupting what you‚Äôre streaming. The latter is when you show everything you‚Äôre doing on your device on your TV. For example, if you‚Äôre streaming a movie and tab out, your smart TV will mirror everything you‚Äôre doing. As with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in vehicles, there are Apple and Google flavors of screencasting: AirPlay and Google Cast (formerly Chromecast). In each case, you start by running your VPN of choice on your phone or tablet, firing up your streaming app, starting your movie or TV show and simply clicking the AirPlay or Google Cast icon when streaming the video. If your TV doesn‚Äôt have AirPlay or Google Cast built-in, you can buy a set-top box that supports one or the other. AirPlay is probably the most well-known casting and mirroring technology, and it currently works on a wide range of smart TVs and set-top boxes. I screencasted from my iPhone XR with a VPN enabled to my Samsung UHD TV and everything worked without a hitch. On the Google side, click the icon with a TV and Wi-Fi rays to start casting your content to the big screen. Note that Amazon is working on a rival screencasting platform called Matter Casting, but it‚Äôs not widely supported yet.¬† Read How to stream via a VPN on Roku for more details.¬† HDMI from a VPN-enabled device If you don‚Äôt want to fiddle with wireless protocols, an underrated and lesser-known way to stream video to your TV using a VPN is via an HDMI cable. You‚Äôll need an HDMI cable and (for some devices) an HDMI dongle, such as one that converts a USB-C port to HDMI. Once connected, your laptop, phone or tablet screen should be displayed on your TV‚Äôs screen. At that point, just fire up your VPN, start your streaming app (or browser) and maximize the window. Whole-house VPN access: Set up a VPN on your router All of the methods above describe ways to get VPN streaming access on a single TV. But if you want a whole-house approach ‚Äì in which you could, for instance, watch UK Netflix on every device on your home network ‚Äì you‚Äôd want to investigate accessing the VPN at the router level. Just note this is for advanced users only, and is far and away the most challenging method of the bunch. This requires installing a new router, or making major modifications to your existing one. Furthermore, it generally requires installing a custom firmware on a router, which usually means voiding the hardware manufacturer‚Äôs warranty. And even then, you‚Äôll need an expert user in the household who knows how to engage and disengage the VPN and customize its settings, as leaving it turned on all the time can interfere with non-streaming activities, including simple things like shopping online. All that said, a more streamlined whole-home option for ExpressVPN users is to try out that provider‚Äôs AirCove router models. (Note that Engadget has not yet tested these models.) Because they are ExpressVPN‚Äôs own hardware, they include warranty coverage and support through the company.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-stream-video-to-your-tv-via-a-vpn-143736234.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Whether you‚Äôve got a brand-new iPad or are still rocking an older model, investing in a good case is one of the best ways to protect your device. After all, an iPad is a versatile device that can go everywhere with you, making it more prone to the occasional drop, scratch or spill. And if you have kids, accidents are more likely than not! A case acts as an extra layer of defense, helping keep your iPad safe from the bumps and bruises of daily life. But it‚Äôs not just about protection ‚Äî many iPad cases come with extra features that make your tablet even more useful. From stands that prop up your screen for easy viewing to keyboard cases that turn your iPad into a mini laptop, the right case can change your experience. These are the best iPad cases we‚Äôve tried. Best iPad cases iPad case FAQs Should you keep your iPad in case? It‚Äôs almost always a good idea to keep your iPad in a case so it‚Äôs protected against hazards and accidents. The best iPads are expensive ‚Äî even the most affordable model will set you back nearly $300 ‚Äî so you‚Äôll want to safeguard your gear as much as possible. What is the difference between an iPad case and an iPad cover? All iPad covers are cases, but not all iPad cases are covers ‚Äî yes, it‚Äôs a bit confusing, but allow us to explain. Most iPad covers are cases that surround the back of your tablet and have a flap that covers the screen, so it provides protection for the body as well as its display. Plenty of iPad cases also have screen covers, but you don‚Äôt have to get one with that feature. Instead, you could just get a case that hugs the back of the tablet and nothing else. Those accessories will be marginally thinner and lighter than their cover-toting counterparts, and give your iPad a more svelte profile. How often should I charge my iPad? How often you charge your iPad will depend on how often you use it. Most iPads will last at least a regular work day with frequent usage, which is one of the reasons why many have opted to use their iPads as laptop replacements. But with heavy usage, like constant video streaming or gaming, will come more rapid battery drain. A good rule of thumb is to charge your iPad when you go to sleep each night, that way you‚Äôll have a topped-up device waiting for you in the morning.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html?src=rss",

    "title": "The best E Ink tablets for 2024",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss",
    "description": "E-Ink tablets have always been intriguing to me because I‚Äôm a longtime lover of pen and paper. I‚Äôve had probably hundreds of notebooks over the years, serving as repositories for my story ideas, to-do lists, meeting notes and everything in between. However, I turned away from physical notebooks at a certain point because it was just easier to store everything digitally so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in the past few years, and we‚Äôre just starting to see more color E-Ink tablets become more widely available. I tested out a number of different E Ink tablets to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today. Are E Ink tablets worth it? An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They‚Äôre also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall. The final note is key here. Most E Ink tablets don‚Äôt run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you‚Äôre automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of color and lower quality than the panels you‚Äôll find on even the cheapest iPad. Arguably the biggest reason why you wouldn‚Äôt want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it‚Äôs much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations. An e-reader is also worth considering if this is the case for you, but just know that most standard e-readers do not accept stylus input. If you like to make notes in the margins of books, underline and mark up PDFs and the like, an e-reader won‚Äôt cut it. What to look for in an E Ink tablet Latency I discovered four main things that can really make or break your experience with an E Ink tablet during my testing; first is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display‚Äôs refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to ‚Äúpaper,‚Äù so to speak?) and the stylus‚Äô latency. Most had little to no latency, but there were some that were worse than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus. Reading The second thing to consider is the reading experience. How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? While you can find E Ink tablets in all different sizes, most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn‚Äôt a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading). The supported file types will also make a big difference. It‚Äôs hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you‚Äôll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet. And with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it‚Äôs not necessarily the best idea to try to bring those titles over to a third-party device. Unless the tablet supports reading apps like Amazon‚Äôs Kindle or the Kobo app, you‚Äôll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others. Search functionality Third, most E Ink tablets have some search features, but they can vary widely between models. You‚Äôll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed that Amazon‚Äôs and Kobo‚Äôs E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save on which pages you took notes, made highlights and more. Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text. Sharing and connectivity The final factor to consider is sharing and connectivity. Yes, we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, but most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren‚Äôt created in a vacuum. You‚Äôll likely want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried were Wi-Fi devices, and some supported cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere. None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you‚Äôll interact with on your E Ink tablet after the tablet portion is done. Other E Ink tablets we've tested Lenovo Smart Paper Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the Smart Paper, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it ‚Äî and in the UK, the service costs ¬£9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive. Onyx Boox Tab Ultra The Boox Tab Ultra has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it‚Äôs designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing ‚Äî but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx‚Äôs devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else. TCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro We got to spend some time with TCL‚Äôs latest E Ink-like tablet at CES, the NXTPAPER 14 Pro. Using the company‚Äôs NXTPAPER 3.0 technology, the device isn‚Äôt precisely an E Ink tablet but one that attempts to strike a balance between the displays of ereaders and standard slabs. It focuses on eye comfort by filtering out up to 61 percent of blue light, using a Circularly Polarized Light (CPL) screen and the like. TCL has not revealed pricing for the NXTPAPER 14 Pro, but it did confirm it would arrive in the US in early 2024.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Women of color running for Congress in 2024 have faced a disproportionate number of attacks on X compared with other candidates, according to a new report from the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) and the University of Pittsburgh. The report sought to ‚Äúcompare the levels of offensive speech and hate speech that different groups of Congressional candidates are targeted with based on race and gender, with a particular emphasis on women of color.‚Äù To do this, the report‚Äôs authors analyzed 800,000 tweets that covered a three-month period between May 20 and August 23 of this year. That dataset represented all posts mentioning a candidate running for Congress with an account on X. The report‚Äôs authors found that more than 20 percent of posts directed at Black and Asian women candidates ‚Äúcontained offensive language about the candidate.‚Äù It also found that Black women in particular were targeted with hate speech more often compared with other candidates. ‚ÄúOn average, less than 1% of all tweets that mentioned a candidate contained hate speech,‚Äù the report says. ‚ÄúHowever, we found that African-American women candidates were more likely than any other candidate to be subject to this type of post (4%).‚Äù That roughly lines up with X‚Äôs recent transparency report ‚Äî the company‚Äôs first since Elon Musk took over the company ‚Äî which said that rule-breaking content accounts for less than 1 percent of all posts on its platform. In a statement, an X spokesperson said the company had suspended more than 1 million accounts and removed more than 2 million posts in the first half of 2024 for breaking the company's rules. \"While we encourage people to express themselves freely on X, abuse, harassment, and hateful conduct have no place on our platform and violate the X Rules,\" the spokesperson said.¬† Notably, the CDT‚Äôs report analyzed both hate speech ‚Äî which ostensibly violates X‚Äôs policies ‚Äî and ‚Äúoffensive speech,‚Äù which the report defined as ‚Äúwords or phrases that demean, threaten, insult, or ridicule a candidate.‚Äù While the latter category may not be against X‚Äôs rules, the report notes that the volume of suck attacks could still deter women of color from running for office. It recommends that X and other platforms take ‚Äúspecific measures‚Äù to counteract such effects. ‚ÄúThis should include clear policies that prohibit attacks against someone based on race or gender, greater transparency into how their systems address these types of attacks, better reporting tools and means for accountability, regular risk assessments with an emphasis on race and gender, and privacy preserving mechanisms for independent researchers to conduct studies using their data. The consequences of the status-quo where women of color candidates are targeted with significant attacks online at much higher rates than other candidates creates an immense barrier to creating a truly inclusive democracy.‚Äù Update: October 2, 2024, 12:13 PM ET: This post was updated to include a statement from an X spokesperson.¬†This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/women-of-color-running-for-congress-are-attacked-disproportionately-on-x-report-finds-043206066.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Juno, a widely praised (unofficial) YouTube app for Vision Pro, has been removed from Apple‚Äôs App Store after complaints from Google, according to an update from Juno‚Äôs developer Christian Selig. Google, Selig says, suggested that his app violates their trademark. It‚Äôs the latest setback for Selig, who shut down his popular Reddit client Apollo last year after the company changed its developer policies to charge for use of its API. The shutdown of Apollo and other apps like it ignited a sitewide protest from Reddit users and moderators. This time, Selig says he doesn‚Äôt want drama, noting the $5 app was a ‚Äúhobby project‚Äù for him to tinker with developing for visionOS. ‚ÄúI really enjoyed building Juno, but it was always something I saw as fundamentally a little app I built for fun,‚Äù Selig wrote on his website. ‚ÄúBecause of that, I have zero desire to spin this into a massive fight akin to what happened with Reddit years ago.‚Äù It‚Äôs unclear what aspect of Juno may have been the issue. Selig says that Google referenced its ‚Äútrademarks and iconography‚Äù in a message to Apple, ‚Äústating that Juno does not adhere to YouTube guidelines and modifies the website‚Äù in a way that‚Äôs not permitted. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt personally agree with this, as Juno is just a web view, and acts as little more than a browser extension that modifies CSS to make the website and video player look more ‚ÄòvisionOS‚Äô like,‚Äù Selig explains. ‚ÄúNo logos are placed other than those already on the website, and the ‚Äòfor YouTube‚Äô suffix is permitted in their branding guidelines.‚Äù Google hasn‚Äôt made its own YouTube app for Vision Pro, though the company said in February such an app was ‚Äúon our roadmap.‚Äù The company didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment. Selig says that people who have already paid for the app should be able to keep using it for the time being, though there‚Äôs a chance a future YouTube update could end up bricking it.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/google-allegedly-got-the-juno-youtube-app-removed-from-the-vision-pro-app-store-232155656.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Meta has been steadily improving Threads‚Äô compatibility with the fediverse over the last year. Now, the company is taking another significant step with an update that allows users to see more details about their followers and interactions with people from other servers across the fediverse. Up to now, Threads has surfaced replies from Mastodon and other servers, and has alerted users to likes on their posts from other fediverse apps. But there was no way for a Threads user to see details about their followers from those services. That‚Äôs now changing, Adam Mosseri explained in a post. With the update, anyone who has opted-in to fediverse sharing on Threads will be able to see a detailed list of their followers from other servers and view their profiles. This will give people on Threads a better sense of their reach and audience on Mastodon and other apps. Threads‚Äô fediverse support is still somewhat limited overall. Users still can‚Äôt reply to replies that originate on apps outside of Threads, and there‚Äôs no way to search for people on other servers from Threads. There‚Äôs also still a delay in cross-posting; it will now take 15 minutes for a post from Threads to appear as Meta also expanded the edit window for posts. Elsewhere, third-party developers are also making it easier for users who want to post on multiple decentralized services. A new app called Croissant enables cross-posting to Threads, Mastodon and Bluesky all at once. The paid app, first spotted by TechCrunch, aims to replicate the functionality of enterprise social media management apps like Buffer.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-will-show-how-many-followers-you-have-in-the-fediverse-215441432.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Nintendo has shuttered another emulator, this time putting an end to Ryujinx. The program was an open-source emulator for playing Nintendo Switch games on Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems. A message shared today with the emulator's Discord server stated that the developer was contacted by Nintendo with a deal to cease work on the project. No additional details were given about the conditions of that agreement. The same message was also posted on X: pic.twitter.com/2Ggt9SWoDI‚Äî Ryujinx (@RyujinxEmu) October 1, 2024 The emulator will still function for anyone already running it, but the Github repository has been removed. Ryujinx also made some headlines last month for running the new¬†Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom game at more than 120 frames per second, vastly outstripping the Switch's capabilities. Nintendo has taken an aggressive stance on emulators, even teaming up with a cybersecurity firm in 2023 to try and curb game piracy. Ryujinx is one of the more popular emulators it has taken on, but the game company also reached a $2.4 million settlement with the emulator Yuzu in March. It issued a whopping 8,535 DMCA takedowns in May to try and remove all the Yuzu code hosted across different Github repositories.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-emulator-ryujinx-is-kaput-after-nintendo-pressure-211524968.html?src=rss",

    "description": "An early Amazon Prime Day deal lets you save $40 on the Ninja Creami Deluxe ice cream maker. The 11-in-1 kitchen accessory, one of our favorite kitchen gadgets, is on sale for only $210 (usually $250). The Creami is based on a patent for an innovation previously only found in the restaurant biz. Once it expired, Ninja leaped at the chance to incorporate its design into a relatively affordable consumer product. The result is fast, easy and surprisingly yummy ice cream made from home. Instead of the churning method used in most ice cream makers, the Ninja Creami uses a drill-like utensil to blend a frozen liquid base into a tasty dessert. Although it‚Äôs pretty loud while doing its thing, it‚Äôs still quieter than most countertop blenders ‚Äî and only stays noisy for a few minutes. When reviewing the standard Creami model (this Deluxe one includes extra containers and settings), Engadget‚Äôs Sam Rutherford concluded that tasting its resulting ice cream was ‚Äúthe best part.‚Äù It produces desserts with intense flavors and smooth textures. This higher-end model also makes smoothies and Frappuccino-style coffee drinks. ‚ÄúBecause the base is spun instead of churned, there‚Äôs less air inside your finished product,‚Äù our reviewer wrote. ‚ÄúThis is good because it increases flavor intensity and delivers a slightly denser, more luxurious mouthfeel. It‚Äôs almost closer to a frozen custard than ice cream.‚Äù You can get the Ninja Creami Deluxe right now on Amazon for $210.

    "description": "Devolver Digital puts out a lot of good games and it‚Äôs looking to spread that magic around to licensed content. The company just announced a sub-label called Big Fan Games that will specialize in developing indie titles based on pre-existing IPs. Devolver describes Big Fan Games as ‚Äúa brand new label giving developers license to create original game adaptations using the worlds and characters of iconic film, television, and comic properties.‚Äù To that end, the team is staffed with industry veterans who have worked with companies like Disney and Dark Horse Comics. Announcement time.Today we launch Big Fan ( @BigFanPresents ) - a brand new label giving developers license to create original game adaptations using the worlds and characters of iconic film, television, and comic properties. pic.twitter.com/A6h3IGOk3p‚Äî Devolver Digital (@devolverdigital) October 1, 2024 The label already has a few games in its library, all of them based on pre-existing IPs. These titles include Reigns: Game of Thrones, Hellboy Web of Wyrd and John Wick Hex. These games were already released before being moved to the new label. For instance, Reigns: Game of Thrones came out six years ago, but back then it was published by Devolver. John Wick Hex came out in 2019 and Hellboy Web of Wyrd hit digital store shelves last year. Today‚Äôs announcement doesn‚Äôt bring any new games, but the company website currently features a big ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù tab, though it‚Äôs currently empty. We should expect some reveals in the near future. Big Fan Games wrote in a press release that its goal ‚Äúis to nurture fun and inventive games that stand on their own, rather than serving as marketing tie-ins for other media launches.‚Äù Licensed games have been hit and miss since the dawn of modern gaming. For every DuckTales, there‚Äôs a Superman 64. Recent releases, however, have been well-received. Respawn‚Äôs Star Wars games were bona-fide hits, as was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder‚Äôs Revenge. While we don‚Äôt know what Devolver and Big Fan Games are cooking up, we do know of some upcoming licensed games. MachineGames will release Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on December 9 and Arkane Lyon is busy working on a game based on Marvel‚Äôs Blade. I personally think it‚Äôs pretty great that Big Fan Games will give indie developers a chance to work on licensed properties. To that end, the company encourages developers to reach out with ideas for a licensed game. \"Have a favorite game you‚Äôve always dreamed of rebooting or a cult classic film or book you'd love to see adapted into a game? We‚Äôd love to hear from you,\" the studio writes on its website.¬†This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/devolver-has-a-new-publishing-label-for-licensed-indie-games-183352439.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Ooni's pizza ovens are popular choices for baking restaurant-quality pies at home. In fact, the Karu 16 is my top pick for a multi-fuel option in our best pizza ovens guide. That model is spacious, accommodating 16-inch pizzas and allowing you to bake and roast thanks to the extra vertical space. The Karu 16 has been around for a while now, so Ooni has taken the opportunity to give it a big overhaul while keeping the price the same. The new Karu 2 Pro maintains many of the great design elements from the Karu 16, but adds some key upgrades to improve upon an already winning formula.¬† First, the digital display for the Karu 2 Pro got a big upgrade. The black and white panel is gone, replaced by Ooni's Digital Temperature Hub that looks similar to what's on the Koda 2 Max. This piece of tech not only gives you a clear indication of oven and food temps (via a wired probe), but it will send those stats to your phone via Bluetooth. To help you adjust temperature of the oven, there's a new air intake lever on the back of the Karu 2 Pro near the fire box. This gives you another place to coax the air flow besides the one that's on the exhaust chimney, allowing you to run the oven as low as 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Lastly, the door of this new model has more glass and less framing, giving you a clearer view of what's going on inside without having to open the oven.¬† Of course, this is an Ooni product, so there are certain things you can bank on. Primarily, there's the fact that the Karu 2 Pro can hit 950 degrees Fahrenheit in 15 minutes. At those temps, you can cook a Neapolitan-style pizza in about a minute or easily sear a steak with a grill pan. The powder-coated, carbon steel exterior helps keep heat in while protecting the Karu 2 Pro, and folding legs provide easy transport. And since this is a multi-fuel oven, you have the option of attaching a gas burner when you don't want to use wood or charcoal (additional purchase required).¬† The Karu 2 Pro is listed as \"coming soon\" on Ooni's website for $799, the same price as the Karu 16 when it arrived. No word on preorders or an on-sale date, but you can sign up via the link below to be notified when the oven is up for purchase. What's more, the Karu 16 is currently available for $649, but it will soon be retired. The Karu 12G and Karu 12 will remain in the company's multi-fuel lineup.¬† This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/oonis-karu-2-pro-pizza-oven-has-app-connectivity-and-a-bigger-window-174519402.html?src=rss",

    "description": "It‚Äôs wild to think the reMarkable 2 debuted in March 2020, a time now more famous for other reasons. A lot has changed in the four-plus years since, and now it‚Äôs time for its successor, the reMarkable Paper Pro. The third-generation, distraction-free writing slate gets a color e-paper display as well as a raft of other equally notable improvements. That includes a bigger screen, faster internals and an active stylus for a more paper-and-pen-like experience. But this much more tech comes at a higher price, so let‚Äôs answer the question: Is it worth it? reMarkable is the standard bearer for devices straddling the gap between the analog and digital. It‚Äôs an e-paper slate with a stylus (and optional keyboard) that lets you read, write and edit your own documents and PDFs. The focus is on giving you a tool that‚Äôll act like paper and pen or a word processor rather than anything more fully-featured. That way, you can focus on whatever you‚Äôre doing without the distractions a full computer, tablet or phone offers. If there was a way to make ‚Äúmedium tech‚Äù sound not like an insult, I‚Äôm sure reMarkable would wear it proudly. Hardware The new reMarkable Paper Pro measures 196.6 x 274.1 x 5.1mm, making it roughly an inch taller and a quarter-inch wider than its predecessor, the reMarkable 2 (188 x 246 x 4.7mm). But it doesn‚Äôt feel that much bigger, thanks to plenty of effort made to shrink the bezels around the display. And the left band (the chin when using the device in landscape mode) has been eliminated altogether here. All of that room has been made to accommodate the Paper Pro‚Äôs headline feature: an 11.8-inch Canvas Color screen. I prefer tablets that have a slightly more austere design than where the industry has been for the last few years. The reMarkable 2 was one of many slates aping the then-current iPad‚Äôs rounded off corners and sides that never felt right. The Paper Pro is a delightful correction, with sharper lines and squarer corners that gives the device some much-needed visual rigidity. The edge band is also inlaid with grooves that, designer Mats Solberg explained, has two useful benefits beyond looking good. First, it evokes the idea you‚Äôre holding a sheaf of paper in your hand, and second, it adds some grip to a device that‚Äôs surprisingly thin. The inside of the Paper Pro has been given a thorough upgrade as well, with a new 1.8GHz Cortex A53 processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. This is underpowered compared to any smartphone from the last decade, but don‚Äôt forget the reMarkable doesn‚Äôt need that much grunt. It‚Äôs still a big leap ahead of the rM2, which was packing a 1.2GHz dual-core chip with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. The battery‚Äôs a lot beefier, too, leaping up from the 3,000mAh of the rM2 to 5,030mAh here. It needs to be, given this is also the first reMarkable with a backlight, making it the first model you can use in dark rooms without a lot of grief. Daniel Cooper for Engadget To be clear, the new size and the switch from a passive stylus to an active one means none of your existing reMarkable accessories are compatible with Paper Pro. The accessory connector is on the backplate rather than the edge, and the new stylus is magnetically charged. So when you‚Äôre pricing one of these up, bear in mind that you‚Äôll need a whole new set of extras, too. In use As soon as you turn on the Paper Pro, you‚Äôll notice the leap in performance compared to its predecessor. At the risk of damning this thing with faint praise; If the reMarkable 2 felt like a fancy ereader, then this feels more like a slow tablet. The faster internals and display mean the experience is a lot more responsive and snappy, with far less delay between action and result. There are even little animations during the setup process and unlocking the device with a six-digit code feels like you‚Äôre unlocking a phone. The Paper Pro uses a modified version of E Ink‚Äôs Gallery 3 technology called ‚ÄúCanvas Color.‚Äù Each pixel in the display holds a series of particles: White, Cyan, Magenta and Yellow. These can be combined to make eight solid colors (Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Yellow, Magenta, White and Black) or, with dithering, up to 20,000 different shades therein. The analogy the company uses is in the CMYK inks found in most printers and newspaper presses. Daniel Cooper for Engadget The end result is a display with visible, if muted, color reproduction with some limitations you‚Äôll need to work around. If you‚Äôre making handwritten amendments to a document, you‚Äôll need blue, cyan, magenta or red. Because yellow, green, gray and cyan are irritatingly faint when you write with a thin nib on existing text. The inverse is true for highlighting, where the gentler colors are better. There‚Äôs no big difference in readability between the Paper Pro (229 ppi) compared to its predecessor (226 ppi). But I can‚Äôt quite shake the nagging feeling that the smaller, older device has sharper text when I‚Äôm looking at it. Your mileage may vary. Because of how much new tech has been crammed inside the Paper Pro, you‚Äôll find scrolling speeds are much faster. When I used the reMarkable 2, I felt I could see its processes taking place in real time. You know, ‚ÄúIdentify input, process input, send command to screen, refresh screen,‚Äù with a notable delay. Here, any lag feels more like a result of the e-paper display‚Äôs natural limitations and slow refresh rate rather than slow processing speed. Plenty of work has been done by the reMarkable team to reduce the latency between the pen and the display. Even after the addition of the color screen, which necessitated some compromise, the input lag was cut from 22ms on the rM2 to 12ms here. Similarly, there‚Äôs no lag when you‚Äôre typing as there could sometimes be when you were using the older slate. If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôm still not sure about, it‚Äôs that when writing in color, the text doesn‚Äôt initially render in the color you‚Äôve chosen. Your first blast of scrawling pops up in gray and it‚Äôs only after the screen refreshes that it reloads in the correct color. Daniel Cooper for Engadget There‚Äôs one other thing that I want to draw attention to, and it‚Äôs a subtle thing but well worth pointing at. A lot of time and effort has gone into ensuring that handwritten notes and highlights can work seamlessly with text inputs. For instance, if I‚Äôm typing something and feel the need to highlight, underline or draw a ring around the word with the pen, I can. If I then have to go back and amend that text later, it‚Äôs easy enough to expect the handwritten additions to become unmoored from the text. But reMarkable has done the hard work to ensure that it all remains in place ‚Äî it‚Äôs a subtle piece of engineering, but one I deeply appreciate. Backlight Paper Pro is the first reMarkable with a backlight, and its inclusion here is very much ‚Äúbetter late than never.‚Äù I‚Äôve often enjoyed writing notes with the reMarkable 2, but found it frustrating that it‚Äôs unusable in darker environments. That both the slate and the new Type Folio are now backlit ‚Äì activated by tapping the top right corner of the screen ‚Äî means that‚Äôs no longer an issue. The light emitted from both is in my experience gentle rather than eye-searing, even when I pushed everything to maximum. Fundamentally, you‚Äôll be able to use this in a dark room or on an airplane with the cabin lights dimmed without any stress or eye strain. Marker Like its predecessors, the Paper Pro comes with a choice of stylus. What separates the Marker and Marker Plus is that the latter, as before, has an active surface on top, allowing you to use it as an eraser. Make an error, and all you have to do is flip it over to get rid of your boo-boo, whereas with the Marker you‚Äôll need to select the erase tool from the menu. Daniel Cooper for Engadget But while you might not notice much of a difference at first blush, plenty has changed on the inside. The older reMarkable styluses were passive, enabling you to use a number of compatible third-party styli in their place. This time around, both versions are active ‚Äî full of technology to help orient the pen and communicate with the tablet for faster processing. It connects magnetically to the ‚Äúright‚Äù hand side, wirelessly charging from the slate like the Apple Pencil. Ironically, a lot of effort has gone into ensuring that, despite the raft of changes between this model and its predecessor, you‚Äôll struggle to notice the difference. I‚Äôve seen some folks saying that the new Marker has a harder tip and that as the display is rougher, it‚Äôs less fun to use. I‚Äôm not sure my experience matches that, and every time I compare the two, I feel like it‚Äôs more or less the same. As for the Marker‚Äôs battery life, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn‚Äôt get this thing to run out of juice under what I‚Äôd describe as normal use. An hour or two a day for more than a week and I never managed to run the stylus flat ‚Äî hell, I barely got the Paper Pro‚Äôs battery to half in that time. Type Folio reMarkable has launched a new Type Folio for the Paper Pro, which is about 1.1 inches wider and deeper than its predecessor. That extra space affords you a palm rest and a bigger margin around the outside of the keyboard, but nothing too dramatic in terms of changes to the keys. You do now get an Escape key, which exits a document and goes back to the homepage. There‚Äôs also a new Icon Toggle, which when activated will remove the icons from the screen to further reduce distractions. Daniel Cooper for Engadget Now, I‚Äôm a big fan of the old Type Folio, finding that it made the right compromises for a travel keyboard. Its main keys were properly sized and spaced so my muscle memory carried over from my regular keyboard to this one and back again. The compromises, like the half-height function row and narrow non-character keys, were the right ones to make. Given the Paper Pro‚Äôs bigger size, its Type Folio can spread those extra keys out a little further to give the whole thing room to breathe. It‚Äôs better than it was before, but what we had before was no slouch. Price and availability The reMarkable Paper Pro is available to order today, priced at $579 with the standard Marker and $629 if you want the Marker Plus. You can add a case from $89, but a full leather version will set you back $179. If you want to add the Type Folio, which I‚Äôd say is a key way of making the reMarkable truly useful, you‚Äôll need to pay an additional $229. The company has, however, decided to keep the reMarkable 2 around as a lower-cost option, selling it for $379 with a standard Marker. Given the reMarkable 2 has topped our e-ink tablet buyer‚Äôs guide for several years, it‚Äôs still a solid choice if the Paper Pro is too rich for your blood. The competition There are a decent number of e-paper tablets floating around the market right now, with the majority of them offering monochrome screens. In our e-ink tablet Buyer‚Äôs Guide, we named the reMarkable 2 the best option for most people. If you‚Äôre looking for a slate with a color display, your options are the Paper Pro, or the Kobo Libra Color and the elegantly named Onyx Book Tablet Note Air 3 C. Kobo‚Äôs device is much more portable than the Paper Pro, but that‚Äôs because the Kobo is primarily designed to be an ereader. Its smaller seven-inch screen is squarely in ereader territory, and while there‚Äôs a notebooks feature that allows you to write freehand as much as you want, it‚Äôs never going to be able to compete with the Paper Pro‚Äôs 11.8-inch screen on that front. The Libra Color will be a better option for those who primarily want to take notes in and mark up ebooks ‚Äî Kobo‚Äôs library is nearly as robust as Amazon‚Äôs Kindle library, and you can digitally mark up any book you buy from Kobo without restriction. Onyx‚Äôs Boox Note Air 3 C is more akin to the Paper Pro in size, but it‚Äôs decidedly not suitable if you want to work in a more distraction-free environment. The Note Air 3 C, like most other Boox devices, are full Android tablets with E Ink screens, so nothing‚Äôs stopping you from going online or even attempting to watch a YouTube video. Even if distractions aren‚Äôt an issue for you, the Paper Pro‚Äôs streamlined interface makes it much easier to use ‚Äî for both newbies and those familiar with these devices. Boox devices will appeal more to tinkerers and the most tech-savvy among us because there are a lot of settings you can play around with to make a device like the Note Air 3 C as capable as you need it to be. The Paper Pro keeps things relatively simple, making it more approachable overall. Wrap-up Daniel Cooper for Engadget Look, you just know that there are some folks who‚Äôll look at the Paper Pro‚Äôs price and spec list, compare that to a base-model iPad and laugh themselves into a coma. The point is that this isn‚Äôt a generic tablet but a device that‚Äôs been consciously designed to do fewer things better. So, we‚Äôre going to judge this thing on and by its own merits, rather than as a typical tablet. I‚Äôm a big fan of reMarkable‚Äôs devices because they offer a way for me to focus in a way that my ADHD brain struggles to do otherwise. If I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed and need to eliminate distractions, then stealing myself away with a device like this really can help. There‚Äôs no easy way for me to swipe away from my work to check Reddit or YouTube, helping me stay on track. And given how popular these devices are, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only person who feels this way. If, however, you‚Äôd still like to dip a toe into this water but don‚Äôt want to spend that much, then there is good news. reMarkable is keeping the 2 around as an entry-level unit, priced at $379 with the standard marker and because for all of the good things the Paper Pro does, none diminish the long list of good qualities the reMarkable 2 has. On one hand, you have a device that‚Äôs whip-fast, eminently capable at the things that it can do and now has a bigger screen that renders colors. On the other, I cannot pretend that it‚Äôs not a pricey piece of kit, especially when you bundle in the Type Folio. Naturally, if your budget can stretch to that sort of cash and you really do need a way to work without distractions, I think it‚Äôs worth it.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/remarkable-paper-pro-review-writing-in-color-is-nice-but-itll-cost-you-173024590.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Bose launched a new wireless portable speaker on Tuesday. The SoundLink Home is a relatively small addition to the lineup with ‚Äúpremium sound‚Äù and around nine hours of battery life for $219. The SoundLink Home is quite ‚Äúmini‚Äù for a home-branded speaker: 8.5 inches high, 4.4 inches wide and 2.3 inches deep. It weighs 1.93 lbs (0.88 kg). It shouldn‚Äôt be hard to tote it from room to room or find an open spot on a desk or table. A small size often means compromised audio, but Bose promises its dual passive radiators will produce ‚Äúdeep bass that fills any room.‚Äù The company also says it has ‚Äúpremium sound‚Äù with ‚Äúgreat acoustics.‚Äù The company can squeeze surprisingly powerful sound into small packages, as evidenced by its SoundLink Flex lineup (more on that in a second). Bose The SoundLink Home forgoes Bose app access, so you‚Äôll need to tweak your source audio if you want to adjust EQ levels. In addition to Bluetooth 5.3 (including multipoint!), it lets you attach a USB-C cable for wired input. The speaker also has a built-in mic to use for voice assistant access or as a speakerphone for calls. You can use its bundled USB-C cable for charging, too, and Bose says it will go from empty to full in around four hours. You can link it wirelessly with a second unit for a stereo setup. As its photos indicate, it‚Äôs a snazzy-looking little speaker. Its body is made from anodized aluminum, and it has a ‚Äúhigh-quality‚Äù fabric grille and a built-in stand. The Bose SoundLink Home is available now exclusively on the company website. You can buy it in gray and silver colorways. The speaker costs $219 and (at least for me) shows shipping available immediately. Bose SoundLink Flex Bose The company recently updated its SoundLink Flex, a pill-shaped portable speaker that‚Äôs one of Engadget‚Äôs picks for the best Bluetooth speakers. Unlike the first version (and the SoundLink Home), this second-gen model now connects to the Bose app. There, you can make EQ adjustments and store stereo pairing connections with other compatible Bose speakers. The new version supports AAC and aptX audio codecs and comes in a new Alpine Sage colorway. The new model also gains a shortcut button (similar to the one on the SoundLink Max). Like that model, the button on the Flex is customizable through the app. The second-gen SoundLink Flex is available now for $149.

    "description": "While there's a much bigger title coming to the service later in the month, Xbox has revealed the first five Game Pass additions for October. Among them are some newcomers to the new Game Pass Standard tier.¬† Baseball sim MLB The Show 24 and the enjoyable narrative game Open Roads were already on Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass and Game Pass for Console (which is no longer available unless you were grandfathered in). They'll join the Standard library on consoles on October 2 alongside Sifu. That captivating brawler is also coming to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. Two other games will hit all versions of the service save for Xbox Game Pass Core in the coming days (have we talked about how needlessly convoluted the Game Pass setup is lately?). Physics-based party brawler Mad Streets will join the lineup on October 7, followed by Inscryption on October 10. That creepy roguelike deck-builder is one of our picks for the best horror games you can play right now. Inevitably, Xbox will be removing some games from the library in the coming days to make way for the newcomers (and also because various licensing deals will be coming to an end). On October 15, it will yank Dyson Sphere Program, Everspace 2, From Space, F1 Manager 2023 and Scorn. As ever, Xbox will add more titles to Game Pass in the back half of the month, including a lil' under-the-radar one a few people might have heard of called Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. That one will not be on the Standard tier any time soon, however.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/the-first-new-game-pass-titles-for-october-include-inscryption-and-sifu-165518640.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Apple has been in hot water with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) since 2022 when the company was accused of union-busting. It agreed to review its labor practices last January, but the NLRB determined that Apple had violated workers‚Äô rights soon after. Today, the NLRB strikes again, accusing Apple of anti-union practices, denying employees the right to discuss wages and even signing illegal nondisclosure, noncompete and confidentiality agreements. Truth be told, this is pretty much the same song and dance covered since 2022. These complaints originate from former Apple employees Cher Scarlett and Ashley Gj√∏vik. They claimed that Apple prohibited wage discussion and that CEO Tim Cook aimed to punish leakers, respectively. Gj√∏vik also alleged that it prevented staff from talking to reporters. Apple provided a statement to Reuters, which first reported on this complaint. The company claims it always honors employees‚Äô rights to discuss wages, hours and working conditions. Should Apple not settle the case, an administrative judge will hear it in January.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/us-labor-board-accuses-apple-of-violating-employees-rights-164643503.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Amazon Prime Day is getting really close now and the deals spigot has been turned on. Case in point? There‚Äôs an Echo Pop bundle that includes a TP-Link Tapo smart light bulb for just $18. This is a discount of more than 70 percent. The Echo Pop is Amazon‚Äôs latest entry-level device in the smart speaker category. It typically costs $40 on its own, adding more luster to today‚Äôs sale. The semi-spherical speaker is a great fit for small spaces, like dorm rooms and bedrooms. The Echo Pop includes Amazon‚Äôs AZ2 Neural Edge processor for on-device machine learning tasks which, of course, allows full access to Alexa. The speaker also pairs with Eero mesh routers to extend a home network‚Äôs range by ‚Äúup to 1,000 square feet.‚Äù This is a decent smart speaker for beginners, with one caveat. The Echo Dot is available in multiple colors, and some are quite fetching, but this deal is only for the standard black/charcoal model. Of course, this bundle also includes a Tapo smart light bulb. This is another entry-level device, though it‚Äôs not exactly bare-bones. The bulb can display 16 million different colors, which makes for unique lighting effects. Once connected, users can ask Alexa to dim the lights, raise the lights or change colors. A single light bulb doesn‚Äôt make for a smart home, per se, but this will allow consumers to experiment with some adjacent features. It‚Äôs also a good way to gauge how much energy will be saved by going with smart appliances, as Tapo bulbs use around 60 percent less power when compared to standard bulbs.

    "title": "Sony expands its LinkBuds line with new open earbuds, ANC earbuds and a speaker",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-expands-its-linkbuds-line-with-new-open-earbuds-anc-earbuds-and-a-speaker-160045247.html?src=rss",
    "description": "In early 2022, Sony took a gamble on a unique design for open-design earbuds. The company built tiny buds with a circular, donut-shaped speaker that were designed to be worn all day. It then followed those with a more \"traditional\" set, the LinkBuds S, just a few months later. That second model delivered a lot of the key features from the flagship WF-1000XM5, but at $100 less.¬† Now Sony is expanding the LinkBuds line once again, adding three new options with very different designs. A second-gen version of the LinkBuds are now called LinkBuds Open (pictured above), with an all-new design debuting alongside them in the LinkBuds Fit. Lastly, there's a LinkBuds Speaker that allows you to automatically switch the audio between it and a set of earbuds as needed. LinkBuds Open My key gripe with the original LinkBuds is that they weren't very comfortable. Sony did well to pack in a ton of features, including tapping your face in front of your ear for the onboard controls (Wide Area Tap). However, the rigid casing for the ring driver was too firm and the earbuds overall didn't stay in place that well. To address this, the company redesigned the \"fitting supporter\" for the LinkBuds Open, opting for a more common fit wing shape off the top edge. Sony also says it reduced the size of the second-gen model to further assist with a more comfortable fit. Inside, Sony built a new 11mm ring driver that's still open at the center for an inherent transparency mode. Thanks to a carefully selected high-compliance diaphragm and a powerful magnet, the LinkBuds Open can better replicate clear highs and mids along with louder, richer bass, according to Sony. The company also upgraded the earbud chip to its Integrated Processor V2, the same component that's found inside the WF-1000XM5. Sony says this update should provide connectivity that's more stable compared to the LinkBuds. Sony also extended the battery life on the LinkBuds Open, offering up to eight hours on a charge. That's up from five and a half on the first model. What's more, the quick charge feature now gives you an hour of use in three minutes, as opposed to 90 minutes of playback in 10 minutes on the original version. Sony included a fit check tool in its new app this time, allowing you to have the positioning analyzed with a photo (Sony has done this before with other models). Other key specs include an IPX4 rating and multipoint Bluetooth. The LinkBuds Open are available for preorder today for $200, $20 more than the 2022 model. They're available in black, white and Olivia Rodrigo-collab purple (purple is US only). There are additional colors of case covers ($20) and additional fitting supporters ($10) to further customize your look. Those are available in blue, green, pink, purple and black. LinkBuds Fit Sony The new LinkBuds Fit are a completely new design and the successor to the LinkBuds S. Based on consumer polling, Sony determined that fit and comfort were the two primary concerns for its customers. So, the company used its analysis of \"extensive ear shape data\" for the new curves. The earbuds are smaller and shorter, and a new Air Fitting Supporter is hollow to make it more flexible. Plus, a new ear tip is here to further enhance overall comfort. Inside, a new Dynamic Driver X handles the audio, powered by the WF-1000XM5's Integrated Processor V2 chip that also assists with the active noise cancellation (ANC). That component also enables a new Auto Ambient Sound mode that automatically adjusts transparency audio based on your surroundings and an Auto Noise Canceling Optimizer that tweaks ANC in real time ‚Äî all aided by dual noise sensor tech and multiple microphones. Sony called the ambient sound quality on the LinkBuds Fit the \"best-in-class,\" which is a lofty claim when you consider the high bar Apple set with the AirPods Pro. Battery life is slightly shorter than the LinkBuds S at five and a half hours. That's 30 minutes less than that previous model. Other key specs include an IPX4 rating and multipoint Bluetooth. Like the LinkBuds Open, you'll tap on the side of your face by your ear for the onboard controls (Wide Area Tap).¬† The LinkBuds Open are available for preorder today for $200, the same price as the LinkBuds S was at launch. They're available in black, white, green and Olivia Rodrigo-hued purple (purple is US only). There are additional colors of case covers ($20) and additional fitting supporters ($10) to further customize your look. Those are available in blue, green, pink, purple and black. LinkBuds Speaker Sony The third member of the LinkBuds trio isn't another set of earbuds, it's a speaker. The LinkBuds Speaker is a small, portable Bluetooth speaker with an IPX4 rating and built-in loop for hanging it up. You can expect up to 25 hours of battery life and a 10-minute rest on the charging dock will give you 70 minutes of use. The driver setup includes a woofer, a passive radiator and a tweeter, and Sony says the speaker is tuned for \"well-balanced... pleasant and clear sound that does not tire the listener.\" There's a top-mounted microphone for calls that's flanked by volume and playback controls. A Quick Play button lets you get the music going with a single button press.¬† The key feature of the LinkBuds Speaker is Auto Switch with compatible Sony earbuds. Those include the new LinkBuds Open and Fit, but the LinkBuds S and WF-1000XM5 are also on the list. The speaker's hand-off tool will work with the WH-1000XM5 headphones, too. Just like it sounds, the feature allows you to quickly swap the audio between headphones or earbuds and the LinkBuds Speaker. You can also use the Sound Connect app to set routines for the speaker so that things happen automatically during the day based on your schedule. You can set Auto Switch to occur daily when you're heading out to the gym or office, for example. The LinkBuds Speaker is available for preorder today for $180 in black and grey color options. A charging dock is included in the box, but the speaker is only available in the US at this time. Sound Connect app During this new LinkBuds series launch, Sony is replacing its Headphones Connect app with a new one called Sound Connect. Starting today, all headphones which were compatible with the old app will now work with this new software. What's more, ULT speakers and the new LinkBuds Speaker will also work with Sound Connect. If you have Headphones Connect installed, you'll automatically change over the next time the app updates. Sound Connect provides a much-needed redesign and a UI that looks more modern than the aging aesthetic of Headphones Connect. All of the key settings are right on the main screen and the app will provide tips for headphone and earbud use on the Discover tab. For LinkBuds Open and LinkBuds Fit, the app delivers a few unique features that should make your life easier. First, there's a built-in voice control tool that allows you to control the earbuds with a \"Hey Headphones\" command. It's just like Bose offers on its new QuietComfort Earbuds. You can use it to control music, adjust volume, enable/disable ANC and check battery life. Taking a page out of Apple's book, Sony will also enable head gestures for accepting or rejecting calls on its two new sets of earbuds. An Auto Battery Save feature will disable things like EQ, DSEE upscaling, Speak to Chat and Voice Control to conserve energy when you hit 20 percent remaining. Lastly, a Background Music Effect can simulate less distracting sound as if it were playing in a bedroom, living room or cafe. A full review of the LinkBuds Open, LinkBuds Fit and LinkBuds Speaker is in progress. Stay tuned to that detailed evaluation in the coming days.¬†This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-expands-its-linkbuds-line-with-new-open-earbuds-anc-earbuds-and-a-speaker-160045247.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Apple‚Äôs Find My network and Google‚Äôs Find My Device are both smart tracking solutions to help us prevent losing our items, but devices made for one aren‚Äôt typically compatible with the other. However, Pebblebee is changing this by introducing its Pebblebee Universal, a trio of rechargeable item trackers that work with both Apple and Google systems. The Pebblebee Universal line includes three products: the Pebblebee Clip Universal, Pebblebee Card Universal and Pebblebee Tag Universal. The Clip tracker is the standard model and is great for tracking all kinds of bags and keys. The Card tracker fits inside wallets and passports to prevent losing valuables. Finally, the Tag Universal is Pebblebee‚Äôs smallest rechargeable tracker, which will fit almost anywhere. We featured the Pebblebee Clip in our best Bluetooth tracker guide. It performed well in our tests and works as an excellent AirTag alternative. Being able to connect to either the Apple or Google networks makes the Pebblebee Universal line of trackers much more versatile. Founder and CEO Daniel Daoura says these trackers are part of the company‚Äôs ‚Äúmission to create one connected global ecosystem for all.‚Äù Note that if you set up your Pebblebee Universal tracker to connect to the Apple Find My network, you‚Äôll have to perform a factory reset to use the other network in the future. All connections to the tracker are end-to-end encrypted, meaning only you get to see where it is. Pebblebee Universal trackers are currently available for $35 per tracker. They‚Äôre being sold on Pebblebee‚Äôs website, Best Buy stores, and Best Buy's official website.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/home/ebay-will-stop-charging-seller-fees-in-the-uk-155751915.html?src=rss",
    "description": "As of today, eBay consumer-to-consumer (C2C) sellers in the UK will no longer have to pay selling fees for any domestic purchases. The company had first tested free selling for pre-owned clothes earlier this year. Using the data from this test, eBay decided to open the floodgates. In addition to the initial test in the UK, eBay also removed seller fees in Germany for domestic sales. In today‚Äôs announcement from eBay, CEO and President Jamie Iannone said that doing so can ‚Äústrengthen our marketplace by lowering the barriers to C2C selling, which improves the breadth and depth of inventory on eBay.‚Äù However, Iannone also mentioned that the company will begin implementing a ‚Äúbuyer-facing fee‚Äù early next year. Among the reasons cited for the removal of seller fees was that the UK is home to hundreds of millions of unused items. Iannone believes that sellers would be more inclined to set up shop on eBay if they didn‚Äôt have to spend money just to list items and not worry about the company taking a percentage of the money received after a sale. The breadth of items coming from consumers rather than just professional sellers could make the marketplace ‚Äúmore vibrant.‚Äù eBay also faces competition from Vinted and Depop, two newer ecommerce platforms that don‚Äôt charge seller fees. Vinted, in particular, is a second-hand marketplace primarily for clothes, and eBay removing seller fees for clothes is a direct answer to the rival company. Depop, owned by Etsy, has also been growing. Thus, it‚Äôs not a surprise that eBay is following its competitor‚Äôs footsteps. The announcement also mentioned more changes and improvements, such as a ‚Äústreamlined listing process,‚Äù an improved local pickup process and a better wallet experience through eBay Balance. eBay plans to share more details on its future plans at the next Global All Hands event.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/ebay-will-stop-charging-seller-fees-in-the-uk-155751915.html?src=rss",

    "title": "The unsealed New Mexico Snapchat lawsuit alleges the company ignored child safety",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-unsealed-new-mexico-snapchat-lawsuit-alleges-the-company-ignored-child-safety-154235977.html?src=rss",
    "description": "On September 5, New Mexico Attorney General Ra√∫l Torrez filed a lawsuit against Snap. Torrez claimed that Snapchat has become a platform rife with sexual exploitation, child grooming and other dangerous behaviors. That legal complaint was heavily redacted, but today, Torrez announced in a press release that he has filed an unsealed complaint, which goes into detail on how Snap allegedly knowingly created an environment that exposed children to sexual predators. The unredacted accusations include how Snap employees encountered 10,000 sextortion cases each month. Still, the company never warned users because it did not want to ‚Äústrike fear‚Äù among them. The statement also mentioned that Snap employees regularly ignored user reports related to grooming and sextortion. An account with 75 separate reports remains active, and Snap refused to touch any of this content, citing ‚Äúdisproportionate admin costs.‚Äù Snapchat‚Äôs disappearing messages have long been a draw of the platform, but the suit alleges that they lull users into a false sense of security. Therefore, predators find it easier to solicit explicit images from users before extorting them for money, or these images will be sent to friends and family. The unredacted complaint also notes that Snapchat‚Äôs ‚ÄúQuick Add‚Äù feature was suggesting adult strangers to minors, and Snap Map also lets adults find minors‚Äô accounts. Quick Add was even proven to be dangerous as a New Mexico man, Alejandro Marquez, had used it to lure and rape an 11-year-old girl, as mentioned in the complaint. The complaint also alleges that Snap's upper management routinely ignored former trust and safety employees who pushed for additional and improved safety mechanisms. CEO Evan Spiegel ‚Äúprioritized design‚Äù over safety and even refused to preserve abusive images for review and for law enforcement to use as proof. The company also didn‚Äôt keep its child sex abuse images database updated, even rolling back changes and deleting evidence of matches. Even worse, predators using Snapchat have taken to creating a ‚ÄúSextortion handbook‚Äù to teach others how to target users at schools. Compounded with the fact that 90 percent of all reports are ignored and 30 percent of victims never received any assistance from Snap, predators could essentially roam freely. That‚Äôs not the only issue New Mexico is concerned with. The complaint also accuses Snap of tolerating drug and gun sales. Drug dealers freely used the platform to advertise their wares without repercussions while also gaining ‚Äúa huge amount of subscribers.‚Äù Teens have even died after using drugs they bought after seeing them advertised on Snapchat. As harmful as these dangers are, Snapchat makes it difficult for parents to monitor their children‚Äôs Snapchat use, as only 0.33 percent of teens have joined the Family Center. Snapchat also doesn‚Äôt truly verify a user‚Äôs age, allowing fake birthdays to pass inspection. This contradicts Snap‚Äôs claims that it doesn‚Äôt let children under 13 years old use the app. Based on these accusations, it would be easy to conclude that Snapchat is a dangerous platform for underage users. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation‚Äôs Director of Corporate and Strategic Initiatives, Lina Nealon, said: ‚ÄúIn my conversations with law enforcement, child safety experts, lawyers, survivors, and youth, I ask them what the most dangerous app is, and without fail, Snap is in the top two.‚Äù In a statement Snap sent to Engadget last month when the lawsuit was filed, the company claimed to be diligently removing bad actors and working with law enforcement. Today, Snap provided the following statement in regards to the unsealed complaint: \"We designed Snapchat as a place to communicate with a close circle of friends, with built-in safety guardrails, and have made deliberate design choices to make it difficult for strangers to discover minors on our service. We continue to evolve our safety mechanisms and policies, from leveraging advanced technology to detect and block certain activity, to prohibiting friending from suspicious accounts, to working alongside law enforcement and government agencies, among so much more. We care deeply about our work here and it pains us when bad actors abuse our service. We know that no one person, agency, or company can advance this work alone, which is why we are working collaboratively across the industry, government, and law enforcement to exchange information and concept stronger defenses.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-unsealed-new-mexico-snapchat-lawsuit-alleges-the-company-ignored-child-safety-154235977.html?src=rss",
