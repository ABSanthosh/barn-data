  "text": "One match down, three to go - and it was Chelsea who came out on top against Manchester City in the first meeting of a quickfire four-game run.With a first trophy of the season in the bag and their quadruple hopes intact, Sonia Bompastor's side were understandably all smiles as they left Pride Park.The Women's Super League leaders were favourites to win the League Cup having gone unbeaten in all competitions this season, while City only had days to prepare with interim manager Nick Cushing starting his role on Tuesday.However, City arguably performed better in Saturday's final, creating numerous chances and putting Chelsea under pressure - before the Blues showed their ruthless streak to win 2-1 and lift the trophy. In the end, Chelsea did what they do best - winning trophies.\"It feels great for sure, I'm really happy. The performance was maybe not a great one but we find a way to win the game,\" said Bompastor.\"City are a really good team so it was a tough game, but we were expecting that. We created some opportunities and did enough to win this game.\"Bompastor's celebrations after winning her first trophy with Chelsea will be subdued. The players have a curfew and will be in bed before 21:00 GMT, she says, because in four days they will do it all again.City host Chelsea in the first leg of their Women's Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday, before a WSL showdown at Etihad Stadium and then the European second leg at Stamford Bridge. Bompastor believes winning the first match of the four can be a \"big advantage\", but does not want her players to be complacent.\"Psychologically it's really important to win the first one,\" she said.\"Of course, it won't be the main element going into the next game but in terms of confidence, it's really positive. You always recover better when you win games. \"That's a big advantage but it won't be enough just to think that because we won today, it will be enough to win the game on Wednesday. \"It's really important in this really rare situation - when you have to face the same team four times in 12 days - to take it game by game.\"The defeat for City was crushing. They came close, tested goalkeeper Hannah Hampton and fought back to grab an equaliser in the second half. City were on top before Yui Hasegawa's unfortunate own goal restored Chelsea's lead having failed to capitalise on their dominance. Now interim boss Cushing must make sure they do not lose belief. \"That's my job, to swing this into being motivation rather than the deflation of losing, or the fear that we are playing a better team,\" he said. \"I'm a simple guy. This feeling that you get when you lose finals - if that is not enough motivation, then we are playing the wrong game. \"If watching that game back doesn't give you the belief that you can go on and win... we did enough to win the game and we had many moments. \"I was proud of that. If you carry that disappointment, it won't help on Wednesday. We can't do anything about this one now.\"There was intrigue this week to see what changes Cushing would make after stepping in last minute following the sudden sacking of Gareth Taylor.Cushing previously enjoyed a successful seven-year spell at City, with his first trophy success coming in the Women's League Cup in 2016. But limited by injuries, Cushing did not change too much on the pitch, instead focusing on pushing his players to \"believe\" in their quality.Asked what worked and what did not, Cushing said: \"The result didn't work! But I want this team to be a threat and to believe that it can be a threat - however the game goes and whoever we play. I hope you could see that. \"I thought we had multiple moments in their box and put them under pressure many times. We had real belief we could get back into the game.\"These finals always swing on moments. The moment fell to Chelsea and we didn't get back in it at 2-1 down. \"But I've seen enough to know that we can be competitive in the next three games. I have the belief that this team can win. I wouldn't be here if I didn't.\"There were positives in City's performance but the concern is that Chelsea found a way to carve out a victory even when they were not at their best. \"I know this team has more than we showed today. But when you play with elite clubs, your job is to win games,\" said Bompastor. \"That is the most important thing. You have to find a way to win. I would love to have both - I would be the most happiest person. \"But if it's not possible, the one thing I would pick is winning.\"The next three games could define both clubs' seasons.City are out of the WSL title race but must secure a top-three spot to ensure they are in the Champions League next season, as well as throwing everything at their two-legged quarter-final with Chelsea. Bompastor's side remain on course to win a quadruple and will not want to lose ground in any competition.So what will Wednesday bring?\"We have to be prepared for anything. We could be seeing changes. You never know what you are coming up against,\" said Chelsea captain Millie Bright. \"It is an unusual position for two teams to be in and I don't think it's ever happened before. They are in the same position as we are.\"Momentum in football is just such a big thing, especially when you are playing the same opponent four times in a row. It is so important to be champions.\"",
