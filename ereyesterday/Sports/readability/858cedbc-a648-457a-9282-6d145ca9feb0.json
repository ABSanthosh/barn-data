  "text": "Michigan appears to have found its next offensive coordinator.According to multiple reports, the Wolverines are expected to hire North Carolina offensive coordinator Chip Lindsey. The former Troy head coach has been the offensive coordinator at North Carolina for the past two seasons. The Tar Heels are midst of a regime change after firing Mack Brown before the end of the season. The school has had conversations with Bill Belichick about succeeding Brown.Michigan’s offense was abysmal in 2024 as the Wolverines couldn’t adequately replace the talent it lost to the NFL Draft after a national title-winning season in 2023. Michigan averaged less than five yards a play and quarterbacks Davis Warren, Jack Tuttle and Alex Orji combined to throw for fewer than 1,600 yards with 10 TDs and 12 interceptions.The Wolverines finished 7-5 despite outscoring opponents by just 1.5 points per game. Michigan failed to score more than 17 points in half its games, including a Week 14 win over Ohio State. Michigan won that game 13-10 as Warren threw for just 62 yards and had two interceptions. Three days after the win, the school announced it had fired offensive coordinator Kirk Campbell. He was in his first season as Michigan's OC following Sherrone Moore's promotion to head coach to succeed Jim Harbaugh.North Carolina went 6-6 in 2024 but scored over 30 points per game and averaged six yards per play. That output also came as the Tar Heels played three different quarterbacks. Week 1 starter Max Johnson suffered a season-ending broken leg during the team’s season-opening win over Minnesota.Conner Harrell started in a Week 2 win over Charlotte, but Jacolby Criswell eventually took over as the team’s starter. Criswell completed 58% of his passes for 2,452 yards and 15 scores.The offense was powered by all-ACC running back Omarion Hampton. He rushed 281 times for 1,660 yards and 15 scores while also catching 38 passes for 373 yards. Hampton had the most receptions of any UNC player and the second-most receiving yards.Before his two seasons at UNC, Lindsey was the offensive coordinator at UCF in 2022. He spent a season there after three years leading Troy. The Trojans were 15-19 in his time as head coach.",
