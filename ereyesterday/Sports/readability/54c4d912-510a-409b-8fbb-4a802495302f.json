  "text": "NFL Nation, ESPNNov 24, 2024, 05:32 PM ETWeek 12 of the NFL season kicked off Thursday with the Cleveland Browns winning a snowy battle against the Pittsburgh Steelers.Sunday started with a handful of thrillers. The Dallas Cowboys snapped their five-game skid, beating the Washington Commanders, and the Tennessee Titans upset the Houston Texans. The Minnesota Vikings earned an overtime win against the Chicago Bears, and the Kansas City Chiefs narrowly beat the Carolina Panthers.Our NFL Nation reporters reacted to all the action, answering lingering questions coming out of each game and detailing everything else you need to know for every team. Let's get to it.Jump to: PIT-CLE | TB-NYG | DET-IND KC-CAR | NE-MIA | TEN-HOU DAL-WSH | MIN-CHIMinnesota 30, Chicago 27VikingsHow did the Vikings let this game get to overtime? Simply put, weird things happen to the Vikings at Soldier Field. The Vikings were up by 11 points with 22 seconds remaining. Although their defense allowed Bears quarterback Caleb Williams to run all over it in the fourth quarter, the real issue was tight end Johnny Mundt letting an onside kick hit him in the foot. That allowed the Bears to recover the kick long before it went the required 10 yards. If it had not been for that fluke bounce, the conversation would have been much different.Most surprising performance: No. 2 receiver Jordan Addison had a huge day, catching seven passes for a career-high 162 yards and a touchdown. The Vikings finally made an opponent pay for the attention it was paying to Justin Jefferson, but he managed only seven receiving yards in regulation. That would have been a career low before Jefferson caught a 20-yard pass in overtime.What we learned about the QB today: Quarterback Sam Darnold is tough, and he might have had his best stretch as an NFL player in overtime. He left Sunday's game for two plays in the fourth quarter because of what appeared to be an ankle injury. But he returned and completed all six of his pass attempts in overtime to salvage the game. -- Kevin Seifert Next game: vs. Cardinals (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)BearsHas Caleb Williams been more efficient with Thomas Brown as offensive coordinator? Williams has averaged 2.42 seconds before releasing his passes in Brown's two games as interim OC, which marks his quickest throws this season. That helped him go 9-of-12 for 128 yards and two touchdowns against the blitz, marking his first multi-TD game versus the blitz this season. He was 5-of-12 for 141 yards on passes with at least 15 air yards, which was his season best. His completion rate also is higher (71% to 61%).Most surprising performance: Keenan Allen was a late addition to the injury report Friday after rolling an ankle in practice, but he turned in a season-high (and team-best) nine catches for 86 yards and a touchdown. He ignited the Bears' dormant deep passing game when he hauled in a 40-yard reception from Williams that set up Chicago's lone touchdown in the first quarter. This was Allen's third game with double-digit targets.Eye-popping stat: After his blocked game-winning attempt against Green Bay, Cairo Santos' first field goal attempt of the afternoon was blocked by the Vikings. His three blocked field goal attempts are the most in the NFL this season and Chicago's most in a season since 2012 (also three). He converted on two other attempts, including a 48-yarder to send the game into overtime. -- Courtney CroninNext game: at Lions (Thursday, 12:30 p.m. ET)Dallas 34, Washington 26CowboysHow the heck did the Cowboys pull that off? The Cowboys entered the game with more than $100 million in salary cap space on injured reserve in Dak Prescott, DeMarcus Lawrence, Zack Martin, Trevon Diggs and Brandin Cooks. Their best offensive lineman, Tyler Smith (ankle), was also ruled out Sunday. They overcame two missed field goal attempts, a deflected punt, a penalty on a kickoff and iced the game on a pair of kickoff returns by KaVontae Turpin (99 yards) and Juanyeh Thomas (43 yards) after Washington nearly pulled off its second miracle of the season.What we learned about the QB today: Cooper Rush is steady, and that's what teams need from their backup quarterback. Against the Commanders, Rush completed a season-high 78.5% of his passes and avoided big mistakes. His previous best as a starter was 67.7% in a 2022 win against the Giants. He threw two touchdown passes in the second half and looked like the quarterback who went 4-1 as Prescott's replacement in 2022.Early prediction for next week: When the Cowboys host the Giants, don't expect an uptick in the quality of football after the Giants lost 30-7 to the Buccaneers. This will be just the fourth time in the Super Bowl era that both teams are under .500 when playing on Thanksgiving. At least the Cowboys enter the game with a win. -- Todd ArcherNext game: vs. Giants (Thursday, 4:30 p.m. ET)play0:49Commanders' miracle comeback attempt falls short after Seibert's missed XPTerry McLaurin hauls in an 86-yard touchdown, but Austin Seibert misses the game-tying extra point as the Cowboys beat the Commanders.CommandersWhat's wrong with the offense? Washington's offense powered its 7-2 start. Now it's responsible for its past two losses. Dallas' defense entered the game ranked 29th in scoring and 23rd in yards, but Washington managed only 319 yards, surpassing 300 for the first time in three games. The offensive line is banged up, and in the past three games, its running backs have averaged 3.2 yards per carry and gained 181 yards combined.What we learned about the QB today: It hasn't been good. The pass game lacked any rhythm, and quarterback Jayden Daniels averaged just 3.9 yards per attempt until he had to throw downfield to play catch-up late in the game. Daniels was considered an MVP contender early in the season. Now they just need to get him back to being the presumptive Offensive Rookie of the Year.Biggest hole in the game plan: The kicking game. Austin Seibert missed two extra points and a 51-yard field goal attempt. Entering the game, Seibert had made 25 of 28 field goal attempts and all 22 extra-point attempts. However, he had missed the past two weeks with a hip injury and was bad Sunday. Tyler Ott's low snaps and a 99-yard kick return by the Cowboys didn't help, either. -- John KeimNext game: vs. Titans (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)Tennessee 32, Houston 27TitansIs the Titans' offense starting to wake up? The Titans scored 30 points for the second time this season. Before reaching that threshold against the Dolphins in Week 4, Tennessee had not done it since Jan 2, 2022. Nick Westbrook-Ikhine continued his hot play with his sixth touchdown in six games. The suddenly explosive passing game produced three plays of 30 yards or more, matching last week's output against the Vikings.Eye-popping stat: Will Levis absorbed seven sacks in the first half, becoming the first QB to be sacked at least seven times in multiple halves of a season since Randall Cunningham with the Eagles in 1986. Levis was also sacked seven times by the Packers in the second half of a Week 3 loss.What we learned about the QB today: Levis continues to be late on throws. At least three of Houston's eight sacks could have been avoided if he saw receivers coming open. His predetermined read kept him from seeing Texans safety Jimmie Ward in the passing lane, leading to a pick-six. But Levis showed resilience, connecting with Chig Okonkwo for a 70-yard touchdown that held up as the game winner. -- Turron DavenportNext game: at Commanders (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)TexansWill the Texans' defensive struggles become a trend? The Texans allowed quarterback Will Levis to go 18-of-23 for 278 passing yards and two touchdowns. In December, Houston faces the Dolphins, Chiefs and Ravens, whose offenses can score in bunches. Those issues must get fixed or the hopes of a deep playoff run won't materialize.Eye-popping stat: Ka'imi Fairbairn's missed 28-yard field goal attempt in the fourth quarter marked just the fourth missed field goal of 29 or fewer yards (out of 159 attempts) in the NFL this season. Two of those four misses are by Fairbairn.What we learned about the QB today: C.J. Stroud's performance was a mixed bag. He threw multiple touchdown passes for the first time since Oct. 13, but he also threw multiple interceptions for the second time in three weeks and was sacked four times. Houston's line has allowed 17 sacks in its past four games. -- DJ Bien-AimeNext game: at Jaguars (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)Miami 34, New England 15DolphinsCan Miami's offense continue to be efficient at Green Bay on Thanksgiving? The temperatures for the Dolphins' game against the Packers are expected to drop below freezing -- which has historically been the Dolphins' kryptonite. But with a continued emphasis on high-efficiency passes and ball control this season, Miami appears to be better equipped to play in frigid temperatures than it was in either of the past two seasons. If it can overcome the weather, Thursday night presents an intriguing matchup for Miami against a Packers defense that ranks 22nd in defensive expected points added since Week 8.What we learned about the QB today: Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has matured as a passer, and that was on full display Sunday with a four-touchdown performance. He completed 72.5% of his passes against the Patriots -- not far from his career-high 74% this season. It's clear he is less insistent on attempting deep passes and more willing to take what defenses give him.Early prediction for next week: Tight end Jonnu Smith will have another big game against the Packers. He has scored three touchdowns in his past two games and faces a Green Bay defense that has allowed the 13th-most yards to opposing tight ends this season (entering Sunday). Miami's intention to run the passing offense through Smith is no secret, but Green Bay is still more likely to shade coverage toward receivers Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle. -- Marcel Louis-JacquesNext game: at Packers (Thursday, 8:20 p.m. ET)play0:16De'Von Achane waltzes in for 2nd TD of game for DolphinsDe'Von Achane gets the pass from Tua Tagovailoa and runs it in to increase the Dolphins' lead to 21-0.PatriotsWas this no-show effort an outlier or a sign of things to come in the final five games? The Patriots had played competitively in four games since coach Jerod Mayo called the team out for \"playing soft,\" so this was a big step back. It was a poor reflection on Mayo and his staff, as well as the players. The Patriots return home to face the Colts on Sunday, then they have their bye week before finishing the season against the Cardinals, Bills, Chargers and Bills again. Mayo has said he hopes to be a team that no one wants to play coming down the home stretch. They hardly looked like that against Miami.Describe the game in two words: Undisciplined mess. The Patriots had nine penalties in the first half, six of which were pre-snap infractions: four false starts, one offensive offside and one defensive neutral zone infraction. Before a team can beat an opponent, it has to not beat itself.Biggest hole in the game plan: Was there a game plan? The Dolphins ran circles around them, especially in a 24-0 second quarter, which was the largest scoring margin for a team in any NFL quarter this season. Tackling on defense was also shoddy. -- Mike ReissNext game: vs. Colts (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)Kansas City 30, Carolina 27ChiefsWhat does the emergence of more receiver options mean for the rest of the Chiefs' season? The Chiefs can't have too many threats, so having another reliable receiver is a welcome development for them. It's unlikely their passing game will feature as many big plays as they envisioned before the start of the season, but the Chiefs showed against the Panthers they can be effective with mostly shorter gains. Wide receiver Hollywood Brown could return later in the season, which would give the Chiefs yet another threat.Eye-popping stat: Tight end Noah Gray had 11.9 yards of separation on his first touchdown, which is the most yards of separation on a Chiefs receiving touchdown in the past two seasons. He was wide open.Most surprising performance: The Chiefs on defense had more trouble with quarterback Bryce Young and the Carolina offense than expected. The Panthers entered the game averaging 281 yards (last in the league) and 17 points (30th). But the Chiefs failed to contain them. Carolina had 249 passing yards, allowing the Panthers to tie the game with less than two minutes left. -- Adam TeicherNext game: vs. Raiders (Friday, 3 p.m. ET)PanthersDid Bryce Young earn the right to start the rest of the season? Coach Dave Canales has been careful not to name Young the starter each week until evaluating the film. No further need. The top pick of the 2023 draft had his best game, considering the opponent, and deserves to play out the season. He handled the blitz in particular like a seasoned pro. He was blitzed on 38% of dropbacks. He was 11-of-13 for a season-high 135 yards with a touchdown against five or more defenders.Describe the game in two words: Turning point? Despite the loss, Carolina went toe-to-toe with the two-time defending Super Bowl champions. This might have been a bigger confidence booster than the consecutive wins against the Saints and Giants entering the day. Young looked great. The defense created pressure (5 sacks). This team had an identity.Biggest hole in the game plan: Defending the Chiefs' second tight end, Noah Gray. He had four catches for 66 yards and two touchdowns, including a 35-yarder on the first series. The Panthers did a decent job on star Travis Kelce, but Gray made them pay throughout the afternoon. -- David NewtonNext game: vs. Bucs (Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET)Detroit 24, Indianapolis 6LionsAre Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery the NFL's top rushing duo? Nicknamed \"Sonic \u0026 Knuckles,\" Gibbs and Montgomery combined for three rushing touchdowns against the Colts, becoming the first duo in NFL history with 10 rushing touchdowns each in consecutive seasons. Sunday's game also marked the 11th time both backs have scored a touchdown in the same game -- including the playoffs -- which is the most such games by an RB duo in NFL history, per ESPN Research. At this point, it's not a question of whether they're the best in the league; the production speaks for itself. It's now time to decide their place in league history, if they can keep it up.Biggest hole in the game plan: Defending the deep ball. Dealing with a groin injury, rookie cornerback Terrion Arnold was ruled out for Sunday's game and didn't travel with the team. His absence was felt. Detroit's defense allowed Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson to connect with Michael Pittman Jr. for a 30-yard pass and another 39-yard bomb to Alec Pierce.Most surprising performance: Lions wideout Tim Patrick. In the Lions' previous four games, Patrick logged five receptions for 38 yards, but he found a groove against the Colts. He grabbed four receptions for 55 yards, including a 27-yard catch at the end of the first quarter, which helped the Lions' offense find an early rhythm. -- Eric WoodyardNext game: vs. Bears (Thursday, 12:30 p.m. ET)play0:46Lions lose two players in the 3rd quarter to injuryLions' players David Montgomery and Kalif Raymond head to the locker room with apparent injuries in the third quarter.ColtsDo the Colts still have a realistic shot at the postseason? The Colts entered the day in the eighth position among AFC playoff contenders and didn't help their case with a loss. After starting the day with a 34% shot at the playoffs, according to ESPN Analytics, the defeat lowered those chances to 27% independent of other outcomes. On the other hand, the Colts have one of the more favorable schedules down the stretch, with four of their five remaining opponents currently under .500. In any case, it will take significant work for them to reverse the damage done to their postseason hopes by losing four of their past five games.What we learned about the QB today: Sunday demonstrated that Anthony Richardson needs more help from his supporting cast. Indianapolis was flagged for a season-high eight offensive penalties, several of them proving to be crushing by negating big plays from the quarterback. Richardson also had some underwhelming performances from his pass targets, including a dropped touchdown by tight end Drew Ogletree.Eye-popping stat: This was the first loss in a game in which the Colts did not commit a turnover since a loss to the Raiders on Jan. 2, 2022. In the past five seasons, the Colts have 22 games in which they have avoided a turnover. They are now 19-3 in those contests. The Colts' six points Sunday is the fewest scored in any of those three losses. -- Stephen HolderNext game: at Patriots (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)Tampa Bay 30, N.Y. Giants 7BuccaneersIs this the jolt the Bucs needed to ignite a playoff push? Yes, as long as Baker Mayfield's stinger isn't serious and these late-game fumbles stop. Getting franchise leading scorer Mike Evans back was huge. So was having both starting cornerbacks in Jamel Dean and Zyon McCollum, and waiver wire pickup Mike Edwards, who came in at safety on third-down passing situations and then to relieve Jordan Whitehead after he had a pectoral injury in the fourth quarter. Only one of their remaining opponents -- the Los Angeles Chargers -- has a winning record.What we learned about the QB today: Mayfield still has some of that Oklahoma swag. Never mind the Bucs came into Sunday's game on a four-game losing streak. He hurdled Giants cornerback Cor'Dale Flott, did Giants quarterback Tommy DeVito's signature celebration and sprinted downfield to deliver a block on Bucky Irving's 56-yard run.Eye-popping stat: The Bucs had 11 different receiving targets catch passes, tied for their most in a game in franchise history. This was last done Week 16 of 2020, when Tom Brady threw for four touchdowns in a 47-7 win over the Lions, according to ESPN Research. -- Jenna LaineNext game: at Panthers (Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET)GiantsHow much did the release of Daniel Jones lead to this blowout loss? It's hard to imagine it wasn't a significant factor. The Giants benched their starting quarterback, saw him step in as a scout-team safety during a walk-through period at practice Thursday, and he was released by Friday. Players such as captain Dexter Lawrence said publicly they thought Jones was still the team's best quarterback. Clearly, it had an effect. DeVito hardly provided the \"spark\" or energy that coach Brian Daboll thought it would as his team fell behind 23-0 by halftime.What we learned about the QB today: DeVito isn't the answer. He went 3-of-5 passing for 31 yards with three sacks in the first half. He finished 21-of-31 passing for 189 yards. He was also sacked four times. Not that DeVito stood a chance. The Giants lost left tackle Jermaine Eluemunor on the opening drive. That put third-string left tackle Chris Hubbard into the game opposite Evan Neal for what was already the lowest-scoring offense in the NFL.Most surprising performance: A no-show by the Giants defense coming out of the bye week. Inexcusable. At points, Lawrence stood despondent, by himself, on the sideline. Perhaps it was because the defense barely sniffed Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield during a sackless afternoon while allowing 400-plus yards of offense. -- Jordan RaananNext game: at Cowboys (Thursday, 4:30 p.m. ET)Pittsburgh 24, Cleveland 19SteelersIs this loss a wake-up call for the Steelers' offense? Don't be distracted by the first part of Russell Wilson's stat line. Yes, the quarterback completed 21 of 28 attempts for 270 yards and a touchdown, but he was also sacked four times. And the offense had six empty possessions that ended either with a punt, turnover on downs or a turnover. Wilson had some moments of field-stretching brilliance, firing off three deep balls on third-down completions to Calvin Austin, Van Jefferson and George Pickens, but he also struggled against pressure. Winning like they did against the Ravens, with six Chris Boswell field goals, isn't sustainable. It wasn't against the Browns, and it won't be as the gauntlet of AFC North games continues.Describe the game in two words: Trap game. Hindsight is 20/20, but this had all the makings of a trap game. Though the Steelers said they didn't overlook the hapless Browns, they were clearly overpowered and outwitted by a motivated team playing with nothing to lose. Browns coach Kevin Stefanski took risks that paid off, while Steelers coach Mike Tomlin did the opposite.Eye-popping stat: Though they briefly erased their 12-point deficit, the Steelers are the only franchise that hasn't overcome a deficit of 12 or more points in the fourth quarter of a regular-season game since 2000, per ESPN Research. -- Brooke PryorNext game: at Bengals (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)BrownsWill the Browns play spoiler during the final stretch of the season? Thursday night's win over the Steelers marked the Browns' second upset victory over a divisional opponent, coming weeks after they stunned the Ravens. With four of its final six games coming against teams with winning records, Cleveland has the opportunity to play spoiler a few more times and a strong finish could raise optimism heading into the offseason with a roster that disappointed in the first half of the season.Describe the game in two words: No quit. Four days after giving up 21 points in the fourth quarter of a blowout loss to the Saints -- their seventh defeat in their previous eight games -- the Browns delivered a gritty victory at home against the division-leading Steelers.Most surprising performance: Browns offensive tackle Jack Conklin. The veteran lineman held outside linebacker T.J. Watt to just one pressure across 24 matchups. It was just the second game this season that Watt was held to one pressure. -- Daniel OyefusiNext game: at Broncos (Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET)",
