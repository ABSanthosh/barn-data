Golden State is eager to find another star to play alongside franchise star Stephen Curry.Due to Phoenix's 25-24 record and ninth-place standing in the West entering Wednesday, teams have been aggressively calling the Suns and have inquired about Durant.However, sources told Charania that Durant does not want to go back to Golden State, after he helped the Warriors win back-to-back titles in two of his three seasons there.Durant won Finals MVP in both the 2017 and 2018 NBA Finals.The Suns hope to continue to build around Durant and Devin Booker, but it is unclear where trade talks go between now and the deadline.",
