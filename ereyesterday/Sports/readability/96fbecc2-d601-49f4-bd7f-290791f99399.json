  "text": "Football fans have become accustomed to debating the use of technology in the game over recent years - but in the FA Cup fourth round, its absence has provided a frequent talking point.With video assistant referee technology only in use from the fifth round onwards this season, there have been a number of controversial incidents to dissect.Some liked VAR's absence, such as Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler, whose side might have had their winner against Chelsea disallowed for a Tariq Lamptey handball.\"But that's it. That's football,\" he told BBC Sport. \"With VAR, football is getting not that emotional like it was today. \"Everyone agrees with me that today was a great atmosphere. You can celebrate a goal because you are certain it's a goal. I'm happy it was like that.\"Some were less convinced, including his Chelsea counterpart Enzo Maresca - whose side might still be in the FA Cup with VAR.\"I think the handball is quite clear. In the last two or three days, there were many different moments in different games that, without VAR, sometimes are more complicated,\" said Maresca. However he added: \"Sometimes even with VAR, you never know if it's [going to be given as] handball or not. I don't know. This season we saw so many handballs and the VAR was not there.\"Even Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim admitted Harry Maguire's dramatic late winner against Leicester City in the round's first tie on Friday was offside and should not have stood.There were several further high-profile incidents during Saturday's matches, and there are still five games to be played over the next three days.So, what's going on with VAR in the FA Cup - and why?The Football Association confirmed in December that VAR technology would only be introduced from the fifth round onwards to ensure a \"consistent refereeing approach for all clubs taking part in the same stage of the competition\".Because of infrastructure and operational costs, VAR had previously only been used at Premier League grounds, and at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-finals and final.There have been 13 VAR mistakes in the Premier League so far this season - down from 20 at the same point last term - say league bosses.However, to confuse matters, goalline technology has been in use at Premier League and Championship grounds - where the infrastructure exists - in this year's competition, despite not being available everywhere.That includes at St Andrew's, where Newcastle United beat Birmingham City after Joe Willock's controversial equaliser was judged to have crossed the line.\"I think it's refreshing they had no VAR and I wish they had this throughout the competition,\" former Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given said on BBC One following that match.\"If there was any doubt, you have to give Birmingham the benefit of the doubt, but the linesman was adamant [that Willock's shot crossed the line].\"But, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, former Birmingham defender Matthew Upson said it was \"impossible to tell\" whether the ball had crossed the line.It was a situation that would have been resolved instantly by goalline technology, which utilises Hawk-Eye to detect the exact position of the ball.\"We have no definitive answer and we have watched it 100 times,\" former Blues player Curtis Davies said on BBC One. \"When the computer makes a decision, you have no one to point the finger at. It's more of a guess. I don't know how the linesman makes a conclusive decision.\"Match: Birmingham City 2-3 Newcastle UnitedWhat happened? Birmingham City goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell was positioned behind his goal line but believed he had kept out Joe Willock's close-range shot. The linesman flagged to award Newcastle the goal and, with no technology at the home of the League One leaders, that decision stood.Match: Leyton Orient 1-2 Manchester CityWhat happened? It was the moment Leyton Orient's Jamie Donley wrote his name in cup folklore - but should it have stood? Manchester City, who made a full recovery from their shock setback after Donley's shot from 50 yards put the League One side ahead, felt Nico Gonzalez was fouled by Sonny Perkins in the build-up.Match: Manchester United 2-1 Leicester CityWhat happened? Harry Maguire scored a controversial stoppage-time winner for FA Cup holders Manchester United, heading in Bruno Fernandes' free-kick in the 93rd minute. But while replays showed Maguire was clearly offside from the set-piece, it was not picked up by the on-field officials.Match: Brighton 2-1 ChelseaWhat happened? Tariq Lamptey's shot was blocked and clearly came back and hit his arm. Chelsea could not clear and moments later Georginio Rutter picked out Kaoru Mitoma to score Brighton's winner.What you had to say...Will: Hilarious. Complain about handballs and offsides given with VAR, then complain when VAR isn't there to give handballs and offsides.Anon: It's almost like with no VAR, we've gone the other way. Just allow handballs to go. Officials have become too reliant.Stu: Only two handballs in the build-up to Brighton goal, no problem.Tom: Nice not having VAR. Back to the good old days of just having to accept the refs are humans and miss things. Only thing that should be at every ground is goalline technology.Alan: Disaster not having VAR. Why in some rounds of the FA Cup and not others? Leicester were knocked out because of not having VAR in use.",
