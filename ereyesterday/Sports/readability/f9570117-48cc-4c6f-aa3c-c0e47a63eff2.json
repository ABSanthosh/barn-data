  "text": "The Premier League has warned its clubs it will be \"taking the necessary time\" to decide how to respond to this week's landmark verdict in the legal battle with Manchester City over rules governing commercial deals.In a letter sent by chief executive Richard Masters - and seen by BBC Sport - he hints at a possible delay to a key meeting to discuss the situation, advising there could be an \"impact on the scheduling\".Both sides claimed victory after the decision of an arbitration panel was published on Monday following a legal challenge by City against the league's associated party transaction (APT) regulations.APT rules are in place to ensure sponsorship deals with companies linked to clubs' owners represent fair market value.City had some complaints upheld, with two aspects of the rules deemed unlawful by the tribunal.The tribunal said low-interest shareholder loans should not be excluded from the scope of APT rules, and that changes made in February to toughen up the regulations also breached competition law.In its initial response on Monday, the Premier League said the panel \"endorsed the overall objectives, framework and decision-making of the APT system\", adding it would seek to amend its rules \"quickly and effectively\".Its Financial Controls Advisory Group and Legal Advisory Group are due to meet next Tuesday, with a full meeting of the clubs following on Thursday.However, in his latest correspondence to clubs, Masters says: \"There have been many club conversations over recent days, with constructive and informative feedback provided.\"We now have a comprehensive set of information and data which is helping to inform our recommended approach and rule amendment drafting.\"We are taking the necessary time to develop our proposals and the associated draft rule amendments for club consideration.\"We will circulate these to clubs when fully considered and ready, which may impact on the scheduling of our planned meetings with Financial Controls and Legal Advisory Groups, and all clubs next week.\"Earlier this week, City claimed the Premier League‘s summary of the panel’s ruling was \"misleading\" and contained \"several inaccuracies\", in an escalation of the dispute.In a letter sent to top-flight clubs and the Premier League, City wrote that the rules were now \"void\", that the club had \"concern [over] the Premier League's suggestion that new APT rules should be passed within the next 10 days\", and signalled possible further legal action if there was a \"knee-jerk reaction\".The league declined to comment.Clubs approached by the BBC have expressed different views over the situation. One referred to \"general concern at the potential destabilising effect of this ongoing dispute\".Another said: \"We want to move forward… there will obviously be modifications to the rules and it needs to be done in a thoughtful way and we go on. We want to focus on the football.\"Several others declined to comment.The league has also written to the tribunal panel to get further clarity on the status of the APT regulations.This case is not directly related to the Premier League disciplinary commission, which will hear 115 charges against City for allegedly breaching its financial regulations, some of which date back to 2009. City deny wrongdoing.",
