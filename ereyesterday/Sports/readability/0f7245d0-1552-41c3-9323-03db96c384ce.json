Bryan Reynolds hit a two-run single two batters later, and Skenes and three relievers made it hold up. David Bednar worked the ninth for his 14th save.Parker Meadows doubled for Detroit, which has dropped seven of eight but still has a double-digit lead in the AL Central. Flaherty lasted three innings and is winless in his last seven starts.AdvertisementKey momentThe closest Detroit came to scoring against Skenes came in the third when the Tigers' first two batters reached. A fly ball, a fielder's choice, and a strikeout on a 99 mph fastball later, Skenes was back in the dugout.Key statPirates designated hitter Andrew McCutchen recorded his 2,233rd career hit on a single in the fourth inning, moving past Hall of Famer Willie Stargell and into 180th on MLB's hit list.Up nextDetroit's Casey Mize (9-3, 3.15 ERA) will try to reach 10 wins for the first time in his career on Tuesday when he faces Pittsburgh's Mitch Keller (3-10, 3.48).___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",
