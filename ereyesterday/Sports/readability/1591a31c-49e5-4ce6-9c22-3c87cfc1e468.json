  "text": "Seattle sends two-time Pro Bowl WR DK Metcalf to the Steelers (1:03)Check out the stats behind Seahawks WR DK Metcalf being traded to the Steelers. (1:03)Brooke PryorMar 9, 2025, 08:02 PM ETCloseBrooke Pryor is a reporter for NFL Nation at ESPN who has covered the Pittsburgh Steelers since 2019. She previously covered the Kansas City Chiefs for the Kansas City Star and the University of Oklahoma for The Oklahoman.PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers cannonballed into free agency Sunday night, acquiring wide receiver DK Metcalf from the Seattle Seahawks for a 2025 second-round pick and signing him to a five-year, $150 million extension, sources to ESPN's Adam Schefter.The Steelers and Seahawks are also flipping 2025 picks in the sixth and seventh rounds, sources said.Metcalf, the 27-year-old 2019 second-round pick, requested a trade on March 5 as he entered the final year of a three-year, $72 million extension signed in 2022. He previously had one year left on his contract worth $18 million, but the Steelers worked quickly to secure their new wideout to a deal worth $30 million annually.That figure puts him in rare air among wide receivers and among Steelers free agents. Only six other wide receivers have contracts currently valued at least $30 million annually, and before Metcalf's extension, the most the Steelers spent on an outside free agent was Patrick Queen's three-year, $41 million contract signed last free agency.Metcalf's trade comes only a few days after the Seahawks dealt quarterback Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders. Following both trades, the Seahawks have five picks in the first three rounds of the 2025 draft: Nos. 18, 50, 52 (via Pittsburgh), 82 and 92 (via Las Vegas).In Metcalf, the Steelers finally landed their long-hunted big-play receiver to round out a wide receiver room that lacked depth and star power behind 2022 second-round pick George Pickens. Metcalf averaged 15.0 yards per reception and 66.1 yards per game in 2024, collecting 66 receptions, 992 receiving yards and a career-low five touchdowns.Metcalf was more productive in the first six games of the season, averaging nine targets in the Seahawks' first six games. But after hurting his MCL in Week 7, Metcalf missed two games and averaged just under six targets per game the rest of the season.Since the Seahawks traded up to snag Metcalf out of Ole Miss with the final pick of the second round in the 2019 draft, the big-bodied receiver has averaged 1,054 receiving yards and eight touchdowns per season along with 14.4 yards per reception. Meanwhile Pickens, the Steelers' top receiver, averaged 64.3 yards per game and 15.3 yards per catch in his third season in Pittsburgh. He also caught three touchdowns in an injury-shortened season.The next most productive wide receiver on the Steelers' 2024 roster was fellow 2022 draft pick Calvin Austin III, who averaged 15.2 yards per reception and finished the year with just 548 receiving yards and four touchdowns.The Steelers' pursuit of a top-tier wide receiver dates back to the previous offseason when they were in the mix for 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. Aiyuk, however, opted to remain in San Francisco with a four-year, $120 million deal. The Steelers also landed wide receiver Mike Williams at the trade deadline from the New York Jets in exchange for a 2025 fifth-round pick, but Williams wasn't a major contributor after a game-winning catch against the Washington Commanders less than a week after being traded.Though the Steelers significantly upgraded their wide receiver room with the Metcalf acquisition, they still don't have a quarterback under contract for the 2025 season. Both Justin Fields and Russell Wilson are slated to be free agents when the new league year opens on Wednesday afternoon, and sources told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler that Fields wants to test the market before making an informed decision.Wilson and Metcalf both starred together in Seattle, with the Wilson serving as Metcalf's quarterback for the first three seasons of his career.The Jets have also expressed interest in the former Bears first-round pick, sources indicated to Fowler. Steelers general manager Omar Khan told reporters at the NFL Combine the team's top priority was sorting out the quarterback position, but Metcalf requested a trade earlier this week, expediting the Steelers' roster-building timeline.ESPN's Brady Henderson contributed to this report.",
