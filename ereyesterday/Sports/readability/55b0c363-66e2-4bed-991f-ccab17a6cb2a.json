  "text": "'We focus on ourselves' - what has derby drama done to title race? Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mohamed Salah's goal at Everton had looked set to move Liverpool nine points clear at the top, before James Tarkowski struckJust as it looked like Liverpool were about to go nine points clear at the top, up stepped James Tarkowski.The Everton defender struck a dramatic equaliser in the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park to leave the Reds having to settle for a draw.Toffees fans celebrated the moment wildly, but so too will Arsenal supporters with the result providing some hope that their side can catch Liverpool.With every side having now played 24 games, Arsenal are seven points behind with 14 games to go.Liverpool are in the ideal position, despite the setback, and captain Virgil van Dijk told BBC Sport: \"The main thing for us is to completely focus on ourselves, don't look at what others are doing and writing, just focus on us.\"Every game will be tough until the end of the season, then we will see at the end of the road if it is enough. \"But we have put ourselves in a good position and we have to keep fighting.\"Can Liverpool be caught?With 42 points to play for Liverpool can, of course, be caught.History, however, tells us that it is pretty unlikely.When the teams behind the league leaders have also played 24 games then the biggest deficit overhauled in the Premier League era was five points. That was achieved just twice - by Manchester United in 2003 and Manchester City six years ago.The biggest points gap that has been overturned after the leaders had played 24 games is nine points. That was also achieved twice - Manchester United in 1996 and Arsenal in 1998 - but they had one and two games in hand respectively.The Opta supercomputer has given Liverpool an 88.3% chance of winning the league, compared to just 11.6% for Arsenal.Nottingham Forest, third in the table, are 10 points behind the Reds and no side has hauled such a gap back to finish first from this stage of season. They have been given a 0.1% chance of ending the season with the trophy.Chelsea are fourth while defending champions Manchester City are 16 points behind Liverpool - both sides have been given 0% chance of winning the Premier League this season by the Opta supercomputer.What are Liverpool's remaining fixtures?Liverpool's recent form: DWWWDIt is a hectic few weeks for Liverpool with the Reds having league games pretty much every three days until the end of the month.But things ease considerably in March, when the Reds play just one league game - a home fixture against bottom club Southampton.That's not to say it is a quiet month, however, with Liverpool having the small matter of the EFL Cup final against Newcastle on 16 March.On either 4 or 5 March Liverpool will also have the will the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie, where they will travel to one of Paris St-Germain, Benfica, Monaco or Brest. The return leg at Anfield will take place a week later.Liverpool finish the season with a home game against Crystal Palace - by which point they would hope to have already had the title wrapped up.Liverpool's final 14 Premier League games:16 February: Wolves (H)19 February: Aston Villa (A)23 February: Man City (A)26 February: Newcastle (H)8 March: Southampton (H)2 April: Everton (H)5 April: Fulham (A)12 April: West Ham (H)19 April: Leicester (A)26 April: Tottenham (H)3 May: Chelsea (A)10 May: Arsenal (H)18 May: Brighton (A)25 May: Crystal Palace (H)What are Arsenal's remaining fixtures?Arsenal's recent form: DWDWWArsenal are currently unbeaten in 14 league matches (W9 D5) â€“ their longest run without defeat under Mikel Arteta.They have one fewer Premier League game than Liverpool in the rest of this month, but play one more than the Reds in March.Gunners fans will be hoping their side are still in the title race when they go to Anfield on 10 May because getting a result in that game would set them up for a home fixture against Newcastle and then an away trip to Southampton on the final day, by which point the Saints could be relegated.Arsenal's final 14 Premier League games:15 February: Leicester (A)22 February: West Ham (H)26 February: Nottingham Forest (A)9 March: Man Utd (A)16 March: Chelsea (H)1 April: Fulham (H)5 April: Everton (A)12 April: Brentford (H)19 April: Ipswich (A)26 April: Crystal Palace (H)3 May: Bournemouth (H)10 May: Liverpool (A)18 May: Newcastle (H)25 May: Southampton (A)Who has the easier run in?Half of Liverpool's games are against teams in the top half of the table, with potentially tricky trips to Aston Villa and Manchester City coming up in their next three games.They also play rivals Arsenal towards the end of the season but have the advantage of being hosts for that encounter.Arsenal, meanwhile, face six sides in the top half of the table in their final 14 games.How costly could Havertz injury be for Gunners?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Kai Havertz has scored nine goals in the Premier League this seasonOn paper Arsenal may have the marginally easier run-in but they have been rocked this week with the news striker Kai Havertz could be out for the season.The 25-year-old suffered a muscle injury on the team's Dubai training camp and is currently being assessed.Havertz has made 34 appearances across all competitions this season and is the club's top scorer with 15 goals and five assists.The Gunners are already missing forward players Gabriel Martinelli and Bukayo Saka through hamstring injuries and striker Gabriel Jesus is out for the rest of the season with an anterior cruciate ligament injury.They also did not manage to sign another striker during the winter transfer window.More on this story",
