(2:42)Kendra AndrewsMar 28, 2025, 07:33 PM ETSPOKANE, Wash. -- USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb made it clear Friday that she did not think the play that resulted in JuJu Watkins' season-ending ACL tear was dirty.Gottlieb also condemned the online bullying against Mississippi State player Chandler Prater, who was guarding Watkins when she was injured in the first quarter of the Trojans' second-round win Monday.\"There was nothing to me that looked like it had any intent to hurt her. ... I mean, that's not a USC view at all,\" Gottlieb said. \"It was a physical game. ... No one deserves online bullying in any realm, but certainly not a young woman in Chandler, who was trying to make a play, and unfortunately our player got hurt.\"As Watkins sprinted down the floor, Prater came to guard her and the two made contact as Watkins started to drive toward the basket. Watkins' right knee buckled, and she crumbled to the court, eventually needing assistance to get back to the locker room. It was later revealed that she tore an ACL in the knee and was done for the year.For the rest of the game, boos rained down on Mississippi State, especially any time Prater touched the ball.Bulldogs head coach Sam Purcell said after the game that he was praying for Watkins, adding that his team doesn't \"play to hurt, we play to compete.\" He also expressed his hope that the situation wouldn't stir up further unrest or ill will between the two teams.But Prater still became the subject of hateful comments online. Some fans called her a \"dirty\" player and said \"it's war\" against her. Others told her to \"learn to play basketball without fouling and injuring players.\"Prater has disabled the ability for users to comment on her most recent social media posts, but fans went to older posts to send their messages.\"We have really passionate fans, and there's a lot of love for JuJu, and I understand people being sad and hurt that she's hurt, but nobody in our camp feels like there was any type of attack on her and would not support any type of online bullying or things of that nature,\" Gottlieb said. \"She's a young person that was playing basketball, too, and I'm sure did not want any part of a negative situation that it turned out to be.\"USC continues its season Saturday in a Sweet 16 matchup against Kansas State.",
