And he demonstrated his confidence in a bogey-free first nine containing three birdies.Another birdie on the 13th left McIlroy well placed on four under before an aggressive chip from off the back of the par-five 15th green ended in the water and led to a seven.He followed that with another double bogey on the par-four 17th, blotting what had previously been a consistent card where he had played with patience and maturity.Such was his disappointment at his closing holes, McIlroy passed on post-round media interviews, and headed straight to the practice area.Clean card gives Scheffler solid startMedia caption, Scheffler features in Masters day one best shotsEven though Scheffler's start to the season has been slow by his lofty standards, he remains the man to beat.Hampered initially by a hand injury sustained when trying to roll out ravioli with a wine glass on Christmas Day, the 28-year-old American arrived at Augusta feeling he is peaking at the right time.Scheffler finished joint runner-up in Houston two weeks ago and, with the major season getting under way at the Masters, laid down another warning to his rivals that he is finding form.While not at his clinical best, he has put himself in a strong position with a bogey-free round - and, ominously for his rivals, has the capacity to go further through the gears over the next three days.His driving and iron approaches were solid, enhanced by converting a couple of lengthy putts.Scheffler set the tone with a confident birdie putt on the second, landing a monster from 62 feet on the fourth - sending the patrons into raptures - and adding another shorter one on the ninth.The two-time champion's first real mistake of the day came when he lipped out from seven feet on the 13th and had to settle for a par.But he made amends by holing from 42 feet for a two on the par-three 16th.\"I felt pretty good. Anytime you can keep a card clean out here, it's a really good thing,\" Scheffler said.\"I had to make two really good up-and-downs. But other than that, the golf course was in front of me most of the day, kept the ball in play, did a lot of really good things out there.\"Rai makes dreamy start to Masters debut Image source, ReutersPlaying at the Masters is a reward for Rai's success over the past couple of years.A maiden PGA Tour title at the Wyndham Championship last year helped the 30-year-old from Wolverhampton climb into the world's top 50.Virtually every Masters debutant - understandably - says competing at Augusta National is a \"dream come true\". Rai was no exception.It became even dreamier when he took the outright lead after four birdies on the first nine without dropping a shot.But three successive bogeys on 11, 12 and 13 - the notorious Amen Corner - were a reminder of Augusta's propensity to bite back.Rai was unfazed and rallied. Two birdies, either side of a bogey on 16, ensured he was the early clubhouse leader.\"Without playing this course under competitive conditions before, it's very difficult to figure out how it is going to play in the flow of it,\" he said.\"So I'm very, very pleased with how it went overall.\"Veteran champions roll back the yearsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Bernhard Langer was one under after nine holes before three bogeys on the second nineTwo-time champion Bernhard Langer dipped into vintage fashion as he began his 41st and final Masters appearance.The 67-year-old German wore an all-red outfit in homage to his first victory in 1985 as he carded a two-over 74.On Friday, he plans to rehash the green and yellow number he donned when he won his second Augusta title in 1993.\"It's more or less to celebrate the two outfits that I put the Green Jacket on. That's the idea behind it,\" Langer said.Fred Couples, another veteran champion, provided a magical moment when he holed out from 191 yards for an eagle on the 14th.The 65-year-old American, who won the 1992 tournament, moved to one under as a result.Couples closed out with four pars for a 71 which he hopes will help him make the cut for only the second time in the past seven years.Media caption, Fred Couples makes 191-yard eagle on 14Angel Cabrera, the 2009 champion who is making a controversial return this year following his release from prison, shot a three-over 75.The 55-year-old Argentine was found guilty in 2021 of numerous charges that included assault, theft and illegal intimidation against former girlfriends.While Augusta chairman Fred Ridley said Cabrera was invited to return, as all past champions are, women's action groups have expressed their disappointment with that decision.Live text commentary of round two starts at 13:00 BST on the BBC Sport website and app. Radio coverage starts on BBC 5 Live at 19:00 BST with full commentary from 20:30, or listen via BBC Sounds.",
