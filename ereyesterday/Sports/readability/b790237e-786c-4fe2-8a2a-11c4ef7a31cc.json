Hutchinson's leg appeared to snap above the ankle when it collided with the left leg of teammate Alim McNeill as Hutchinson was pulling down Prescott.The Lions said after the game that Hutchinson underwent immediate surgery at a Dallas-area hospital. Hutchinson will remain in Dallas and the team will know more on Monday about the extent of the injury, coach Dan Campbell said.After the injury, Hutchinson's left leg was placed in an air cast, as members of the Lions and Cowboys made a large circle around him. Hutchinson, who exited on a cart, finished the game with three tackles, including the sack.Hutchinson was the second pick of the 2022 NFL draft. His 7.5 sacks this season are the most through five games by a Lions player since 1983 (William Gay), per ESPN Research. Entering Week 6, Hutchinson led the NFL in sacks, pressures and pass rush win rate, although the Lions were coming off their bye week.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
