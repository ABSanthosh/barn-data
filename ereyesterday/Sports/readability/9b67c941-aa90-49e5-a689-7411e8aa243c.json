This season, after a couple of losses to the Super Bowl-favorite Lions and also the Vikings and Eagles, Green Bay finds itself in a familiar spot — looking for a wild-card berth and a chance to make some noise in the NFC in January. While the Packers have already reached 10 wins, playing in the NFL's best division hasn't been entirely kind, with losses to those heavyweights, but the fact remains that Green Bay is unbeaten against the rest of the NFL.That may pose some bad news for the Saints, who, after a good start to the year (remember when this team was averaging nearly 50 points per game after two weeks?), have come down back to earth with a thud. Head coach Dennis Allen got fired last month, and with interim boss Darren Rizzi pulling the levers, New Orleans has an eye on next season. With aging starters at key positions and uncertainty around the future, getting some momentum heading into the offseason will be important for the players who'll be around for the new regime next season.The Packers can clinch a playoff berth with a win, while the Saints will look to play spoiler at the 'Frozen Tundra' with snow showers possible for Monday evening in Green Bay.Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Lambeau Field | Green Bay, Wisc.TV Channel: ESPNStreaming: ESPN+ FuboLive3 updatesMon, December 23, 2024 at 7:51 PM ESTPackers' playoff scenariosThe Packers are all but a lock to make the playoffs at 10-4, but would mathematically clinch a wild-card berth with a win against the Saints Monday night.There's no chance that they'll win the NFC North, though. A win by the 13-2 Lions knocked the Packers out of contention for the division title on Sunday. The Packers can finish no better than tied with the Lions, who hold the tiebreaker thanks to a sweep of their regular-season series.In addition to clinching, the Packers are playing to remain in the No. 6 seed ahead of the 10-5 Washington Commanders, who project as the No. 7 seed in the NFC. The No. 7 seed faces a likely playoff path with games against the Eagles and the eventual NFC North champion, whether that's the Lions or the Vikings, a difficult road to the Super Bowl.The Packers are also seeking to avoid the disaster scenario that would knock them out of the playoffs. This would require Green Bay to lose all of its remaining three games and the Falcons (8-7) and Bucs (8-7) to win out to put two NFC South teams alongside the Commanders in the playoffs with the Packers left out. The Falcons, Bucs and Commanders would all have the tiebreaker advantage if they each finished 10-7.Mon, December 23, 2024 at 6:57 PM ESTJaire Alexander remains out for PackersPro Bowl Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander will miss a fourth-straight game with a lingering knee injury.
