  "text": "Everton have been mired in chaos in recent years and have been thrown into disarray again following a strange day at Goodison Park.New owners the Friedkin Group had promised to show their commitment to the club \"through actions, not words\" when completing their takeover in December.And they have been true to their word, making their first major decision by ruthlessly bringing Sean Dyche's tenure to an abrupt end just three hours before kick-off against Peterborough in the FA Cup third round.Everton Under-18s head coach Leighton Baines was brought in as caretaker alongside captain Seamus Coleman, and the former full-back was on duty to speak to the media after the 2-0 victory.\"It has definitely been a difficult day,\" said Baines. \"A manager losing his job isn't good and it normally follows a difficult period. Within all of that, there has to be hope and optimism.\"Things are changing at the football club with the ownership and new stadium. The manager has had to leave and that is not what anyone wants. There will be a new manager coming in and that brings opportunity.\"The football club is in a situation where it needs some stability and that was the message from the owners when they came in. Everyone would gladly accept that at the moment.\"Dyche's sacking on Thursday evening just as preparations were being finalised for the cup tie came as a real shock - not because it happened, but the nature of how it transpired.Local authorities met at lunchtime to give the game the go-ahead despite freezing conditions on Merseyside, and the Friedkin Group's bombshell decision was just as cold.Dyche had been at the club's Finch Farm training ground in the morning before being informed of the decision in the afternoon and bidding farewell to staff.Baines was then asked to report to the Titanic Hotel in Liverpool, where the players were meeting and informed of Dyche's dismissal by director of football Kevin Thelwell.Senior sources close to the club and the Friedkin Group have told BBC Sport the owners and Dyche felt they had reached the end of the road when they met for talks this week.It is claimed Dyche did not know of the decision at Tuesday's pre-match news conference, where he spoke about having \"no problem\" with the club \"succession planning\".And once he had told his superiors about taking the team as far as he could, change was inevitable and the group acted decisively to \"relieve Dyche of his duties\" at 16:32 GMT, before the 19:45 kick-off.\"Sean was here this morning and I have never had that [timing of a sacking] before,\" said Peterborough boss Darren Ferguson. \"It is very unusual for a manager to be sacked three or four hours before a game. The timing of it surprised everyone.\"Everton supporter Chris and his son were at the Peterborough tie and told BBC Sport: \"It was disrespectful to Dyche and the team, but he can't do any more than he has done. Announcing it in the morning after the game would have been better.\"The brutal nature of the dismissal was further highlighted by the club's official statement, external - no thanking Dyche for his service, or acknowledgment of the work done by him and his staff under difficult circumstances during their tenure, which lasted just short of two years.The matchday programme had been published and was being sold at the ground including Dyche's manager's column, in which he wrote about looking to start \"building some positive momentum after a couple of disappointing results\".He will not be given that opportunity.Former Everton manager David Moyes has been heavily linked with the vacancy, and though BBC Sport have been unable to verify the reports, he appears to be the best fit.The 61-year-old, out of work since leaving West Ham in the summer, is familiar with the surroundings having spent 11 seasons at Goodison Park between 2002 and 2013. He also matches the club's aim of appointing someone with Premier League experience.\"The best one who is available is David Moyes,\" former Everton captain Alan Stubbs told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"I can see Moyes being employed by Everton in the next day or two.\"Dyche's exit did little to enthuse the Everton faithful, with the game played in bitterly cold conditions amid a largely subdued atmosphere.\"Why was Goodison so flat?\" asked former Blues winger Andros Townsend on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"I thought it would be electric.\"The supporters will have to rally themselves and fully get behind the next man in, with the club hopeful of making an appointment before Wednesday's Premier League home game against Aston Villa.Dyche's successor will take charge of a side mired in another dogfight at the wrong end of the table in 16th place, just one point above the bottom three.Everton have won just three of 19 Premier League games this season and were beaten 1-0 by Bournemouth on Saturday, when they failed to register a shot on target.Though they scored two against lowly League One opposition on Thursday, finding goals in the league will be the main issue for the new manager to resolve, having netted only 15 times in those 19 league games.Townsend said: \"Looking at the bigger picture, I think it's a major red flag for this ownership.\"Whether it's the right or wrong decision, it's three hours before kick-off in an FA Cup game. It's a man who has saved you from relegation the last two years - one with a points deduction, yet somehow managed to keep them up, and this is how you treat him.\"But I think Everton have more than enough in that dressing room to stay in the Premier League.\"I don't think they will be anywhere near the bottom come the end of the season.\"Additional reporting by BBC Radio Merseyside's Giulia Bould.",
