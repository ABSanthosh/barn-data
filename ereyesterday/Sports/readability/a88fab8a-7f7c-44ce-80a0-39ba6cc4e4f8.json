(0:39)Alden GonzalezMar 31, 2025, 06:07 PM ETCloseESPN baseball reporter. Covered the L.A. Rams for ESPN from 2016 to 2018 and the L.A. Angels for MLB.com from 2012 to 2016.LOS ANGELES -- Atlanta Braves outfielder Jurickson Profar tested positive for a banned substance and will begin an 80-game suspension Monday, for the start of a three-game series at Dodger Stadium. Profar tested positive for chorionic gonadotropin, a performance-enhancing drug, according to Major League Baseball.Profar will be eligible to return to the Braves on June 29 against Philadelphia but will be ineligible for the 2025 postseason as part of his suspension.Profar, 32, signed a $1 million contract with the San Diego Padres in February 2024 and put together the best offensive season of his career last season, slashing .280/.380/.459 with 24 homers and 85 RBIs in 158 games. The Braves signed him to a three-year, $42 million deal in January to make him their everyday left fielder.In a statement sent by the MLB Players' Association, Profar called Monday \"the most difficult day of my baseball career\" and said he was \"devastated\" by the news. Profar added that he was tested eight times for PEDs in 2024 and \"never tested positive.\"\"This is especially painful for me because anyone who knows me and has seen me play knows I am deeply passionate about the game,\" Profar wrote as part of his statement. \"There is nothing I love more than competing with my teammates and being a fan favorite. I want to apologize to the entire Braves organization, my teammates, and the fans. It is because of my deep love and respect for this game that I would never knowingly do anything to cheat it.\"The Braves posted a statement on X, saying, \"We were surprised and extremely disappointed to learn that Jurickson Profar tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance in violation of Major League Baseball's Joint Prevention and Treatment Program. We fully support the Program and are hopeful that Jurickson will learn from this experience.\"The substance hCG is a hormone that helps in the production of testosterone, according to the Cleveland Clinic, as cited by The Associated Press.Profar's suspension, which is without pay, comes after a brutal opening weekend for the Braves, who were swept in a four-game series by the Padres while scoring a combined seven runs -- including zero over the last 22 innings.Profar's absence hurts the short-handed Braves. Outfielder Ronald Acuna Jr. is not expected back from the injured list for another month. Jarred Kelenic and Bryan De La Cruz have been platooning in right field in Acuna's absence. With Profar gone, the Braves can also turn to, as a down-the-road option, Alex Verdugo, who was signed to a $1.5 million deal March 20 and optioned to the minor leagues to get at-bats.For now, however, the Braves acquired outfielder Stuart Fairchild from the Cincinnati Reds for cash considerations earlier Monday and added him to the 40-man roster. He's expected to join them Tuesday. The Braves will be one player short against the Dodgers on Monday night.",
