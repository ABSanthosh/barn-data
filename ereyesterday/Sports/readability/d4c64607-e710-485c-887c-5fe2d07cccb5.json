Morant is now considered “week-to-week,” though a specific timetable for his return is not yet known.Morant went down with the injury after he crashed into a screen set by Pelicans center Daniel Theis in the third quarter on Friday. Morant fell down to the court and rolled around in pain pointing toward his shoulder. He eventually walked off the floor and left the game. Theis was initially called for an offensive foul, though it was overturned after the Pelicans challenged.Morant missed most of last season due to a suspension and a season-ending injury in his right shoulder. He underwent surgery to repair a labral tear in his shoulder in January, though he was cleared to return in July.Morant has averaged 21.2 points and 7.9 assists per game this season with the Grizzlies. Memphis will enter Tuesday’s game against the Phoenix Suns with a 22-11 record. They’ve gone 8-5 without Morant this season.This post will be updated with more information shortly.",
