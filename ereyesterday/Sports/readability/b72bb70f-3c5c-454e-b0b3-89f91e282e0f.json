Maresca has done a top job so far with his coaching staff and they look extremely dangerous.\"Premier League top scorers Chelsea followed up a 4-3 win at Tottenham with a 3-1 win over Astana in the Europa Conference League on Thursday, and Maresca's side have registered 15 goals in their past four games in all competitions.Brentford are ninth after beating Newcastle 4-2 last weekend. But while the Bees have been formidable at home so far this season they have taken just one point from a possible 21 away.They do, however, have an encouraging record at Stamford Bridge - winning all three of their Premier League games there.\"[Chelsea] have so many threats going forward and have top-quality players all over the pitch. I expect an unbelievably difficult game,\" said Frank.\"They are massive favourites but, of course, we believe that we can compete against anyone and we believe we can win.\"",
