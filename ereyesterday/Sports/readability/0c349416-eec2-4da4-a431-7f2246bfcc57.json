Up next is WR Anthony Gould.With offseason programs now behind us, we will be getting a jump start on our training camp preview by going player-by-player through the Indianapolis Colts' 91-man roster.Going alphabetically, up next is wide receiver Anthony Gould.Anthony Gould's profileHeight: 5-8Weight: 174Age: 24NFL experience: 1 seasonCollege: Oregon StateNo. 62024 Snap count totalsOffense: 15Special teams: 722024 PFF gradesOffense: 69.6Special teams: 58.52024 Season ReviewOverall, Gould's role during his rookie year was small. On his 15 offensive snaps, he did have one catch on one target for 23 yards in Week 15 against Denver.With impressive speed and a former All-American punt returner at Oregon State, the thought was that Gould could provide that unit with a spark. But after being the primary return man during the first three games, the Colts opted to go with experience, relying on Tyler Goodson, Ashton Dulin, and Josh Downs to help fill those roles.Through those first three weeks, Gould had four kick return attempts, all of which came in Week 1 against Houston, and averaged 27.3 yards per return. He had just one punt return attempt, but did total 19 yards on it.Clearly, the Colts felt that development was needed. In Week 13 and through the rest of the season, Gould again took over as the return man. For the year, he averaged 29.4 yards per kick return on seven attempts and 9.5 yards per punt return on 10 attempts.For some context around those return figures, Gould ranked 15th in average yards per kick return and 23rd in average yards per punt.Looking ahead to the 2025 seasonWith Michael Pittman, Josh Downs, Alec Pierce, and AD Mitchell at the top of the receiver depth chart, along with Shane Steichen not often using four or more wideouts on the field, we likely won't see much of Gould offensively this season. He may even end up behind Ashton Dulin again on the depth chart.However, the hope for the Colts is that he can secure the role and be the go-to return man for the entire season, providing that unit with some added juice.
