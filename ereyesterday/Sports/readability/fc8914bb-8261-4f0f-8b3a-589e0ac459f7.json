You can follow him via Twitter @RichCimini.One day after enjoying a laugh at the expense of New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, quarterback Aaron Rodgers offered an unusually curt response Tuesday when asked about Johnson -- boosting the perception of a rift between them.Rodgers, discussing his future, said he must be \"in the plans of multiple people, starting with the ownership\" for the Jets to retain him in 2025. The future Hall of Famer sidestepped a question on whether he believes Johnson wants him back.\"You should ask Woody,\" Rodgers said tersely.Has he had any conversations with Johnson about his future?\"No.\"Rodgers, 41, is preparing for what likely will be the final two games of his Jets career -- and perhaps his NFL career. Despite an MCL injury to his left knee, Rodgers said he's planning to play Sunday against the Buffalo Bills, insisting, \"There is no way I'm not playing.\" Earlier Tuesday, interim coach Jeff Ulbrich was noncommittal.With the Jets (4-11) closing out their most disappointing season in recent memory, the game is the secondary storyline for Rodgers, who continues to make headlines.On Monday, he poked Johnson during his weekly appearance on \"The Pat McAfee Show,\" saying he has never been released by a teenager -- a reference to a recent story by The Athletic that said Johnson is influenced by his teenage sons, Brick and Jack.A source told ESPN recently that he'd be \"shocked\" if Johnson, 77, brings back Rodgers, who is under contract for 2025 but hasn't played up to expectations. In Week 6, Johnson suggested benching Rodgers, sources said. That didn't sit well with Rodgers, who has battled through various leg injuries to stay on the field.In recent days, Rodgers talked openly about the possibility of being released, perhaps as soon as Jan. 6 -- the day after the season ends. He doesn't think that's likely, but he wouldn't rule it out.\"I don't think it's a high percentage,\" he said. \"I think this is probably a conversation to be had, but I'm just not naive to that being a zero [percent chance].\"Rodgers, who said he will take time after the season to mull his future, expressed gratitude to the Johnsons for bringing him to New York in 2023 -- meaning Woody and his younger brother, Christopher, the vice chairman. Rodgers and Christopher Johnson are known to have a good relationship.Rodgers said it would be \"special\" to be asked back because it would mean they see him \"as an important part of helping the culture, the changeover, whatever they do at head coach and helping the next wave of New York Jets. ... But if they don't, again, no offense at all will be taken.\"The four-time MVP also responded brusquely when asked about wide receiver Garrett Wilson, who has expressed frustration over his role in the offense. Rodgers didn't seem interested in explaining why Wilson's numbers have slipped.\"I've talked to him throughout the season about some of [his frustrations],\" Rodgers said, adding, \"Not this week. No, not in the last couple of weeks, but it's not the first time. So, there's been conversations about it.\"After being a nonfactor for most of Sunday's game, a 19-9 loss to the Los Angeles Rams, Wilson said he wants more targets, but \"people see it differently.\" He didn't mention Rodgers by name, but the reference seemed obvious.On Monday, Ulbrich said Wilson needs to be more involved.\"We have to find ways to get Garrett the ball more often,\" Ulbrich said. \"He's one of the best players on our team, if not one of the best players in this league, especially at his position.\"Wilson has 90 receptions and is the fourth-most-targeted player in the league (139), but his chances have declined since the arrival of Davante Adams in Week 7. Since the trade, Adams -- a longtime Rodgers friend -- has 93 targets and 56 receptions. Wilson has 74 and 49, respectively.Rodgers said he understands that receivers always want the ball, but he added, \"There's a ton of plays in the plan for both him and Davante. That's how you usually you scheme out plays for your top players.\" He said coverage dictates where he throws the ball.\"We've moved him around a bunch,\" Rodgers said of Wilson. \"We give him a lot of plays where he's No. 1 or 2 in the progression.\"In injury news, rookie left tackle Olu Fashanu suffered a plantar fascia injury on his left foot and was placed on injured reserve, ending his season. He won't need surgery, according to the Jets.",
