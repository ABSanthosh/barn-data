(Megan Briggs/Getty Images) (Megan Briggs via Getty Images)The Colorado Rockies are back.OK, not at all. But, for the first time this season, the Rockies have won a series.The Rockies, thanks to a late solo home run from Hunter Goodman, beat the Miami Marlins 3-2 on Tuesday night. That, paired with their 6-4 win over the Marlins on Monday night, gave them the win in the three-game series regardless of what happens in the series finale on Wednesday.The Rockies were the last team in the league who hadn’t won a series. They were 0-for-19 on the year entering this series this week at LoanDepot Park. The Rockies had lost 22 in a row dating back to last season, too.AdvertisementThat drought, though, is finally over.The Marlins jumped up 2-0 in the third inning after both Jesus Sánchez and Kyle Stowers hit RBI singles. The Rockies responded in the fifth, when Jordan Beck hit an RBI single and then Thairo Estrada hit a sacrifice fly to left. That then set up Goodman’s homer in the eighth, which marked his 10th of the season.The loss dropped the Marlins to 23-36 on the season. They've lost six of their last eight.Even though they got the win, the Rockies are still historically terrible. They sit at just 11-50 on the year, which is by far the worst record in baseball. They were swept 10 times through their first 20 series of the season, which is tied for the most at that point in a season in MLB history. They fired manager Bud Black after a 7-33 start.AdvertisementThe Rockies were also the third-fastest to reach the 50-loss mark, though the other two occurred during the 1800s, and they were just the second team in history to have 50 losses already when they recorded their 10th win on Monday night.But, less than 6,000 people showed up to watch that happen in South Florida.Regardless, the Rockies have finally won their first series. It might not turn the season around, but it's a start.",
