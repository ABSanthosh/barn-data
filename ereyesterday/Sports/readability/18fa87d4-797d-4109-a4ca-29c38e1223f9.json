Our deepest sympathies go to his daughters, Carlie Irsay-Gordon, Casey Foyt, Kalen Jackson, and his entire family as we grieve with them.\"Irsay was 12 years old when his father, Robert Irsay, acquired the Baltimore Colts in 1972. Jim Irsay worked in various roles throughout the organization before becoming the team's vice president and general manager in 1984, the same year the team made the controversial move to Indianapolis.Irsay assumed day-to-day management of the Colts in 1995 after his father suffered a stroke. He went on to oversee one of the most successful periods of the franchise's history, which began when the team selected Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning with the No. 1 overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft.Irsay also became heavily involved with the Indianapolis community, as the team noted in its statement.\"Jimâ€™s generosity can be felt all over Indianapolis, the state of Indiana and the country,\" the team wrote. \"He made philanthropy a daily endeavor. He never hesitated to help countless organizations and individuals live better lives. Music was one of Jimâ€™s passions and the ability to share his band and collection with millions of people across the world brought him tremendous joy. Simply put, he wanted to make the world a better place and that philosophy never wavered. Jim will be deeply missed by his family, the Colts organization, and fans everywhere, but we remain inspired by his caring and unique spirit.\"Plenty from around the NFL world paid homage to Irsay after his death, including Peyton Manning. Below are some of the most notable tributes to the late Colts owner.NFL world reacts to death of Jim IrsayPlease donâ€™t ask me if Iâ€™m ok. Cuz Iâ€™m not. Thank You Sooo Much Mr.Irsay.
