  "text": "Absorbing Sinner-Alcaraz rivalry set for next chapterImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are meeting for the second successive Grand Slam men's singles finalThere are a number of factors which turn an exciting rivalry into an epic, enduring duel that transcends the sport.The core talent. The blend of personalities. The gripping encounters on the biggest stages.The tussle between Italy's Jannik Sinner and Spain's Carlos Alcaraz - ranked one and two in the men's game - has all those components.It also has arguably the most important ingredient: each player being pushed to a greater height by the other.On Sunday, the pair will meet again in the Wimbledon final - where Sinner aims to win his first title and Alcaraz bids for a rare third in a row.A renewal of their acquaintance at the All England Club comes just 35 days after Alcaraz beat Sinner in an all-time classic French Open final.Asked about their rivalry, Alcaraz said: \"I'm not going to say I'm feeling like when Rafa [Nadal] and Roger [Federer] are playing.\"But I'm feeling like it is a different energy when we are facing each other than other players.\"Sinner, 23, and 22-year-old Alcaraz have created a duopoly in the men's game over the past two seasons.Because of his brilliance, Sinner has remained the world number one - despite serving a three-month doping ban this year in a case which rocked the sport. The pair have gained a grip on the Grand Slam tournaments, winning the past six majors between them.Their epic French Open battle was another demonstration of how the absorbing rivalry - which the ATP Tour has long pinned its hopes on filling the Federer-Nadal-Novak Djokovic void - could be a blockbuster for years to come.\"You cannot compare what the 'Big Three' did for 15-plus years. [Our rivalry] is not that big yet,\" said three-time Grand Slam champion Sinner, who is aiming for his first non-hard court major.\"This is the second consecutive Grand Slam that we are in the final and playing each other - I believe it's good for the sport. \"The more rivalries we have from now on, the better it is, because people want to see young player going against each other.\"The quality, excitement and tension of the recent Roland Garros final accelerated interest in the pair.Alcaraz fighting back from two sets down - and having saved three championship points - to win a five-setter in over five hours has whetted the appetite for Wimbledon.The five-time major champion expects to be pushed \"to the limit\" again at the All England Club.\"It's going to be a great day, a great final. I'm just excited about it,\" he said.\"I just hope not to be five and a half hours again. But if I have to, I will.\"Ice versus fire - the 21st century versionThe contrasting personalities are reminiscent of another pair who created a rivalry which continues to endure almost 50 years later.Bjorn Borg was the 'ice' compared to John McEnroe's 'fire' and there are similar characteristics in Sinner and Alcaraz.Sinner is ice-cold during matches and little appears to faze the mild-mannered Italian - on or off court.He was able to stay sanguine during the doping controversy and has also moved on quickly from the brutal nature of his French Open defeat.\"We keep talking about the fact that he's got really good self-awareness and puts everything into perspective,\" Sinner's coach Darren Cahill told BBC Sport.\"I think that's part of the reason why he's been able to do what he's been able to do here. \"I would have been heartbroken after losing a final where I had match points, but he sees the big picture really well and is why he's able to bounce back so quickly.\"Alcaraz is not as combustible as the famously volatile McEnroe. But he does possess a more colourful side than Sinner.He bellows 'Vamos' when big moments go his way in matches and also regularly shows his emotion by breaking out into beaming smiles.The natural warmth and authenticity of the Spaniard, plus his array of stunning shot-making, makes him relatable to fans.\"He's got the X-Factor - he's a performer,\" American great Billie Jean King told BBC Sport.Who's got the advantage?Sinner has been the dominant player on the ATP Tour for the past two seasons, winning 98 of his 109 matches (90%) and lifting nine titles.In the same timeframe, Alcaraz has won 102 of his 120 matches (85%) and claimed nine titles.But it is the Spaniard who is dominating their head-to-head record.The triumph on the Paris clay was his fifth straight victory over Sinner, extending his dominance to eight wins from their 12 career meetings.\"When Sinner brings his A game there is no-one that can beat him - other than Alcaraz,\" said seven-time major champion McEnroe, who is a BBC Sport analyst during the championships.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sinner won their only previous meeting at Wimbledon, back in 2022 when he won 6-1 6-4 6-7 (6-8) 6-3 in the last 16\"On the other hand if Alcaraz doesn't bring his A game then Sinner will win every time. So it's going to be extremely interesting.\"Alcaraz has moved through the gears nicely at the All England Club and goes into the final - unlike Sinner - having suffered no injury problems over the past fortnight.After beating Djokovic in the semi-finals, Sinner said the elbow injury he suffered in the fourth round against Grigor Dimitrov would provide \"no issues\" on Sunday.\"I will give a slight edge to Carlos as a favourite because of the two titles he's won here and the way he's playing and the confidence he has right now,\" seven-time champion Djokovic said.\"But it's just a slight advantage because Jannik is hitting the ball extremely well. \"It's going to be, again, a very close match-up like we had in Paris.\"More on this story",
