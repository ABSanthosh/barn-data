  "text": "When the full-time whistle blew at the Bolt Arena and the Scotland players fell to their knees, the cold wind of deja vu swept in.Just over two years ago, many of these players suffered the same pain in their World Cup play-off defeat by the Republic of Ireland at Hampden.It took time for a talented team of individuals playing for clubs across Europe and the United States to recover. This was their chance to respond.But instead, they're back to square one and face a winter of what-ifs and a summer of sitting on the sofa.Defender Sophie Howard, who was part of the squad who reached Euro 2017 and the 2019 World Cup, believes Scotland \"gave it everything\".\"We wanted so much more and we didn't achieve it,\" the 31-year-old said. \"As a team, we feel like we gave it everything.\"I wouldn't say we let ourselves down because we're in this together, we're just massively disappointed.\"I feel like every single player on that pitch gave everything. I think we deserved to win today with the way we played.\"You can't win games without goals, though. And across 180 minutes against Finland - and 90 against the Irish - Scotland seemed to take fright at the sight of goal.The word 'deserved' is often used by this group.They deserved to be at the World Cup. They deserved to be in Nations League A. They deserved to be at the Euros.No team, certainly not one who has now missed three tournaments in a row, has that right to take a seat at the top table. It must be earned.While Erin Cuthbert missed a gaping goal and Sam Kerr scudded an upright, there wasn't much more on offer from the Scots in Helsinki.Not enough to take them past a Finland team who have reached five of the last six Euros. But still, this group remain defiant.\"We said we owed it to ourselves to play with bravery and have no regrets and I don't think we have any regrets,\" Leicester City defender Howard said.\"We took risks and played with confidence. I think the one thing to say from tonight is that we stepped on to the pitch with bravery and have no regrets.\"Perhaps that is an indictment of where this squad actually are, compared to where they should be.In the first leg they were flat, flimsy and saved by a terrific Eartha Cumings save.They travelled to Helsinki with hopes alive but hardly kicking. By eight minutes in, they were behind and floundering.At 2-0 down, left-back Nicola Docherty tried to rally the troops. Troops who play for football giants such as Real Madrid, Chelsea and Bayern Munich.On paper, the talent is top drawer. On the pitch, it's a bit sketchy, and has been for too long.The disappointment is devastating, but Howard insists this group will go again.\"It's a choice and we'll make the choice to pick one another up,\" she added. \"Football is cruel sometimes and tonight it just didn't work for us, but we will make the choice to go again.\"Howard is 31 - she was 23 at her only European Championship appearance. Caroline Weir was 22, and is now 29. Cuthbert was a teenager who is now 26.Much has been made of this golden generation. Now there is a worry they've missed their golden hour.",
