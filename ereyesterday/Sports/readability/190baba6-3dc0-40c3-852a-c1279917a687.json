  "text": "Wales boss Bellamy enjoying 'sane' and successful altered imageMedia caption, Wales boss Craig Bellamy wanted to prove 'I'm not a lunatic'Craig Bellamy hopes his successful start as Wales head coach has proved he is not the \"lunatic\" some expected him to be.During his playing career, the former Liverpool and Manchester City forward made headlines for his controversial actions off the field as well as his many accomplishments on it.But Bellamy has been calm and assured as Wales boss, leading his team to Nations League promotion after an unbeaten first campaign which ended with Tuesday’s thumping 4-1 win over Iceland.\"I probably feel it was important to show people I am not a lunatic - I'm quite sane,\" said Bellamy. \"People thought I was going to be running on the pitch and pushing the ref and stuff, getting sent off.\"I probably felt more pushed into management to show I am not like that. People used to bring temperament up. 'Oh yeah, but his temperament.' I was like: 'Really?' Now you get to see this side of me.\"Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Wales manager Craig Bellamy celebrates with Harry Wilson and Ben DaviesThe former Wales captain added: \"But you [the media] were concerned, you were thinking: 'I wonder what he’s going to be like?' I understand that as well.\"You'll see me even calmer and kinder when it goes wrong. Now is the worst period you can get me in because my emotions are everywhere. Trust me, you get nowhere being that way.\"I'm not naive enough to know those moments aren't coming. I don't know when but it's going to happen. I feel like some are waiting for it happen. I know that and I have to stay calm with that.\"Bellamy was booked during Wales' win over Iceland but, other than being enthusiastic on the touchline, he has shown no signs of the red mist which descended on more than one occasion during his eventful playing career.The 45-year-old has been composed during media interviews, giving long and detailed answers as he shares his thoughts about the game.That cooler approach has helped him make an excellent start to his Wales tenure, with three wins and three draws taking his team to the top of Nations League Group B4 and securing promotion to the competition's top division.Bellamy has also instilled an exciting new style of play - bold and creative on the ball, tenacious and relentless out of possession.'Still a long way to go' as Wales target World CupThe ultimate goal is to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, as Bellamy stated when he took the job in July.He said this Nations League campaign would be used to establish a clear \"playing identity\" and prepare for World Cup qualifying.While this promotion-winning Nations League campaign met those requirements and boosted Welsh hopes of securing at least a World Cup play-off, Bellamy sounded a slightly cautious - if still optimistic - note after the Iceland victory.\"We've still got a long way to go. It's six games. We’ve had good periods,\" he said.\"I could easily sit here and be ecstatic with the draw [against Turkey, last Saturday] and it's turned out to be quite a good draw but I believe there is more for them [the Wales players].\"I believe they can play. I believe they can pass the ball. People might say you can't but I do.\"We want to go to a World Cup - we've got to get that ticked off. If we get there, we want to compete. These players deserve to be there.\"",
