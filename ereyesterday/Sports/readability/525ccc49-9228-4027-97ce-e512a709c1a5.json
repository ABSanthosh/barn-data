(1:12)Michael C. Wright, ESPN Staff WriterJan 12, 2025, 03:48 PM ETCloseJoined ESPN in 2010 Previously covered Bears for ESPN.com Played college football at West Texas A\u0026MAfter postponing a couple of Saturday matchups due to the ongoing wildfires in the Los Angeles area, the NBA has informed the Lakers and Clippers that their regularly scheduled games are expected to be played Monday at Crypto.com Arena and the Intuit Dome.The Lakers are scheduled to host the San Antonio Spurs, while the Clippers will host the Miami Heat.\"It's above my pay grade,\" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said when asked whether it feels right to play Monday. \"I think the NBA, they have a good handle on things that's going on and what they need to do. So they make the decision. They know we're going through a tough time right now in the state of California and they understand that.\"Hopefully we can bring some kind of joy with the game coming back tomorrow and some togetherness, as you may, and try to put some smiles on people's faces in tough times.\"The league on Friday postponed games Saturday featuring the Spurs at Lakers and Charlotte Hornets at LA Clippers, with those games to be rescheduled for later dates.The NBA also said it would donate $1 million for immediate relief to the American Red Cross, World Central Kitchen as well as additional organizations. The Lakers will also host a donation drive at upcoming home games starting Monday, with fans encouraged to bring unused, unopened items to support the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank's relief efforts.Approximately 105,000 people remain under mandatory evacuation orders amid multiple wildfires in the Los Angeles area. The Palisades Fire is already the most destructive in Los Angeles history, with more than 5,600 structures destroyed over 24,000 acres. At least 16 people have died as a result of the fires.\"This is probably the biggest thing I've been a part of,\" Lue said. \"Just seeing families and people lose their houses, lose their businesses, lose loved ones. It's pretty devastating and it's tough to really fathom what they're going through right now.\"Spurs guard Chris Paul, a Los Angeles resident who formerly played for the Clippers, expressed concern for the community after the team's loss Wednesday night in Milwaukee. Paul said his wife and children evacuated their home Tuesday.\"It's definitely scary, everything that is going on,\" Paul said. \"I'm sending so much love and prayers to some of my closest friends and family who have lost everything.\"Clippers forward Nicolas Batum said the team has \"been through some crazy stuff\" over the last five days, including last Wednesday's game in Denver as evacuations were happening in Los Angeles.\"That game in Denver was weird all day,\" Batum said. \"I was on the phone with my family all day. I didn't sleep that night. ... I think I stopped checking my phone three minutes before game. I checked at halftime. I never do that. Just to make sure my wife and kids were OK.\"The Spurs arrived in Santa Monica early Thursday after landing in Los Angeles on a flight that commenced shortly after the team's matchup at Milwaukee. The club checked into its team hotel in Santa Monica but decided hours later to relocate to a hotel in downtown Los Angeles for precautionary reasons.The NBA had previously postponed Thursday's game between the Lakers and Hornets at Crypto.com Arena, with that game still yet to be rescheduled.Lakers coach JJ Redick said last week that he lost his home in the Palisades Fire.After the games Monday, the Lakers are scheduled to host the Heat on Wednesday while the Clippers will host the Brooklyn Nets.ESPN's Ramona Shelburne and Dave McMenamin contributed to this report.",
