  "text": "Russian Dmitry Bivol produced a boxing masterclass to gain revenge over compatriot Artur Beterbiev and win the undisputed light-heavyweight world title in Saudi Arabia.The dazzling footwork, fancy flurries and crisp punching of Bivol, 34, prevailed in Riyadh in a deserved majority decision points win.Beterbiev, 40, landed power punches in the early to middle rounds but tired towards the end as Bivol reversed October's points loss to his rival.With scores of 114-114, 116-112 and 115-113, Bivol claims the WBA, WBC, WBO and IBF titles.\"I wanted to work from the first round to the end of the 12th. I was better. I was pushing myself more, I was more confident and I was lighter. I wanted to win so much today,\" Bivol said.After 24 rounds of boxing of the highest level, the results sets up a mouth-watering decider.\"I didn't want the second fight, it wasn't my choice, but no problem. We can do a third fight if we need to,\" Beterbiev, who suffered his first pro loss in 22 fights, said.It took just 137 days for the two best light-heavyweights of their generation to once again square off.While the first fight was a captivating contest of the highest level, the rematch was even better.With no drawn out ring walks, the fighters raced to the ring. There was no bad blood in the build-up. This was strictly business - two warriors, generational greats, putting their bodies on the line in their quest for legendary status.Bivol worked behind his jab and quick feet, two of his world-class attributes, to make a sharp start with eye-catching combinations and a counter right hand in the second.The crowd - including legends Roberto Duran and Prince Naseem Hamed – were on their feet after Bivol landed combinations and Beterbiev connected thumping power shots in a third which showcased the best of both.Canada-based Beterbiev planted his feet and unleashed monstrous rights. He staggered Bivol in the fifth with a menacing onslaught which ended with a right to the temple.Bivol did not bemoan a first career loss four months ago - which many felt he won, and vowed to do better.He regained his rhythm with crisper, cleaner punches and elegantly dancing out of range in the eighth and ninth.Beterbiev, who has knocked out every other opponent apart from Bivol, remained a threat. But it was Bivol who confidently took the centre of the ring in the championship rounds.\"We need this now and can't take any chances,\" Beterbiev's corner told him. He was fatigued and marked up but continued throwing until the final seconds.There were no celebrations from either team at the end of the most gruelling fight.It is time to rest up and do it all again. The public demand for a trilogy will be too much to ignore. Earlier in Riyadh, heavyweight Joseph Parker made short work of late replacement Martin Bakole with a second-round stoppage win.New Zealand's Parker, 33, was scheduled to face IBF world champion Daniel Dubois before the Briton withdrew because of illness on Thursday.Bakole made an agonisingly slow entrance draped in the Democratic Republic of Congo flag. The 31-year-old, remarkably, only landed in Riyadh about 24 hours before the first bell.Now based in Scotland, Bakole weighed 22st 7lb (142.9kg) at an unofficial weigh-in, almost a stone and a half more than a career-heavy Parker.The past, current and future of heavyweight boxing watched on with legend Lennox Lewis, current world champion Oleksandr Usyk and prospect Moses Itauma in attendance.Bakole found some success, drawing blood from Parker's nose with an uppercut followed by a stinging left to the body.Preparation is key in elite boxing, though. Moments later, an overhand counter-right from Parker landed on the top of Bakole's head and scrambled his senses.He fell heavily to the canvas and, with 20 seconds left in the round, trainer Billy Nelson threw in the towel.Parker - who held a world title between 2016 and 2018 - is fully deserving of another shot and welcomed a fight against Ukraine's unified champion Usyk.",
