Rodgers visited with the Pittsburgh Steelers earlier Friday, hours before New York pivoted to Winston.It was starting to seem in recent days as if the Giants were a longshot for Rodgers, the former three-time MVP. Winston gives them a quarterback capable of starting who can also serve as a mentor to a young quarterback from the draft.New York is still expected to add to their quarterback room this offseason despite the addition of Winston. It still needs a young quarterback, which is most likely to come in the draft. The Giants currently hold the No. 3 overall pick.Co-owner John Mara said earlier this year that finding the team's quarterback of the future was the No. 1 priority this offseason. Winston and Tommy DeVito are the only two quarterbacks currently on the Giants roster.Winston, 31, visited with the Giants earlier in the week. This came on the heels of Joe Flacco and Russell Wilson coming to New Jersey the previous week.Winston began the 2024 season as the backup to Deshaun Watson but took over as the Cleveland Browns' starter after Watson's season-ending right Achilles tendon tear in Week 7.He helped spark a Browns offense that failed to reach 20 points in any of Watson's starts. Winston engineered upset victories over the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers, and he threw for a franchise-record 497 yards in a Week 13 loss to the Denver Broncos.Winston, though, was benched in Week 16 after throwing eight interceptions in a span of three games. The Browns were 2-5 in games that Winston started. Winston finished the year completing 61.1% of his passes for 2,121 yards, 13 touchdowns and 12 interceptions, while also running for one score.While working as a media correspondent at the Super Bowl, Winston asked Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley where he should sign. Barkley told him New York.Winston later expressed his interest in the Giants.\"Would I really sign with the Giants? Absolutely!\" Winston told NJ Advance Media at the time. \"I want to keep playing and do what I do best.\"The 6-foot-4, 230-pound Winston entered the NFL as the No. 1 overall pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2015. After five seasons in Tampa Bay, Winston spent four seasons with the New Orleans Saints before signing with Cleveland last offseason.In his 10-year career, Winston has appeared in 105 games with 87 starts. He has completed 61.2% of his passes for 24,225 yards, 154 touchdowns and 111 interceptions.ESPN's Daniel Oyefusi contributed to this report.",
