(0:56)Associated PressApr 1, 2025, 07:51 PM ETBOSTON -- Alex Ovechkin moved four goals away from breaking Wayne Gretzky's NHL record after scoring the 891st of his career in the Washington Capitals' game against the Boston Bruins on Tuesday night.Ovechkin gave Washington a 2-0 lead with about four minutes left in the first period, when the Capitals had a man advantage and John Carlson passed the puck toward the net to Dylan Strome, who redirected it across the crease. Ovechkin easily pushed it into the open half of the net for No. 891.The Boston crowd gave a mixed cheer for the visiting Capitals. The Bruins have already fired their coach and are likely to miss the playoffs for the first time since 2016, so many fans -- more than a few of them in Ovechkin jerseys -- were likely there to see history in progress.Ovechkin has 12 goals in his past 18 games as he pursues the career goals mark Gretzky set before retiring in 1999. The 39-year-old Russian has 38 goals this season and is on track to reach 40 for a 14th time -- also the most in league history -- despite missing 16 games because of a broken left fibula.The first-place Capitals have eight more games left in the regular season.",
