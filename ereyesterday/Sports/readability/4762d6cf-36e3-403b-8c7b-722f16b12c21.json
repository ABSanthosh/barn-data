  "text": "He's made 1,378 senior appearances, had his debut in 1997 and is the oldest player at the Club World Cup.Fluminense's Brazilian goalkeeper Fabio Deivson Lopes Maciel has already had some career - and he's showing no signs of slowing down.The 44-year-old starred in Monday's 2-0 win over Inter Milan to help the Brazilian side into the Club World Cup quarter-final, against either Man City or Al-Hilal.He produced four saves, including a crucial late block with his legs, as the 2023 Copa Libertadores winners stunned this season's Champions League runners-up, before celebrating in style.He even makes 40-year-old teammate Thiago Silva seem young in comparison, although both made a mockery of their years in the 33C heat.Just four days before, he made history with a record-breaking 507th clean sheet - overtaking former Italy international Gianluigi Buffon. The record is 508 now.Now, he will have his eyes set on an even more impressive record - the most appearances in world football.According to the Guinness Book of Records, the former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton is the current record holder with 1,390 appearances. Shilton himself claims he has played 1,387., externalEven then, there are question marks about the actual tally Fabio is chasing. Shilton is recorded as having played 1,249 games in his club career and a record 125 England appearances, taking him to 1,374 appearances.So why isn't Fabio, who has played his entire career in Brazil and has never played for his country despite winning the Under-19 World Cup in 1997, already the record holder?According to England Football Online,, external Shilton played 13 times for England Under-23s, which would take us to the 1,387 tally Shilton believes he has.Whether or that should count as a senior appearance is up for debate but, having passed the 1,374 milestone with zero fanfare, Fluminense and Fabio are clearly being safe rather than sorry.Whether they are chasing 1,387, or 1,390, it will surely be just a matter of time. He turns 45 in September but, having signed a new contract in May until the end of 2026, the record looks certain to be his.How long the record stays with him is another thing though.Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, who is 40 and still playing for club and country, has appeared in 1,281 official, senior games in his career.The Al Nassr forward is just is 62 short of 1,000 career goals and, having already stated that as his aim, Ronaldo will undoubtedly be chasing Fabio down.",
