Follow him on Twitter »SAN FRANCISCO -- The NBA on Wednesday said officials made two incorrect calls in the final 37 seconds of Golden State's 121-116 play-in victory against the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night.The NBA's Last Two Minute Report said the officiating crew of Josh Tiven, Bill Kennedy and Nick Buchert should not have called a personal foul on Golden State point guard Brandin Podziemski when he made what was a block on Scotty Pippen Jr. near the basket with 37 seconds left.Podziemski was called for a foul, resulting in two free throws for Pippen. The Grizzlies point guard made one of two to cut the Warriors' lead to 117-114.With 7.3 seconds left and Golden State leading by one, play was stopped when Ja Morant reached in on Stephen Curry and made contact with the ball, which went out of bounds. The NBA said the ball should have been called off Curry's hand, awarding possession to Memphis instead of Golden State.One pivotal call the NBA ruled that officials got correct was a five-second violation by Memphis on an inbounds play while trailing 119-116 with 5.4 seconds left. Curry was fouled after that and sealed the Warriors' win from the line.The Last Two Minute Report also said officials made two incorrect non-calls in the final two minutes. The referees should have called a personal foul on Draymond Green on Pippen with 1:29 left. That would have been Green's sixth personal foul. The Warriors' big man would foul out later with 58.6 seconds left.Referees also made an incorrect non-call when Grizzlies center Zach Edey should have been called for an offensive goaltending when he made contact with the ball while it was in the imaginary cylinder above the rim with 1:28 remaining. Edey was credited with a putback that cut the Warriors' lead to 114-111 at the time.The Warriors secured the seventh seed and will face the host Houston Rockets in Game 1 of a first-round series Sunday. Memphis will host the winner of Wedneday night's Dallas-Sacramento game in a play-in game Friday to determine the Western Conference's eighth seed.",
