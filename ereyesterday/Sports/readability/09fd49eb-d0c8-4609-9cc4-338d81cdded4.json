(AP Photo/Martin Meissner) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)MUNICH (AP) — Another trophy for Cristiano Ronaldo. More records, more adulation.The Portugal star shed tears after helping his team win the Nations League on Sunday.Ronaldo scored to help Portugal draw level with Spain 2-2 in the final, then watched as his teammates won the penalty shootout 5-3.Advertisement“I have many titles with my clubs, but nothing is better than winning for Portugal,” Ronaldo said. “These are tears. It’s mission accomplished and so much joy.”The 40-year-old Ronaldo had been the first to run out onto the field for the pre-game warmup, sparking a huge roar from the Portugal supporters, including many wearing jerseys emblazoned with his name.His appearance prompted many supporters to pull out their cell phones to record the superstar while they could still see him in action. Ronaldo conceded Saturday that he won’t be able to play forever.That was three days after he helped Portugal to its first win over Germany for 25 years, scoring the winner for a 2-1 victory in the Nations League semifinals.AdvertisementOn Sunday he was driving the team again, though it was initially a frustrating game as his chances were limited by Spain’s hard-working defenders.Nuno Mendes fired Portugal level after Martin Zubimendi opened the scoring for Spain. Then Mikel Oyarzabal put Spain ahead 2-1 at the break.But Ronaldo was in the right place at the right time to fire home the equalizer from Mendes’ deflected cross in the 61st, setting off joyous scenes among his faithful fans. It was Ronaldo’s 138th goal for Portugal. Nobody has ever scored more for their country.Ronaldo kept trying in what was his record-extending 221st appearance for the country, but eventually had to go off exhausted in the 88th to standing ovations from fans and a hug from coach Roberto Martínez.AdvertisementRonaldo said he was carrying an injury into the game.“I had already felt it during the warmup, I had been feeling it for some time, but for the national team, if I had to break my leg, I would have broken it,” Ronaldo said. “It’s for a trophy, I had to play and I gave it my all.”Ronaldo’s future is uncertain as his contract with Saudi club Al-Nassr only runs to the end of June. He posted “this chapter is over” on social media after the club's last Saudi Pro League game of the season.On Saturday he said he had all but decided not to go to the Club World Cup despite “quite a few” offers from participating clubs to play there.AdvertisementWhatever club Ronaldo plays for, he will keep striving for Portugal.“I have lived in many countries, I have played for many clubs, but when it’s about Portugal, it is always a special feeling,” he said.___AP Sports Writer Tales Azzoni contributed to this report.___AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",
