  "text": "Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Gerwyn Price's best run in the Premier League saw him finish runner-up in 2023Gerwyn Price beat Luke Littler 6-3 in the night six final in Nottingham to win his second event in the 2025 Premier League Darts. The Welshman, who was extremely animated throughout the evening, has now won six successive matches against the teenager.He averaged 94.10 in comparison to 103.39 by Littler but he was more clinical on the doubles taking out six of 11. The 2021 world champion broke Littler's throw in leg two, but the 18-year-old broke back in leg seven to trail 4-3.However Price broke straight back and then closed out to join Littler and Luke Humphries on two victories in this year's competition. \"I try to be more positive and it shows on the board. The last couple of years I've been negative on myself,\" Price told Sky Sports.\"I might say I'm enjoying it and loving it but in the background it's hard. I'm just glad to get a win tonight. Another one over Luke, because I don't think it will last long.\"He's the best player in the world and he's going to be for some years. \"I think he will beat Phil Taylor's record of 16 world titles. There's nobody at the PDC at the minute that will stop him - only the younger generation, JDC, can stop him. \"We can't stop him - he will only get better and better.\"Littler earlier beat world number one Humphries 6-4 in a thrilling quarter-final.He was 4-3 down and Humphries' missed attempt at triple 20 left him with a bogey number.Littler pounced to sensationally take out 344, including a 167 finish, in six darts to level and from there he closed out for the win to move top of the table. The Warrington-born teenager was in devastating form in his 6-3 semi-final win over Rob Cross too - taking out 167, 127 and 164 finishes all on bullseye.Price ground out a 6-4 win over Stephen Bunting, who still remains without a win, in the quarter-finals, before producing a stunning display to blow away Michael van Gerwen 6-1 in the semi-finals.He raced into a 5-0 lead and was looking for the first clean sweep since 2023 but Van Gerwen pinned double tops in leg six to avoid it. Seven-time winner Van Gerwen, who beat Nathan Aspinall 6-4 in the quarter-finals, has won five of his six quarter-finals this year, but has lost every semi-final.

It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line.Players earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night.The top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match.
