I love it! pic.twitter.com/SrPETdFZFP— TURRON DAVENPORT (@TDavenport_NFL) May 24, 2025There has been a lot of grumbling amongst the fan base on social media centered on the snippets of videos coming out of the Tennessee Titans' offseason activities. Sure, no choreographed 7-on-7 drill clips are streaming, but that doesn’t mean that the work being put in during Phase 2 of the OTAs isn’t essential in the overall scheme.Head coach Brian Callahan has openly discussed changing things up during his second season, and it appears that he has focused on competition and technique in these early stages of work. Turron Davenport caught up with Calvin Ridley during his youth football camp to discuss the offseason program, and you can count Ridley as one who applauds these changes.“Competing!” He said. “We're competing in everything we do at work right now. And I think it's great. I think it's so fun. I'm a captain on my team. I got my boys behind me. And we're, I'm telling them every day, I’m even messing up sometimes, but I tell them every day, man, we're trying to win! You know, we're trying to win, we're trying to win, we're trying to win.”Many of the players have mentioned this theme in short bursts when talking to the media, and there is a genuine sense of excitement building as the team heads into Phase 3 of the offseason program. Will it make a difference? No one will know until September. But it appears the team heading in a new direction.  Facebook Twitter Email",
