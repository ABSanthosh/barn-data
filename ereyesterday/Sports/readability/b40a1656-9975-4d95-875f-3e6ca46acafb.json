When Lewis, 55, continued, she told him again to \"stop talking.\"Davis entered a not guilty plea on Lewis' behalf, stating that she wouldn't accept a guilty plea at an initial hearing. She assigned public defender Gavin Uitvlugt to Lewis's case.Lewis was ordered held on $50,000 bail, and Davis ordered him to stay away from Indianapolis basketball arenas Gainbridge Fieldhouse and Hinkle Fieldhouse -- where Clark and the Indiana Fever play their home games -- and to not have any contact with the reigning WNBA Rookie of the Year.Lewis could face up to six years in prison and a $10,000 fine.Lewis is listed in court documents as being a resident of Denton, Texas, but in court he said he lives in his vehicle, which he drove to Indianapolis.
