  "text": "PHOENIX — It was the Los Angeles Dodgers’ pitching version of \"Charlie’s Angels\" across three different fields in front of frenzied fans Tuesday in the morning and early afternoon, charming the Dodgers coaching staff and front office with visions of October already in the air.It was Shohei Ohtani at 10:30 in the morning, pitching his fourth bullpen session since joining the Dodgers, showing why optimism is rampant in camp that he’ll be dominating on the mound in May. He looks like he could be ready by opening day instead of two months into the season the way he has thrown.Has he surprised the Dodgers?“Yes, given who the player is and who the person is,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said, “but there’s still a process that we are going through. He just understands that we’ve got a long season to go, so he’s sort of bought into whatever we need from him.“But very surprised how quick it’s gone and seeing this is great.\"Shohei Ohtani throws a bullpen session on Tuesday.Next up was 23-year-old Japanese sensation Rōki Sasaki. He was supposed to throw just two innings, but wound up going three, throwing 30 pitches four Chicago White Sox minor-league players. He threw 102 mph in Japan, but his velocity was in the mid-90s Tuesday, giving up a home run to prized catching prospect Kyle Teel on his second pitch, and generating four swing-and-misses.“He’s been a star since he was 16 years old,\" Roberts said, “so he probably hasn’t got hit a lot. But some of these guys that I’ve seen that have been really good pitchers, they get hit in the mouth and respond back. So he doesn’t run away from the competition. That’s part of his pedigree.\"On the big stage at 1:05 p.m. was two-time Cy Young winner Blake Snell, making his Dodgers debut facing the Seattle Mariners. He threw plenty of strikes – 20 in 30 pitches – but lasted just one inning when he was scheduled to go two. He had two swing-and-misses, each against All-Star center fielder Julio Rodriguez in his lone strikeout.“To start our day watching Shohei throwing a professional bullpen, to come out of it feeling great,\" Roberts said. “Then you go on the back field and see Rōki go three innings and do what he did. … Today, overall, was a really good day for us.\"It was an embarrassment of riches with Snell disappointed he wasn’t on hand to check out Ohtani and Sasaki.“It’s a lot of talent, sad I couldn’t watch,\" Snell said, “but I had to get ready. But the talent here is pretty, pretty amazing and I’m excited to be here.\"And, oh yeah, just for a little reminder of this abundance of talent, there is a picture of three-time Cy Young winner Clayton Kershaw, who’s expected to return in May, sitting in his locker.“It’s there for a reason,\" Snell said.There will be a time this season when they will all be together, along with Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow, Kershaw and Dustin May.No wonder Yamamoto and Ohtani made sure to stop by show their support by watching Sasaki throw, with teammates, front office executives and coaches all eying the young star.“He’s a guy everyone wanted,\" Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts said, “so he’s why everyone’s going to watch him.\"No one is predicting that Sasaki is going to go out and win the Cy Young award his rookie season, but you can’t find anyone who’s doesn't see future stardom.“I thought Rōki was good, \"aid Roberts, who sat in a golf cart with special assistant Farhan Zaidi watching Sasaki, and then driving away with Andrew Friedman, Dodgers president of baseball operations and GM Brandon Gomes riding in the back. “Velocity looked good. I thought there’s a lot of chase with his split mixed in some breaking balls.“Talking to our pitching guys, we were pretty pleased with the outing. ... He’s getting really acclimated to Major League Baseball. He’s in a good spot.The tentative plan is for Yamamoto to pitch Game 1 in Tokyo against the Chicago Cubs, Sasaki to pitch the second game, and then for Snell to pitch the Dodgers’ home opener on March 27 against Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal and the Detroit Tigers.Snell, who missed all but the final week of spring training last season after signing March 28 with the San Francisco Giants, says he’ll be ready, pleased that his fastball command is already far ahead of schedule. He didn’t feel comfortable until the second half last year, going 0-3 with a 6.31 ERA the first half, and then dominating the National League after the All-Star break with a 5-0 record and 1.45 ERA, striking out 103 batters in 68 ⅓ innings.“Last year was definitely challenging,’’ Snell said. “It taught me a lot so I’m definitely happy that I went through that I was able to learn from it.\"This is why Snell arrived early in camp, learning his teammates, getting familiar with the coaches and settling in an to have that the comfort level when he stepped onto the mound Tuesday.“I think for him to just be in camp, get on some type of routine, he’s well beyond where hew was last year,\" Roberts said. “You can just kind of see it. He doesn’t let us know too much but certainly just being around him each day, getting into a routine, he’s in a good place.The only thing Snell has to get acclimated to now is wearing the Dodger uniform after competing against them in the 2020 World Series with Tampa, and being a rival with the San Diego Padres and Giants.“The first time putting on a Dodger uniform, so I was definitely excited about that,’’ Snell said. “I think pitching in front of fans again is really exciting.\"So just imagine the euphoria of everyone else.“Unbelievable, right?\" Dodgers reliever Michael Kopech said. “The talent in here is just incredible.\"Follow Nightengale on X: @BnightengaleThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Ohtani, Sasaki and Snell: Dodgers throw three 'unbelievable' new aces",
