  "text": "The concerns about the small-market NBA Finals didn't prevent the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder from delivering a classic in Game 1. They do, however, seem to have impacted ratings as expected.Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Finals averaged a 4.7 rating and 8.91 million viewers on ABC, making it the least-watched Game 1 of the Nielsen meter era (since 1988) outside of the league's COVID-19-fueled ratings nadir in 2020 and 2021, according to Sports Media Watch.AdvertisementThose numbers are an 18% ratings decline and 19% viewership decline from last year's NBA Finals opener in which the Boston Celtics faced the Dallas Mavericks. The decline would have been worse had Tyrese Haliburton and the Pacers not launched a furious comeback in the final minutes to stun the Thunder.Those numbers seemingly vindicate what many have said about a clash between teams from the 25th and 47th largest markets in the Nielsen rankings, with Oklahoma City's mayor bristling at those concerns ahead of the game.No matter how many people watched, Game 1 of Pacers-Thunder was a fun one. (Photo by Kyle Terada - Pool/Getty Images) (Pool via Getty Images)Of course, it's also important to maintain perspective about how much ratings matter. Sure, the NBA would love if 100% of households were tuning into its signature event, but the league just finalized $76 billion in television deals for the next 11 season. While ratings are down, the league extracts value from many other areas. Your favorite team will be fine. Your favorite player will be fine.AdvertisementNBA's PR team also pointed to some positives, such as the broadcast reaching 11 million viewers by the time Haliburton made his game-winning shot with 0.3 seconds left, strong viewership among the 18-to-34-year-old demographic and a record number of views on social media.The Pacers' win could aid ratings down the line, as many viewers might not have tuned in due to how lopsided the series was perceived to be. The Thunder opened as a -800 favorite to win their first title in OKC, the best odds since the 2017-18 Golden State Warriors.The Thunder have been so dominant this season that even down 1-0, they are still -350 favorites to win it all. They aren't unstoppable, though, and plenty of fans could be interested in either a comeback or one of the biggest upsets in NBA Finals history.",
