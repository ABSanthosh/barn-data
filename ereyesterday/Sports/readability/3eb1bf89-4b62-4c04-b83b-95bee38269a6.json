Georgia raced to match up and then jumped offside as the play clock ticked down, giving the Irish a clock-sapping first down with 7:17 to go.By the time the Bulldogs got the ball back, just 1:49 remained, and Notre Dame was well on its way to playing No. 5 Penn State (13-2, CFP No. 6 seed) in a semifinal at the Orange Bowl in Miami on Jan. 9.The Irish opened as a 1.5-point favorite over Penn State in the Orange Bowl at ESPN BET, while Ohio State remains the favorite to win the CFP at +110.Georgia entered the game without starting quarterback Carson Beck, who injured his elbow in the Southeastern Conference championship game. He was replaced by Gunner Stockton, who was 20 of 32 for 234 yards and one touchdown.Leonard finished with 90 yards passing and a team-high 80 yards rushing.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
