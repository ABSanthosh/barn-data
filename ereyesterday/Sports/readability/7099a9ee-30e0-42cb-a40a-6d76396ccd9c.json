Hunter began waving his finger as he walked up to Mathurin on the court and then shoved him in the chest.Mathurin played one minute and did not score.Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson had taken note of what he called an excessive foul in Game 1 of the series when Mathurin's block on Hunter's layup at the rim resulted in Hunter spraining his right thumb, which kept him out of Game 2.The Pacers built a 38-23 first-quarter lead.",
