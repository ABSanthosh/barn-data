  "text": "Sean O'Malley has been here before, processing loss.But this time is a little different. In the wake of UFC 316, O'Malley (18-3 MMA, 10-3 UFC) is sorting through the emotions of his second loss to Merab Dvalishvili (20-4 MMA, 13-2 UFC).There's peace – something he's not experienced in the past, particularly off a loss. O'Malley uprooted his lifestyle in preparation of Saturday's fight at Prudential Center in Newark, N.J.. Ultimately, he lost by third-round submission.\"Happiness is a skill,\" O'Malley said Tuesday on his YouTube channel. \"So for me to be able to go through something like that and then the next Sunday rolls around, Monday rolls around, I don't feel sad at all – I still feel really happy. I feel a little disappointed in the outcome. I feel a little frustrated, but there's no sadness inside of me. I'm holding my 14-day-old. ... I'll close my eyes and I'll picture things like when I started locking up the guillotine, I could've done something. I could've done this. I could've done that. But I'm like, ah, man – there's nothing I can do about it now. On to the next thought. I'm not sitting in that f*cking thought just letting it unravel and go down a negative hole. I still feel very good.\"There's confusion: How is Dvalishvili as good and as strong as he is? O'Malley seemed baffled as he broke down the loss with coach Tim Welch. Despite sentiments they hold that O'Malley improved leaps and bounds this camp, the outcome was even more decisive in Dvalishvili's favor.O'Malley's current explanation? He was fighting the best bantamweight in the world.\"I feel like I got so much better this fight,\" O'Malley said. \"I feel like I was able to show that that camp. But just being on bottom – and I've trained with the best; we train with such good guys ... It's so weird. He just felt so f*cking compact and strong in there. I feel like that was too much. ... (He's the) greatest of all time – greatest bantamweight of all time.\"Lastly, there's gratefulness – no surgery is necessary and he's relatively unscathed. He doesn't want to even think about what his next fight will be, but he and Welch indicated late 2025 or early 2026 will be his next outing.\"It's nice to not think about a fight right now because I do want to just chill for a few weeks,\" O'Malley said. \"It's way better. Even if the UFC said, 'We know what we want to do (with you next),' I don't even want to know right now. Just let me chill for five.\"Whether it's vs. Umar Nurmagomedov or Deiveson Figueiredo or someone else, O'Malley still seemed confident his career is on an upswing. Even now, he thinks he can beat Dvalishvili if given a third chance. It might sound crazy, but O'Malley said that confidence is what has helped him succeed throughout his career.\"I definitely felt a nervous feeling that I'm not used to, just because of how the first fight played out, knowing his cardio is so crazy, knowing if it hits the ground (I might be in trouble). ... I had worked the takedown defense so much and I knew I was able to get up,\" O'Malley said. \"But I was like, 'I also know there's a chance this fight plays out the same way it did (last time).'\"So in the back, I was more nervous this fight probably than I've ever been. You feel vulnerable. You're in the cage like, 'This motherf*cker grabs a hold of me, there's a chance I can't get away from this little f*cker.' ... In there, I'm like, 'I'm gonna knock this motherf*cker out.' I know, I still know, I can beat Merab. Call it delusional, call it whatever. That's how I got to where I'm at right now. I know I can still beat Merab.\" Facebook Twitter Email",
