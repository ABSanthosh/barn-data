  "text": "Some just stand there looking calm, some move around wildly and others spend a good chunk of time shadowing the fourth official.Every manager does it differently - so we wanted to find out exactly how differently.Over the past three days, we sent a BBC Sport journalist to all 10 Premier League games to closely watch what every manager did as the action unfolded. They spent the matches recording data on where each boss stood, while also surveying how they interacted with those around them. We know that there are many variables that can determine how a manager reacts so measuring across a single weekend is certainly not definitive, but we were curious to see what unfolded.The data enabled us to produce a heatmap for every manager, which you can find below along with observations from each journalist.Some heatmaps will show a number that is either just above or just below 100%. That is because we rounded our percentages up or down to improve readability within the graphic.Everton 1-1 ArsenalMike Peter at Goodison Park: The touchlines are tight here, but that wasn't going to stop Mikel Arteta - he still squeezed out of his technical area almost 50% more than opposite number David Moyes.Anywhere close to the action was Arteta's domain, with his coaches, particularly set-piece lead Nicolas Jover, having to venture out to join him twice as much as Everton's backroom staff had to find Moyes. Jover, just as much an animated presence as his manager, immediately took up position in the very corner of the technical area for any set-piece.Moyes ventured around his area more freely, often stepping back in his box to discuss matters with his staff, and even taking a seat on the bench - something Arteta never did.Nor was the dugout the only place the veteran Scot sat down - he was perched on a drinks cooler in the corner of his area when Everton scored their equalising penalty.Match reportCrystal Palace 2-1 BrightonGeorge Booth at Selhurst Park: Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner was an animated figure throughout - constantly moving in the technical area and never sitting down for long periods.He did generally respect the white line, only leaving his technical area once in the first half, while in the final 10 minutes of the contest he was frequently interacting with the crowd in a bid to help his team over the line.Fabian Hurzeler spent the majority of the first half outside his technical area, virtually inches away from the pitch, but was seated for most of the second half - despite the three red cards coming during this period.When his side faced a defensive set-piece, assistant manager Jonas Scheuermann took control of the technical area, with Brighton's players often looking back to follow instructions.The Brighton manager, with the help of his coaching staff, also interacted with fourth official Sam Allison throughout the game.Match reportIpswich 1-2 WolvesMichael Emons at Portman Road: Ipswich's Kieran McKenna paced along the edge of the technical area, encouraging and clapping his side - calm and steady instead of panicking and nervous.He was a near-permanent presence there, but when something happened - goals at either end, corners, good challenges, shots - he would watch the clip with the analysts for 10-20 seconds before returning to his position.A raised fist followed Liam Delap's goal, but McKenna - 40 seconds late for the start of the second half - was dejected after Wolves' late winner.Wolves manager Vitor Pereira - watching from media seats - and assistant Luis Miguel were suspended, so first-team coach Andre Monteiro took charge.After Ipswich scored, Monteiro was a chalk-on-the-trainers boss, almost on the pitch, a few paces out of the area. On a few occasions the fourth official had to politely tell Monteiro to get back.Monteiro was constantly in touch with Pereira, looking in his direction, making hand signals while talking via an earpiece.When Wolves equalised, Monteiro was about to bring on striker Hwang Hee-chan, but after some hand waving in Pereira's direction, the decision was changed. Wolves' winner left Pereira hugging his coaching staff, with Premier League safety practically secured.Match reportWest Ham 2-2 BournemouthEmma Smith at London Stadium: West Ham manager Graham Potter was continuously standing on the edge of his technical area, arms folded and observing the game for the most part, while two members of his staff - assistant manager Bruno and first-team coach Narcis Pelach - were up and down from the bench.It was the coaches who interacted with the fourth official rather than the manager, and calling subs over from their warm-up. Pelach was usually alongside Potter when West Ham had an attacking free-kick.Potter and Bruno were often in conversation after key moments and before any tactical changes.Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola was much more excitable - almost on the pitch as he issued instructions to his players.This was particularly prevalent early on, though in the second half he spent more time on the bench conversing with staff as the flow of the game changed. He would also take a much more direct role in interacting with his players - both on the pitch and with the subs - than Potter.Match reportAston Villa 2-1 Nottingham ForestAndrew Bassett at Villa Park: Unai Emery and Nuno Espirito Santo spent the majority of the match in front, rather than within, their technical areas.Emery energetically directed his team, frequently moving up and down the sideline, while Nuno stood unmoved with arms folded.Their communication styles with their teams were different too. Emery directed his team, often gesticulating to up the tempo. One moment stood out - when he crouched down to excitably stress a point to substitute Boubacar Kamara as he was coming on.For Forest, Nuno's assistant Rui Silva was more likely to interact with players during the match - shouting instructions and briefing oncoming substitutes. It was notable that Villa coach Austin MacPhee would jump up from the bench to coach most set-pieces, including some attacking throw-ins.Match reportBrentford 0-0 ChelseaAdam Millington at Gtech Community Stadium: Coaching on a matchday is a team affair for Thomas Frank. He has no qualms with stepping back to analyse the game and allowing the rest of his backroom team to deputise.Frank constantly shifted back to the bench with his notepad in hand to speak to colleagues before stepping back to convey information to the players on the pitch.He seemed to prefer the slightly higher vantage point from the bench. It also gave him the ability to intently watch replays of what was happening on the pitch, assess the game in real time and make any needed adjustments.Enzo Maresca, however, was the polar opposite. He rarely retreated to the bench, instead spending the game pacing up and down - and often outside of - his dugout.Maresca was regularly animated, shouting instructions towards his players and running backwards and forwards. Frank, meanwhile, was quiet and pensive in his technical area.Match reportFulham 3-2 LiverpoolEmma Smith at Craven Cottage: Both managers generally stood alone at the edge of their technical areas, and were the ones to issue instructions to their players.Marco Silva was not shy of expressing his views to the officials - he flew into a rage at Fulham not being awarded an early penalty, while referee Chris Kavanagh had to come over for a word after Silva felt Rodrigo Muniz was fouled. Silva would occasionally sit down and speak to coaches, but he was usually found pacing the length of his technical area shouting instructions to players.Arne Slot also stood throughout most of the game, although as more of a watching brief; he would turn to coaches to express thoughts after key moments.His longest period sitting down came after Liverpool went 3-1 behind, when he looked furious and exasperated. After all five goals, Slot spoke to various players in his team - such as Curtis Jones, Cody Gakpo and Diogo Jota - to issue instructions.Match reportTottenham 3-1 SouthamptonMichael Emons at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium: Two very contrasting styles. Tottenham's Ange Postecoglou was calm throughout - he would pick a spot on the edge of his box and stay there for a few minutes. There was hardly any shouting, just the occasional gesture of frustration when a pass was misplaced.The most animated he became, maybe predictably, was when VAR got involved for a decision to wipe out a second Spurs goal that took four minutes to conclude. That was the only time he moved for any length of time, as his frustration grew.At one stage in the delay he appeared to play a rock, paper, scissors game - highlighting the unpredictable, random nature of VAR decisions.Southampton's Ivan Juric could not stop moving, constantly pacing up and down the line. There were only 47 seconds on the clock when he was told by fourth official Sam Barrott to get back in the area.Juric treated the technical area as optional, spending more time out of it than in, often crouching down, repeatedly shouting instructions but all to no avail as the Saints were relegated to the Championship. Juric left the club the following day.Match reportMan Utd 0-0 Man CityJoe Bradshaw at Old Trafford: United boss Ruben Amorim bounced between standing on the balls of his feet like a coiled spring and relentlessly pacing his technical area, constantly barking out instructions and only pausing to drink from his bottle or usher coach Carlos Fernandes forward for both attacking and defensive set-pieces. Those were the only times he disappeared from the touchline, directing his players through almost every other element of the performance.While less frenetic on his feet, counterpart Pep Guardiola was equally active - arms thrown wide, head bowed in frustration or whirling his hands to demand more from his players.When United attacked, Guardiola regularly dropped to his haunches. Occasionally he would return to the dugout to swap thoughts with assistant Juan Manuel Lillo, but barely lasted a minute before coming to the side of the pitch againThere was one nice moment when Guardiola showed a delicate touch to control a ball out of play, and Amorim touched his hand as a sign of commendation. From one cultured footballer to another, their mutual respect was also obvious in their embrace at the end.Match reportLeicester 0-3 NewcastleMichael Emons at King Power Stadium: Eddie Howe was the main figure of course, but Newcastle assistant Jason Tindall also played a part. Whenever Howe was talking to his players at a set piece or to the substitutes waiting to come on, Tindall would move into position so there was almost always one of them at the front of the area.Howe was also in constant talks with Tindall at the back of the technical area or writing notes down in his notebook. When the second goal went in, Howe immediately called over Joelinton for a tactical chat, and he did similar with a number of other players when the third went in, despite the big lead.Ruud van Nistelrooy had his head in his hands after the visitors scored after a couple of minutes and was noticeably getting more and more frustrated at his side's inability to keep the ball as sloppy mistakes became more frequent.He spent most of the opening half hour on the edge of the technical area, but after Newcastle's third goal, he watched the rest of the half from his seat. He did return to the edge of the technical area for most of the second half though, with most of the home fans leaving well before the end.Match reportAll graphics and imagery for this project were designed by Lee Martin.Related topicsNottingham ForestSouthamptonManchester UnitedLeicester CityLiverpoolFulhamWest Ham UnitedBrentfordChelseaAston VillaBrighton \u0026 Hove AlbionPremier LeagueManchester CityCrystal PalaceTottenham HotspurBournemouthArsenalEvertonNewcastle UnitedFootballIpswich TownWolverhampton Wanderers",
