  "text": "Since trading for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1975, the Los Angeles Lakers have gone exactly seven seasons since then without a bona fide headliner — and they were going to make sure that number would stay exactly where it is when LeBron James retires.That was the impetus for the Lakers trading Anthony Davis, who’s playing the best ball of his career, for Luka Dončić despite the questions about Dončić’s conditioning. It wasn’t something the Lakers were courting, but Dallas did call them about Dončić, and the Lakers jumped at the opportunity, sources told Yahoo Sports.It’s hard to think of a more shocking trade in NBA history when you consider the names and the timing of the deal, late on a Saturday night when the Lakers looked as good as they have at this point in a season since 2020.But surprise aside, the Lakers have someone to build around for the next decade, assuming health. Keep in mind, the Dallas Mavericks had serious concerns about Dončić and his conditioning.However, a 25-year-old to follow in the footsteps of Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe Bryant and now, James, was too much to turn down for a Lakers franchise that always has someone on the marquee and in his prime.The Mavs moving Luka Dončić brings up all sorts of questions. (AP photo/LM Otero)Either they draft them like Magic, identify a young talent like Kobe, or more commonly they poach a full-grown man from a poor franchise that’s ill-equipped to handle everything that comes with a superstar. That wasn’t necessarily the case with the Mavericks, who advanced to the NBA Finals last June and the Western Conference finals in 2022. But in the Lakers' trade history, they got a teenage Bryant for Vlade Divac, and Davis for a collection of productive players and draft picks that didn't make a major impact. In acquiring Abdul-Jabbar, the most notable player the Lakers gave up was Elmore Smith. When they acquired Pau Gasol to assuage an itchy Kobe Bryant in the 2007-08 season, Kwame Brown was the centerpiece.It’s not usually two All-NBA players being moved for one another, it’s usually the pu-pu platter. In fact, it feels like the first of its kind, as Dončić was All-NBA first team last season and Davis was second team — his first All-NBA honor since 2019-20.That’s where Dončić comes in. The lowest he’s finished in MVP voting the last five seasons is eighth in 2022-23, and he was third last year. But even still, the Mavericks didn’t feel confident in Dončić's future with the franchise, as he was eligible for a five-year contract extension this summer worth more than $350 million.His conditioning, a constant concern throughout his career despite his stellar play, was a chief motivator in Dallas initiating trade talks with the Lakers. He's played only 22 games this season and is currently out with a calf injury. He’ll be ineligible for postseason awards because he won’t be able to meet the 65-game threshold.Perhaps it’s a signal for the future as more money comes into the NBA system with the new media-rights deals taking hold. We’re in this new reality of tax aprons and record contracts — like the one Dončić could’ve signed this summer.Teams had better be completely sure of who and what they’re investing in for the long term because the ramifications, financially, are massive. Perhaps the days of holding your nose and offering a player with any level of question marks this type of money are dwindling.Dončić's conditioning has been a topic since arriving in the NBA in 2018. He’s a special case relative to others, and his body hasn’t really changed over that time. But when you consider how Zion Williamson or Joel Embiid have health concerns and injury issues, there’s no guarantee players will get that money in the future. Comparatively, Dončić has been far more reliable than both combined, and he got moved.If one were to make a list of players whom teams would most likely move heaven and earth to acquire, Dončić would be on the short list — with Victor Wembanyama likely co-headlining with Nikola Jokić, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Giannis Antetokounmpo right behind them.Because every homegrown superstar will demand the max, and anything less will be seen as an insult and act of war, it puts the onus on them to be completely responsible and reliable as those times approach — and kudos to Dallas for avoiding potential drama by doing this in the din of night rather than holding a bidding process on the week of the trade deadline or even the summer.Davis is under contract until 2028, with a player option for the 2027-28 season, but he’s extension-eligible after next year. And even though he’s been as healthy and as productive on both ends of the floor since his first year in Los Angeles — and a prime candidate for Defensive Player of the Year the last two seasons — the Lakers were not going to extend his contract. He’ll be 36 entering the 2029-30 season.According to sources, Davis is OK with going to Dallas and teaming with Kyrie Irving — and this is a big show of confidence for Irving. Davis can play his desired position of power forward alongside Daniel Gafford and promising big man Dereck Lively II at center.This feels more about Dallas and Dončić than even Davis and the Lakers — a shock in and of itself. Dončić is shocked with the move, sources told Yahoo Sports. And that could very well be in response to how serious he took the organization’s concerns about his conditioning and diet.Davis packs his bags for Dallas, and Dončić to Los Angeles — and even though the answers are becoming less hazy, there’s still more smoke to be cleared.If nothing else, it's a shocking move that sets the stage for the future of this season and beyond.",
