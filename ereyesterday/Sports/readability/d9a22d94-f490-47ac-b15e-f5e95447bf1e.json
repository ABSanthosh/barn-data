With a loaded roster led by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown returning, the Celtics have an eye on repeating as champions, something that hasn't happened in Boston since 1968 and 1969. They'll host the New York Knicks, who won 50 games for the first time since the 2012-13 season and are looking to make a big jump, with Jalen Brunson leading the way for a new-look New York squad that added Karl-Anthony Towns and Mikal Bridges over the offseason.NBA Power Rankings | Season predictions | '24-'25 Survival GuideThe Lakers may have one of the most anticipated debuts for a second-round pick in NBA history as Bronny James suits up for his first regular-season game, and may take the floor with his legendary father as L.A. hosts Anthony Edwards and the Minnesota Timberwolves. LeBron James has talked often throughout the years about wanting to play with his son, and the two did share the floor in the preseason. A father-son duo has never played together in the NBA, but Ken Griffey Sr. and Jr. were the first to do so in Major League Baseball and will be in attendance tonight.Yahoo Sports has you covered with previews of all 30 teams, hot takes, breakout candidates and much more. Stay with Yahoo Sports for live coverage of NBA Opening Night 2024 below.Live21 updatesTue, October 22, 2024 at 9:00 PM EDTCeltics threatening single-game 3-point recordThe Celtics are up to 24 made 3-pointers midway through the third quarter. The record for a single game is 29 by the Milwaukee Bucks in 2020.Here's Al Horford with No. 20:Tue, October 22, 2024 at 8:56 PM EDTMikal Bridges' jumper? Maybe brokenWhile Boston's Jayson Tatum dispelled of the notion that his shot was broken within minutes of opening tip, shooting 6-of-9 from 3 in Tuesday's first half, Knicks counterpart Mikal Bridges cannot say the same.Bridges missed all five his shot attempts in the opening half, including four 3-point attempts. He did not make his first shot until a smoother-looking corner 3-pointer in the opening minutes of the third quarter.His shot clearly looks different, and he told reporters last week that he indeed changed his mechanics.“When I came out of college, I kind of tweaked it a little bit,\" he said. \"Then my second year in the league, I had the hitch, and tried to build back from that ever since. So just trying to get it right. Pretty much it.”The hitch is back. Bridges shot 2-for-19 from deep in the preseason. So why Bridges did feel the need to change his jumper. He is a career 37.5% 3-point shooter and shot 37.2% on 7.2 tries a game last season.Tue, October 22, 2024 at 8:48 PM EDTJaylen Brown opens the second half with a 3, and the Celtics are off to the races.Tue, October 22, 2024 at 8:37 PM EDTNotable halftime statsCeltics 74, Knicks 55Celtics shooting: 27 of 49 (55.1%)Knicks shooting: 22 of 38 (57.9%)Celtics 3-point shooting: 17 of 32 (53.1%)Knicks 3-point shooting: 4 of 14 (28.6%)Jayson Tatum: 25 points, 6 assists, 3 rebounds; 9 of 12 from the field, 6 of 9 from 3Jaylen Brown (12 points), Derrick White (11) Jrue Holiday (10) all in double figures Jalen Brunson: 15 points, 2 assists; 6 of 7 from the field, 1 of 2 from 3Karl-Anthony Towns: 12 points, 5 reboundsMikal Bridges: 0 points, 0 rebounds, 2 assists; 0 for 5 from the field, 0 for 4 from 3Tue, October 22, 2024 at 8:31 PM EDTScorching Celtics roll to 74-55 halftime leadThe Celtics have been on fire from inside and out with no signs of a championship hangover midway through their season opener. They lead the Knicks, 74-55 at halftime after receiving their championship rings in a pregame ceremony.Tue, October 22, 2024 at 8:22 PM EDTThe Celtics are doing it on both ends of the floor. Here's Jaylen Brown picking Jalen Brunson's pocket for an easy dunk on the other end.Tue, October 22, 2024 at 8:16 PM EDTMiles McBride trying to keep Knicks afloatA Knicks reserve is doing his best to keep New York in this. Miles McBride is 6 for 6 from the field to lead New York with 14 points. But Boston leads, 54-35 midway through the second quarter.Jalen Brunson has 6 points and has made all three of his field goal attempts, but hasn't scored since early in the first quarter. Miles Bridges is 0 for 5 from the field including 0 for 4 from 3-point distance so far in his Knicks debut. Karl-Anthony Towns has 6 points and 4 rebounds.Tue, October 22, 2024 at 8:11 PM EDTCeltics hit 10 1Q 3sHere's a look at all 10 made 3s by the Celtics in the first quarter.Tue, October 22, 2024 at 8:08 PM EDTJayson Tatum's shot? Not brokenThere was some concern about Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum's jump shot over the summer. He shot 28.3% from 3-point range in the playoffs. He missed every jumper he took at the Olympics and sat for two of Team USA's six games in Paris, leading many observers to believe his shot had something to do with it.Asked about his errant jumper at media day, Tatum conceded that he had made some slight adjustments to his mechanics, though he explained that these kinds of minor tweaks are common practice for him.“Been working with my trainer a lot recently in the last few weeks,” he said last month. “A few mechanical things — pick-up points, hand placement, getting lower, keeping my shoulders forward and things like that. ... There were some things I could have fixed, but in the midst of the playoffs, trying to manage your rest, it’s a little tougher. I was still playing well. I just wasn’t shooting the ball as well as I would have liked. And, obviously, we were winning, so it wasn’t the time or the place to try to fix things in that moment.”If we learned anything in the opening minutes of Boston's first game, it was that Tatum's shot is far from broken (if it ever was). He attempted six 3s in the opening quarter and made four of them, staking the Celtics to a 43-24 lead in the opening frame. This after he shot 41.4% from distance in the preseason.Tue, October 22, 2024 at 8:05 PM EDTCeltics catch fire for 43-24 leadAfter taking a 21-16 lead into the second timeout of the game, the Celtics have taken over. Boston ran off a 22-8 run to close the first quarter and enter the second with a 43-24 lead. They're 16 of 27 from the field and 10 of 17 from 3.They've picked up right where they left off from last season's championship run with a first-quarter gut punch to a Knicks team playing with a revamped lineup.Tue, October 22, 2024 at 7:52 PM EDTThe new-look Knicks have countered with a strong start of their own. They're 8 of 13 from the field early including six points from Jalen Brunson, who's hit all three of his shots from the field. Karl-Anthony Towns in on the board with his first bucket as a Knick.Tue, October 22, 2024 at 7:50 PM EDTThere's no ring ceremony hangover in Boston. The Celtics are off to a hot start with a 21-16 lead at the 4:51 mark of the first quarter. They're 8 of 17 from the field including a 4-of-9 pace from 3. Looks a lot like last season so far.Tue, October 22, 2024 at 7:37 PM EDTJayson Tatum opens the game with a 3-pointer, and the new NBA season is underway.Tue, October 22, 2024 at 7:32 PM EDTAnd here's Boston's 18th championship banner:Tue, October 22, 2024 at 7:31 PM EDTHere's the much anticipated new-look Knicks starting lineup:Jalen BrunsonJosh HartOG AnunobyMikal BridgesKarl-Anthony TownsTue, October 22, 2024 at 7:17 PM EDTJayson Tatum kept his comments brief when given the mic to address fans during the ring ceremony.\"This is special, Tatum said. ... \"I can honestly say to the best fans in the world.

He shot 28.3% from 3-point range in the playoffs. He missed every jumper he took at the Olympics and sat for two of Team USA\u0026#39;s six games in Paris, leading many observers to believe his shot had something to do with it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAsked about his errant jumper at media day, Tatum conceded that he had made some slight adjustments to his mechanics, though he explained that these kinds of minor tweaks are common practice for him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Been working with my trainer a lot recently in the last few weeks,” he said last month. “A few mechanical things — pick-up points, hand placement, getting lower, keeping my shoulders forward and things like that. ... There were some things I could have fixed, but in the midst of the playoffs, trying to manage your rest, it’s a little tougher. I was still playing well. I just wasn’t shooting the ball as well as I would have liked. And, obviously, we were winning, so it wasn’t the time or the place to try to fix things in that moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we learned anything in the opening minutes of Boston\u0026#39;s first game, it was that Tatum\u0026#39;s shot is far from broken (if it ever was). He attempted six 3s in the opening quarter and made four of them, staking the Celtics to a 43-24 lead in the opening frame.
