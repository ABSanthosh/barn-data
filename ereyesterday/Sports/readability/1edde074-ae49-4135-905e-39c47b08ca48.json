  "text": "Nick Diaz Army member Nick Maximov was surprised by his UFC and PFL releases but is determined to get back to the brand that long motivated him.The past couple of years have been full of challenges, but Nick Maximov refuses to be deterred.Through injuries and a surprising release, followed by a new mission that was called off before it launched, the Nick Diaz Army member has remained positive and focused even in the midst of adversity.\"It's probably honestly one of the hardest things,\" Maximov told MMA Junkie. \"When you're an up-and-comer, it's easy to get noticed and people f*ck with you and want to talk to you and sh*t like that. Going back to the regional scene is so bizarre.\"Surprising newsMaximov was 24 when he hit free agency after a four-fight UFC stint with a 2-2 record. He entered the UFC with much hype due to his grappling credentials and his contract-earning win against 54-pounds-heavier Oscar Cota to earn his contract.After wins over Cody Brundage and Puna Soriano, and losses to Andre Petroski and Jacob Malkoun, Maximov was surprised to find out online his name was removed from the roster following the completion of his four-fight deal.\"I was like, 'Damn.' That's a lot of emotions and a lot of stuff to deal with at a younger age,\" Maximov said. \"Because this is your dream. A lot of people don't even make it that far, let alone when they are 22 or 23 years old. I feel like you learn a lot about yourself and how to try to fight past it. There is going to be a lot more bad days than good days when you're trying to make it back. It's almost easier being 0-0, just starting out trying to make it than making it and getting pushed back to the side and then you try to remake it again. That's a lot f*cking harder, and it makes you that much sweeter and that much better.\"Exiting the UFC was a big blow, but on the heels of a devastating knee injury, it was made worse. The brain wanted to resume the journey. The body could not.Maximov underwent surgery for a full ACL tear and meniscus injury. Unable to walk, it took him 18 months to recover. There was no consolation prize for recovery. When he got over the finish line, he found himself at a career drawing board.Maximov returned in August 2024 when he defeated UFC alum Elias Urbina by first-round submission. He then won Urijah Faber's A1 Combat gold against Kevem Felipe, and followed it with another win over Said-Magomed Abdulagaziev.\"It was hard for sure,\" Maximov said. \"Learning to walk again and run and train and do all that, that's the hardest part – really starting all over and kind of accepting this is the life for right now and trying to accept this as a reality. It took me a while, but it feels really good. I run more than I've ever ran. I almost over-emphasize using my knee now, because I just want it to be so strong and the best it can be. It's a tough injury. I know a lot of people's careers end from it. I was really determined to not let that be me. If it happens, it happens. But I'm glad it didn't.\"To PFL or not to PFLMaximov's next big break came – and then it went.Signed as an alternate for the 2025 PFL middleweight tournament, Maximov was expected to backfill an April 18 vacancy left by Jordan Newman, who was to be elevated into a main event spot vs. Impa Kasangany because of visa issues with Fabian Edwards.However, days after his offer, Maximov was notified the promotion secured Edwards a visa, so everything would be reset to its original state. He would be given a fight in June instead.One week prior to the April 18 bout, Newman withdrew due to injury. Maximov was offered the opening but made the difficult decision to decline it due to the extreme short-notice nature of the switchup.PFL then elected to part ways with Maximov.\"It was not a bad purse,\" Maximov said. \"It is what it is. But to gamble my career on it? I wasn't even guaranteed another fight after this. If I went in there and lost for whatever reason, I could be back even further. If you lose a fight, you're three fights back.\"Maximov 2.0So now what?The answer is easy for Maximov. He wants back in the UFC.In order to put himself in the best position to do so, he's reassessed what went wrong the first time out. Maximov thinks his increased maturity would make a second UFC run more dominant.\"When you are 23 or 24 years old, going against these big-ass grown men, you don't see a lot of younger dudes like that at the bigger weight classes, kind of almost for a reason,\" Maximov said. \"Dudes are just so much more mature and bigger and more manly. At 135, it's almost like a younger man's weight class in my opinion. I think that's why all the bigger dudes are all champions when they are like f*cking 30 – early-to-mid or even late thirties. (Michael) Bisping, Luke (Rockhold) – all these guys were champs in their mid-to-late 30s.\"Speaking of the Bispings and Rockholds of the world, Maximov has changed his training situation. While he will forever remain loyal to the Diaz Brothers, he's moved to train under legendary coach Jason Parillo to improve his striking.\"He's probably one of the best coaches in the world,\" Maximov said. \"For MMA-boxing, like standup for MMA, he's got to be up there. He was the head coach at RVCA, but he doesn't train a million fighters. He picks and chooses which guys he wants to work with and who he doesn't. He's had so many world champions and world title fights. That speaks more to me than being at a big gym and being like, 'Oh there are 50 MMA fighters, including 30 UFC fighters, etc.'\"Time heals all, whether injuries or reputations. Look no further than how well Maximov's four-fight UFC run has aged. All four of his opponents remain in the UFC with .500 or above promotional records. Maximov hopes the UFC will recognize all this and give him another opportunity.\"We're going to shoot for the UFC,\" Maximov said. \"That's the goal and has always been the goal. Hopefully this shows I want to go to the UFC more than anything, rather than going to their rival.\" SMS Facebook Twitter Email",
