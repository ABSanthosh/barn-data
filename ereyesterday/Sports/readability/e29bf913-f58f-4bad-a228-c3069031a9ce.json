(AP Photo/Matt Slocum)The Philadelphia Eagles rebounded from a pair of rough passing games to bully a Pittsburgh Steelers team that lost star pass rusher T.J. Watt to a reported high-ankle sprain.The Eagles took an early lead despite multiple turnovers and never trailed in a 27-13 victory, their 10th straight win.Philadelphia improved to 12-2, tying the Detroit Lions for most wins in the NFC. The Steelers, falling to 10-4, still lead the Baltimore Ravens by one game in the AFC North. If Pittsburgh wins at Baltimore next week, the Steelers will clinch the division.The Steelers will hope their offense can better support their defense and special teams by then. And they’ll hope that Watt, whose two Sunday sacks improved him to 11.5 on the year, will be healthy enough to face the Ravens after suffering what appeared to be a non-contact injury on a fourth-quarter pass rush.After the game, head coach Mike Tomlin said “it could be described as a low ankle [injury] at this juncture.”Pittsburgh managed just 163 total offensive yards to the Eagles’ 401.Pittsburgh will hope its offense is better able to support its defense and special teams by then. Against a talented Eagles defense, Pittsburgh managed just 163 total offensive yards.In the unofficial battle of Pennsylvania between teams with double-digit wins, the Eagles quickly muffled the friction between quarterback and receivers while the Steelers showed just how sorely they needed their top receiver George Pickens, who missed the game with a hamstring injury.No matter that A.J. Brown had publicly voiced discontent with the passing game a week earlier. Hurts found Brown on the second play of the game for seven yards and again later in the first quarter on a 24-yard, back-shoulder fade that cornerback Joey Porter Jr. couldn’t pace.Brown also found the end zone first in the game — just his second time in the last seven games — to cap off a diverse drive featuring a Jalen Hurts seven-yard scramble, a 22-yard, well-cut Saquon Barkley carry and a fake handoff that ultimately freed Brown.The Steelers defense and special teams came out strong.Watt stripped Hurts on a scramble, and linebacker Mark Robinson’s hit prompted a Cooper DeJean punt return fumble. But the Steelers struggled to capitalize on the gifted possessions. An anemic offense missing Pickens needed more than 20 minutes of game time before it managed a first down.Hurts would fire to DeVonta Smith for a two-yard touchdown before the Steelers managed to sustain a drive. Philadelphia outgained Pittsburgh 148 yards to 2 in the first quarter.Then, Pittsburgh began settling into its Pickens-less rhythm. Russell Wilson hit tight end Ben Skowronek for a 17-yard catch-and-run to start a drive that would ultimately be defined by quarterback keepers. Backup quarterback Justin Fields gained one first down by penalty on a scramble, Wilson moving the chains twice more with his legs. On third-and-goal, Wilson pegged his most reliable end-zone target: Tight end Pat Freiermuth caught the trafficky pass for a nine-yard score, Freiermuth’s team-high sixth receiving touchdown of the season.A Watt sack that Hurts didn’t see coming quickly returned the ball to Pittsburgh, but the Steelers couldn’t recover from a Nolan Smith sack that set them back 10 yards. As the second quarter waned, Chris Boswell’s 49-yard field goal narrowed Philadelphia’s lead to 17-13.Eagles pulled away in second half as Steelers blew their chancesThe Eagles came out of halftime with good news: Barkley, despite a red-zone flip that sent him to the medical tent and an extended sideline visit in the second quarter, was healthy enough to return. Head coach Nick Sirianni told Fox sideline reporter Erin Andrews that Barkley’s second-quarter spell was about Kenneth Gainwell’s two-minute ability rather than Barkley’s health (play-by-play analyst Kevin Burkhardt promptly disagreed).Philadelphia bled the clock on a 13-play drive to start the second half, extending their possession after a Steelers unnecessary roughness penalty on Jake Elliott’s made 48-yard field goal gave the Eagles an automatic first down. Ultimately, Philadelphia wasn’t able to gain more points — just to take more time. Five plays later, Elliott drilled a 41-yard field goal to extend Philadelphia's lead to 20-17.The Steelers came out with a bang and a flea-flicker. Wilson handed off to running back Jaylen Warren, who then tossed back to Wilson … who sailed a 31-yard pass to Calvin Austin. But three plays later, the Steelers doomed themselves. Running back Najee Harris fumbled a toss after Wilson called “can, can” to switch play calls. Eagles cornerback Darius Slay recovered the fumble.With a lead and a potent running game, Philadelphia leaned heavily on Barkley to wear down defenders with his own runs and cause misdirection when Hurts ultimately exploited an open lane for 23 yards. Barkley, Gainwell and Hurts kept pounding until Hurts scored on a \"Brotherly Shove.\"The Steelers failed to narrow the gap on the next drive, center Zach Frazier’s tripping penalty setting them back more than they would recoup. They punted the ball — and, soon after, the win.Hurts completed 25-of-32 passes for 290 yards and two touchdowns in addition to 45 rushing yards and a score on 15 carries. Brown and Smith proved a lethal one-two punch, Brown catching eight passes for 110 yards and a touchdown while Smith had 11 for 109 and a score.Watt continued his disruptive stretch with seven tackles including two sacks and a forced fumble.Wilson completed 14-of-22 passes for just 128 yards and a score, while the Steelers managed just 56 rushing yards.In all, the Eagles held the ball for nearly twice as long as the Steelers, 39:52 to 20:08.",
