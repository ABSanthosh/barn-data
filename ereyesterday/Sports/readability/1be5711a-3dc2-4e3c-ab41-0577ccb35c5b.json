  "text": "playShams: Latest Jimmy Butler suspension leaves 'uneasy feeling' in Miami (1:05)Shams Charania reports on Heat star Jimmy Butler's latest suspension after he missed a team flight to Milwaukee. (1:05)ESPN News ServicesJan 22, 2025, 05:15 PM ETThe Miami Heat are planning to suspend star guard Jimmy Butler for two games, sources told ESPN's Shams Charania on Wednesday.Butler missed a team flight earlier in the day and had plans to join the Heat on Wednesday night, sources said. Now, Miami is keeping him home from its two-game road trip -- Thursday at the Milwaukee Bucks and Saturday at the Brooklyn Nets.Butler had just returned Friday from a seven-game team suspension for \"multiple instances of conduct detrimental to the team.\"\"Through his actions and statements, he has shown he no longer wants to be part of this team,\" the Heat said in a statement when Butler was first suspended Jan. 3. \"Jimmy Butler and his representative have indicated that they wish to be traded, therefore, we will listen to offers.\"Sources told ESPN on Friday that the Heat want to find a deal to accommodate Butler's wishes. But the Heat seek a trade that brings back some combination of players who can help Miami win now, draft capital, movable short-term salary and young talent.To this point, however, that deal hasn't materialized, and it is far from certain one will before the Feb. 6 NBA trade deadline.For his part, Butler said Friday night that he and the franchise \"are where we are\" regarding their relationship less than three weeks from the deadline.\"I guess it's basketball at this point,\" Butler said after his return to the court in Friday's loss to the visiting Denver Nuggets. \"I know what I'm expected to do while I'm here and try to do that to the best of my ability, but we are where we are.\"When Butler was asked what would happen if he was still on the team Feb. 7, he smiled.\"We're playing a lot of 'what-ifs,' ain't we?\" Butler said. \"I'm going to hoop.\"Last month, sources told Charania that Butler's list of preferred trade destinations included the Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets and Golden State Warriors.Butler is in the last guaranteed year of his contract; he has a player option worth more than $52 million for next season.Information from ESPN's Tim Bontemps and The Associated Press was used in this report.",
