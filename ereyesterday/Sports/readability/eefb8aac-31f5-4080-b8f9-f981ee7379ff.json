  "text": "Perhaps not Sevens weather, but there was a definite post-season play-offs feel as the team buses rolled into the Twickenham car park.Supporters shed layers for shades as the sun shone on south-west London and with a change of season in the air, England needed to show a spring in their step.The standings demanded it. With a free-scoring France now making the pace at the top of the table, a bonus point would bolster England's - admittedly slim - chances of a title heist.More importantly though, the public required it. After the strength of the opposition, the situation of the game and the severity of the conditions had variously been blamed for England's inability to deliver running rugby, this was a day that invited ambition and invention.England's pre-match record against Italy was as pristine as the Twickenham turf, with 31 unanswered wins.When Ben Earl galloped clear on the final play to add a seventh try, pump the winning margin to 23 points and make it 32 straight successes, it felt like the hosts had lived up to the occasion.\"We were trying to play a lot more,\" said Luke Cowan-Dickie after the 47-24 win. \"We got seven tries so something went right.\"\"We tried to attack from anywhere. We knew it was going to be risky, but we want to show the fans that we don't want to kick as much and play with the ball.\"\"Us as players decided just to beat people, score more tries and be more aggressive with the ball,\" added wing Ollie Sleightholme, who crossed twice for the hosts.It was clear. England kicked 31 times, but carried 145 times. Against Scotland last time out, they kicked five times more and carried 67 times fewer.A remarkable shift, even allowing for the change in opposition.It isn't a tactic that comes naturally to England's coaching staff, whose Premiership triumph with Leicester in 2022 came via grindingly accurate percentage rugby and a barrage of kicks.And, even with the near-wholesale adoption of a Northampton backline which won the 2024 domestic crown in more style, England's attack took time to throw off the ring rust.A duff pass from Tommy Freeman drew the first groan from the stands inside 30 seconds. Earl was pounced on for a turnover shortly after.For much of the first half Italy snapped and fizzed with more danger, throwing cleverer shapes and more accurate passes.But England, as the old adage goes, earned the right to play before exercising it well in the second half.Marcus Smith, who started the campaign as England's attacking talisman but began this match on the bench, was key.His defensive ability has been questioned, but his tackle on Matt Gallagher early in the second half as the Italy wing loomed out wide was impeccable in intent and execution.Two minutes later he picked his moment in attack perfectly too, timing his run off Tom Curry's shoulder to scamper in. A twin-moment, 10-point swing, that critical passage eased the pressure and allow England to loosen up their style.When Sleightholme dotted down his second it was via a party game of a passing move, with England's forwards improvising increasingly outlandish offloads.By then the Italy defence had faded. It was still streets behind the out-worldly handling France showed off in Dublin the day before.But it was a definite step up by England.The pluses are multiple for head coach Steve Borthwick. Fin Smith, sharp shooting off the tee, put in another cool-headed performance at fly-half, pulling strings and making plays. Fraser Dingwall, forced into an unexpected centre combination by Lawrence's injury, was smart enough to find a way. Elliot Daly, the other half of that makeshift midfield, worked the angles superbly. The 32-year-old's abilities, grey matter as much as fast twitch, will age slowly and well.Ollie Chessum, Tom Curry and Earl ranged wide, far and effectively. Ben Curry and Chandler Cunningham-South added energy from the bench.Jamie George felt the love as the crowd took to their feet to clap him on and off the pitch on his 100th appearance for England. He and his front-row colleagues had the best of the set-piece once more.There will be tougher days and more stringent tests ahead.Cardiff, on the final day, will probably be one of them.Wales have stirred themselves under Matt Sherratt. The prospect of wrecking England's title pretensions, while dodging the Wooden Spoon will brew up an almighty atmosphere under the Principality roof.The sunlight and support won't be nearly so plentiful next week. There won't be much of either for England in that city-centre cauldron. It will be a very different feel.England's challenge is to deliver a similar result -and hope France might wobble and the trophy tips unexpectedly their way.",
