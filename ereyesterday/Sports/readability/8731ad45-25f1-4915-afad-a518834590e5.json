  "text": "British number four Harriet Dart has apologised for asking the umpire to tell her French opponent to put on deodorant during a first-round loss at the Rouen Open.Dart lost 6-0 6-3 to Lois Boisson, which included the 28-year-old being swept aside in the opening set in just 28 minutes.During a changeover in the second set, Dart was heard on the broadcast asking the official: \"Can you ask her to put on deodorant? She smells really bad.\"But Dart later posted on her Instagram story: \"I want to apologise for what I said on court today, it was a heat-of-the-moment comment that I truly regret.\"That's not how I want to carry myself, and I take full responsibility. I have a lot of respect for Lois and how she competed today.\"I'll learn from this and move forward.\"Boisson, who had walked back on to the court while Dart was still sat down, appeared to be out of earshot when the Briton made the comment to the umpire.However, she later made light of the incident on her Instagram story, posting an edited photo of her holding some deodorant and telling toiletries company Dove that they \"apparently need a collab\".BBC Sport has contacted the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for comment.During the match, Dart failed to convert any of her six break points as the 21-year-old Boisson claimed a comprehensive victory to reach the last 16.Boisson, who is making her first WTA Tour appearance of the season after struggling with injury, is currently 303rd in the world rankings.She caused an upset by beating the 62nd-ranked Dart, who lost her serve four times in the match.The Briton was appearing in her second clay-court match of the season before next month's French Open, having also lost to Varvara Gracheva last month in the first round at the Charleston Open.",
