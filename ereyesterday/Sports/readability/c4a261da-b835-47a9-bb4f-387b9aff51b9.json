The Warriors are among the teams with interest, sources told ESPN's Brian Windhorst.Suns owner Mat Ishbia, who pulled off a blockbuster deal to acquire Durant from the Brooklyn Nets hours after his purchase of the franchise became official in February 2023, has publicly declared that he has no intention to trade the star forward.",
