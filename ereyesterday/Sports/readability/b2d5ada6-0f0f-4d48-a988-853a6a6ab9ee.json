  "text": "Associated PressJun 1, 2025, 07:18 PM ETERIN, Wis. -- Maja Stark had lost her confidence heading into the U.S. Women's Open.Her decision to stop worrying about that sparked her to the biggest title in women's golf.The 25-year-old Swede shot an even-par 72 on Sunday and stayed ahead all day. Her four-day total of 7-under 281 at Erin Hills left her two strokes ahead of top-ranked Nelly Korda and Japan's Rio Takeda.\"I think that I just stopped trying to control everything, and I just kind of let everything happen the way it happened,\" Stark said. \"During the practice days, I realized that, if I just kind of hovered the club above the ground a little bit before I hit, I released some tension in my body. I think that just doing my processes well and knowing, giving myself little things like that, was the key this week because I don't really want to rely on my confidence for stuff.\"Stark became the sixth Swede to win a women's major, and the first since Anna Nordqvist in the 2021 Women's British Open. Stark also won her second career LPGA Tour title.The former Oklahoma State player is the first Swede to win a U.S. Women's Open since Annika Sorenstam earned her third title in 2006. The only other Swede to win this event was Liselotte Neumann in 1988.\"They texted me yesterday and just kind of said, 'Bring it home,'\" Stark said.Stark's steadiness made the difference as she held off Korda and a host of other challengers.Korda closed with a 71, and Takeda had a 72 to tie for second. Hye-Jin Choi (68), Ruoning Yin (70) and Mao Saigo (73) tied for fourth at 4 under. Hailee Cooper (70) and Hinako Shibuno (74) were 3 under.Stark's playing partner, Julia Lopez Ramirez, fell out of contention early on her way to 79 that left her tied for 19th. Lopez Ramirez, who entered the day just one shot off the lead, had a triple bogey on 18.This was as close as Korda has come to winning a U.S. Women's Open.Korda discussed her \"complicated relationship\" with the U.S. Women's Open this week, as her best previous finish was a tie for eighth place in 2022 at Pine Needles. She missed the cut at this tournament last year after posting an 80 in the opening round.\"I played this event when I was 14 years old, so maybe a little bit more emotional about it,\" Korda said. \"I mean, definitely it's gotten my heart broken a couple times. ... To have that showing last year definitely put a dagger into my heart, but that's just golf. You're going to lose more than you win a majority of the time.\"I feel like I actually learn a lot about myself and my game and where I need to improve playing the U.S. Women's Open because it does test every part of your game.\"Korda birdied Nos. 7 and 8 but missed a 9-foot birdie putt on No. 9 that would have tied her for the lead. Korda's birdie attempt on No. 9 came minutes after Stark's bogey-free streak ended at 21 on No. 7.Stark then extended her lead to three by making a 14-foot birdie putt on No. 11 immediately after Korda missed a par putt of just under 5 feet at No. 13.Korda, Shibuno and Takeda got within two strokes of Stark with birdies on the par-5 14th, though Korda missed a 14-foot eagle putt and Shibuno missed an eagle attempt from 9Â½ feet.Stark then made a birdie of her own on No. 14 to regain her three-stroke advantage at 9 under. She maintained that lead despite bogeying the last two holes.\"I didn't look at the leaderboards until I was on like 17,\" Stark said. \"I caught a glimpse of it. It was nice. I wasn't as nervous as I thought that I would be because it felt like I have somewhat control of my game and I kind of know what's going on.\"Stark credited caddie Jeff Brighton, a former standup comedian who helped keep her loose by telling jokes and making sure she didn't dwell on what was at stake.\"We just kind of tried to talk about some stuff and not be too into my own putt,\" she said.Said Brighton: \"I would say Maja's quite an intense player. She tries really hard and is really competitive, so when [a player's] intense, you're trying between shots to just get their head away from golf.\"He spoke wearing a cheesehead hat similar to the ones seen at Green Bay Packers gamesStark maintained her poise well enough to earn a $2.4 million prize in the most lucrative event of the year. Now she just needs to figure out how to spend her winnings.\"Maybe move out of my studio apartment can be one thing,\" Stark quipped.",
