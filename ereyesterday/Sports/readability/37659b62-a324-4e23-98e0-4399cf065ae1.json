  "text": "Can these two UNC WBB stars make WNBA rosters?The 2024-2025 college basketball season was kind to the UNC women's basketball program, which enjoyed its most successful campaign in three years.North Carolina made a run to the Sweet 16, before watching its season come to an end against archrival Duke in a 47-38 offensive struggle. The Tar Heels (29-8, 13-5 ACC) finished tied for fourth with Florida State in a loaded ACC, one which sent nine teams to the NCAA Tournament.Two major factors behind UNC's big season were the vaunted post duo of Alyssa Ustby and Maria Gakdeng, both of whom played themselves into WNBA Draft consideration. Neither got selected during the April 14 Draft, but good news is on the horizon for each.On Tuesday, April 15, both Ustby and Gakdeng received Training Camp Invites. Ustby will head cross-country to Angel City and join the Los Angeles Sparks, while Gakdeng goes southeast to the ATL and joins the Atlanta Dream.Ustby started all but eight of 150 games she played in a North Carolina uniform, averaging 11.9 points and 8.5 rebounds per game over her career. Gakdeng spent the first two years of her collegiate career at Boston College, then flew down to Chapel Hill for her last two, averaging 10.1 points and 6.6 rebounds per game over her 4-year career.Los Angeles is hoping Ustby can help it snap a 4-year postseason drought, the longest in franchise history. Gakdeng will join an Atlanta squad with several postseason appearances, including each of the last two summers, but one that hasn't won a playoff game since 2018.Follow us @TarHeelsWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.
