  "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers continued the summer league on Monday when they took on the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second of three games in Salt Lake City. The summer Sixers were short-handed as they were down rookie VJ Edgecombe who missed the contest with a right thumb contusion.Without Edgecombe, the Sixers had a tough time getting into any type of offensive rhythm as they were unable to get into the paint much and attack in transition. It hurt them as the summer Sixers fell to the Thunder 89-78. Judah Mintz led Philadelphia with 21 points in a start.Jalen Hood-Schifino had 17 points, Johni Broome had six points and four rebounds, and Justin Edwards had 11 points, six rebounds, and five assists.Here are the player grades after the loss to the Thunder:Justin Edwards: C-plusIt’s been a tough go for Edwards in the summer league thus far. He has done some good things in other aspects of the game, but he has had a tough go at it when considering his lack of scoring. He struggled again in this one in terms of his field goal shooting. He also had a tough night in terms of his turnovers in this one. He found a little something late in this one so the Sixers have to feel encouraged by that.Johni Broome: C-plusThe Sixers have to be encouraged by Broome’s 3-point shooting to begin the summer league. His night started with him stepping out and knocking down a corner 3 which is a good sign when considering Philadelphia would like to see some versatility from up and down the roster. There were some tough moments for him in this one, but he did a good job as a rebounder and flashed signs of being a defensive player. He could have been a bit more aggressive offensively, but that’s understandable when considering he is a rookie just trying to find his way in the league.Adem Bona: DBona was hampered by foul trouble in the early going. He picked up four fouls in the first half and was unable to find a rhythm on either end of the floor. He was a non-factor in this one which is a bit surprising.Judah Mintz: B-plusDrawing the start for Edgecombe in this one, Mintz brought an aggressive nature to the game on the offensive end. He was getting into the paint and was able to make some good things happen for himself in terms of scoring the ball. With the Sixers having such a tough time getting into any type of offense, it was important for Mintz to be able to get going.Jalen Hood-Schifino: B-plusThis was a solid performance for Hood-Schifino on the offensive end. He was moving well and with some real fluidity on that side of the floor and with a lot of confidence. He was really the only Sixer who was in a rhythm in the early going and kept Philadelphia in the game. He has shown flashes in the past of being able to put the ball in the basket so this is encouraging, but he has to build off this and be more consistent.Hunter Sallis: CMaking his summer league debut after missing the opener, Sallis had a tough go at it—as the rest of the Sixers did in this one—but he got to the foul line to get the scoreboard moving so Philadelphia will take that.
