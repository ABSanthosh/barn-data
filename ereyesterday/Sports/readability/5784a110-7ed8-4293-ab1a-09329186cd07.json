  "text": "Jul 20, 2025 9:11 PM EDTScottie Scheffler was brilliant once again this weekend at Royal Portrush. On Sunday, he walked away with the Open Championship title, beating Harris English by four strokes. It marked the fourth major victory of Scheffler‚Äôs career, all before his 30th birthday. His play was steady and spectacular, firing rounds of 68, 64, 67 and 68. His only blemish on Sunday came at the eighth hole, where he carded a rare double bogey. After the win, Scheffler made a heartfelt comment about his wife, Meredith, who was holding their son Bennett during the celebration. ‚ÄúEvery time I‚Äôm able to win a tournament, the first person I always look for is my wife.‚Äù Oops!

This was his fourth tournament win of the season‚Äîand his fourth in just over two months. The streak began at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson in May, followed by victories at the PGA Championship, the Memorial Tournament and now the Open Championship. He now turns his attention to the final piece of the career grand slam: the U.S. Open. That tournament will conclude on his 30th birthday. He finished tied for seventh in this year‚Äôs edition. Scheffler has made the cut in 19 of his last 20 major appearances. The only exception came at the 2022 PGA Championship. He‚Äôs held the world‚Äôs No. 1 ranking since March 27, 2022, closing in on 150 consecutive weeks atop the PGA Tour. A former University of Texas standout, Scheffler met Meredith in high school, and the two married in 2020 in Dallas, Texas. About the AuthorRodney Knuppel",
