  "text": "Howard Balzer breaks down Nolen's rookie deal and shares what people are saying about the Cardinals' first-round pick.There have been only eight practices this offseason with the final one of minicamp Thursday, but Arizona Cardinals defensive lineman Walter Nolen III has been receiving rave notices from teammates and coaches.Also important is that Nolen signed his rookie contract this week, a four-year deal, with a fifth-year option worth $19,367,550 guaranteed and includes a signing bonus of $10,725,492. His salary-cap charge in 2025 is $3,521,373.The contract includes minimum base salaries each year ($840,000 this year; $1.005 million in 2026, $1.12 million in 2027 and $1.235 million in 2028.However, his pay in those final three years will be larger because of roster bonuses payable on the fifth day of training camp. That money for first-round picks has often been included in the base salary, but the bonus gets it in their hands earlier than it being prorated over the 18-week season.Those bonuses are $715,343 in 2026; $1,480,686 in 2027 and $2,246,029 in 2028.Now, about those accolades for the player selected with the 16th pick of the draft.Defensive coordinator Nick Rallis reflected on coaches watching a big screen in defensive backs coach Patrick Toney’s office on draft night and how he was “just hoping that we would be able to get Walt. Obviously super excited about the player that he is, the guy that he is.”As for what he’s seen in the brief work so far, Rallis said, “I knew he was gonna be the talent that we saw on tape. I would say he's very coachable, great to work with. You see him take those coaching points immediately to the field, whether that's in individual or when going against the offense. And I can tell he studies hard outside the building because he's got things down pretty fast. So pretty impressive so far.”Fellow lineman Dalvin Tomlinson, signed as a 31-year-old free agent this offseason, said Tuesday, “I love his quickness, his pass rush. I saw him in some drills and stuff today in our team period. He's just fluid like it comes natural to him and as we progress in training camp with pads on, he's just a natural good defensive tackle. It's just like the sky is the limit for him. And I'm happy I'm part of the process to help him continue to improve.”Last year, the Cardinals selected defensive lineman Darius Robinson in the first round at 27 overall. Both are from the SEC with Robinson playing for Missouri and Nolen for Mississippi.“I love it,” Robinson said after the first OTA practice on May 28 about the addition of Nolen. “He was on the other side of the SEC, so I never played against Walt. But I know he's going be a great player, great teammate. Like last week he brought everybody Epsom salts, the Dr. Teal’s bag. So it just shows you he's a high-character young man and he's a really good teammate. So I'm excited to make some plays with him.”Get more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.
