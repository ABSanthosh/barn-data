Last year, for example, none of the first three players selected in last April's draft -- quarterbacks Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels and Drake Maye -- worked out in Indianapolis.Sources told ESPN on Sunday that Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders will not work out at the combine this week. On Monday, Henry Organ, the agent for Boise State star running back Ashton Jeanty, told ESPN's Pete Thamel that his client won't be doing on-field drills.Defensive linemen and linebackers are among the first players to arrive at the combine this week. Those players started their team interviews Monday, with medical exams scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday and on-field workouts set for Thursday in Lucas Oil Stadium.Carter is one of the draft's top prospects overall as the most highly rated edge rusher on the board. He's the No. 2-rated prospect on ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr.'s latest big board, the No. 1 prospect in ESPN draft analyst Matt Miller's latest rankings and No. 2 in ESPN draft analyst Jordan Reid's rankings.He led all FBS players this season with 24 tackles for loss in the Nittany Lions' 16 games to go with 12 sacks and two forced fumbles.",
