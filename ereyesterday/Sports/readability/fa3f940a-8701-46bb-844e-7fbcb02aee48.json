  "text": "Chicago Cubs center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong has played enough games at Wrigley Field in his young big-league career to know the wind can create tricky elements in any game. At first pitch for Friday’s City Series opener against the White Sox, a 21 mph wind blowing out to left-center — with even stronger gusts — had the flags on the old scoreboard whipping. The wind can be a player’s best friend or worst enemy on days like that, so when Sox starter Shane Smith left a slider down the middle of the plate that Crow-Armstrong slugged toward the right-field foul pole in the second inning, he could only wait to see what the wind would do to the ball. Crow-Armstrong and the Cubs caught a break as it stayed fair for a three-run homer. Crow-Armstrong’s 12th home run of the year was the decisive blow in the Cubs’ six-run second that was aided by two sequences at home plate that resulted in runs. Cade Horton (2-0), making his first major-league start and home debut, limited the Sox to three runs in five innings as the Cubs cruised to a 13-3 victory. The Cubs (26-19) recorded their largest margin of victory against the Sox (14-31) at Wrigley and tied their largest ever in the City Series. “That’s kind of one of those blackout moments,” Crow-Armstrong said of his reaction after the homer. “Like, I knew I had enough, but the wind — best friend. That was nice.” Crow-Armstrong became the first player in franchise history to record at least 12 home runs, 30 RBIs and 10 stolen bases in the first 45 games of a season, according to ESPN Stats \u0026 Info. His six RBIs on Friday matched the franchise record for a leadoff hitter, done four times, most recently by Rick Monday on May 5, 1976, versus the Los Angeles Dodgers. Crow-Armstrong’s 2.8 fWAR this season trails only the New York Yankees’ Aaron Judge (4.0) among major-league hitters. “It’s fun to watch,” manager Craig Counsell said. “It’s fun to see a player take another step. He’s taking a step up defensively. He’s taking a big step offensively. It’s an impact player. “The ability for the home run now, that’s probably a pretty big surprise. But you need surprises, so it’s an important one.” Game 1 photos: Cubs take City Series opener at Wrigley Field Horton filled up the zone against the Sox, which proved to be a helpful approach with the challenging elements. All three runs he allowed came on a pair of homers by Miguel Vargas, the first one giving the Sox a two-run lead in the first. Horton settled in after the second, retiring nine of the next 11 batters. He was especially effective in the fifth as he neared his pitch limit. He needed only five pitches to retire the side to end his outing. “Obviously I’m aware of it — being from Oklahoma, it’s not my first time playing in wind and I know how that goes,” Horton said. “But those balls hit, those are home runs. They’re down the middle. (Vargas) took advantage of them. “On days like that, you have to limit baserunners. Solo shots aren’t going to beat you, but you start getting traffic on the bases, that’s when you get the three-run shot, four-run shot.” Walks were an issue at the beginning of Horton’s season at Triple-A Iowa, but he has shown good command to start his big-league career. The Sox wanted to be aggressive against Horton knowing he would attack the strike zone, and he used that to his advantage. Horton hasn’t walked a batter through his first nine innings in the majors over two outings. “I’m fine with giving up hits, but putting guys on, that’s when you start to get in trouble,” he said. “There’s a lot of things that fall and crumble after giving up walks, so just wanting to attack.” Cubs designated hitter Moisés Ballesteros celebrates after driving in a run with a single in the eighth inning against the White Sox on May 16, 2025, at Wrigley Field. (Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune) For as much as the Cubs roster is built around veterans, Friday’s game showed how their prospect development can help them win games this year. Crow-Armstrong, Horton and Moisés Ballesteros — who drove in two runs, including an RBI single in the eighth for his first big-league hit — are all under 24. “They’ve got a lot of talent, and for them to come up on this stage and do it, it’s awesome to just see them contribute,” catcher Carson Kelly said. “And it’s been a lot of fun.” How long Horton sticks in the rotation likely depends on the timing of Shota Imanaga’s return from the injured list with a left hamstring strain, though the Cubs could choose to keep the rookie in the big leagues when that time arrives and shift right-hander Colin Rea back to the bullpen. Counsell expects to have clarity Monday on Imanaga’s timeline. Imanaga has continued to throw while sidelined, rotating among low, medium and high days. The Cubs addressed their rotation depth after the injuries to Justin Steele and Imanaga by signing veteran right-hander Kenta Maeda, 37, to a minor-league deal. The Detroit Tigers released Maeda on May 7 after he allowed nine hits and seven earned runs in eight innings over seven relief appearances. “He has had success, he’s struggled,” Counsell said. “It’s a player that you’ve got to have constant conversations with, and we’ll see where we can maybe make some adjustments and see where he’s at.”",
