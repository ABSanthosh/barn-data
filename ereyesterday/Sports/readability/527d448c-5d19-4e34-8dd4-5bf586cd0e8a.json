But the WNBA playoffs belong to Courtney Williams.Two days and about 1,020 miles ago, Williams led her team to a semifinals victory over the Connecticut Sun, finishing Game 5 with 24 points, 7 assists and 5 rebounds. It was a heroic effort from the Minnesota guard, but ultimately, nothing compared to what she did Thursday night in Game 1 of the WNBA Finals.Since high school, Williams has excelled in the midrange. It’s as much her identity as her platinum blonde buzz cut. She’s been called the \"Midrange Mistress\" and the \"Midrange Monster.\" She’s fine with both nicknames, by the way.“Folks can call me whatever as long as they’re showing me love,” Williams said.Game 1 hero Courtney Williams of the Minnesota Lynx reacts after being fouled late in the second half against the New York Liberty at the Barclays Center on Oct. 10, 2024, in New York. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)She shoots more long 2-pointers than anyone in the WNBA. But just because it's her signature shot, doesn’t mean it’s her only shot.On Thursday, it was her 3-point shooting that secured a 95-93 overtime victory over the heavily favored New York Liberty, who squandered a Finals record 18-point lead.The Lynx were in the midst of the massive comeback after chipping their deficit down to 68-61 to start the fourth quarter. But the Liberty still held a three-point lead late in the game. With one play, Williams put her team on top with 5.1 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.She rose up on the wing and drained a 3-pointer over Sabrina Ionescu, who was also whistled for a foul. Williams then stepped to the line and calmly finished the four-point play.Then, after a Breanna Stewart free throw sent the teams into overtime, Williams once again knocked down a clutch 3-pointer. This one came with 1:16 left in extra time to put the Lynx up 91-87.Both shots were assisted by Alanna Smith, who was part of a Lynx lineup that made getting Williams the ball a priority.“That’s just a testament to how much we trust each other,” Williams said. “We have so many great 3-point shooters, and the fact that these girls are out here trying to get me the ball. I could cry. It’s amazing.”Williams finished Game 1 with 23 points on 9-of-18 shooting (2-of-6 from 3), 5 rebounds and 5 assists.The happy tears have been a constant for Williams since she signed with the Lynx in the offseason. She’s been in the league since 2016, playing for five different organizations, but none has felt like the Lynx.With Minnesota, Williams has found a home. And with that newfound comfort is a newfound energy.“I love it here,” she said. “I say that all the time, and I don’t just say that for fun. These people that I’m around, we believe in each other so much. It’s crazy, man. I’m just happy to be here.”Williams has played in the Finals before, with Connecticut in 2019 and 2022. She found herself on the losing end of both, but her postseason experience is helping the Lynx.Despite not being one of her team’s top 3-point shooting threats, Williams had the wherewithal to step up when her team needed her. It was chaos at the end of the contest, with missed calls, physical play and turnovers on both sides.Williams served as both an opponent instigator and a calming force for the Lynx.“Courtney has been around for a while,” coach Cheryl Reeve said. “She’s been in Finals games, and she knew that her team needed her to get aggressive.”",
