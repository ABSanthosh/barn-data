  "text": "Realistically, this was always likely to be a week of few answers for England.No matter the runs scored by Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope, or the wickets taken by Shoaib Bashir, they come with the caveat of the opposition. That is not meant to be disrespectful to Zimbabwe, but the tourists simply do not compare to the upcoming challenges of India and Australia.And while England will feel they are ticking the boxes at Trent Bridge: runs for the top order, overs for Bashir, a return for Josh Tongue and a look at Sam Cook, by far the most important fact-finding surrounded captain Ben Stokes and his surgically repaired hamstring.As the Test meandered on a sunny Friday afternoon in Nottingham, Bashir's bashed finger meant Stokes had to spring into action. The rest was exhilarating.The captain, playing for the first time this year, may not have employed himself. As Bashir entered the 13th over of his spell, it looked like Stokes' stubbornness to bowl the off-spinner into rhythm.A dropped catch off his own bowling left Bashir with a gash on his right hand and the need to temporarily to leave the field. An over to complete, Stokes removed his cap and proceeded to give England 20 deliveries of hope for the year ahead.Even when he is out of the game, Stokes is English cricket's biggest draw. As he went through his rehab, there was the 'will he-won't he' over the white-ball captaincy. Eventually, it was decided Superman needs time off wearing the cape.The build-up to this Test was dominated by Stokes, first by the revelation he has been teetotal since the beginning of the year, which may or may not have something to do with his investment in a non-alcoholic drinks company.Then, on Wednesday, came his \"put two and two together\" answer to a question about Jacob Bethell. It seemed unusually honest for Stokes to make such a strong hint that Bethell would make an immediate return to the Test team, but everyone in the room took that to be what the captain meant.Later in the evening came clarification from England that Stokes was actually referring to Bethell's place in the squad. At a time when Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum have asked their team to be careful about the messages they give in public, it was the captain who put his foot in it.Still, Stokes is a man who lets his cricket do the talking and the sight of the all-rounder marking out his run sent a jolt of electricity around Trent Bridge.The familiar approach, arcing towards the stumps, heels kicking up, limbs loose. First ball an over-step, next ball an edge off Brian Bennett. Joe Root failed to read the script and take the catch.Stokes would not be denied. His fourth legal delivery had Sikandar Raza edge behind, and in the next over Wesley Madhevere chopped on.The Durham man was England's best on show. He extracted more movement both in the air and off the pitch than Gus Atkinson, Josh Tongue or Sam Cook. His average pace of 82.9mph was his third-highest in a Test since the beginning of last summer.At almost 34 and with a partly bionic body, Stokes has realised he cannot push himself like he did in his younger days. He has promised to limit himself to short spells and was as good as his word - 3.2 overs were all he bowled. Plenty.Given the match situation - Zimbabwe are 30-2 in their second innings and 270 runs behind - it's unlikely Stokes will bat or bowl again in this game. In order to fine-tune for the series against India in June, he may play one of the two matches England Lions have scheduled against India A from 30 May or 6 June.The decision on Bethell will need to be made. One suggestion, to replace Bashir and use Bethell's left-arm spin, feels like a non-starter simply because of the extra strain it could place on Stokes' bowling.England also need the captain to rediscover his mojo with the bat. His last Test century was in the second Ashes Test of 2023 and since the beginning of last year he averages less than 28. England are a stronger team when Stokes can bowl, yet they still need his batting more.So, bar the need for eight more Zimbabwe wickets over the weekend, the defining period of Stokes' captaincy has arrived.For all of the importance of the series against India, England admitted last summer they have been building for the Ashes. It is hard to see how England stand any chance in Australia without Stokes playing a major role.England will travel with a squad of players who have never won a single Test down under. Stokes will be the only batter to have made a hundred in the country and if Mark Wood is not fit, Stokes will be the only bowler with a five-wicket haul there, too.Even then, away Ashes are yet to see the best of England's talisman. In 2013-14 he was the rookie on debut, he missed 2017-18 because of the Bristol incident and the last tour he was tentatively returning from a break from the game.Earlier this week, McCullum asked England to improve their humility. England do not need a humble Stokes in Australia, they need the alpha at his death-defying best.Make no mistake, conjuring victory down under would be Stokes' greatest miracle.Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge was not the time for the England captain to turn water into wine, or whatever non-alcoholic alternative he is favouring these days.It was just a time to be Ben Stokes, and that was reassuring enough.",
