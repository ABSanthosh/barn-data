  "text": "ESPNMar 22, 2025, 08:29 PM ETAfter two jam-packed days of college basketball, the second round of the men's NCAA tournament is underway. The field has been cut in half, the contenders have emerged -- and we get to do it all again today.We've got you covered with all the March Madness action right here, featuring updates from writers at every site and analysis on what each final result means.Jump to: Live updates | Results and analysis | Women's trackerSaturday's schedule (all tips ET):(8) Gonzaga vs. (1) Houston, 8:40 p.m. (TNT) (7) UCLA vs. (2) Tennessee, 9:40 p.m. (TBS)Saturday results(11) Drake vs. (3) Texas TechFinal: Texas Tech defeated Drake 77-64How Texas Tech won: Put simply, the Red Raiders were too big. Two days after the Bulldogs more than held their own physically against a bigger opponent in Missouri, Texas Tech dominated Drake inside, outscoring the Missouri Valley Conference champions in the paint 50-20 behind a monstrous and efficient 25-point (11-of-13 FG), 12-rebound performance from sophomore JT Toppin. Along with a game-high 28 points from Darrion Williams and a 16-point, seven-assist effort from Elijah Hawkins, the Red Raiders had more than enough to overcome a putrid, 2-for-13 shooting performance from 3-point range. For Drake, it's the end to a storybook season powered by first-year coach Ben McCollum, guard Bennett Stirtz (21 points, 8 assists) and an unlikely 10-man rotation filled with Division II and junior college transfers. All eyes now fall on where the Bulldogs -- and McCollum -- go from here, while Texas Tech advances to a Sweet 16 date with 10-seed Arkansas next Thursday in San Francisco. -- Eli Lederman(5) Michigan vs. (4) Texas A\u0026MFinal: Michigan defeated Texas A\u0026M 91-79How Michigan won: The Wolverines survived a breakout tournament from Texas A\u0026M's Pharrel Payne and mustered just enough find-a-way, crunch-time heroics that Michigan coach Dusty May had lauded the day before, to move on to the Sweet 16. Michigan didn't even have a second-half lead until just over six minutes were left in the game. Payne, who had back-to-back games of 25 and 26 points for the Aggies in the tournament -- his two highest-scoring games of the season -- was a problem for most of the game, as was the Aggies' swarming defense that limited Michigan to 43% shooting. But May has said his players take on a different demeanor when it's time to settle in, no matter how the game has gone to that point -- that \"it just looks different.'' The Wolverines went on a 9-0 run to start taking the lead, and that proved to be the difference. Guard Roddy Gayle Jr., who hit several free throws to close it out, led the Wolverines with 26 points while Vladislav Goldin finished with 23 points. -- Jeff Legwold(10) Arkansas vs. (2) St. John'sFinal: Arkansas defeated St. John's 75-66How Arkansas won: In a second-round game that had the intensity and physicality of a Sweet 16 matchup -- with an amped-up crowd contributing to a special March Madness environment -- Arkansas built an 11-point second-half lead before holding off a late charge from St. John's to post the nine-point victory. RJ Luis Jr., the Big East Player of the Year, had nine points on 3-of-17 shooting from the field, as his struggles reflected what ultimately cost the Red Storm most: a brutal shooting performance. After totaling a season-high 14 3-pointers in their first-round win over Omaha, the Storm were 2-of-21 from 3 against Arkansas. They shot 28% from the field.But take nothing away from the Razorbacks, which navigated much of the second half with big man Jonas Aidoo playing with four fouls and backup Zvonimir Ivisic fouling out midway through the second half. That was asking a lot against St. John's Zuby Ejiofor, who was terrific with 23 points and 12 rebounds. St. John's managed to cut the lead to two in the second half, and Amica Mutual Pavilion was buzzing. But Arkansas held its ground. -- Mike Reiss(12) McNeese vs. (4) PurdueFinal: Purdue defeated McNeese 76-62How Purdue won: Purdue played with the pedigree of a team that was in the national championship game a year ago with its convincing 76-62 victory over McNeese. Led by junior forward Trey Kaufman-Renn (22 points, 15 rebounds) and All-America guard Braden Smith's steady hand in the face of pressure, the Boilermakers started fast by opening a 17-6 lead in making an early statement that they weren't overlooking the Cinderella-story Cowboys, who had dominated No. 5 Clemson in the first round. Purdue trailed just once (3-2) in a game that had a \"been-there, done-that\" feel to it. A signature moment came when Smith dove to keep the ball in play in the first half, directly in front of the Purdue bench. It was an all-out effort from the leader who was willing his team into the Sweet 16 in the Midwest Region, where they will play in Indianapolis, about 65 miles from campus in West Lafayette. -- Mike Reiss",
