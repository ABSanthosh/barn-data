(Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-Imagn Images) (USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Connect / Reuters)Randy Orton entered WrestleMania 41, Night 2 without an opponent after Kevin Owens suffered a recent neck injury. That withdrawal opened the door for someone to step in and answer Orton's open challenge — and that someone shockingly turned out to be TNA Champion Joe Hendry.Unfortunately for Henry, his massive opportunity on the grandest stage didn't go all that well.AdvertisementOrton promised whoever answered his challenge an RKO and went for it right away, only to get countered with a failed roll-up from Hendry. The TNA champ pulled out his usual bag of tricks and engaged the crowd, with Orton looking confused — and clearly having fun with the match.Hendry regained momentum after Orton hit some clotheslines and his patented elevated DDT. Hendry recovered to hit a slam and kip-up into his vintage turn to look into the camera.Unfortunately, that's when the RKO struck.That spelled the relatively quick end for the TNA Champion in Orton's 20th WrestleMania appearance.AdvertisementThe duo shared a somewhat nice little moment after the match, with Orton telling Hendry to look around the arena and bask in the moment — before hitting another RKO.Orton hilariously mocked Hendry afterward and sailed off into the night.Check out highlights of Orton's win below.Catch full WrestleMania 41, Night 2 results, highlights and match-by-match coverage here.",
