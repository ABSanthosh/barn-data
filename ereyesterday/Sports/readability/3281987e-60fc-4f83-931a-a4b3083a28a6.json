  "text": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he has told Bruno Fernandes he will not allow him to leave this summer.Club captain Fernandes - who signed a contract extension until 2027 last August - has been United's star player this season.Over the weekend reports emerged linking the 30-year-old with a move to Real Madrid.\"No, it's not going to happen,\" said Amorim, when asked about the rumours in his news conference before Tuesday's Premier League trip to Nottingham Forest.When asked how he could be so certain, the former Sporting coach added: \"He's not going anywhere because I've already told him.\"There was the familiar spark in Amorim's eyes as he delivered the message, suggesting he was having a bit of fun.Fernandes has scored 16 times in all competitions this season while no other United player has reached double figures.In the final week before the most recent international break, Fernandes scored five goals, including a hat-trick in the Europa League last-16 victory over Real Sociedad.Only Mohammed Salah (54) and Erling Haaland (33) have more than Fernandes' combination of 31 goals and assists in the Premier League this term.United have struggled in the league and are in 13th position before they face third-placed Nottingham Forest at the City ground. Amorim and predecessor Erik ten Hag, have repeatedly backed Fernandes, despite external criticism from former United captain Roy Keane in particular.\"I want Bruno here because maybe in the lowest moments of our season he…,\" said Amorim, before tailing off and switching his answer to strike a more positive note.\"We want to win the Premier League again so we want the best players to continue with us. He's 30 but he's still so young because he plays 55 games every season and between assists and goals he's there for 30 at least.\"We are in control of the situation,\" said Amorim. \"But I feel he is really happy here because he understands what we want to do.\"He is also a supporter of Manchester United so he really feels it.\"Sometimes the frustration you see, that everybody sees and maybe says is not a good thing in a captain is a sign he wants this so bad. This is the kind of player we want.\"",
