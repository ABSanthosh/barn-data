Even last season, when coach Jim Harbaugh and his staff boasted about the running game they would create in L.A., the team finished below the league average in rushing yards per game (110.7).Harris rushed for 1,000 yards in each of his first four seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. His physical style of running is one that Harbaugh covets, and it could be the difference in the Chargers' rushing offense next season.The Chargers declined to comment.",
