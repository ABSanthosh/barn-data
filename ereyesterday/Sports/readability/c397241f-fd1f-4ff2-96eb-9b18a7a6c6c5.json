  "text": "Have Liverpool just struck a decisive blow in the title race?Just when small doubts started to emerge about the Reds' Premier League-winning credentials, the much-maligned Darwin Nunez's late double in a 2-0 win at Brentford provided an emphatic answer.Especially when, hours later, title challengers Arsenal threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at home to Aston Villa and leave Arne Slot's men six points clear of the second-placed Gunners with a game in hand.\"Arne Slot said in the week that he couldn't get Darwin Nunez firing. What an important goal that could be for Liverpool,\" Chris Sutton said on BBC Radio 5 Live.\"He's not going to miss those sort of opportunities.\"That's how you win titles. Going to the end, fighting until the end and taking your opportunities.\"After successive draws against Manchester United and Nottingham Forest, a trip to Brentford, who boast the third best home record in the division, was always expected to test Liverpool's character and ability to sustain a championship charge.Liverpool threw everything at Brentford, attempting 37 shots as they dominated proceedings, but it took until the 91st minute to break the deadlock when substitute Nunez turned in from close range and the Uruguay forward sealed the success two minutes later with his second of the afternoon.Brentford's last three home Premier League outings this month have come against Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool.The Bees lost 3-1 to Arsenal and came from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Manchester City, before succumbing late to Liverpool.\"We just played City and Arsenal and now Liverpool, in a short amount of time,\" Brentford manager Thomas Frank told BBC Sport. \"For me they're a level above the two teams. They're complete. Their work ethic, the way they track back, are good indicators. \"They're so good all over the pitch. Such a threat going forward. It's the best team in the Premier League and the world. They're huge favourites to win it [the title].\"Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy said on BBC Match of the Day: \"They played like a team with a point to prove. If people thought Liverpool were having a blip, that was put to bed.\"Ex-Wales centre-back Ashley Williams added: \"Right now, Liverpool have the strongest squad and I think they will win the league.\"They also have their sights set on the Champions League and if they do win that, we can say they are the best in the world.\"Liverpool flew out of the blocks back in August, emerging as serious title contenders, but their momentum had shown signs of slowing in recent weeks.Slot's side dropped nine points in their opening 18 fixtures, losing one and drawing three, but let slip four points in two games prior to facing Brentford.After 90 minutes of Liverpool's trip to London, it appeared another two would go begging. However, they showed spirit and resilience to get the job done.Arsenal failed to maintain pace later in the day when squandering a two-goal lead during a dramatic eight-minute spell in the second half against Aston Villa.\"Liverpool scoring two goals in injury time – and Arsenal doing that, it's a massive swing – I would be shocked if Liverpool didn't win the league now,\" former Gunner Paul Merson said on Sky Sports.Liverpool's late victory might just prove the catalyst required over the coming weeks to land the big prize in Slot's first season at the club.\"A big day in the title race and it has swung even further for Liverpool - there are some real dejected faces in the Arsenal crowd,\" Gary Neville said on Sky Sports.Arsenal were flying when the clocked ticked into the 55th minute as Kai Havertz wheeled away to celebrate their second against Villa after Gabriel Martinelli had opened the scoring.But just 13 minutes later, Villa were level courtesy of Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins.The Gunners rallied and thought they had snatched a winner just three minutes from time when Mikel Merino's shot went in off Havertz, but the goal was ruled out after a video assistant referee (VAR) check for handball.Arsenal have dropped 12 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, their most in a single campaign since 2019-20 (21).\"We were unbelievable. So proud of the way we played, how dominant, how fluid we were and how much we put into it,\" boss Mikel Arteta told BBC Sport.\"We played three games in six days. So proud of them, but at the same time so disappointed. We deserve more. We didn't get it, and we are sad because of that.\"There are moments, and obviously they [Liverpool] managed to do that [win].They made the subs, and the subs made the impact and changed the game. \"On our side it was the opposite, even after conceding the two goals very close to each other. The danger was that I knew half the team could go downhill because we were physically drained.\"Newcastle and Nottingham Forest have also been touted as potential title rivals to Liverpool in recent weeks.But the Magpies' 4-1 home defeat by Bournemouth earlier on Saturday left them fourth and 12 points adrift, while third-placed Nottingham Forest are nine points shy as they host bottom club Southampton on Sunday.Former manager Jurgen Klopp vastly improved Liverpool's fortunes during his nine years at the helm and led the club to a first Premier League title in 2019-20, leaving Slot with big boots to fill when he arrived in the summer.But the Dutchman hasn't skipped a beat as the Merseyside outfit look well on track for a 20th top-flight title - matching the record mark of Manchester United.Despite performing with consistency throughout the majority of the campaign, Slot questioned whether his side could find a way to win at Brentford after failing to find that formula for success in recent weeks.\"Of course I had doubts about it,\" he said.\"So many times in recent weeks we've missed a lot of chances. It would have been surprising if I felt that after all the chances missed today that we'd score in the last five minutes. The players proved me wrong again.\"Brentford have never conceded 37 shots in a game this season so what more can I ask from my players? They gave everything they had.\"Mohamed Salah has been Liverpool's leading man once again this campaign, with the Egyptian registering 18 goals in the league and 21 across all competitions.Liverpool's recent drop in form has coincided with him failing to score - he is without a goal in his last three outings.But Nunez proved to be the unlikely hero.The 25-year-old joined Liverpool for £64m from Benfica in June 2022 after scoring 34 times in 41 appearances for the Portuguese club in the previous season.Nunez hit nine Premier League goals in his debut campaign and 11 in 2023-24.Prior to the decisive double at Brentford he had just two to his name this term.The Uruguay forward has featured in 16 of Liverpool's league fixtures but only seven of those appearances have come from the start and he is fast becoming an impact player for Slot.\"He's always having a lot of impact when he comes in, he brings energy and power,\" Slot told BBC Sport. \"Most of our games are the last half hour in control around 18 yards, and that's where he's at his best. \"The first hour is often open but the last 30 minutes dominant - and then to have someone like Darwin is nice to have.\"",
