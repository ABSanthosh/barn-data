Speaking after this quarter-final win, the 39-year-old had said: \"I want to be a tough nut to crack for everyone, that is what I used to be. That is where I was two or three years ago and I've maybe slipped off the radar a little bit but I am coming back.\"My game is in a great place and my mind is in a good place.\"For Aspinall this will a morale-boosting performance after the world number 11 spoke candidly about suffering with 'dartitis' , external- a condition where players have a mental block when it comes to throwing on the stage. It came after he said he felt \"absolutely shocking\" and was \"under the weather\" before his quarter-final win over Rob Cross. Price is the third winner of the season after victories for Humphries and Littler in the opening two weeks. Humphries failed to make the final for the first time this season after a 6-3 defeat by Price in the semi-finals.He led 2-0 but was blown away by the Welshman's superb finishing that saw him take out six of his seven attempts at a checkout.A pumped up Price had already seen off world number two Littler in the quarter-finals with an impressive 6-4 victory.It means Price has now won his past five matches against Littler. Littler was not at his best, mixing big scoring with low scores and that saw him average less than 100.The 18-year-old was visibly frustrated by the defeat and was seen throwing his darts case to the floor as he made his way off the stage. Seven-time winner Michael van Gerwen reached his third successive semi-final but his throw was broken four times by Aspinall in the semi-finals. Aspinall's run to the final means Stephen Bunting, who is playing in the Premier League for the first time since 2015, is the only player without a win. He posted on X, external after his 6-4 defeat by Humphries to say \"still a few nerves\" and it is \"a marathon not a sprint\". Week four takes place in Exeter on 27 February.
