  "text": "Liverpool's reshaped style under new head coach Arne Slot may be more middle of the road than the \"heavy metal\" of predecessor Jurgen Klopp, but it has taken them on a direct route to the top of the Premier League.Slot's tempo is more measured than the full-tilt thrills that were Klopp's trademark, but the 2-1 win over Chelsea in an engrossing Anfield encounter continued the Dutchman's near flawless start since taking charge of the Reds.Liverpool's outstanding opening in the new era has been framed by the standard of opposition they have faced, meaning optimism has been cloaked with caution, with this meeting with Enzo Maresca's improving Chelsea regarded as Slot's biggest test, even though he has already enjoyed a 3-0 win at Manchester United.It was an examination Liverpool had to dig deep to pass, in what was a show of resilience and mental strength - as opposed to the glorious attacking chaos that brought so much success under Klopp.And it was no less enjoyable for all that as far as the home fans were concerned. They celebrated raucously at the final whistle, the magnificent Curtis Jones deservedly the match-winner after Nicolas Jackson had equalised Mohamed Salah's first-half penalty.Liverpool seem able to exert greater control under Slot's more studied style than on the occasions when so many victories were secured after a wild ride under Klopp.This must never be taken as a criticism of the German, who left at the end of last season after a nine-year spell as boss, but Slot's early statistics are hugely impressive - the home defeat by Nottingham Forest in September the one blot on his record.This was Slot's 10th win in 11 games, their best record in any campaign since 1990-91, when then-manager Kenny Dalglish had an identical record. During the Premier League era, only Manchester City's Pep Guardiola, who won his first 10 matches, has reached that many wins in all competitions in fewer matches than Slot.For someone entrusted with the weighty responsibility of succeeding an Anfield icon in Klopp, Slot has carried it comfortably in his quiet, understated fashion.Chelsea's pass completion rate of 88.1% was the highest on record, since 2003-04, by any away team at Anfield in a Premier League game. And yet, apart from a couple of late scares, Liverpool gave off an air of control that is fast becoming a Slot hallmark.Maresca's side may have had the ball but Liverpool were solid, with deputy goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher, in for injured Alisson, rarely troubled.Liverpool's passing accuracy of 85.9% this season is only slightly improved on Klopp's final campaign (85.8%), while Slot's side are playing fewer long balls per game, 22.6 as opposed to 25.3 last term. While some stats are similar, there is a marked difference in passes played into the box, with 39.3 per game under Klopp last season and 28.9 under Slot.And there is also a more structured defensive look to Slot's Liverpool, with the stats suggesting they are pressing less aggressively this season. They regained possession in their attacking third 6.1 times per game last season, while that figure is now down to 4.3 times.Liverpool were fourth best in the league by that measure in Klopp's farewell campaign. This season, under Slot, they are down to ninth.There are few huge differences statistically but this is undoubtedly a different Liverpool to watch, not as exciting or frenetic but so far just as effective.Chelsea actually dominated possession at Anfield with 57.3%, while Liverpool’s tally of eight shots on target was the fewest they have had in a Premier League game at Anfield since February 2021.Liverpool, however, never felt under siege or serious sustained pressure.Slot accepted this was more a case of substance than style as he told BBC Sport: \"Many other games were hard but this might have been the hardest maybe because of the amount of quality players they have and the structure they have. We had to fight really hard to get this one over the line.\"We defended so strong through the whole team. There was incredible work-rate.\"The Dutchman added: \"The better the teams you face the more you need to fight. In the Premier League there are so many good teams, so if you want to win at least you need to fight and then hopefully the individuals can make the difference.\"We showed up. That was the most important thing.\"Liverpool also responded well to pressure applied from down the M6 by Manchester City earlier on Sunday - Guardiola's defending champions briefly returning to top spot with a dramatic, controversial late win at Wolverhampton Wanderers.The Reds are back in pole position before next Sunday's visit to title rivals Arsenal, who are four points behind.This was Liverpool's biggest test on two levels and the response was impressive against a Chelsea side who are unquestionably on the road to recovery under Maresca, only lacking the punch to go with their possession.Jones was the Anfield outfit's headline act with arguably his finest performance for the club, earning Salah's penalty and then seeing another spot-kick awarded when he was bundled over in a challenge with Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez, only to see it overturned by the video assistant referee (VAR).He not only scored the winner but flung himself in front of Cole Palmer when Chelsea's in-form talisman looked poised to strike.Liverpool-born Jones delivered the complete performance on a day when his team put down yet another marker that life at Anfield can still flourish under Slot in the post-Klopp era. In some ways different, but just the same in so many others.",
