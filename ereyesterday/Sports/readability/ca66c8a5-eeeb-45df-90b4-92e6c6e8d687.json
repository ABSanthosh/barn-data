While narrating during the broadcast, Dokoupil called Hudson \"a constant presence during our interview.\"\"I clearly communicated with my publicist at Simon \u0026 Schuster that any promotional interviews I participated in would agree to focus solely on the contents of the book,\" Belichick said in his statement Wednesday. \"Unfortunately, that expectation was not honored during the interview.\"CBS News on Wednesday issued its own statement, denying there were \"preconditions or \"limitations\" to the interview.\"When we agreed to speak with Mr. Belichick, it was for a wide-ranging interview,\" CBS News said in the statement. \"There were no preconditions or limitations to this conversation. This was confirmed repeatedly with his publisher before the interview took place and after it was completed.\"During their discussion, Dokoupil also asked Belichick why he didn't mention New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft once in the book, including in the acknowledgments. Belichick won six Super Bowls in New England with Kraft as the owner. Dokoupil noted that Kraft had said he \"fired\" Belichick after the 2023 season; Belichick responded that it was a \"mutual decision.\"Belichick accused Dokoupil of introducing \"unrelated topics\" into the conversation. That, according to Belichick, prompted Hudson to speak up.\"I repeatedly expressed to the reporter, Tony Dokoupil, and the producers that I preferred to keep the conversation centered on the book,\" Belichick said in the statement. \"After this occurred several times, Jordon, with whom I share both a personal and professional relationship, stepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion.\"She was not deflecting any specific question or topic but simply doing her job to ensure the interview stayed on track.\"Dokoupil asserted during the broadcast that Belichick and Hudson were \"not comfortable\" commenting on how they met. Belichick said that made it appear as though he and Hudson were avoiding the question.\"We have been open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021,\" he said in his statement Wednesday.",
