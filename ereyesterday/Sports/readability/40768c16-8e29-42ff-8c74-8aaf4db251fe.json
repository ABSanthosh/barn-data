  "text": "Liverpool's long wait ended as the giant red and white clock in the corner of the Kop flicked over to 18:24 BST on the day that was Anfield's destiny.The small detail was Tottenham Hotspur had been swept aside. The big picture was Liverpool were now officially Premier League champions and, with great significance, had equalled Manchester United's total of 20 titles.As Liverpool's team coach emerged from plumes of red smoke blowing towards the stadium on Anfield Road, the smell of sulphur and cordite hanging heavy in the air, the banners and scarves read: \"The Most Successful Club In England.\"This was a moment 35 years in the making. Liverpool could celebrate a title win with their own vast support, in their own stadium, in front of the Kop. They had last experienced this sort of elation when Sir Kenny Dalglish, who was watching from the directors' box, led Liverpool to victory over Queens Park Rangers on 28 April 1990.Jurgen Klopp led them to the Premier League title in 2020, but the celebrations were played out in the genteel surroundings of Formby Golf Club, and the trophy lift in front of invited family and friends at a deserted Anfield amid the Covid-19 pandemic.This explained the release of emotion at the final whistle, which had been building up hours before kick-off. It was finally unleashed in a wall of sound - fireworks exploded behind the Kop, another fog of red smoke swept around Anfield accompanied by an outpouring of tears from players and fans alike.At the heart of it all was head coach Arne Slot, the modest Dutchman who has made the so-called impossible task of succeeding Jurgen Klopp look so easy.It had been 343 days since Klopp said his Anfield farewell, attempting to ease the air of uncertainty about his departure swirling around Liverpool by singing a song in honour of his soon-to-be-anointed successor.The tune echoed around Anfield throughout this 5-1 win, and Slot delivered his own version in tribute to Klopp as ecstasy unfolded around him.\"To replace Jurgen is a big job and the manager did it in his own way and deserves a lot of credit,\" said captain Virgil van Dijk. \"I don't think anyone from the outside world thought we would be Premier League champions.\"Hours before the storm started there was little calm around Anfield.The entire area was a sea of red from mid-morning - thousands of supporters waited in long lines to be among the first into the stadium, the usual watering holes were packed and Anfield Road was jammed with fans as far as the eye could see.Liverpool owner John W. Henry made one of his rare Anfield visits for the coronation, while tickets were reportedly selling at £3,000 on the black market. Neil Atkinson from the Anfield Wrap told BBC Radio 5 Live he felt like he was on his way to his wedding. Abigail Rudkin, also from the Anfield Wrap, likened the excitement to Christmas morning.\"Just to get to be with everyone, for all of us to get to be here and sit together, it does make the difference,\" she said.\"You can say to yourself 'just win it', but for us fans all of us being together, for the players to be there with us, to be at Anfield - that's what it's all about.\"In reality, this win against a submissive Spurs was simply a step on the road from Anfield's anticipation to the glorious realisation that the prize was theirs.Once Liverpool had applied the correction to Dominic Solanke's shock early goal, it was party time - no better illustrated than when Mohamed Salah celebrated his goal, Liverpool's fourth, by taking a phone to snap the selfie of a lifetime with the Kop as his backdrop.Liverpool fans belted out the old title-winning songbook as they watched their triumphant team rip Spurs apart.Watching intently from the sidelines was Slot, who has brought a more measured approach to the thrilling chaos of Klopp's Liverpool without removing any of the potency. He has not simply been the beneficiary of the outstanding squad he inherited, he has added value with his tactical acumen.Slot was uncharacteristically agitated at times, focusing on the unfolding events in front of him rather than acknowledging the constant demands from the Kop for recognition.He waited until the board for four extra minutes went up before blowing kisses to his family in the stand and applauding the fans. It was then time for a congratulatory embrace with opposite number Ange Postecoglou before he gathered his trusted backroom staff around him.When the celebrations started on the pitch, Liverpool's players ran wildly towards the Kop before Slot donned the red shirt and gave them the Klopp-style fist pumps they have wanted for eight months.Individual players were called forward to take their bow. Trent Alexander-Arnold's future may be in doubt among links to Real Madrid, but on Sunday Liverpool were the centre of his world. The future, for now, can wait.Slot, the architect of this triumph, told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Looking back I have enjoyed the whole day. You could see looking in their eyes how much it meant to them. It was impossible to us to not get that point or win today.\"What else is there to say? It is unbelievable. From this moment now I am part of the history of this great football club.\"",
