  "text": "Cam Ward sets Division I record for most passing TDs in a career (0:35)Cam Ward finds Jacolby George for a touchdown, giving him the Division I record for most career passing touchdowns. (0:35)Associated PressDec 28, 2024, 04:34 PM ETORLANDO, Fla. -- Cam Ward made NCAA history in his final college game.The Miami Hurricanes quarterback threw a record-setting 156th touchdown pass of his college career Saturday, connecting with Jacolby George for a 4-yard score with 4:12 left in the first quarter of the Pop-Tarts Bowl.That's the Division I -- FBS and FCS -- record, one more than Houston's Case Keenum threw from 2007 through 2011.Ward finished with three touchdown passes in the first half, pushing his total to 158. Emory Williams started and played the second half for Miami, which went on to lose 42-41 to Iowa State.Ward might not hold the record for long. Oregon's Dillon Gabriel -- whose team could play as many as three games in the College Football Playoff -- has 153 touchdown passes so far in his career, spanning six seasons at UCF, Oklahoma and now Oregon.Either way, Ward is assured of finishing college with one of the top careers by any quarterback at any level.He entered Saturday with 17,999 yards -- 6,908 at Incarnate Word, 6,968 at Washington State and 4,123 at Miami -- for the third-most in NCAA history behind only Keenum (19,217) and Gabriel (18,423).And when it's all done, Ward will be on the touchdown list for a while as well.The all-division NCAA record is 162 touchdown passes by John Matocha from Division II's Colorado School of Mines from 2019 through 2023.Tyson Bagent of Division II's Shepherd threw for 159 touchdowns from 2018 through 2022. Braxton Plunk of Division III's Mount Union threw for 158 from 2019 through 2023; North Central's Luke Lehnen, whose team will play in the Division III national championship game next month, also has 158 in his career.And now Ward has 158, as well.Ward rewrote Miami's record book in 2024, his lone season with the Hurricanes. He will leave as Miami's single-season leader in yards, completions and touchdown passes. He was on pace entering Saturday to leave as the Hurricanes' leader in completion percentage -- for a season (65.8%, set in 2023 by Tyler Van Dyke) and for a career (64.3% by D'Eriq King in 2020 and 2021).",
