  "text": "The full-time whistle at Emirates Stadium on Saturday was met with a smattering of boos from Arsenal supporters, knowing this was a huge missed opportunity to drag themselves back into contention in the Premier League title race.The Gunners were held to a frustrating goalless draw by Everton and cannot afford too many more slip-ups if the league trophy is to head back to north London for the first time in more than two decades.Mikel Arteta's men have set themselves a high standard after running Manchester City close in recent seasons but are already playing catch-up on leaders Liverpool, who drew 2-2 with Fulham at Anfield.Against the Toffees, Arsenal dominated possession with 76% and had 13 shots, but were unable to breakdown a resolute Everton backline.\"I am disappointed not to win the game,\" said boss Arteta. \"There is only one team that deserves to win and that is Arsenal.\"We gave nothing away - no shots conceded, dominated the play, did not allow them to run, no set-pieces and the high press was excellent.\"We generated chances but you have [to score] with all the dominance. I cannot ask more more from the boys apart from putting the ball in the net. We have to put them away.\"Third-placed Arsenal are on 30 points after 16 games, having failed to win half of their games, and it highlights a drop-off in form from the previous two campaigns.At this same stage last season, they were on 36 points and in second place, while the season before, they were sitting top of the table on 40 points.They have lost just twice so far, the same number as those two seasons, but draws are costing them this term with six to their name.After failing to beat Fulham last Sunday, Arsenal have drawn back-to-back league games for the first time since April 2023, while this was their first goalless draw at home since January 2023 against Newcastle.So is the lack of a prolific striker becoming a problem?Arsenal have scored four fewer goals than at this stage last season and 11 fewer than in 2022-23.Their shot conversion rate is 12.8%, which is on par with their expected conversion rate of 12.3%. They have scored as many non-penalty goals after 16 games this season as they did last season (27), but have won four fewer penalties.The Gunners have taken 13 fewer shots than they had at the same stage last term.Their current expected goals (xG) is 27.7, compared to 29.71 after 16 games last season and 31.53 at the same stage in 2022-23.Arsenal have found the net 29 times this season, but the division's better sides usually overperform their xG because they have better players at their disposal.By way of contrast, Arteta's side overperformed their xG by three goals last season, and by 8.5 in 2022-23.Of the 27 goals (excluding penalties) they have scored during the Premier League this season, nine have come from set-pieces, which is 33.33% of their overall tally.So, Arsenal's finishing is down in terms of overperforming xG which a top striker could help with, but their creativity in terms of the amount of shots they're creating is also down.You could also argue though a striker could help with that too in terms of greater movement and anticipation helping him get chances that others wouldn't.With the January window about to open, Arsenal have been linked with a move for Newcastle's in-form Alexander Isak and Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic.Ex-Arsenal defender Martin Keown recently said on TNT Sports the side could do with a \"different tool in the box\" and a player who can \"find an opportunity out of nothing\".Since the start of last season, Kai Havertz and Bukayo Saka together account for a third of the team's goals but one moment in the second half highlighted why they are missing a finisher.A pass was slipped through into the box for Havertz, but the Germany international was unable to sort his feet out and Everton cleared the ball, whereas a clinical number nine may well have controlled it and slotted home.Former Arsenal winger Theo Walcott said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Any opportunity that Arsenal don't get a result is always going to be a missed opportunity because Liverpool are relentless. You wouldn't have thought Liverpool had 10 men in that game.\"It was a dogged performance from Everton - you could have predicted that performance before the game but of course it is a missed opportunity.\"The result against Everton leaves Arsenal with little wiggle room for mistakes in the title race.The hosts huffed and puffed on Saturday but to no avail, leaving them trailing league leaders Liverpool by six points having played a game more.Scoring from corners has been a potent weapon since the start of last season, netting 23 goals from such occasions, but they could not convert from eight this time.In open play, they could not find the key to unlock an Everton defence that sat deep and much of this owed to a lack of focal point up front.Arsenal crossed the ball 28 times but without a centre forward to aim the ball at, it allowed opposition centre-backs Jarrad Branthwaite and James Tarkowski to clear.Arteta said: \"When you do what we did today against them, you have to win the game. This is football and the hardest thing is the last 20-25 metres.\"Credit to them for blocking shots and to Jordan Pickford for making saves and the desire they defended with, but honestly, it is difficult to ask something else from the team.\"Everton manager Sean Dyche added: \"They were trying to cross it to force something, which shows how defensively solid we were.\"",
