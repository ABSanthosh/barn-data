Meanwhile the No. 2-seeded Buffalo Bills haven't been to the Super Bowl in more than three decades, and in three of their past four postseason appearances, they were knocked out by the Chiefs.The Chiefs have had the Bills' number in the playoffs over the past four years, including an epic 2021 AFC divisional-round playoff game in which the Bills were 13 seconds -- no, that's not a Taylor Swift Easter egg -- away from advancing to the AFC championship after Josh Allen's 19-yard touchdown strike to Gabe Davis gave them a three-point lead. But of course, Patrick Mahomes responded, orchestrating a three-play field goal drive to tie it, and one overtime possession later, the Chiefs raucously celebrated an improbable 42-36 win.Buffalo faced Kansas City again in last year's divisional round, losing 27-24 after Tyler Bass missed a potential game-tying field goal with 1:43 to go. Will this time around be any different?Follow along for live updates and key insights from the AFC Championship Game below.",
