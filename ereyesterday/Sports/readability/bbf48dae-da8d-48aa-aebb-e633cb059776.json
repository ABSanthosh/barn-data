Guard-Imagn ImagesOf course, the Warriors are still awaiting a decision by restricted free agent Jonathan Kuminga as he continues to mull the decision to either stay in Golden State or head to another team likely via a sign-and-trade.While the Warriors are waiting on Kuminga’s decision, they have missed out on multiple free agent targets but they have recently emerged as a favorite to land a veteran point guard that they could use off the bench behind Curry.According to Bovada, the Warriors have the fifth-best odds (+625) to sign Chris Paul in free agency.The Los Angeles Clippers are the favorite (+185) to land him and they are followed by the Phoenix Suns (+260), Milwaukee Bucks (+375) and Los Angeles Lakers (+375).For Paul, he is reportedly looking to move closer to his family in Los Angeles and if both the Lakers and Clippers pass on him, Golden State may be the next best option for him.Dec 8, 2024; San Antonio, Texas, USA; San Antonio Spurs guard Chris Paul (3) is recognized after moving into second place on the all-time assist leaders list in the first half against the New Orleans Pelicans at Frost Bank Center. Mandatory Credit: Daniel Dunn-Imagn Images© Daniel Dunn-Imagn ImagesOf course, Paul played with the Warriors during the 2023-24 season before he was waived after the season before signing with the San Antonio Spurs last season.The 40-year-old guard is no longer the All-Star player he once was but he proved last season that he is still a reliable starter and he could fit well off the bench in Golden State.Despite this, Paul is expected to garner interest from many teams around the NBA and the Warriors may elect to find a different player to upgrade their bench.",
