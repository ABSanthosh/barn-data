  "text": "Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill is changing his tune. Just a month after saying that he was done with the Dolphins organization, Hill has expressed a desire to stay in Miami during multiple interviews in the run-up to Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans.On NBC's Pro Football Talk on Friday, Hill said that he was in \"a good space,\" adding that, as a leader and a father, he regretted the situation he put himself into. More importantly, he said directly that he wants to stay with the Dolphins.\"I'm taking full accountability of what I said,\" Hill said, adding that Miami had been good to him in the three years he'd played there. \"They've been very good to me. So why am I going to go out and say some of the things that I said? And I fully take it back.\"I'm gonna come back next year,\" Hill added, \"and bust my tail, for the team, for the guys, for the fans, for the whole city.\"Hill appears to be on an apology tour while he's in New Orleans. The 30-year-old receiver also put forward a \"public apology\" to his Dolphins teammates, especially quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, while speaking with Up \u0026 Adams' Kay Adams. In the interview, Hill called Tagovailoa \"a hell of a competitor.\"\"Tua, he's my guy, always will be my guy, no matter what, man. I'm sure he understands my frustration. Like, we all wanna win,\" Hill said. \"I'm looking forward to just us continuing to build our relationship even more.\"Hill said that the apology extended to the rest of his team. \"But they already know that though,\" Hill said. \"They know I'm not that kind of player at all. A lot of people may say, 'Oh, Reek is a hot head, he's this, he's that,' but my teammates know. I come to work every day, I bust my tail, I show up to meetings on time, and I do what I gotta do.\"Hill had strong words after the Dolphins' loss to the New York Jets on Jan. 5, which ended their season. While heated from the loss, Hill said that he wanted to open the door to new opportunities, saying that he was \"was too much of a competitor\" to stay in Miami.\"I'm out, bro. It was great playing here, but at the end of the day I gotta do what's best for my career,\" Hill said at the time.A few days after Hill's comments, Dolphins general manager Chris Grier said that the receiver had \"never asked for a trade,\" while head coach Mike McDaniel said that he and Hill had straightened things out.Hill walked his words back three weeks after making those comments, chalking things up to his \"frustration\" over not winning.Hill has two years left on a three-year, $90 million contract, with $65 million guaranteed.",
