The Pacers have won four straight games in playoff-series-clinching scenarios, the longest streak in franchise history, On the contrary, the Knicks are 1-3 under head coach Tom Thibodeau when facing elimination.With a win on Thursday, the Pacers would be the lowest-seeded team (4-seed) to lose one game or fewer in each series en route to the NBA Finals since the playoffs expanded to 16 teams in 1984.In Game 4, Indiana guard Tyrese Haliburton led the way with a historic stat line.
