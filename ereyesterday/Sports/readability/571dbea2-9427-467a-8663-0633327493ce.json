  "text": "Could the 2023 No. 1 overall pick be on the move? How about a Super Bowl MVP still at a prime-producing age, despite injuries? What pass rushers could be dealt to boost a contender?All of those questions, and potentially more, will be answered by the NFL trade deadline on Tuesday, Nov. 5 at 4 p.m. ET.With so many teams in the mix at the halfway point with the expanded playoffs, the difference between the buyers and sellers could be razor thin. Could the Panthers be willing to move on from 2023 No. 1 overall pick Bryce Young? Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson says that some across the NFL think the Panthers are willing to cut bait on the second-year quarterback, should a market develop to try to rebuild the 2021 Heisman Trophy winner after a dismal start to his NFL career.Cooper Kupp's name has been in trade circles for nearly two weeks, but the Rams are still connected in the NFC wild-card race, and head coach Sean McVay says he wouldn't want the Super Bowl 56 MVP to leave Los Angeles.Yahoo Sports' Frank Schwab has Davante Adams back to the Bay Area, Detroit adding a well-travelled pass rusher, and the Cowboys upgrading their backfield among his 10 trades that should happen before the deadline.However it shakes out, Yahoo Sports will be with you all the way, so stay with us for all of the news, rumors and notes heading into the 2024 NFL trade deadline.",
