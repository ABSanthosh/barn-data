  "text": "The numbers behind Roki Sasaki joining the Dodgers (0:56)Take a look at the important numbers after Roki Sasaki announces that he will sign with the Dodgers. (0:56)Alden Gonzalez, ESPN Staff WriterJan 17, 2025, 06:26 PM ETCloseESPN baseball reporter. Covered the L.A. Rams for ESPN from 2016 to 2018 and the L.A. Angels for MLB.com from 2012 to 2016.Roki Sasaki, the prized Japanese pitching prospect who has had scouts drooling over his potential since high school, has chosen the Los Angeles Dodgers as his major league team, he announced on Instagram on Friday.Sasaki called this \"a very difficult decision, but I will do my best to make it the right decision when I look back after my baseball career.\"The Dodgers, long viewed as the favorites for Sasaki, had recently emerged as one of three finalists for the 23-year-old right-hander, along with the Toronto Blue Jays and San Diego Padres. On Friday morning, the Padres began agreeing to deals with their prospective international signees in the Dominican Republic, a clear sign throughout the industry that they were out on Sasaki. The Blue Jays thusly acquired $2 million in international bonus pool space -- along with center fielder Myles Straw -- from the Cleveland Guardians in hopes of enticing Sasaki.It ultimately did not matter. A Dodgers team coming off a World Series title with a roster headlined by Sasaki's countrymen Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto again landed one of the biggest prizes of the offseason.In the Dodgers, Sasaki joins a team that has built a reputation as one of the best at developing talent and one that expects to field an incredibly deep rotation in 2025. Yamamoto and Tyler Glasnow return from last season's group. Ohtani, who will resume his duties as a two-way player, will be added. Blake Snell was signed to a five-year, $182 million contract in November. Clayton Kershaw is also expected to return at some point. And younger arms such as Tony Gonsolin, Dustin May and Bobby Miller remain in the organization, making it easy for the Dodgers to field a six-man rotation that would lessen Sasaki's acclimation process.Because he is under 25 years old and spent less than six seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball, Sasaki essentially will sign a minor league contract and follow the path of a player selected in the amateur draft -- able to be optioned to the minors, scheduled to earn close to the major league minimum during his first three major league seasons and unable to become a traditional free agent until attaining six years of service time.Teams were limited to giving Sasaki only their international bonus pool, which ranged from about $5.1 million to $7.5 million at the start of the signing period.Sasaki's pitching arsenal features a mesmerizing splitter that has been lauded as one of the world's best secondary pitches and pairs it with a fastball that reaches 100 mph, adding a slider that has also been deemed a plus pitch. In four seasons with the Chiba Lotte Marines, Sasaki posted a 2.02 ERA, a 0.88 WHIP and 524 strikeouts against 91 walks in 414â…” innings.In an April 10, 2022, start against the Orix Buffaloes, Sasaki pitched a perfect game while setting an NPB record with 13 consecutive strikeouts. Seven days later, he took the mound again and fired eight perfect innings before being removed from his outing. The following spring, Sasaki showcased his talents on a global stage, forming a star-studded rotation alongside Ohtani, Yu Darvish, Shota Imanaga and Yamamoto for a Japanese team that won the World Baseball Classic.For years, major league scouts and executives descended upon Japan to catch a glimpse of Sasaki and salivated over the possibility of him someday being posted. When it finally happened in early December, upward of 20 teams made initial pitches, doing so with videos, letters and even books. Sasaki flew to the L.A. headquarters of his agency, Wasserman, later that month and conducted meetings with at least eight teams -- the Dodgers, Padres, Blue Jays, New York Yankees, New York Mets, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers and San Francisco Giants.Earlier this week, five of those teams were informed they were out of the running, prompting Sasaki to take follow-up meetings in Toronto, San Diego and L.A. before reaching his decision.Sasaki needed to select his new team between this past Wednesday, the start of this year's international signing period, and next Thursday, the expiration of his posting window. His presence in the international amateur market left prospective signees of the three finalists in limbo on deals that are verbally agreed to years in advance, causing particular consternation within the Dominican Republic. The Dodgers, Padres and Blue Jays needed to not only free up their international bonus pools for the potential of landing Sasaki, but entertain the possibility of trading for additional space in hopes of sweetening their offers.Sasaki starred in Summer Koshien, a prominent Japanese high school tournament, and was taken No. 1 overall in the NPB draft in 2019. The Lotte Marines handled him carefully, restricting him to bullpen sessions and simulated games in 2020 and limiting his workload whenever possible thereafter. Sasaki's numbers were down a bit last year, his ERA rising to 2.35. His four-seam fastball went from averaging roughly 98 mph to 96. At one point, he dealt with shoulder fatigue. There are concerns about how Sasaki will handle a major league workload, and many will acknowledge that his command needs improvement.But few doubt his ceiling.Within these next handful of years, several prominent evaluators believe, Sasaki could be an annual Cy Young contender.",
