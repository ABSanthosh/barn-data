  "text": "McLaren's Lando Norris says title rival Max Verstappen \"knows he did wrong\" in their battle in last weekend's Mexico City Grand Prix.The Red Bull driver was given two 10-second penalties for his actions in a battle with his McLaren rival.Norris said: \"Max knows what he has to do. He knows he did wrong, deep down he does. And it's for him to change, not me.\"Max is one of the most capable drivers on the grid, if not the most. He knows what he can and can't do and what the limits are.\"Verstappen, who heads into this weekend’s Sao Paulo Grand Prix 47 points ahead of Norris with four races to go, says he finds criticisms of his defensive driving \"annoying\" and pays no attention to them.This week, 1996 world champion Damon Hill accused Verstappen of \"Dick Dastardly stuff\". The Dutchman said: \"I don't listen to those individuals. I just do my thing. I am a three-time world champion. I think I know what I'm doing.\"He added: \"Some people are just being very annoying. I know who these people are and I don't really pay a lot of attention to them. I have got this far in my career. Some people are just a bit biased.\"Norris said: \"I expect a cleaner battle than what we had but it's not up to me.\"Verstappen's racing tactics have come under the spotlight following two incidents in the last two races.In the first, in the United States Grand Prix, Norris was given a five-second penalty for overtaking off the track.That led to the F1 drivers discussing the incident five days later in Mexico, with many making it clear to governing body the FIA that they felt Norris should not have been penalised.That is because Verstappen's driving contributed to the incident - the Dutchman, who was defending his position on the inside, also went off track.Then, in the race in Mexico, Norris again went off track trying to overtake Verstappen on the outside, at Turn Four.Although Verstappen stayed on the track, he was adjudged to have forced Norris off the track and was given his first penalty. Four corners later, Verstappen again forced Norris off, and regained the position, and was penalised for gaining an advantage by going off the circuit.Asked whether he would do anything different from now on, he said: \"It's my 10th year in F1. I think I know what I'm doing.\"He added: \"I have my opinions, I don't need to share them.\"And asked whether he was happy with the racing guidelines, Verstappen said: \"It's not that straightforward clearly even between how many seconds you get. Sometimes they work for you, sometimes they work against you.\"It is never going to be perfect because even if you remove rules, if you get into a battle you want more rules because it's not clear what is allowed or not, then when you have too many rules you want less rules.\"Do I think it's over-regulated? Probably yes. In general the rule book is only getting bigger and bigger every year and I don't think that's always the right way.\"Verstappen said he took advice only from \"people who are objective and close to me\". And he also made a veiled criticism of the FIA while pointing out that, while he had been punished for swearing in a news conference at the Singapore Grand Prix, no action had been taken despite Ferrari's Charles Leclerc doing the same in Mexico.He said: \"People who are not just there to stir… I can't say the word and apparently it only counts for me. After the race someone was swearing and I didn't hear anything [about it].\"Verstappen is reported to be getting a five-place grid penalty for Sunday's race as a result of taking a new engine, having already exceeded his new allocation.But he was unable to confirm it, saying: \"I haven't heard anything yet. I know I will have to take one at some point, so we'll see.\"Red Bull have not responded to requests for comment on the matter.",
