  "text": "'We know Pakistan can crumble' - centurion DuckettImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ben Duckett now has four centuries in his 28 TestsEngland opener Ben Duckett says Pakistan can \"crumble\" and are under \"pressure\", despite the home side ending day two of the second Test in the stronger position in Multan.Duckett's 114 led England's rapid response to Pakistan's 366, the tourists reaching 211-2.But off-spinner Sajid Khan utilised the used pitch to take three wickets in an overall collapse of 4-14 that left England 239-6.\"Whatever the state of the game we always believe we can go and win,\" Duckett told Test Match Special.\"The first session tomorrow is going to be huge. If we can bat for as much as we can and get close to their total I think we will actually be favourites.\"England earned an unprecedented 3-0 clean sweep in Pakistan two years ago, then pulled off a record-breaking run-filled victory in the opening match of this series last week.In response, Pakistan made changes to their selection committee, dropped superstar batter Babar Azam and re-used the pitch from the first Test for the second, choosing three frontline spinners in their XI.\"We know that they can crumble and so the pressure is over to them,\" Duckett told Sky Sports. \"We're 1-0 up in the series, won the last series 3-0 and we know they're going to fight to make it as hard as they can for us. But we always believe we're in the game.\"Sajid was one of four new faces in the Pakistan XI, playing his first first-class match since his last Test against Australia in January.The 31-year-old watched the first Test on TV at home in Peshawar before being recalled to win his ninth cap for Pakistan.In the space of 10 deliveries, the charismatic Sajid removed Joe Root, Duckett and Harry Brook, celebrating with his trademark one-legged pose.\"He's certainly a character. He was chirping away,\" said Duckett. \"He doesn't get loads of bounce, bowls quite quick and flat. He didn't really miss.\"England now face the likely prospect on a fourth-innings run-chase on a pitch that Duckett says will spin \"more and more\".But the Nottinghamshire man, who turns 30 on day three, believes England will be in the contest in they can get close to parity on first innings.\"If we can get as close to Pakistan's total as we can and bowl better than them in the second innings, I think we'll be in a good position,\" he said.\"If we bowl well and keep the chase to anywhere around 200 or less, we'll believe we're in the game.\"",
