  "text": "'Unfinished business' - Mings redemption has Villa dreaming Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Tyrone Mings helped Aston Villa secure a sixth win in the Champions League this seasonWhen Tyrone Mings inexplicably gifted Club Brugge a penalty in the Champions League group phase in November, Aston Villa manager Unai Emery labelled it \"the biggest mistake I have witnessed in my career\".On a night of redemption for the England defender, Mings returned to the scene of his howler - and helped Villa take a huge step towards the quarter-finals of European football's most prestigious competition.\"I was more than happy to come back here and play in this stadium again because I think we had unfinished business,\" Mings said after Villa's impressive 3-1 win at Club Brugge in the last-16 first leg in Belgium.\"I am very proud of what we have done tonight. I really enjoyed this game. We played against them [in the league phase] and knew a bit of what to expect. \"The game was exactly as we anticipated. We can be proud of both our defensive and attacking play.\"Will Villa finish the job in Birmingham on 12 March, and book a last-eight showdown with Liverpool or Paris St-Germain?One thing is for sure - Mings looks to be back in form after putting the events of four months ago firmly behind him.What happened in November?Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez nudged the ball out of the six-yard area and Mings, thinking the goal-kick had not been taken, picked up the ball.German referee Tobias Stieler awarded a penalty for handball, and Club Brugge captain Hans Vanaken stepped up to score the only goal of the game.It was a horrible moment for Mings, who was substituted soon afterwards on his European debut and his second game back after 14 months out with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.\"His mistake is completely strange,\" added Emery after that game.\"It's only happened one time in all my life.\"Image source, ReutersImage caption, Tyrone Mings was making his third appearance in this season's Champions League'Mings was incredible'On Tuesday, Mings - who has come a long way since playing for Yate Town and Chippenham Town in non-league football - provided a headed assist for Leon Bailey to open the scoring in the third minute.At 1-1, Brugge skipper Vanaken produced a header which was on target and heading for the back of the net before Mings managed to get a vital touch which took it wide. \"Tyrone Mings was incredible there,\" said former Scotland winger Pat Nevin, who was in the Jan Breydel Stadium for BBC Radio 5 Live.\"He stopped it diverting into the inside of the post and that surely prevented a goal.\"Mings made seven clearances - more than anyone else - as Villa notched their sixth win in nine Champions League games this season to leave their 1,500 travelling fans celebrating wildly at the end.When asked about Mings' performance, Emery said: \"The first experience he had here was not good. But today he reacted fantastic, playing focused, serious, saving one action that was a goal.\"Of course I know the difficulties in football and how we can have experiences and how we can get better and analyse everything deeply and try and correct it - that is my only target with the players.\"We corrected something from the match we played here.\"'We still have work to do'This was Villa's first knockout tie in European football's premier competition since the 1982-83 quarter-finals - and Emery's side are certainly making up for lost time. Club Brugge, who wasted at least two good chances, will feel they did not deserve to lose 3-1, but Villa have given themselves a golden chance to go through to the last eight.Emery, however, is not getting carried away.\"We are not in the quarter-finals,\" the Spaniard was quick to point out.\"There's still 90 minutes to play. We're ready in case we need extra time and penalties because I know how difficult it is in each match.\"The players, I'm sure they have experiences before as well with matches like that and we have to respect the opponent always.\"They won against Atalanta 3-1 [in the knockout-round play-offs] and they compete very well.\"We need to watch the match again with the players to understand the difficulties we can face against teams in Europe.\"I am happy but calm, getting balance.\"Image source, ReutersImage caption, Aston Villa scored more goals in this match (three) than they had in their previous five meetings with Belgian sides in all competitions combined (two)",
