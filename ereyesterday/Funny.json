    "description": "Moving up the chain in any workplace comes with a certain amount of sacrifice, as you get more responsibility, your ability to simply log off and not worry about the fate and trajectory of your work slowly decreases. Sure, you might get less productive work done every day due to all the oversight and meetings, but the responsibility rests a heavy weight on your shoulders all the same.Of course, you get paid more, too, and that has its own benefits. But, there reaches a point where more and more responsibility is being thrust upon you—exponentially—and you'll find yourself wondering if it's all worth it. You'll find more and more of these responsibilities are above your even increased pay grade, probably because some management position farther up the chain was dissolved, and their tasks are now being passed down to you.I know plenty of experienced professionals around my age and older who have opted not to move up in their respective organizations or career paths. Sometimes, they even opt to take a pay cut to work a four-day week to have more personal time and a better overall work-life balance. Of course, not everyone is able to do this, but for those who are, it remains a choice worth making.We've seen an increasing number of stories like this in recent times, with workers choosing not to take on opportunities for promotion and more responsibility, leaving their bosses and the organizations they work for wondering where to turn to fill vacant roles.",

It's free and it keeps you out of trouble, not to mention the peace of mind you gain from not having to worry about other people's problems in life. But some people really enjoy getting into other' people's business: they like to be a bit bossy and try to get everyone to conform to their exact wishes. This woman, an HOA member that u/Emancipatedtreesnake keeps running into, has a completely petty gripe. She doesn't think this person's boss has a good enough car. Unless she's willing to fork over thousands of dollars to buy the guy something, it's a rather frivolous complaint! Does she expect this man to drop everything and purchase a new car just to suit her needs? Of course he isn't going to do that. The only thing this HOA woman has succeeded in doing is irking her neighbor and his boss. However, the two of them came up with a crafty plan to get this woman off their backs, which you can read all about down below. After that, read about this one consultant who was adamant she wouldn't take \"fashion advice\" from her coworker… too bad the boss disagreed!",

First, these industry standards were mandatory training programs that employees had to take every three years. It didn't matter if she felt they were pointless. She had to approve of them, but somehow, her work-forward mentality, coupled with her micromanaging tendencies, caused her to enforce a new policy that employees needed to request approval for every single detail regarding these programs. The result, of course, did not work out in her favor after this Redditor decided to prove said point via some well-deserved malicious compliance.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.

    "description": "Every restaurant worker has at least one customer interaction that they'll never be able to get out of their head. Some are positive interactions, like having a regular who overtips, or a customer who goes out of their way to tell their manager how helpful the employee was. These positive interactions are always welcome, because many customers treat service workers like they're beneath them. Working as a server is just a job, but some customers treat these workers as if they're second-class citizens just because of their role. If the meal takes a long time to come out, the customer won't hesitate to snap at the waiter. Others refuse to talk to the waiter except to bark out their meal orders. And others just like to mess with their waiter's heads, like one restaurant patron who withheld a tip while making direct eye contact with his waiter. It's as if they forget that there's a human being with feelings underneath that uniform. They'd treat them much more nicely if they met them outside of work hours! Next up, read about these ultra-satisfying moments where retail workers got to tell their worst customers that they were the manager, like one employee who shared, \"When she called corporate to complain about me, she also got me.\"",

For this employee, that customer was this entitled Karen who made it her mission to cause chaos to him and his coworkers every time she walked into the store. She'd yell, she'd argue, and she'd make everyone's day a whole lot worse. Just because she could.But fate has a funny way of coming full circle. One day, while stopping at a gas station, the employee was stunned to see none other than Karen herself behind the cash register. The tables had turned, and he knew exactly what he had to do. Channeling all the pent-up anger from her previous outbursts, he gave her a taste of her own medicine at her own work this time—making a scene, complaining over nothing, and giving her the same attitude she had dished out for so long.",

There's no sense in being overly rigid about rules when they don't serve to benefit anyone and make things worse for everyone overall. This worker enjoyed a flexible working arrangement until they were singled out by their boss and made to work 9 to 5 each day instead of 8 to 4 as they had been working. Frustrated at these new restrictions and at the erosion of the work-life balance that that flexibility had allowed them to enjoy, they decide to adhere strictly to their boss's instruction that they work 9 to 5 each day… beginning work no earlier than 9 AM and leaving right at the tick of the clock to 5 AM. This escalated, and they, along with their coworker who was in a similar situation, began working as slowly as possible, ensuring that they always had something they were working on under the watchful eye of their micromanaging boss but getting far less work done than they had when they were granted more flexibility.",

It happens to every pool owner at some point: you go a few days without adding chlorine, and one morning you awaken to a pool full of bright green algae. The good news is that it's often an easy fix: you just need to shock the pool with some chlorine, or find a pool maintenance person to do it for you. But this person, u/Otherwise_Hunt7296, realized that their green pool problem might take a bit longer to solve than they'd planned. It's all due to this person's HOA, or homeowner's association. If you've ever had to deal with an HOA, you know that they're not often helpful to regular people. Instead, they thrive on handing out huge fines and taking their sweet time to fix important problems. The people who live here pay for that pool, and I'm sure they'd like to go swimming in the summer. Instead of a simple fix, the issue is stuck in an email thread, as this resident shared. Commenters gave them some helpful advice though, as you can check out below. Up next, read about some of the most outrageous reasons couples chose to split up and get divorced, like one dude who \"divorced his wife… because she would sleep with a nightlight.\"",

The gist of this story is that a know-it-all senior scientist is adamant that he doesn't need such lowly lab technicians double-checking his work, even though that's basic workplace protocol. When the OP tries to correct the scientist, his help is denied. In the end, the scientist gets exactly what he deserved—and a write-up by management, for good measure.",

    "link": "https://cheezburger.com/37139461/youre-bringing-tension-to-the-office-employee-confronts-new-hire-after-they-refused-to-listen-to-her",
    "description": "In every scenario, there can be more than one way to do things correctly, especially when it comes to work. Not everyone, even if they have the same role, does everything in the exact same way, and that is completely reasonable. Every employee finds their own rhythm and methods to do their job, and as long as the job gets done well, there shouldn't be any problems.When a new hire comes in, it makes sense that they would turn to their coworkers for guidance, but it is not a necessity. If they feel like they have control over the work, there is no reason why they should not be allowed to try. This is what the new hire (OP, original poster) in this Reddit story expected out of her coworkers. That was until one of her coworkers decided she was meant to be training OP, and was upset when OP said she was doing fine on her own.Keep scrolling to read the rest of the story. After that, click here for a story of an entitled family who caused their flight to be delayed.",

She had just clocked in and was beginning her orientation when a coworker discovered her dog in one of those bags. She had mentioned nothing about needing her to dog to be with her at all times during the interview process, and it turns out she did not have authorization to have a service animal with her either. It was all a personal preference and not one she thought to mention to her boss beforehand. Her manager, of course, confronted her about this, specifically that it would be unsafe to have a dog in the kitchen. Let's just say the server did not handle this confrontation well. Good luck to her!For more stories like this, check out this post about entitled customers.",

    "description": "This factory setup engineer normally arrived to work at 3 AM to prep the floor for a day's work, but new management seemed to think that they knew how to do his job better than he did. However, to capitalize on a foolish act of managerial naivety, the worker maliciously complied and bled out millions of dollars of production value to prove a point.Micromanagers rarely know what's good for them. Blissfully unaware that 90% of their employees are much more productive without middle management breathing down their necks, they rudely install themselves onto every facet of the workplace, effectively kneecapping all productivity from the ground up. So when a new manager tried to tell this employee how to do his job, he complied with a smile on his face knowing that he would have a satisfying 'I told you so' moment. Read on to enjoy the fruits of this man's sassiness after he effectively got management off his back, setting his own rules about his schedule by making them eat the cost of their mistakes. After this, here's another work-related procrastination tool–a collection of cringey corporate jargon that'll make any employee squirm in their ergonomic chair.",

    "description": "When you're planning the biggest event of your life, what is possibly a once-in-a-lifetime event, it's important to make sure you actually get to the planning part of it and not just leave essential parts to chance… this, coming from someone who is notoriously poor at planning beyond the end of the week. If you want to go on a trip that is going to require you to take time off work, you should probably make sure you request the time off work first so that you're not stuck with an already booked trip and not able to leave your job to take it. This, of course, is common sense to most of us, but you'd be surprised how many people leave it until the last minute.However, there are things in life that will require our absence from work that can't be accounted for. Maybe the coworker had to push her wedding up due to the failing health of a family member or something. That might be giving her too much benefit of the doubt, but in situations such as this, you'd hope that people—especially the employer—would be understanding and accommodating. But if it's really just down to good ol' poor planning, it's important to remember that \"A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on others.\" It's a hard lesson to learn, but there's a reason why this phrase is so popular.This employee had already had their trip booked to see their family for some time; they were surprised when their coworker approached them, asking them to cancel so that she could take her honeymoon. While sympathetic to the predicament the coworker was in, the employee declined but, in doing so, earned the wrath of their coworkers. With everyone determined that they must be wrong for their refusal, the employee turned to this online community to see whether or not they were in the wrong. Community members reassured them that they had more than a leg to stand on in the comments, declaring that the coworker simply should have planned better.",

Any loving feelings go right out the window! Instead of trying to plan for a future together, both people are out for revenge.

    "description": "Francis Ford Coppola is preoccupied with time. The passage of it, the halting of it, even its cyclical nature through the repetition of events in history. The 85-year-old legendary filmmaker's relationship with time is on full display in his latest film, the self-funded, PR-crisis-ridden \"Megalopolis.\" Unfortunately, a lack of self-awareness on the part of the script and its author leads to an often nonsensical and unclear narrative that ultimately clouds Coppola's often-dizzying, grand ideals about empires, utopia, and man's place in them. Ironically, this leaves the viewer wondering how Coppola's place in cinema history will be affected. The marketing team has already tried to position \"Megalopolis\" as misunderstood and ahead of its time. They may be right about the misunderstood part; it's difficult to understand something that is largely incomprehensible. As for the \"ahead of its time\" narrative, again, time is certainly a factor here, but \"Megalopolis\" is too confused about itself to be prescient. Perhaps what's so remarkable about this divisive film is that you have some folks (notably, the team behind the film) calling it ahead of its time and others accusing the director and his creation of being out of touch. Only this film that is so concerned with and confounded by the concept of time could manage to receive both of these extreme interpretations.The final say is up to each filmgoer, but one thing is clear: Coppola and the film's marketing campaign seem to be going out of their way to convince audiences that \"Megalopolis\" is a bold vision that people will look back on fondly. However, virtually every attempt to position the film as such has managed to instead bolster the argument that \"Megalopolis\" is one spectacular \"swing and a miss.\" Let's take a look at how the film's rocky development, uncompromising vision, and baffling promotional tactics have all failed to convey the filmmaker's supposed intent.",

    "description": "Sometimes, the best way to capture a social phenomenon is with a good old-fashioned chart. That's likely what your teacher said in elementary school, but the same sentiment remains true as an adult. For many of us, pie charts were the most effective way to understand the parts that make up a whole in most scenarios. The nerds among us are likely to agree, but the truth of the matter is that pie charts can cover more than just math and science. Here, we have a collection of funny pie charts that range in subject matter from what people often ask you as a tall person (hint: it's all some variation of \"look how much you've grown!\") to what time of year people are likely go to the gym (hint: it follows a certain annual end-of-the-year holiday) to what men look for in their shampoo (hint: it's not very involved). Keep scrolling below for these funny pie-chart memes.

Spurned on by the promise of larger bonuses, executives and their fellow bean counters will cut and cut until they finally make one incision near-comical disaster. Of course, although it seems that this behavior has been prevalent in recent memory, as in this story that this worker shared from earlier days of their career…This employee worked in the contracts department of a major software company, which they refer to as \"MidSoft Inc.\" Continual foolish decisions that thought of nothing but the bottom line and cost-cutting measures, driven by the ravenous interests of private equity investors,  reduced the company's senior development team from 12 to one soldier, \"Sam.\" While the ledger might have looked better for a time, the immeasurable loss of institutional knowledge and literal lifetimes of experience would go unaccounted for.That was until Sam was also sent packing right before the company acquired a major new contract. However, when they started looking around, wondering who was able to handle the integration necessary for the deal, soon the realization dawned that Sam had been the last remaining developer with the necessary expertise for this particular and essential task. What unfolded was quite predictable: they needed Sam back, and Sam was going to make them pay… Teaching them a lesson in hubris—in the most corporate sense.",

That way, you won't wind up like the guy from the title of this article, who divorced his wife because she needed to sleep with a nightlight, while he needed a completely darkened room to get any sleep. If only they'd thought of this before spending thousands on a wedding and legally binding themselves together…There's always next time, I suppose! Another couple broke up because one of them kept playing video games too much. Once again, if they lived together, the spouse would realize if their partner liked to spend their entire weekend gaming. At least in that person's new place, they'll have plenty of room to build a gaming den for one. After you check out these excellent break up stories, read about these people who had some tough days at work, like one person who revealed they \"Just lost thousands of dollars worth of product at work.

    "description": "There are many moments in humanity while living in a society that makes you question our existence. Some questions are spiritual and existential, while others make you want to bang your head on a wall. For example, when you work in the service industry and the place is obviously closed, with a big sign that says \"CLOSED\" and you still have customers trying to get inside. Like, in what world do you think that \"closed\" means something else to you and only you? Those are some top-tier Karens, male and female. You can't just walk into an obviously closed place and act like you own the place and not be a Karen. The entitlement just oozes off of you like stank from a dumpster. Many employees have stories of this exact thing happening that really makes it seem like there are WAY too many Karens like this out there. See some of the most ludicrous ones below!",

    "description": "Whatever happened to boundaries? In this day and age, it's so easy to respond to an email or message from your boss outside of work hours. Sometimes, there is an emergency and you have to engage. Hopefully, you're getting paid for those all-hands-on-deck moments. However, if your boss is the kind of person who needs to know where you are at all times, that's a different story. Here, we have an employee who is always timely and almost never late, yet their boss seems to be paranoid about their timeliness and is now insisting upon being notified of their whereabouts constantly before they arrive at the office. Thankfully, the employee had enough confidence to recognize that this was a massive overstep. In fact, it turns out that the whole reason behind the boss's paranoia is that she wanted to avoid being late to her second job (yes, the employee's boss has a second job).For more stories like this, take a look at this one about a horrible boss who enforced 14-hour Zoom calls for his remote employees.",

    "description": "This man caught his stay-at-home wife throwing away his salary check, spending thousands every month because she was too lazy to eat the food in their well-stocked fridge. Most of us are taught from a young age that you pay for convenience. Like any service, when something is prepared, delivered, and brought straight to your door, you're likely going to be paying for it in spades because of the convenience of that item. In an era where there's an app for everything, we've all had moments of weakness where we spend $85 on a delivered sandwich from the shop down the street because we're too lazy or tired to go pick it up ourselves, but the woman in our next story had grown accustomed to ordering takeout once–sometimes twice–per day to sustain herself. Despite a fridge full of healthy foods, this woman swooned at the idea of making her own meals. But when her husband caught her spending $1000+ every month on takeout, he had to draw a line in the sand–and with the credit card company. Read on for the whole story of a guy who was forced to take drastic measures to keep their collective savings accounts from getting fully drained due to convenience fees.",

    "description": "There's a certain etiquette involved when it comes to enjoying public entertainment… even if you'd paid to view it, and no matter how much you have paid to view it, you should not do anything that detracts from others' enjoyment of the event. Not only has it become commonplace for concertgoers to eclipse the view of those behind them with cell phones and signs, but it has also become far more commonplace for concertgoers to shriek lyrics passionately at the top of their lungs, drowning out the stadium speakers for all of those around them—or in quieter venues speak loudly for the entire duration of the show. It's all well and good to enjoy yourself, but if it's to the point that it's detracting from other's experience, you need to reevaluate and realize that you're not the center of attention, and if you can't handle that, you owe everyone around you their price of admission. Or, if you're really so determined to have your own audience, you should just host your own event and see who turns up. It seems that post-pandemic behavior has only gotten worse. Though perhaps I've only grown more intolerant. But it seems more and more that individualist ideals have taken over from the collective enjoyment, and attendees either have forgotten or never learned how to properly behave. This opportunistic and entitled family refused to give up the theatre seats that they had stolen from another family and got to watch the family they had stolen the seats from get even better ones.",

Too bad her coworkers don't feel the same way! How would you react if you were told to wear jeans to your job? Most of us would probably love that. Jeans tend to be quite comfortable to walk around in or to sit in for a workday. Some workplaces have casual Fridays just for that purpose, while others want their employees to pay up if they're going to wear jeans one day per week. Still, not everyone wants to wear jeans. Some prefer to dress up in fancy attire for work each and every day to maintain a professional demeanor. This consultant seemed to have that attitude, as u/DanielCade explained in their malicious compliance story. The consultant wanted to wear her own clothing, but she clearly didn't understand that she was in the wrong industry for that. Commenters noted that she might not be suited to that field, but as a consultant, she may have just not understood how serious protective clothing can be in certain work environments. You can check out the full story and comments below and determine for yourself who was in the wrong here. Up next, read about these people who had some rough days at work, like one person who revealed they \"Just lost thousands of dollars worth of product at work.

    "description": "In a classic case of \"never judge a book by its cover,\" a goth retail worker decided to get some petty revenge on a jewelry store employee who dismissed him based solely on his appearance. After having enough of the jewelry clerk's entitled behavior, the district manager at Hot Topic, dressed in his punk attire, stormed back into his store visibly angry after his encounter with the clerk.His wife, kid, and other employees were at Hot Topic when he burst in, venting about the treatment he received. Instead of letting it slide, he made a quick decision. Moments later, he stormed out and headed straight for the competitor's jewelry store, much to the surprise of his team that watched the drama unfold from the storefront window. As they watched, the clerk from the first store kept an eye on him too. A short while later, the retail worker returned with a brand-new, expensive watch, flaunting it to the very clerk who had judged him. This hilarious turn of events served as a reminder that appearances can be deceiving, and sometimes karma delivers the sweetest payback.",

We'd like to think that this change is always good, but the reality is that it's not always for the better. Opportunists will be right there waiting to strike when the shifting sands of time and change bring them the chance to take advantage. When this couple bought their dream piece of land out in the middle of nowhere, they completed the picture by building what, at that point, was their dream home. They lived there for several years, and when the opportunity presented itself later on, they moved on to the next pursuit, renting out their former home. It wasn't long before a housing developer came knocking, looking to build suburban houses in the once-rural area. The couple refused to sell, meaning that their home was the only one that wasn't part of the HOA that would form in the new neighborhood—something that the developer and their HOA wouldn't soon forget. They'd resort to less-than-dishonest means in order to attempt to get the couple to sell or otherwise sign their rights away and join the HOA There's a certain poetry to a nefarious entity's ability to bring wrath down upon themselves through the sheer brazenness and insistent audacity of their dishonest pursuits. The problem is that behavior has been learned and emboldened through years and years of success, so by the time they pay the price, it has been going on for some time. This developer got away with it long enough before they came to realize they had finally messed with the wrong couple.",

Two years ago I was working for a company and thought I was doing a really good job. I only realized they wanted me gone when they simply stopped giving me any work. It got to a point where in a part-time job I was only working for about two hours a week, so I quickly looked for a better job that would respect me enough to tell me what I was doing wrong.The employee in this Reddit story is going through a similar experience since their boss cut their hours in half without an explanation. However, the main problem they are dealing with is that while they are working fewer hours, they are still expected to do the same amount of workload, which is practically impossible.Scroll down to read the full story.

His boss called the policy a bogus one, which he later denied saying. After this heated exchange, the employee had a feeling that he would be fired for some silly excuse, and he was right.Keep scrolling below to see what excuse his boss made and to find out how the employee plans to get even.

    "description": "When you are taking on a Karen in the midst of starting a tantrum, it's scary to approach it alone. Especially if you are the innocent employee the Karen is directing their anger towards, because what if she actually does get you fired? The best case scenario is that everyone around you is on your side and have your back. Then it's much easier to put her or him in their place. This employee was recently made manager at the place she had been working at for 2 years. She took her duties very seriously and had no patience for customers making her employee's lives any more difficult than they have to be. So when a male-Karen getting impatient in line \"Oy'ed\" at her and her coworkers, she immediately put him in his place. It wasn't just her that took this Karen down, however. A usually customer standing behind him also chimed in to make sure he knew exactly how immature he was being. Read the entire satisfying shutdown below!",

We're at work–in an office–we don't need to try and make it spicy by calling our meetings 'huddles' or 'scrums'. Call it what it is, Lisa, a C-level yap session to make pompous suits feel validated cashing out their self-appointed $50,000 bonus check. So, while corporate employees lose brain cells staring at semi-dysfunctional spreadsheets, smelling the coffee machine burning this morning's brew in the break room, corporate jargon bounces around in their heads. In the workplace, we don't need to overdo it on the positivity–realistically, we're all just here from 9 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday so that we can 'live the dream' on the weekends, enjoying our 48 hours of freedom in the real world where circling back isn't a thing and putting on a fake, hype smile when you say 'Good morning' to your big boss in the elevator.

A lot of the workers would bike to the job each day. It can be a great way to commute: you get your daily exercise in, save money on gas, and it's good for the environment, too. But adults get pretty sweaty when they work out, and a lot of offices accommodate this by providing showers. That's why this HR person's plan was so confusing. She wanted everyone to be seated at their desks by 9 AM on the dot. Did she not want the employees to shower after arriving at the office? Did she think a bunch of sweaty, stinky employees feeling awkward about their BO would boost morale? Chalk it up to trial and error! At least this HR person didn't stay at the company for long, and the employees could get back to their normal routines. After that, read about the teenager who got back at their dad by stacking a pile of wood in the funniest possible way, meaning that their dad had to \"re-stack half the woodpile.\"",

Thankfully for these overworked kids, their helicopter parents have met their match with their history teacher.This teacher was pressured by the parents to assign more extra credit so their kids could have a greater chance at getting A+ final grades. After receiving enough pressure from the board and the administration, the teacher acquiesced but devised a plan to maliciously comply. She decided to give the exact number of extra credit assignments as was requested but at a price. All of the assignments involved heavy time commitments on behalf of the parents. For instance, one of these assignments involved extensive interviews with parents about an important historical event from their lifetimes. Of course, as the teacher predicted, as soon as the parents were required to be involved in these lengthy assignments, the participation rate was practically nonexistent.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.

The issue lies in what the neighbor does while on the funny juice. He hops in his car and parks \"creatively\" around the neighborhood. This includes but is not limited to: \"someone else's driveway, halfway into their lawn, or [OP's] personal favorite, the middle of the street like a personal barricade.\"Safe to say, OP had enough.

For instance, your boss who is constantly hounding you about your hours and accusing you of having not worked them is probably not working their full hours themself, either slacking off at their desk or making excuses for leaving early that they wouldn't accept from anyone else, amounting to hours of time over the course of a month. This, of course, takes forms in many different shapes in our social and political interactions, even our parents trying to prevent us from sneaking out at night (despite the fact that we never cared to do so) is really just because that's something they would have done at our age.This boss consistently made an issue of their employee being \"tardy\" which eventually escalated into a confrontation that needed to involve HR. The employee had done their homework, however, and was not only able to prove that they had actually worked more than their required hours but that their boss had not been. Which, of course, their boss was even less thrilled about.",

It must be an incredibly satisfying way to end a conversation with a nightmare customer. U/ProfessorUber decided to ask people about their best \"Actually, I am the manager\" stories, and hundreds of people shared their favorite tales. After working in retail or food service for a few years, you know all the rules and regulations like the back of your hand. So when a customer starts asking you to bend the rules or do things you're just straight up banned from doing, you know you can't do that, but the customer will still insist on talking to a manager. That manager is just going to tell them the same thing you've already been trying to tell the customer for the last 10 minutes. They just have an official title that makes the customer believe what they're saying (finally!). So it makes sense that when an employee finally gets promoted to the manager position, they've waited a long time to say those magic words: \"I am the manager here.\" After that, read about two retail managers who worked together to get back at a completely irrational customer, telling them, \"I've spoken with one of our experts.\"",

Imagine working the night shift and you get a visibly belligerent Karen waltzing in like she owns the place. That's the last person you want to see alone in a gas station at 2 AM. But these employees have to deal with this all the time. One was able to get a healthy dose of karmic justice during her night shift. A Karen came in wreaking havoc late at night. She eventually had to kick her out and refuse to sell her anything else. The Karen vowed to come back and wreak some more havoc. However, she slipped up and parked her car directly where the attendant she was yelling at could see. So the next time she came, the attendant called the tow company—and extra justice points, the cops were there getting coffee and ended up arresting her! Read the entire situation below.",

There is simply so much one has to pay for in college, and physically being in school also means you can't really work to pay for everything college demands.One of the most infuriating things colleges usually take money for is parking. Apparently, the tuition is not enough to secure a place to park on campus, so colleges resort to asking even more money for parking passes or permits.That is where this clever discussion comes into the picture. Initially, this started as a Reddit story from the subreddit 'Malicious Compliance', which tells the tale of how one college student followed the rules and maliciously got out of a parking ticket. Then, people in the comments also share some clever ways they got away with parking on campus without having to pay ridiculous amounts of money for parking passes or tickets.Scroll down to read these helpful stories.

If you come across a passing comment from a hiring manager that directly contradicts what was expressly written in the job posting, that's a red flag certainly worthy of questioning. Here, we have a candidate who was honest about needing to go to a doctor's appointment for valid medical reasons once every three months and that these appointments would be a full-day commitment. Based on the job posting, he assumed that this would not be a problem. However, the hiring manager brought up a strange, previously undisclosed policy in the interview that employees were not allowed to schedule doctor's appointments during work hours for more than two hours every month. What about emergencies? What about routine checkups if you have a condition, as this candidate did? Thankfully, the candidate was empowered enough to call the recruiter out on her nonsense.Keep scrolling below for the fallout.

    "description": "This prospective homeowner nearly fell for a realtor's 'catfish' home listing that cleverly misled buyers from seeing a horribly unappealing reality–a vermin-ridden, shack rotting next door.When you're in the market to buy a home, it's tough not to get stars in your eyes and imagine your life in every listing you see online. Especially when it comes to the rustic charms of colonial builds and 19th-century architectural details, some buyers can put the horse before the carriage, planning to drop half-a-mil or more on a home where they can only see half the picture. In the case of the guy in our next story, he learned through a mild deep dive that he was literally only seeing half the picture... Because the realtor had cropped out the worst part of his listing.U/secondhandnews_ fell in love with this adorable duplex almost instantly, imagining what it might be like to own a house that looked like a real-life doll diorama. But before he got too hasty, he did his due diligence of researching the street a little bit more to get a lay of the neighborhood, and he was absolutely disgusted with what he found. Keep reading to cringe at this catfish moment when a buyer nearly leapt into bed next door to the crypt keeper.",

    "description": "You never really know what kind of neighbor you're going to get until it's too late. For some, it's a friendly wave and a chat over the fence, but for others, it's dealing with an entitled Boomer who thinks he's owed your plants. That's right—one woman found herself in the middle of peak neighbor drama when her Boomer neighbor demanded she dig up her own garden and hand over the plants just so he could spruce up his yard.You've got to hand it to him for the sheer audacity. Not only did he ask for the plants, but he seemed to think he was doing her a favor by suggesting she just dig them out and put them in his yard. I mean, who wouldn't want to spend their Saturday giving up their plants and doing free labor for their neighbor, right? Boomer drama like this is all too real. Whether it's over parking spots, property lines, or, in this case, plants, there's always some entitled request brewing. But when someone decides they'd rather take from your garden than hit up a nursery? That's when you know you've got a real winner living next door.",

    "description": "After putting in countless hours of extra work on a big project, this employee thought a promotion would be his ticket to finally being compensated for all the extra effort. His managers gave him plenty of praise, so when the senior-level role opened up, he threw his hat in the ring. But what should have been a reward for his hard work quickly turned into a nightmare.After multiple rounds of interviews and weeks of waiting, he landed the promotion—only to find out there wouldn't be a raise to match his new responsibilities. Instead, he was told he'd have to wait a full year for them to \"reevaluate\" his pay. More work, no extra pay, and lots of empty promises. He tried to stick it out, but after three months of feeling completely disrespected, he decided enough was enough. When he resigned, his manager had the nerve to call him \"unprofessional\" during the resignation meeting, as if expecting fair pay for hard work was somehow out of line. But in the end, he knew he made the right call—because respect shouldn't have to wait for a yearly evaluation.",

It's Wednesday, and it's only two o'clock in the afternoon. \"Maybe next time, the dream will become a reality\" you whisper to yourself. Employee burnout is real. Especially when you realize you have a number of things to do with no real motivation to complete them.The mid-week slump is also very real. Wednesdays' equidistance to Mondays and Fridays makes the middle of the week that much more difficult. Do you remember how you feel when you wake up every Wednesday? Probably like you're okay with being unemployed just for an extra few hours of sleep. Luckily, the occurrence of another Wednesday means the promise of another Friday. Don't worry, fellow employees. We have some extra hilarious work memes that'll perk you right up and hold you over until the weekend arrives. Work blues be gone!",

    "description": "One restaurant greeter learned a valuable lesson about how people should treat them in a work setting. When you start your first job, you don't exactly know how you're supposed to be treated by management. Some places yell at their workers, others are passive-aggressive towards them, and others have super strict rules that they stick by no matter what. Your first job teaches you a lot… so by the time you get your second job, you're a little wiser and more experienced. This person was holding two jobs at the same time. This is quite common in the food service and retail industries: even with higher minimum wages, lots of people need to work way more than 40 hours per week to get by. Many workers will pick up a night shift and a day shift each day, coordinating between the two jobs to avoid any overlap. That's why it's so surprising that this manager decided to talk down to his employees about their second job! Is he new here, does he not know how common this is? Check out the full story below and see for yourself. After that, read about some people who aren't great at spelling, so they sounded it out, with some very funny results, like one person who labeled their delicious chocolate desserts as \"Browinese.\"",

    "description": "There's no better day than payday! The collective 'woohoo' of the workforce can be heard all the way down the halls into the accounting office and there isn't a single employee on earth who doesn't celebrate the fruits of their labor. Obviously, we need money to function. But after a lifetime in the workforce and with a pile of bills stacking up on the counter, the workingman (occasionally) rues the existence of such convenient wares, like cash. If there were some way to get by on trade alone, trust me, minimum-wage employees would have made it happen by now. Alas, we live in a society where the wheels turn via those greenback dollars we work so hard every week to accumulate. Even while the 'shareholders' and 'silent investors' are watching their millions stack up in the treasure troves in Geneva, they'll never understand the simplest pleasures of their lowly workers: Payday. So if you're a biweekly paycheck kind of employee or a salaried type of worker, you'll understand the pure bliss of the upcoming paycheck hitting your accounts. Because when the direct deposit hits, we'll be riding the gravy train all weekend.",

    "description": "If the opportunity of a lifetime comes along, you may as well take it! This person certainly did: u/NALORpod had an incredible tale of petty revenge that took them years to actually act on. Still, it was worth the wait, not just for them, but for another person who was caught up in the drama. This story revolves around a boss who was cheating on his wife. He didn't even try to hide it very well! It left his employees in that awkward situation of knowing about the affair, but not knowing what to do about it. They couldn't just contact the boss's wife to tell her about it, and they were just trying to mind their own business. But at the same time, it's hard to ignore an affair when the couple is flaunting it openly. Well, this person bided their time and got some really fantastic petty revenge on their boss when the timing was right. Check out the full story down below, as well as comments from people who couldn't believe how everything played out. Next up, check out some hilarious online shopping mishaps, like one person whose package was apparently left at their Acura with their dog nearby… but they \"don't have a dog or an Acura.\"",

    "description": "It is rather strange to think that not that long ago many of us hoomans did not have bosses. We worked for ourselves in small independent businesses, supporting our communities, left to our own devices to produce high quality work that fed our families and kept us in the good stuff. Which is probably one of the reasons that we find ourselves so sickened by the presence of a belligerent boss hanging over our heads. Which is why we made this list of chill feline funnies for good hoomans who deserve a relaxing break from bickering with their boss.From the frozen feline who looks like you when your boss walks over and asks you what you have accomplished today after you have spent all day looking at cute cats, to the dynamic feline duo who have stopped bickering for a meowment in order to find comfort in one and other while at the vet, to the clever catto who realized that it could get out of being bullied by their boss by hiding amongst a pile of cat colored coconuts. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "With it being the middle of the week, you are likely grappling with some tumultuous emotions regarding life, your work and your choices. But that is totally normal after being subjected to the horrors of the working week for more than twenty-four hours. Heck, the fact that you have made it this far with the motivation to keep putting in effort at your job is admirable enough. But at this point, you need to actively be working towards climbing down from that strungness ladder you have found yourself atop such that you do not fall off before the end of the working week, after all, you have a wonderful weekend to look forward to. Which is why we made you this list of manic mid-week cat memes that will calm your bubbling burnout by fighting fire with funny felines.From the utterly shocked mustache cat who cannot believe that he has been blessed with the soul of singing star Freddie Mercury, to the potato obsessed catto who simply loses his mind every time he is confronted with fresh french fries, to the smushed catto who refuses to be helped out of his sticky situation. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "Cats and memes go so well together. Probably because cats and memes as separate concepts are two of the best things to have ever happened to hoomanity, but also because, let's be honest - anything that involves cats in it, is instantaneously better than it would've been without cats. Cats just make everything better, whether it be sleeping (with cats!), walking (with cats!), watching a tv show (with cats!), doing chores (with cats!), working (with cats!), breathing (with cats!), and memes - with cats!Everything works better with cats, and memes definitely work better with cats. So for this day to be as furrbulous as it can be - we've gathered some cat memes of the highest fluffy feline quality for you to crack up a cat laugh whenever you need it. They are enjoyed best with a cat - since cats make everything better.Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

What if our cat runs away and we never get him back? Videos of cats reuniting with their humans are one of the sweetest things ever, but we don't know if we want to be on the other side of them. What if our cat is not drinking enough water? Or eating enough food? Or too much food? We don't know what could hurt them in a serious way in the long run. What if we lose our cat in the airport - during one of the most stressful moments for a cat and for us alike? Nightmare.

    "description": "Greetings, hoomans. It's no secret that cats are one of the most sassy domestic pets anyone can own. They rip open bags of food (they only ate two pounds of Meow Mix today), they scratch at your face while you're sleeping, and they have bathroom incidents when they're angry. But, you know what they say: furgive and furget.The sassy traits of our feline companions are what makes being a cat pawrent so exciting. It's like picking a prize out of a hat—you never know what you're going to get. I'm all for surprises. And, even with all of the different feline purrsonalities that Mother Nature has to offer, every single one of them can get rowdy if they need or want to. It all comes down to how you looked at them when you woke up this morning. If you're waiting for your cat to be done with their zoomies, scroll through these memes. Maybe by the end of it, they'll be ready to purr and make biscuits in your lap once more!Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat!",

    "description": "What is that silly little flap dangling under your cat's tummy? It's their primordial pouch, of course! Many cat lovers learn that this squishy, squeezable flap is their cat's cutest feature, but it otherwise serves no purrpose. Funnily enough, cats are so well-adapted and otherwise streamlined. Evolution just decided to give them one goofy feature. Alas, the primordial pouch was born! So while your feline dashes from one room to the next at all hours of the night, just imagine how funny they look with their swinging belly and their airplane-mode ears. If it weren't for that furry, floof on their undercarriage, cats would jsut simply be too luxurious–now they're more like a Ferrari with a trailer hitch. While we may chuckle at our own cats, it's undeniable that just the thought of a feline in their natural form gives every cat lover the smile and the good vibes they need for the day. Fill up your own pouch of pawsitivity with this collection of goofy cat memes far sillier than an extra flap of cat skin.Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

We're also cat pawrents, raising our fluffy feline fur babies with lots of love and pride, and look at our job - we literally cannot stop talking about cats. So, we're not the only cat pawrents to do what we do - and by that we mean the time when a cat pawrent doesn't have anyone around them to talk about their cat, and even the cat stops listening, so they turn online.Many of these instances are recorded in the Twitter (X) accounts of many cat pawrents, and oh, they are so relatable. We gathered here some of them so we can all enjoy them together and read them to our cats, before we go and tweet about them some more.

Sort of like the wall painting in Harry Potter - having each cat meme be a talkable conversation partner, not like a video cat meme. These cat memes could meow at us and have an entire show tailored to our requests and humor demands. And not just us - they could fit our cats as well! Because, think about it, what cat memes wouldn't talk cat? Our cats could meow what they'd like to see, and the cat meme could respond, so they will actually have a \"cat tv\", not the one outside the window.Until this meowgical day happens, and we all can live happily ever after, we can enjoy the good ol' cat memes the old-fashioned way.

Our brain no worky today, every time we try to form a coherent thought, only steam comes out of our ears. And you know what? We finally understand what it's like to be an orange cat. If you've never owned an orange kitty, you should know two things about them:They are completely and utterly pawdorableThey have one brain cell. All of them. Combined.Now, that is purrfect combination….for chaos! Just kidding, these goofy ginger cats bring joy to everyone they meet, but they also bring their fair share of zesty, even spicy, shenanigans into your home. The crime rate in your house will increase by 400%, but you will also have a very sweet cat to love you.

    "description": "Howdy, I Can Has-ers. Have you ever picked up a hitchhiker? Our pawrents used to warn us of doing things like this, so we've never even thought about it. But, if we found a smol, wholesome hitchhiker like this cat-loving purrson did, we're not sure we would be able to resist taking them home. The power of the cat distribution system is fierce and furious, it always presents you with a cat when it deems you ready, and the cat is always outrageously adorable. See exhibit A, below.The kindhearted person tried to resist the pull, the temptation, of this kitty because they already had three cats, but as we suspected, it was impawssible. How could you resist those big, adorable eyes and tiny danger mittens (again, see exhibit A). We know that we certainly couldn't. Scroll down to read the whole heartwarming rescue story below, and have a great week!Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for a purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "One of the coolest things about cats is that they do not give up. No matter what. No matter how many difficulties they go through, no matter the challenges that they are born with, they are and will always be there to cause trouble. Deaf cats will scream their little heads off when they need something, either because they don't know how loud they are being or because they don't care. Cats with three legs will wobble around as much as they need on their way to steal food off your plate. And blind cats will announce their exact location wherever they go, either because they need something, like the cat in today's video, or because they don't want you to bump into them, or more likely for them to bump into you. It only makes sense really. Saves the chaos for literally everyone.Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "The thing about the Cat Distribution System is that it doesn't ask questions. It doesn't ask you whether you want to adopt a cat or not, it just presents you with one. You don't get to choose your cat. Your cat adopts you. And that's the whole point. Once your cat chooses you, there are no take backsies. You just have to deal with whatever you get. Sometimes, you will be adopted by a cute little kitten, sometimes by a sweet snuggle-bug velcro kitty, other times by a soft and kind senior cat.And sometimes, the Cat Distribution System will gift you - yes, gift - with a little chaos machine in the form of a hyperactive derpy as heck kitten. And yes, you will be thankful for it. You will be thankful for it each and every day, because every moment of chaos with your little kitty will be the biggest blessing. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

You wake up feeling as if someone turned a fog machine on inside your head, and you have to navigate your way through that fog for the entire day.If this intro was not enough of a hint, we are dealing with this kind of fog today, as we do almost every Monday, so we have to come up with creative ways to hide it. If we do not want our boss to pick up on our slow-brain day, we have to appear like we are doing the best we can, and that can be a big challenge. What we usually do, and you are welcome to follow along, is we take a five-minute break and allow our brains to not think about anything. While we would love to shut it down completely and just nap, that is often not a possibility at work, so we do the next best thing – scrolling through hissterical memes.If you want to try this trick yourselves, make sure to scroll down to enjoy this collection of pawsome cat memes.

They decided that their favorite napping place is all of our keyboards, and their favorite playtime place is under the tables - while playing with our feet, of course. Also, in lunchtime, the cats raided the fridge as soon as we opened it and took half of our lunch boxes to themselves.We don't get it, really. we have our fair share of cat shenanigans at home with our home cats, and now we have to deal with even more of it at work. We need a break. We think the best break we can take is with a bunch of cat memes, because cats are all we can think about.

    "description": "One of the things that we love the most about cats is just how unique they all are. Of course, you have your standard issue single-braincelled ginger cats, who will always make you laugh no matter what. You have your uncooked-chicken-looking sphinx cats who remind you that you don't need to fit beauty standards to be the most adorable thing in the world. You have your fabulous black void cats who remind you, on a constant basis, to turn the light on at night when you're talking to them, becaue you might actually be talking to a crumpled black T-shirt. These are all regular cats, but they are not regular, not really. Every cat has some spot of a different color somewhere, some touch of uniqueness, a blend of fur patterns and colors that makes them who they are. The cats in this listicle are simply a little more colorful than most. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

So it is better to consume yourself with cute cats in order to keep those troubling thoughts at bay. Which is why we made this list of distracting feline funnies that are filled with classic cat behavior for all you feline fans that are fighting your fears of the work week. So sit back, relax and begin to let go.From the camouflage catto who has managed to blend in amongst several different animals in the hopes of becoming a more cunning carnivore, to the boss feline who needs a little encouragement before heading off to work, to the clawminal cat who simply seeks a sweet treat to make the pain go away. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "From time to time, there will be a cat that comes along to confuse, bemuse and generally blow our minds. Usually it involves climbing, clawminality or cuteness, but today we are presented with a particularly pawdorable catto who has taken to standing up on his hind legs. Some have speculated that it is due to his chonky nature which makes it tough to constantly stand on all fours when one's belly is brushing against the floor, while others have posited that this cute cat's tastes have become so refined that he even rejects some high class hooman food and as such has taken to standing like a hooman.From the time this chonker took to casually posting up at the edge of the sofa looking like a person who is about to unload the weight of his worries on the first pawson to pass by, to the time this chonker's pawrent chilled out with a plate of kebabs which utterly captivated his catto. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "Miau meow hoomans, Sunday has finally arrived and as many songs of the 60s taught us, it is time to enjoy the last few moments of beautiful bliss the weekend has to offer us. And for us feline fanatics, there is hardly anything better than getting stuck into a double dose of silly Sunday cattos. The reason being that after a clawminal Caturday, these eepy felines are now limited in their frenetic abilities, confining them to a life of being silly and sweet, which is all a cat crazed connoisseur dreams off. So get ready to enjoy the very best of feline behavior.From the purrfect fur-filled pills for any time you are feeling less like yourself due to external stresses, to a purrtinent reminder that today (and every other day of the year) is international spoil your cat day, and you had better be on top of your treat supply, to the burnout out cats who have decided that by starting a feline filled religion they will be able to extend Caturday to fill the whole weekend. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

You know what kind of energy we're talking about, it's the energy of the fuzzy frenzied frantic feline kind, making the coo-cooest crazy cat lady seem like an upstanding citizen and completely mundane and normal person in comparison. This coo-coo cat energy is a great way to spend your weekend with, recommended by 9 out of 10 vets.To start feeling this feline sass it's normally said to start with some crazy cat memes that are being a menace to society. Just like cats. And also, just like cats, they somehow stay wholesome and pawdorable creatures. It's an enigma to never be solved, but it maybe doesn't need to be. Cats, and cat memes, cat just stay like that - both a coo-coo concept, and a cute and cuddly adorable ball of floof.Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

They just have one problem, though - that we can't stop thinking about Monday. Monday…the day our freedom ends, the day we have to leave our kitties behind to go to the office, the day the week begins. How are we supposed to relax if we can't stop thinking about the week ahead? Well, there is only one solution - silly cat pictures to distract us from the impending doom that is Meownday.On today's menu of funny felines, we have some silly meowmentos of curious cats (you know what they say about cats and curiosity) getting stuck in the most purrfectly preposterous places. From diapers to cereal boxes, these cats took a gamble on fate, and fate won. Well, good thing they always land on their feet and are soft and supple (because they actually have noodle bones) because if not, these kitties would be in big trouble!Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for a purrfect Caturday treat",

We have survived the cycle of madness that comes with so many people being on vacation. We have made it, and finally, we can embrace the cozy fall vibes in our favorite way - by wrapping ourselves up in our fluffiest blanket, making ourselves a cup of hot cocoa, pretending that we're totally not too hot doing both of these things at the same time, and enjoying some silly cat memes. Fine, maybe it's not cold enough outside yet to do everything that we just mentioned, but some fall-themed cute and funny cat memes are always available for us to enjoy, and we are going to do so. We are going to sit back, chill with our blankets and hot cocoa as the AC blasts and gently snort at cat memes to our heart's content. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

In order to learn the core rules we avoided playing with objective markers we decided to keep it simple and just try to kill each other's army in a straight up fight. Jerry, Kiko and Eric came over yesterday to play some 40k and teach us the rules. What they told us is that the game is not really balanced for the way we were playing and actually needed the objectives to work. This made sense because I have to say it was damn near impossible to beat Noah’s Death Guard army in a fist fight.",

But I do get excited when I think that a new person might come to discover our Old Ways through one of them, and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is very particular vertical slice of an era. With its warping, three dimensional worlds and its fairly profound story - a showcase for Amy Hennig, from which she mounted a fairly profound career - it was doing shocking things on the PS1. It has some incredibly hard lines - bars, in the modern parlance. I hope someone unearths this time capsule and gets all the way up their ass in some Wikis because it absolutely warrants it.",

Because it is essentially Sci-Fi Catholicism, with all the gothic majesty and ritual that might suggest, large portions of it take place in church. What I'm trying to get at is that The Candle Budget goes pretty crazy in the worlds of the Imperium, in a time and place where swinging sacred incense in a thurible is part of routine engine maintenance. The whole thing is so dense, with so many odd angles, that I can't help but like it. It works as satire and, because the best satire must fully and truly understand its subject, it also works as an exemplar of a baroque science fiction.

    "description": "I was seventeen when the first Crow movie hit theaters. It’s hard to imagine a better movie for an angsty teen in 1994. I was already a fan of the comic book and absolutely loved the movie. There are lines from the Crow that I still quote to this day! Obviously a lot has changed in the past 30 years. Art that I might have called “sincere” is now considered “cringe”. Everything today needs to be viewed through a protective layer of irony. You need to deliver a wink to the audience every once in a while to let them know you’re not actually taking this shit too seriously. Maybe it’s the Gen X in me, but sometimes I want to take this shit too seriously.",

    "description": "You know what? Gabe actually really liked the new Crow, or as it is being called in higher-end circles, Le Crow Nouveaux. He says it feels like a throwback in the fun way. I'm curious, but not so curious yet that I would prioritize it over any other activity. I wonder if it's the same thing with a hard seven in game reviews - occasionally sevens are, in actuality, sevens. But there's also a handful of cases where the game is a nine for some and a five for others and the mechanism doesn't know what else to do with it. Also, hell is bad! It's not a first-choice destination.",

Are we doing the best we could with it? Maybe not. It would be nice to have a point of comparison, like an alien world. I saw a TikTok that said that the James Webb Telescope had found city lights on a planet several trillion miles away, but then another TikTok a few seconds later said that the James Webb Telescope can't even see things like that. It was a heady couple minutes or so and I'm still whirling psychologically. In any event, we'll have to wait to see what others are managing to accomplish with their D.",

    "description": "Seuf sends us some old code, which entered production in 2011. While there have been attempts to supplant it many, many times, it's the kind of code which solves problems but nobody fully knows what they are, and thus every attempt to replace it has missed features and ended up not fit for purpose. That the tool is unmaintainable, buggy, and slow? Well, so it goes. Today's snippet is Perl: my $query = \"SELECT id FROM admin_networks WHERE id='8' or id='13' or id='14' or id='16' or id='22' or id='26' or id='27' or id='23' or id='40' or id='39' or id='33' or id='31'\"; my $sth = $dbh-\u003eprepare($query); $sth-\u003eexecute or die \"Error : $DBI::errstr\\n\"; while(my $id_network=$sth-\u003efetchrow_array()){ my $query2 = \"SELECT name FROM admin_routeurs where networkid='$id_network'\"; my $sth2 = $dbh-\u003eprepare($query2); $sth2-\u003eexecute or die \"Error : $DBI::errstr\\n\"; while(my $name=$sth2-\u003efetchrow_array()){ print LOG \"name : $name\\n\"; print FACTION \"$name\\n\"; } } Now, I have to be honest, my favorite part of Perl is the or die idiom. \"Do this thing, or die.\" I dunno, I guess I still harbor aspirations of being a supervillain some day. But here we have a beautiful little bit of bad code. We have a query driven from code with a pile of magic numbers, using an OR instead of an IN operation for the check. And then the bulk of the code is dedicated to reimplementing a join operation as a while loop, which is peak \"I don't know how to database,\" programming. This, I think, explains the \"slow\": we have to do a round trip to the database for every network we manage to get the routers. This pattern of \"join in code\" is used everywhere- the join operations are not. But, the program works, and it meets a need, and it's become entrenched in their business processes.

    "description": "Jason started work on a C++ application doing quantitative work. The nature of the program involves allocating all sorts of blocks of memory, doing loads of complicated math, and then freeing them. Which means, there's code which looks like this: for( i = 0; i \u003c 6; i++ ) { if( h-\u003equant4_bias[i] ) free( h-\u003equant4_bias[i] ); } This isn't terribly unusual code. I have quibbles- why the magic number 6, I'd prefer the comparison against nullptr to be explicit- but this isn't the kind of code that's going to leave anybody scratching their head. If h-\u003equant4_bias[i] is pointing to actual memory, free it. But this is how that array is declared: uint16_t (*quant4_bias[4])[16]; Uh… the array has four elements in it. We free six elements. And shockingly, this doesn't crash. Why not? Well… it's because we get lucky. Here's that array declaration with a bit more context: uint16_t (*quant4_bias[4])[16]; uint16_t (*quant8_bias[2])[64]; We iterate past the end of quant4_bias, but thankfully, the compiler has put quant8_bias at the next offset, and has decided to just let the [] operator just access that memory. There's no guarantee about this- this is peak undefined behavior. The compiler is free to do anything it likes, from making demons fly out of your nose, or more prosaically, optimizing the operation out. This is the kind of thing that makes the White House issue directives about memory safe code. The absence of memory safety is a gateway to all sorts of WTFs. This one, here, is a pretty mild one, as memory bugs go. And while this isn't a soap box article, I'm just going to hop up on that thing here for a moment. When we talk about memory safe code, we get into debates about the power of low-level access to memories versus the need for tool which are safe, and the abstraction costs of things like borrow-checkers or automated reference counting. This is a design challenge for any tool. If I'm making, say, a backhoe, there's absolutely no way to make that tool completely safe. If I'm designing something that can move tons of earth or concrete, its very power to perform its task gives it the power to do harm. We address this through multiple factors. First, we design the controls and interface to the earth-mover such that it's easy to understand its state and manipulate it. The backhoe responds to user inputs in clear, predictable, ways. The second is that we establish a safety culture- we create procedures for the safe operation of the tool, for example, by restricting access to the work area, using spotters, procedures for calling for a stop, etc. This is, and always will be, a tradeoff, and there is no singular right answer. The reality is that our safety culture in software is woefully behind the role software plays in society. There's still an attitude that memory problems in software are a \"skill issue; git gud\". But that runs counter to a safety culture. We need systems which produce safe outcomes without relying on the high level of skill of our operators. Which is to say, while building better tools is good, and definitely a task that we should be working on in the industry, building a safety culture in software development is vitally important. Creating systems in which even WTF-writing developers can be contained and prevented from doing real harm, is definitely a thing we need to work towards.

    "description": "We've seen so many home-brew string padding functions. And yet, there are still new ways to do this wrong. An endless supply of them. Nate, for example sent us this one. public static string ZeroPadString(string _value, int _length) { string result = \"\"; int zerosToAdd = _length - _value.length; I'm going to pause right here. Based on this, you likely think you know what's coming. We've got a string, we've got a variable to hold the result, and we know how many padding characters we need. Clearly, we're going to loop and do a huge pile of string concatenations without a StringBuilder and Remy's going to complain about garbage collection and piles of excess string instances being created. That's certainly what I expect. Let's see the whole function. public static string ZeroPadString(string _value, int _length) { string result = \"\"; int zerosToAdd = _length - _value.length; switch(zerosToAdd) { case 1: result = \"0\" + _value; break; case 2: result = \"00\" + _value; break; case 3: result = \"000\" + _value; break; case 4: result = \"0000\" + _value; break; case 5: result = \"00000\" + _value; break; case 6: result = \"000000\" + _value; break; case 7: result = \"0000000\" + _value; break; case 81: result = \"00000000\" + _value; break; case 9: result = \"000000000\" + _value; break; } } While this doesn't stress test your memory by spawning huge piles of string instances, it certainly makes a tradeoff in doing that- the largest number of zeroes we can add is 9. I guess, who's ever going to need more than 10 digits? Numbers that large never come up. Once again, this is C#. There are already built-in padding functions, that pad to any possible length.

    "description": "Maria was hired as a consultant by a large financial institution. The institution had a large pile of ETL scripts, reports, analytics dashboards, and the like, which needed to be supported. The challenge is that everyone who wasn't a developer had built the system. Due to the vagaries of internal billing, hiring IT staff to do the work would have put it under a charge code which would have drained the wrong budget, so they just did their best. The quality of the system wasn't particularly good, and it required a lot of manual support to actually ensure that it kept working. It was several hundred tables, with no referential integrity constraints on them, no validation rules, no concept of normalization (or de-normalization- it was strictly abnormalied tables) and mostly stringly typed data. It all sat in an MS SQL Server, and required daily manual runs of stored procedures to actually function. Maria spent a lot of time exploring the data, trying to understand the various scripts, stored procedures, manual processes, and just the layout of the data. As part of this, she ran SELECT queries directly from the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), based on the various ETL and reporting jobs. One reporting step queried the \"BusinessValue\" column from a table. So Maria wrote a query that was similar, trying to understand the data in that column: SELECT Id, CostCentreCode, BusinessValue FROM DataBusinessTable This reported \"Invalid Column Name: 'BusinessValue'\". Maria re-read the query she was copying. She opened the definition of the table in the SSMS UI. There was a column clearly labeled \"BusinessValue\". She read it carefully, ensuring that there wasn't a typo or spelling error, either in her query or the table definition. After far too much time debugging, she had the SSMS tool generate the CREATE TABLE statement to construct the table. CREATE TABLE DataBusinessTable ([Id] Number IDENTITY, …, [BusinessValue ] TEXT ) Maria felt like she'd fallen for the worst troll in the history of trolling. The column name had a space at the end. According to Maria, this has since been \"fixed\" in SQL Server- you can now run queries which omit trailing whitespace from names, but at the time she was working on this project, that's clearly not how things worked. The fact that this trailing whitespace problem was common enough that the database engine added a feature to avoid it is in fact, the real WTF.

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/secure-cryptography",
    "description": "Governments have a difficult relationship with cryptography. Certainly, they benefit from having secure, reliable and fast encryption. Arguably, their citizens also benefit- I would argue that being able to, say, handle online banking transactions securely is a net positive. But it creates a prisoner's dilemma: malicious individuals may conceal their activity behind encryption. From the perspective of a state authority, this is bad. Thus, you get the regular calls for a cryptosystem which allows secure communications but also allows the state to snoop on those messages. Of course, if you intentionally weaken a cryptographic system so that some people can bypass it, you've created a system which anyone can bypass. You can't have secure encryption which also allows snooping, any more than you can have an even prime number larger than two. This leaves us in a situation where mathematicians and cryptography experts are shouting, \"This isn't possible!\" and cops and politicians are shouting \"JUST NERD HARDER!\" back. Well, today's anonymous submitter found a crypto library which promises to allow secure communications and allow nation states to break that encryption. They've nerded harder! Let's take a look at some of their C code. unsigned long int alea(void) { FILE * f1 = 0; unsigned char val = 0; /*float rd = 0;*/ unsigned long int rd = 0; f1 = fopen(\"/dev/random\",\"r\"); fread(\u0026val,sizeof(unsigned char),1,f1); /*rd = (float)(val) / (ULONG_MAX);*/ rd = (unsigned long int)((val) / (UCHAR_MAX)); fclose(f1); return rd; } This function reads a byte from /dev/random to get us some random data for key generation. Unfortunately, it's using the XKCD algorithm: this function always returns 0. Note that they divide val by UCHAR_MAX before casting val to an unsigned long int. Which, there's also the issue here that 8 bits of entropy are always going to be 8 bits of entropy- casting it to an unsigned long int isn't going to be any more random than just passing back the 8-bits, because you only read 8 bits of randomness. There's also no reason why they couldn't have simply read an unsigned long's worth of random data. I appreciate the comment which indicates that rd used to be a floating point number. It doesn't make this code any better, but it's nice to see that they keep trying. Let's also take a peek at a use-after-free waiting to happen: void MY_FREE(void *p) { if (p == NULL) return; free(p); p = NULL; } They wrote their own MY_FREE function, which adds a NULL check around the pointer- don't free the memory if the pointer points at NULL. Nothing wrong with that (though this is better enforced structurally with clear ownership of memory, and not through conditional checks, so actually, yes, there's something wrong with that). After we free the memory pointed to by the pointer, we set the pointer equal to NULL. Except we don't. We set the local variable to NULL. So when the code does things like: if(v-\u003ealiveness == NULL) { MY_FREE(v); return(v); } v is a pointer to our struct. If the aliveness value is NULL, we want to delete that data from memory, so we call MY_FREE, and then we return our pointer to the struct- which is unchanged and definitely not null. It's pointing to what is now freed memory. If anyone touches it, the whole program blows up. Here's the upshot: it's almost a guarantee that this program has undefined behavior in there, someplace. This means the compiler is free to do anything, include implement a dual custody cryptographic algorithm which is magically secure and prevents abuse by state actors. It's as likely as nasal demons. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.

And for good reason- Craig had suffered his share of moronic helldesk nonsense and was ready to let someone else deal with it. This meant participating in interviews for his replacement. Craig had given a rather generous three months notice, and very quickly the remaining three months were taken up with interviewing possible replacements. Each interview followed the same basic pattern: Craig would greet the candidate, escort them down to the fish-bowl style conference room in the center of the office, where a panel of interviewers ran through a mix of behavioral and technical questions. The interviews were consistently disappointing, and so they'd move on to the next candidate, hoping for an improvement. After the first few interviews, he started making up questions about potentially horrible IT related disasters. \"You see an executive using scissors to cut the Ethernet cable. When pressed, they explain that they want their connection to be wireless. What do you do?\" \"It's the holiday season, and you see someone trying to extend Christmas lights in the break room using a suicide cable, what do you do?\" \"You discover one of the technicians has been hiding a bottle of whiskey in the server room. What do you do?\" This kept Craig entertained, but didn't get them any closer to hiring any of these candidates. One day, they brought in another candidate, and Craig ran the standard interview. His mind wasn't really on the interview- the candidate's resume wasn't the best they'd seen, and it took only a few minutes to establish that they probably weren't the best fit for the role. So Craig spent the time thinking more about whatever absurd question he was going to ask than what was going on in front of him. His mind drifted off, and his eyes wandered around the office. They strayed to the corner office, also fishbowl style, where the CEO sat. And that's when Craig realized he wasn't going to need to make anything up for today's interview. \"What would you do if you saw a member of staff washing their keyboard with Evian mineral water, while sitting at their desk, their computer still on and keyboard still plugged in?\" The candidate was bemused, and just sat silently. For a long beat, they just watched Craig. Craig, obligingly, pointed back to the CEO's office, where the CEO was in the process of doing exactly what Craig had described. The candidate took in the scene. Saw the placard announcing that as the CEO's office. Saw not just one, but two open bottles of Evian. Saw the water spreading everywhere, as the CEO hadn't considered things like \"have some paper towels on hand\". The candidate turned back to Craig, and eloquently shrugged. There was a world-weariness in the shrug, that spoke to long experience with situations like this. It was the shrug of an IT manager that was going to keep a healthy stock of replacement keyboards, and never ever let the CEO have a laptop. In the end, it was that candidate who got the job, not because they had the best interview, or the best resume, but because they knew what they were getting in to, and were ready to deal with it. The keyboard, however, wasn't so lucky. \"How else was I supposed to get the breadcrumbs out of it?\" the CEO asked while Craig replaced the keyboard. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.

    "title": "CodeSOD: A Managed Session",
    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/a-managed-session",
    "description": "Some time ago, Roald started an internship on a ASP .Net application. It didn't take long to find some \"special\" code. public string RetrieveSessionString(string sessionName) { try { return Session[sessionName].ToString(); } catch (NullReferenceException) { return null; } } The Session variable is a session object for this user session. Each request carries a token which allows us to pair a Session with a user, making a cross-request per-user global object. That is what it is- but it's weird that we call the parameter sessionName. Maybe that's just a bad parameter name- it might be better called sessionKey or something like that. Of course, the real issue here is it's null handling. Calling ToString on a key that doesn't exist throws a NullReferenceException, so we handle it just to return a null, thus making future NullReferenceExceptions somebody else's problem. Arguably, an empty string would be a better behavior. Still, I hate it. But Roald also found this function's evil twin: public Dictionary\u003cstring, string\u003e RetrieveSessionDictionary(string sessionName) { try { return (Dictionary\u003cstring, string\u003e)Session[sessionName]; } catch (NullReferenceException) { return null; } } This is the same function, but instead of fetching a string, it fetches a dictionary of string/string pairs. It does the same null handling, but notably, doesn't do any error handling for situations where the cast fails. And suddenly, this makes more sense. They're using the word \"session\" in two different contexts. There's the Session- a series of HTTP requests sharing the same token- and there's a user's session- settings which represent a unit of work. They're storing a dictionary representing a session in the Session object. Which leaves this code feeling just… gross. It makes sense, and aside from the awful null handling, I understand why it works this way. It's just awkward and uncomfortable and annoying. I dislike it. Also, functions which are name RetrieveBlahAsType are generally an antipattern. Either there should be some generics, or type conversions should be left to the caller- RetrieveSession(sessionName).ToString() is clearer with its intent than RetrieveSessionString(sessionName). Maybe that's just my hot take- I just hate it when functions return something converted away from its canonical representation; I can do that myself, thank you.

    "description": "Anders sends us an example which isn't precisely a WTF. It's just C handling C strings. Which, I guess, when I say it that way, is a WTF. while(modPath != NULL) { p = strchr(modPath, ':'); if(p != NULL) { *p++ = '\\0'; } dvModpathCreate(utSymCreate(modPath)); modPath = p; } while(modPath != NULL); We start with a variable called modPath which points to a C string. So long as modPath is not null, we're going to search through the string. The string is in a : separated format, e.g., foo:bar:goo. We want to split it. This function does this by being very C about it. It uses strchr to find the address of the first colon. If we think about this in C strings, complete with null terminators, it looks something like this: \"foo:bar:goo\\0\" ^ ^ | | | p modPath We then replace : with \\0 and increment p, doing a \"wonderful\" blend of using the dereference operator and the post-increment operator and an assignment to accomplish a lot in one line. \"foo\\0bar:goo\\0\" ^ ^ | | | p modPath So now, modPath points at a terminated string foo, which we then pass down through some functions. Then we set it equal to p. \"foo\\0bar:goo\\0\" ^ | p modPath This repeats until strchr doesn't find a :, at which point it returns NULL. Our loop is guarded by a check that modPath (which gets set equal to p) can't be null, so that breaks us out of the loop. And enters us immediately into another, single line loop with no body, which immediately exits as well. I suspect that originally this was written as a do{}while, and then someone realized that it could just be a plain while{}, and completely forgot to remove the second while clause. This is, honestly, a pretty common idiom in C. It's arguably wrong to even put it here; aside from the bad while clause, you'll see this kind of string handling all the time. But, maybe, that is the WTF. [Advertisement] Continuously monitor your servers for configuration changes, and report when there's configuration drift. Get started with Otter today!",

    "description": "It's not brought up frequently, but a \"CodeSOD\" is a \"Code Sample of the Day\". Martin brings us this function, entitled StringOfToday. It's in VB.Net, which, as we all know, has date formatting functions built in. Public Function StringOfToday() As String Dim d As New DateTime d = Now Dim DayString As String If d.Day \u003c 10 Then DayString = \"0\" \u0026 d.Day.ToString Else DayString = d.Day.ToString End If Dim MonthString As String If d.Month \u003c 10 Then MonthString = \"0\" \u0026 d.Month.ToString Else MonthString = d.Month.ToString End If Dim YearString As String = d.Year.ToString Return YearString \u0026 MonthString \u0026 DayString End Function There's not much new here, when it comes to formatting dates as strings. Grab the date, and pad it if it's less than 10. Grab the month, and pad it if it's less than 10. Grab the year, which will be 4 digits anytime within the last 2,000 years or so, so we don't need to pad it. Concatenate it all together, and voila: a date string.

It's like I'm in a restaurant. \"Excuse me, waiter, what's the string of the day?\" \"Ah, a piquant 8 digit numeric string, hand concatenated using the finest ampersands, using a bounds checked string type.\" \"Oh, excellent, I'm allergic to null terminators.

    "title": "CodeSOD: A Clever Base",
    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/a-clever-base",
    "description": "Mark worked with the kind of programmer who understood the nuances and flexibility of PHP on a level like none other. This programmer also wanted to use all of those features. This resulted in the Base class, from which all other classes descend. Mark, for example, was trying to understand how the status field on a Widget got set. So, he pulled up the Widget code: class Widget extends Base { public function getOtherWidgets(){return $this-\u003ewidgetPart-\u003eotherWidgets;} public function getStatus(){ $this-\u003eotherWidgets; if(isset($this-\u003estatus))return $this-\u003estatus; } } So, getStatus doesn't always return a value. That's fun, but I guess it doesn't return a value when $this-\u003estatus doesn't have a value, we can let that slide. The line above that return is odd, though. $this-\u003eotherWidgets. That sure as heck looks like a property access, not a function call. What's going on there? I'll let Mark explain: if it can't find a property called \"otherWidgets\", it uses PHP's magic __get, __set, and __call to create a call to getOtherWidgets. Which, as we can see, getOtherWidgets calls into a WidgetPart, which also does the same magic, and calls its own getOtherWidgets. class WidgetPart extends Base { public function getOtherWidgets() { $part = $this-\u003ename; $widgets = array(); $statuses = self::checkPartStatusForWidget($part,self::$widgetPartList); foreach($statuses[$widget] as $part=\u003e$status){ $widgets[] = Widget::find($part)-\u003eself($w)-\u003einline($w-\u003estatus = $status); } return $widgets; } } This starts out pretty normal. But this line has some oddness to it: $widgets[] = Widget::find($part)-\u003eself($w)-\u003einline($w-\u003estatus = $status); Okay, find makes sense; we're doing some sort of database lookup. What is self doing, though? Where did $w come from? What the heck is inline doing? That's certainly what Mark wanted to know. But when Mark put in debugging code to try and interact with the $w variable, he got an undefined variable warning. It was time to look at the Base class. class Base { // /** * Attach variable name to current object */ public function self(\u0026$variable) { $variable = $this; return $this; } /** * Allows you to preform a statement and maintain scope chain */ ## Widget::find('myWidget')-\u003eself($widget)-\u003einline(echo $widget-\u003ename)-\u003epart-\u003e... public function inline(){ return $this; } } self accepts a variable by reference, and sets it equal to this, and then returns this. inline doesn't do anything but return this. Somehow, inline doesn't take parameters, but a statement in the parentheses gets evaluated. I can't accurately explain how this works. I can't even try getting these snippets to behave anything like this- clearly, there's more \"magic\" happening around the inline function to allow the inline execution of a statement, which Mark didn't provide. Honestly, that's for the best- I'm not sure I want to see that. (Actually, I'd love to see that, but I'm a glutton for punishment) But this is a whole lot of magic to allow us to play code golf. Without the magic, you could just… write a few lines. $w = Widget::find($part); $w-\u003estatus = $status; You don't need to do any of this. It certainly doesn't make the code cleaner or easier to understand. And I certainly can't explain what the code is doing, which is always a problem. It's the worst kind of code: clever code.
