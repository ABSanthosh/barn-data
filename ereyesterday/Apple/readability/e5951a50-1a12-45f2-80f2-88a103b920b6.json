Photo: Cult of Mac Deals Youbooks is a new AI book writer that combines popular AI models like ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini to help you create full nonfiction books. A lifetime subscription is on sale now for just $49 (regularly $540). How does Youbooks AI write your book? If you ever tried writing anything longer than a few hundred words with ChatGPT, you know how disjointed AI can get with long-form text. The AI Writing Tools in Apple Intelligence probably won’t knock your socks off, either. Youbooks does things differently. The AI book writer taps into multiple models to create nuanced, coherent manuscripts up to 300,000 words long. That leaves you plenty of room to dive into the nitty gritty of your chosen niche. Research is an important part of nonfiction writing, and Youbooks can help with that, too. The built-in research tool pulls in current facts and statistics to help keep your content up to date. You also can upload your own research, documents and transcripts. The AI book writer then weaves all that into the manuscript for a more personalized, fact-grounded result. Adjust your tone and writing style With Youbooks, you can fully customize your writing tone and style. Whether you want an academic voice, conversational tone or something in between, the AI book writer can match it. You can even store up to 100 style samples to help shape future projects. For creators worried about rights, Youbooks offers another key benefit: You keep full commercial ownership. That means you’re free to publish, distribute or sell your book however you like, with no extra licensing fees or royalties to worry about. The lifetime deal includes 150,000 monthly credits, which cover both writing output and uploaded source material. You’ll also gain access to upcoming feature updates. And when it’s time to deliver, Youbooks lets you download documents in DOCX, EPUB, PDF and Markdown formats. Save on Youbooks AI writer Writing a book doesn’t have to be hard.
