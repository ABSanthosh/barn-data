  "text": "Every year, many companies introduce special products based on the signs of the zodiac to celebrate the New Year in Japan. As 2025 will be the Year of the Snake, Apple has now announced a limited edition AirTag with a unique snake engraving. Apple celebrates Year of the Snake in Japan with special AirTag and gift cards Apple Japan’s website has been updated to promote the New Year’s campaign, which will take place between January 2nd and 5th. Customers in Japan will get Apple gift cards worth up to ¥30,000 (around $190) when buying a new Apple product such as an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Of course, the amount of the gift card varies according to the product chosen. Check out the list of eligible products below: Beats Solo Buds, Studio Buds+, and Beats Flex: Gift card of up to ¥6,000 Magic Keyboard for iPad and Apple Pencil (2nd gen and Pro): Gift card of up to ¥6,000 Apple TV 4K and HomePod: Gift card of up to ¥8,000 iPhone 14, iPhone 15, and iPhone SE: Gift card of up to ¥11,000 Apple Watch SE, Series 10, and Ultra 2: Gift card of up to ¥11,000 AirPods 4, AirPods Pro 2, and AirPods Max: Gift card of up to ¥12,000 10th gen iPad, M2 iPad Air, and M4 iPad Pro: Gift card of up to ¥15,000 M2 and M3 MacBook Air: Gift card of up to ¥30,000 In addition to the gift card, the first 50,000 customers who buy a new iPhone 14, iPhone 15, or iPhone SE during the campaign will win a limited edition AirTag celebrating the Year of the Snake. Unfortunately, Apple won’t be selling the Year of the Snake AirTag separately. Notably, some of the company’s high-end products such as the iPhone 16 and MacBook Pro are not eligible for the offer. The same applies to the recently launched iPad mini 7. Customers in Japan can find more details about the offer on Apple’s website.
