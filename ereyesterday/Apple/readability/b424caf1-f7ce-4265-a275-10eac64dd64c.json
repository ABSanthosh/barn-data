  "text": "Just days after issuing a voluntary recall for the Anker PowerCore 10000, the company has now issued a second, broader recall, this time with global reach and five additional power bank models affected. Anker says the move is a proactive step following recent improvements to its internal quality assurance systems. While the company claims the risk of malfunction is low, it’s recalling the affected models “out of an abundance of caution.” All five power banks flagged in the recall use lithium-ion battery cells sourced from the same supplier. Five models affected The global recall (via MacRumors), applies to the following power banks: Anker Power Bank (10K, 22.5W) — Model A1257 Anker Power Bank (20,000mAh, 22.5W, Built-In USB-C Cable) — Model A1647 Anker MagGo Power Bank (10,000mAh, 7.5W) — Model A1652 Anker Zolo Power Bank (20K, 30W, Built-In USB-C and Lightning Cable) — Model A1681 Anker Zolo Power Bank (20K, 30W, Built-In USB-C Cable) — Model A1689 To find the model number and the serial number on your product, Anker instructs users that “the serial number is usually printed on the side or back of the product”: If you own any of these models, Anker recommends stopping using them immediately, even if they seem OK. The company warns that affected batteries could overheat, potentially leading to melting, smoke, or even fire. How to check if your device is affected Here’s the step-by-step, as provided by Anker: Step 1: Check your model number—located on the back or side of your power bank. If it matches one of the following models (A1257, A1647, A1652, A1681, A1689), proceed to Step 2. Step 2: Verify your serial number or submit your proof of purchase using our online recall form: http://www.anker.com/rc2506-form Note: Please carefully review the letters and numbers in your serial number, such as “1,” “L,” “l,” “2,” and “Z.” Characters like “0” (zero) and “O” (letter O) are easily confused. Affected serial numbers do not contain the letters “O” or “I.” Anker also says that if your device is confirmed to be affected, you can choose between two compensation options when filling out the recall claim form: Receive a free replacement product or receive a gift card for use on the Anker website. Replacement and discarding instrucions Like with the PowerCore 10000 recall, Anker asks clients not to dispose of the power bank until the company confirms it’s eligible for replacement. The company emphasizes that recalled lithium-ion batteries must be taken to a certified facility, usually a municipal Household Hazardous Waste collection site, rather than recycling or drop-off boxes, which aren’t equipped to safely handle recalled batteries.
