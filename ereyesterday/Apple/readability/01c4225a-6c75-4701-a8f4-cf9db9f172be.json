But if you’re the adventurous type—a hiker, camper, photographer or videographer, and so on—you know how challenging it can be to keep your gear charged and connected on the go. That’s why BLUETTI has just launched two solutions with its new BLUETTI Handsfree Backpack Power Stations. Solving the problem of power availability with BLUETTI backpacks There are only so many USB power banks you can carry with you. And depending on your needs, they may not offer nearly the kind of power you need for your treks. For example, maybe you’re remote filming, taking e-bike adventures, live streaming in nature, or simply wanting to get away for a while. Portable power can be hard to come by. BLUETTI offers two different backpacks with built-in power stations to meet your needs: the BLUETTI Handsfree 1 Backpack Power Station is a more compact option, with 42L of storage capacity and a 300W/268Wh power station built in. It’s ideal for 1-3 days of outdoor adventures. the BLUETTI Handsfree 2 Backpack Power Station goes bigger, with more room and more power for a longer trip. It stores up to 60L and includes a massive 700W/512Wh power station for adventures spanning 3-5 days. No matter which backpack you choose, you’ll get a similar, thoughtful design with a variety of compartments, MOLLE straps, hooks, and mounts to store all your gear. The power stations built into each backpack are accessible from a side compartment, with one AC, two USB-C, and two USB-A ports. So it’s easy to plug in and charge up on the go. And even though they boast a ton of power, each power station is ultra-thin and fits seamlessly into the backpack while adding minimal weight. You can recharge each backpack via mains, solar, battery, or a vehicle. And unlike some competitors, they charge extremely fast: up to 80% charge in 45 minutes, and full charge in less than 90. So you can prep for your next adventure with little time wasted. Cost and availability Each BLUETTI backpack is now available at an early bird launch price through November 15 only: the BLUETTI Handsfree 1 Backpack Power Station is just $299, or you can add a high-performance 120W solar panel in the PV120S Combo to bring the total to $499 the BLUETTI Handsfree 2 Backpack Power Station is only $399, with the PV120S Combo running $599 You can order from the official BLUETTI website or on Amazon.
