AT\u0026T Wireless and Verizon are running Black Friday and Cyber Monday specials that run through Dec. 2 — and the iPhone 16 Pro is highly incentivized. AT\u0026T Wireless AT\u0026T is running a promotion on the iPhone 16 Pro, making it free via bill credits with an eligible trade-in. You can also get an Apple Watch and iPad for $0.99 per month each. The offer is valid on the 128GB iPhone 16, the 40mm Apple Watch SE 2 and the 64GB iPad 10th Gen. It requires an installment agreement and is valid for well-qualified customers. Taxes are owed on the full device amount; see AT\u0026T for details. To put the deal in perspective, Amazon is running sales on the Apple Watch SE 2, which can be found for as low as $149, while the iPad 10th Generation is marked down to $249 when you clip an on-page coupon. Verizon Wireless The first is for the iPhone 16 Pro, where you can get up to four on Verizon. You have to trade in up to 4 select phones with new lines on Verizon's myPlan. The trade-ins must be from Apple, Google or Samsung. Plan options include Unlimited Ultimate, postpaid Unlimited Plus or the Unlimited Welcome plan at a minimum of $65 per month with AutoPay. The second offer is for a bundle of Apple products — all on Verizon. Get an iPhone 16 Pro with an iPad and Apple Watch with select phone trade-in and new line on myPlan. Any condition is accepted for the trade-in. A service plan is required for the iPad and Apple Watch, with the devices valued at up to $2,000. See Verizon for terms and conditions. Boost Mobile on Amazon If you don't have a device to trade in, the Boost Mobile offer on Amazon is worth checking out. You can score an iPhone 16 for $0.01 plus taxes on the full retail price at checkout. The offer requires activation and a 36-month financing plan through Boost Mobile. Like the offers from AT\u0026T and Verizon, terms and conditions apply.",
