  "text": "Tripsy, a popular app to help users plan and organize their trips, has just received another major update with some useful new features. The new version of the app makes it easier for users to check their expenses in different currencies and also to see nearby places on a map. What’s new with Trispy For those unfamiliar, Tripsy is a trip planner that “helps you plan your entire trip in one place.” You can share your itinerary with family and friends, receive flight alerts, and make wish lists of places to visit. The app also shows weather forecasts, flight information, and lets users store any documents needed for travel. Version 3.3 of the app adds some great new features, including Nearby Places. As the name suggests, this feature helps users see their list of places for a trip organized by distance on a map. You can tap on a place or even use your current location to see which places of interest are nearest in a circle. Another long-awaited feature coming with the update is currency conversion. Although the app already supported multiple currencies, it can now automatically convert your spending from one currency to another. “No matter how many different currencies appear in a trip, Tripsy will convert them to your preferred currency using real conversion rates based on your trip dates.” In addition, Tripsy now has custom categories, so you can create your own categories with a custom title, color and icon to save any activity or place on your trip. Custom categories are also visible to other users when you share a trip with them. Tripsy is availavle for free on the App Store, but some features require a subscription of $4.99 per month or $39.99 per year. There’s also a lifetime license available. It’s worth noting that the app can be used on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. The app was one of the 2024 App Store Awards finalists in the iPhone App of the Year category. More details about Tripsy can be found on its official website.
