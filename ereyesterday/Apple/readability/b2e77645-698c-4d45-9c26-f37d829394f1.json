The dust is barely starting to settle following the release of the iPhone 16e, and Apple is seemingly getting ready to introduce more hardware for consumers to buy. Those new items will probably be the M4 MacBook Air and a new iPad Air. There have been some signs of updates on the way, including a reduction of stocks of the current MacBook Air in preparation for the new models. According to Bloomberg on Sunday, it's also the case for the iPad Air. Apple will be imminently introducing the M4 MacBook Air, the report adds. While an exact release date is not provided by the publication, it is thought that it could occur within a few days. There is also a lack of timeline for the iPad Air, but Mark Gurman writes of expectations that the entry-level iPad could get an update at the same time as the Air line. This is not the first time that launches of both iPad Air and MacBook Air in early 2025 has been claimed. They have surfaced in rumors alluding to an early 2025 launch for each. Performance boostsThe MacBook Air update is expected to largely be a spec-bump upgrade, with the change in chip likely to be the main alteration. The same design and two sizes will be available as last time. The base M4 chip is likely to be used, saving the M4 Pro and M4 Max for the MacBook Pro lineup. An update to the webcam to an ultra-wide version, appearing in macOS code references, is also a strong possibility. The iPad Air is similarly anticipated to get the spec bump update treatment, but to the M3 chip rather than the M4. Product listings from a leaker showed M3 in relation to the 13-inch iPad Air, meaning it could keep the M4 for the current-gen iPad Pro line.",
