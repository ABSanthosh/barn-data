  "text": "If you’re a heavy Mastodon user (or were a Twitter user back in the good old days), you’re probably familiar with Tapbots – the company behind the popular Ivory and Tweetbot apps. The developers now have some good news to share with Bluesky users, as they announced this week that they’ve been working on a new app for the platform. New Bluesky app ‘Phoenix’ coming soon to the App Store Called “Phoenix,” the app will essentially be a Tweetbot or Ivory for Bluesky. The announcement was confirmed through a new page on the official Tapbots website. Unfortunately, there aren’t many details about the app for now, but presumably it will look just like its sister apps. After Twitter (now X) discontinued its API for third-party apps, Tweetbot was shut down. As a result, Tapbots created Ivory for those who wanted to have the same Tweetbot experience when using Mastodon. The developers note that they have no plans to abandon Ivory, but that their user base is now split between Mastodon and Bluesky. “Mastodon is our home on the social web and we will continue to invest our time there. Since the incredible growth of Bluesky in the past year, our customer base has become split between the two services and for us to continue to thrive as a company, we must support both. Unfortunately, we can’t survive on Mastodon alone,” says a note on the Tapbots website. While some users wanted a single app that supported both Mastodon and Bluesky, developers claim that keeping them separate will be better for the experience. They also say that users shouldn’t worry about the development of new features for Ivory. “It would be a lie if we said Ivory would be in full development while we are trying to get Phoenix up and running. However, we did not want to start Phoenix development until after we released Ivory v2.3. Once Phoenix is out the door, development will happen concurrently and both apps will get all the huge improvements we have planned throughout the apps.” Phoenix for Bluesky will be released this summer, with a limited public beta coming soon. In the meantime, you can try Ivory for Mastodon – it’s available on the App Store and costs $1.99 per month.
