  "text": "Apple's work to build its own 5G modem could keep MacBook users online without an iPhone, with the prospect of a wider rollout beyond iPhones and cellular iPads. The multi-year modem project has the main intention of replacing Qualcomm's modem for an in-house design. However, Apple is considering the possibility of using its modems beyond the currently cellular-equipped product lines. People familiar with the modem effort told Bloomberg of the modem, codenamed \"Sinope,\" which will be more tightly integrated with Apple's other hardware components. This could result in some obvious benefits including a thinner iPhone. However, Apple is said to be looking into whether it should add cellular connectivity to its Mac product line. The idea would result in a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro that could connect to the Internet over a mobile phone signal, but one built into the device itself. This idea would mean the MacBook could connect without needing to tether with other devices, such as an iPhone. It is reckoned that, if Apple does go down that path, it won't be before 2026. This is because Apple's second-generation modem will apparently be more suited to providing high speeds that a MacBook Pro user would want to use. The concepts go beyond the MacBook line, however. It is also proposed that the modem could be included in headsets, such as a future model of the Apple Vision Pro. Again, this would eliminate the need for an iPhone for tethering, and could allow for users to roam around while carrying around less equipment.",
