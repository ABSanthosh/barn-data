Laurene Powell Jobs and Eve Jobs | Image Credit: @evejobs on InstagramJobs' siblings, Reed and Erin, are expected to attend. It is not known whether her half-sister, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, will be present. Jobs is a Stanford graduate and professional equestrian. She is a model by profession, having modeled for brands including Coperni and Louis Vuitton. She has appeared in Vogue Japan and other publications. Interestingly enough, Eve nor her siblings are set to inherit any of her late father's wealth. Her mother, Laurene Powell Jobs, has publicly stated that she plans to use the fortune for philanthropic endeavors, rather than passing it on to her children.",
