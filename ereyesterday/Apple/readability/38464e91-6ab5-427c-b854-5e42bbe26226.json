Apple has determined that \"a very small percentage\" of iPhone 14 Plus units have a rear camera issue, and has launched a repair program to fix it. The company says that iPhone 14 Plus units manufactured between April 10 and April 28 of last year may have an issue with the rear camera. The problem prevents the device from showing a preview of the image when a photo is taken. Apple has launched a web page detailing the issue, and it allows users check their iPhone 14 Plus serial number to determine if they are eligible. If a unit is affected by the issue, Apple will fix the problem for free, regardless of the phone's warranty status. Users who have the problem will need to bring the iPhone 14 Plus to an Apple Authorized Service Provider or Apple retail store for the repair. Users who don't live near an AASP or store can request a mail-in option by contacting Apple Support. The program does not extend any existing warranty, but covers any affected iPhone 14 Plus models for up to three years from the original purchase date, according to the company web page. The iPhone 14 Plus was launched in September 2022, so this program will continue to cover any affected units until September 2025. If a user has already paid to have the camera issue repaired, they can contact Apple to request a refund on the cost of the repair.",
