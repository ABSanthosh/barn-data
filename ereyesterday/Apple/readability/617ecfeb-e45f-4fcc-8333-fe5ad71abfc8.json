  "description": "Macworld More often than not, a single monitor is not enough to get your work done, especially when you need to keep multiple apps up on the screen. Apple’s Studio Display is gorgeous, but it’s also absolutely expensive. A great alternative is the 27-inch 4K Dell UltraSharp which is only $435 right now, a 25 percent discount from its $580 MSRP and more than $1,100 less than Apple’s option. Rather than paying $1,599 for the Studio Display, you can get one of these gorgeous Dell monitors. If you have the budget, you can get multiples, especially since the newer MacBook models allow you to add quite a few monitors. Granted you’re not getting a camera, spatial audio, Thunderbolt, or 5K, but for the price, you won’t miss them. With 4K UHD resolution and high brightness, you’ll enjoy crystal-clear images, vibrant colors, and deep contrast. Whether you’re working, playing, or streaming content, you’ll have a fun time. Keep in mind that this monitor is better suited for everyday activities than any serious gaming because there’s a 60Hz refresh rate and 5ms GTG response time. But the Studio Display is only 60Hz as well, so you’re not missing anything there. However, you are gaining some flexibility, as Dell’s monitor comes with a stand that allows you to adjust its height, tilt, or swivel it. Apple only lets you tilt unless you pay even more. So go ahead and get yourself one (or two) of these $435 Dell UltraSharp 27-monitor monitors while they’re still 25 percent off at Amazon. Buy now at Amazon",
