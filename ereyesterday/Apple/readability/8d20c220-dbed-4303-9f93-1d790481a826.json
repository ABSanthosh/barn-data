Image: Ed Hardy/Cult of Mac In an indication that iPhone users are eager to try out Apple Intelligence, the iOS 18.1 install rate is twice as high as iOS 17.1 was a year ago, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook. The AI features in iOS 18.1 provide a big impetus for people to update their iPhones, Cook said Thursday during a quarterly earnings call with Wall Street analysts. iOS 18.1 install rate is double iOS 17.1 Apple Intelligence, a suite of software features that runs on iPhones, Macs and iPads, is AI done Apple’s way. Apple says it’s more personal, and more security-focused, than similar products. And because it requires a certain amount of processing power and RAM, it only runs on certain devices: the iPhone 16 lineup, iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, and Macs and iPads with Apple’s M-series chips. The company began the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence features this week. “Apple Intelligence introduces a new era for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, delivering brand-new experiences and tools that will transform what our users can accomplish,” Cook said Monday in a press release. “Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovation in AI and machine learning to put Apple’s generative models at the core of our devices, giving our users a personal intelligence system that is easy to use — all while protecting their privacy.” The gradual Apple Intelligence rollout drives iOS 18.1 updates Beyond saying the iOS 18.1 install rate is twice that of iOS 17.1, Cook didn’t provide any numbers. But double the install rate stands out as a huge jump. And it’s a solid indication that Apple Intelligence is a big draw for customers. The company released iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1 on Monday, featuring a handful of early ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features. Apple Intelligence software so far includes only a handful of offerings. Writing Tools improving and summarize text. A Clean Up tool offers a way to eliminate unwanted elements from photos. Smart summaries attempt to simplify dealing with notifications, messages and email. And a new, glowing Siri animation looks cool, if nothing else. Apple Intelligence will gain new features in iOS 18.2, set to launch in December. This update likely will prove even more popular because of image-generating features like Genmoji and Image Playground. “Apple Intelligence is generative AI in a way that only Apple can deliver, and we’re incredibly excited about its ability to enrich our users’ lives,” Cook said in the press release. A later update round of updates, likely arriving in early 2025, supposedly will supercharge Siri, Apple’s AI assistant.",
