Apple CEO Tim Cook says this all comes down to where Apple Intelligence is available, and where it isn't. In a recent chat with CNBC ahead of the company's earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook explained that regions where the company has rolled out its AI platform, Apple Intelligence, saw stronger iPhone 16 sales compared to areas that didn't have it. Tim Cook's remarks suggest that Apple Intelligence might have been a key factor in boosting iPhone 16 sales in markets where it's available. However, China has not yet seen the rollout of Apple Intelligence. \"During the December quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, the year-over-year performance in the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those markets where we had not rolled out Apple Intelligence,\" Cook said. Despite the absence, China remains central to Apple's growth plans, and its success there is often driven by hardware advancements and strong brand loyalty. What is Apple Intelligence?Apple's approach to AI is famously understated compared to rivals like Google, but it's clearly making a difference. Apple Intelligence is working behind the scenes to improve the iPhone experience — think smarter Siri interactions, better photo editing suggestions, or even personalized app recommendations. This restrained approach fits Apple's style. Unlike some of its competitors that loudly market AI features, Apple tends to embed them into its ecosystem quietly, letting the technology work for itself. Based on Cook's comments, this strategy is resonating with customers and giving the iPhone 16 lineup an edge in competitive markets. Why AI matters nowThe timing is no coincidence. AI is dominating the tech industry, and companies are rushing to integrate it into everything. Google's Pixel phones have made a name for themselves with AI-powered features like real-time translation and ridiculously good camera software. Apple, meanwhile, has been more careful, rolling out features that integrate deeply with its devices. Apple Vision ProFor the iPhone 16, Apple Intelligence enhances the experience in ways that may not be immediately obvious but still make an impact. The phone's new hardware — like better cameras and longer battery life — gets a boost from these AI-powered features. Apple's strategy of selectively launching Apple Intelligence in certain markets feels like a trial run. The company often takes this kind of gradual approach, whether it's rolling out new technologies or expanding product features. Ultimately, Apple's take on AI feels true to its brand: practical, polished, and focused on the user. As AI continues to shape the tech world, Apple's ability to seamlessly integrate it into its ecosystem could set it apart in a big way.",
