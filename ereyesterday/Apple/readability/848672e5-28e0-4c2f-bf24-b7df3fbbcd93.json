  "text": "The Brazilian antitrust regulator has been investigating Apple for imposing anti-competitive terms and conditions on the App Store. Although the company was given more time to make its case after a judge overturned an injunction against the App Store last year, Apple will now have to face a public hearing in Brazil on the case. Apple’s App Store faces antitrust scrutiny in Brazil As reported by Estadão (via MacMagazine), the Brazilian antitrust regulator (Cade) will hold a public hearing next week to discuss “aspects of competition” related to the iOS ecosystem. Since Android is also being investigated by Cade, Google will also have to participate in the public hearing. Cade says that the hearing aims to find ways to “deal with digital markets” and the “growing number of complaints about violations of economic order” related to mobile devices and their operating systems. The report mentions that companies such as Match (owner of Tinder) and Epic Games, known for its dispute against Apple over Fortnite, have filed complaints with the Brazilian regulator against both Apple and Google. Representatives from Match and Epic are likely to attend the public hearing. When it comes to Apple, Cade’s investigation began after Latin American e-commerce giant Mercado Libre accused Apple of forcing developers offering digital goods or services in their apps to use Apple’s own payment system. Cade is also investigating Apple for the practice of “tying” by imposing anti-competitive terms and conditions on iOS. In November 2024, Cade ruled that Apple can no longer prevent developers from selling content and distributing apps outside the App Store in Brazil. The company would have 20 days to comply with Brazil’s antitrust legislation, otherwise it would be fined more than $40,000 a day. Apple appealed the decision and a judge ruled that the injunction was unnecessary, giving the company more time to discuss the case. The trial is expected to take place in the next few months, and if Apple loses, it will have to change how the App Store works in Brazil. In a related note, the report also mentions that the Brazilian government aims to regulate other big techs like Meta and Amazon in the future. This comes after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose higher tariffs on products imported from Brazil.
