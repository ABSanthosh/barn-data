Both are now available at steep discounts. An Amazon deal knocks 39% off the PlugBug 50W with built-in Find My, while the ButterFly foldable wireless charger price drops by 34%. This post contains affiliate links. Cult of Mac may earn a commission when you use our links to buy items. Get a great travel adapter deal No one who travels regularly should bring their everyday wall charger with them on trips. There’s too much risk it’ll get left behind. Eventually, either you’ll arrive at your hotel and realize you don’t have a charger with you, or you’ll get home and discover your charger is still plugged into a wall at the hotel. That’s the brilliance of travel chargers. Keep one in your luggage, and it’ll always be there when you get to your destination. Enough goes wrong when traveling that you can’t risk standing in a hotel room looking at your iPhone battery at 5% and realizing there’s nothing you can do about it. The risk is low for those who travel once or twice a year, but if you’re on the road once or twice a month, or even multiple times a quarter, you really need a travel adapter. Happily, I recently reviewed two genius options from Twelve South: the PlugBug and the ButterFly. And right now, you can grab deals on both of these fantastic travel adapters. You might even consider combining a ButterFly with a PlugBug for an outstanding travel charging setup. Twelve South Plugbug Keeping a charger in your luggage doesn’t save you from accidentally leaving it behind in the hotel room when you head home — it’s easy with the charger hidden behind the bedside table. But it’s nearly impossible to forget the Twelve South PlugBug because your iPhone sends you an alert if you forget the accessory. The PlugBug comes with Apple’s Find My tech built in. This was originally intended to help you find your lost keys, but it’ll also alert you if you get too far away from a Find My-compatible device. So if you’re checking out in the hotel lobby, you get a reminder that the PlugBug is still back up in your room. It includes a pair of USB-C ports and puts out 50W, which is enough for a MacBook and an iPhone. I wrote a review with many more details and tests. Ordinarily, Twelve South PlugBug sells for $69.99. However, with this Amazon deal on the travel adapter, you can get it for just $42.99. That’s a 39% savings. Buy it from: Amazon Built-in Find My! Twelve South PlugBug - 2-Port 4.5 Charge up to two USB-C powered devices simultaneously with dynamic charging up to 50W. With folding prongs, the PlugBug is perfect for compact travel,But the standout feature is that the PlugBug works with the Apple Find My app, so you can easily locate it using your Apple device.   Pros:Provides plenty of power for iPhone or MacBookPortableFind My support is brilliant Cons:Audible alarm could be louder Twelve South ButterFly No one wants to carry too much bulky gear on the road, but you must bring a charger. Twelve South’s ButterFly travel adapter is about the size of an AirPods charging case but opens to reveal charging mats that let you wirelessly juice up an iPhone and Apple Watch at the same time. It’s a brilliant design — simple but highly functional. The aluminum exterior is both rugged and matches the look of Apple devices. And the ButterFly even does double duty as an iPhone stand. Plus, it comes with the necessary wall charger and international power adapters. I tested and reviewed this travel adapter, too. And now it goes with me on every trip. The usual cost for a Twelve South ButterFly is $129.95, but a current Amazon deal knocks the price of the travel adapter way down to $85.99. Save yourself 34%. Buy it from: Amazon Unique design Butterfly 2-in-1 foldable wireless travel charger 5.0 The ButterFly 2 in 1 charging station is the size of an AirPods Pro case, but unfold it to charge your iPhone and Apple Watch or AirPods. Crafted with an anodized aluminum shell and vegan leather, the ButterFly charger matches the color and curvature of your MacBook.The charger doubles as a hands-free display stand for your iPhone, and the magnetic Watch charger can be tilted vertically for Nightstand Mode.The accessory comes with a USB-C cable, USB-C power adapter, four international plug adapters and a travel bag. Pros:Brilliant design is both portable and elegantCharges iPhone, Apple watch and AirPods",
