Let’s check them out. AirTags are very useful personal trackers that have myriad uses from keeping an eye on your dog, cat, luggage, backpack, purse, car keys, package, bike, or just about whatever else you might want to track with the Find My network. With an AirTag 4-pack coming in at just $65 ($16 per AirTag), this is quite a deal, down from the $99 retail price. Try them out yourself! AirTags – 4-pack – $65 (down from $99) Apple Watch Series 10 – $299 (down from $399) Apple Watch Series 10 features an always-on 42mm display, sleep tracking, fitness tracking, activity tracking, step counter, heart rate monitor, ECG, crash detection with emergency SOS, fall detection with emergency SOS, ovulation tracking, GPS, water resistance, all day battery life, voice control, pinch gestures, Siri commands, and more.
