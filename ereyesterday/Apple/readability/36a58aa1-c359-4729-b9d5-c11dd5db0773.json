It’s designed for busy people who want to make steady progress without carving out hours each day. MosaLingua’s lessons are short and to the point, with most taking just 10 minutes to complete. Its advanced tools make learning a new language fun. And instead of sitting down for a whole language session, you can brush up whenever you have time. Sound bueno? Right now, you can secure a lifetime subscription to MosaLingua for just $97.99 (regularly $4,085). AI language learning app MosaLingua: A smarter, faster way to learn Learning a new language can be incredibly useful (and incredibly fun). The problem is, learning that language can be incredibly difficult, especially when you have a million other responsibilities to juggle. If you want to try a new way of learning a second (or third, or fourth) language, check out AI language learning app MosaLingua. The learning method is based on spaced repetition and other science-backed strategies that help you retain vocabulary and build fluency over time. Instead of memorizing long word lists, you focus on useful, everyday language you’ll actually use. What languages can you learn? This lifetime subscription to the MosaLingua AI language learning app gives you access to 11 languages — English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Arabic. You also receive any new languages MosaLingua adds in the future, at no extra cost. You can jump between languages or stick with one. And you can always go at your own pace, any time and any place. You can access your lessons in your web browser (including Safari on a Mac), on iOS and Android devices, and on Macs as well as Windows PCs. (Download lessons in advance if you want to practice offline.) Advanced tools make fluency fun MosaLingua differs from other language learning apps due to the practicality of its lessons. MosaChat-AI acts as a virtual tutor, helping you improve writing and speaking through real feedback. There’s also a whole lot less pressure when you’re talking to AI than if you were talking to a real live native speaker. MosaDiscovery, another tool built into this AI language learning app, lets you learn directly from content you already enjoy, like YouTube videos or news articles, by turning them into vocabulary-building tools.
