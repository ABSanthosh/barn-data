  "text": "Apple Intelligence was announced with iOS 18 and has been available since last October, when Apple released iOS 18.1 to the public. Although most apps provide support for Apple Intelligence features by default, developers can choose not to have them in their apps – and it seems that Meta has decided to do so. As reported by the Brazilian blog Sorcererhat Tech, features such as Writing Tools – which lets users create, change, and proofread text with Apple Intelligence – are no longer available in any of Meta’s apps, including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Threads. Typically, iPhone and iPad users can access Writing Tools by tapping on a text field. However, in Meta’s iOS apps, the option is not available. Meta apps also don’t let users create and share Genmoji, Apple’s custom emoji generated by AI. The report notes that Meta has also removed the ability to add keyboard stickers and Memoji to Instagram Stores – something that was possible before. Unsurprisingly, Meta doesn’t give any details about why Apple Intelligence isn’t available in its iOS apps. But if we had to guess, the company probably wants to motivate people to use Meta AI instead of alternatives like Apple Intelligence. Meta AI is available in pretty much all of Meta’s apps and also lets users create and change text, as well as generate images. A WSJ report last year revealed that Apple and Meta had discussed a potential partnership that would bring Llama, Meta’s AI language model, to Apple Intelligence. However, Apple reportedly decided to scrap the deal because it didn’t agree with the company’s privacy policies. Apple and Meta also frequently fight each other over App Store guidelines. Unfortunately for iOS users, this means that they can’t take advantage of Apple Intelligence in some of the most popular apps in the world. Hopefully the company will change its approach in the future.
