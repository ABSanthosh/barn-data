  "description": "Macworld Remembering the numerous passwords we use on a daily basis can be a real pain. Whether it’s logging into Amazon to order a new book, checking your online banking or settling down to watch something on Netflix, seeing the log-in box appear can make your heart sink. Then there’s the fact that each site seems to require a different length or combination of certain characters, meaning you need different ones for nearly every site or service (which, sadly, is also a good idea). How are our limited human brains supposed to store all these weird strings of letters, numbers and special characters? All I want to do is stream Star Trek: The Next Generation for the 50th time, not prove my intellectual prowess! Password managers can help you manage all your passwords and login information across your Mac, iPhone, iPad and other Apple devices. Apple offers iCloud Keychain, but is that the best password manager for Mac and iPhone, or is there another password manager for Apple devices that would do a better job. PROMOTIONRoboForm Premium: Just $0.99/Month! Secure your passwords with RoboForm Premium—now only $0.99/month, a massive 60% off! Exclusive to Macworld readers. Offer ends soon. Grab it today! $11.90/yr at RoboForm These carry the burden of remembering everything for you, as you just have to create one master password, after which the app takes care of logging into all other accounts. They even make recommendations for really secure passwords, so you don’t rely on the mixture of your birthday and the name of your first pet. Having only a single login to remember? That sounds good to us. Need some help coming up with a safe and secure password? Read our tips to make your passwords even stronger. Updated with details of Apple’s Password app. How password managers work The idea of password managers is to simplify the way you access your various accounts. Instead of having to memorize multiple complex passwords for each of the services you use you need only recall one password – or provide a fingerprint or Face ID – and the password manager will automatically fill in the required details for you. Just remember this is only as safe as the password you use to unlock access to all your passwords – so don’t lock them all behind an easy-to-guess password, like your pet’s name. The password managers also offer various other features. For example, they can generate random, highly secure passwords for your accounts, they can warn you if your password has been compromised, and some can advise you about existing insecure passwords and support your efforts to update them. Obviously, security is a high priority—as the manager apps have the virtual keys to your kingdom—which is why all of the options listed below use high-grade encryption to protect your details. Many also feature digital wallets so your bank details can be safely stored and used to make purchases online without having to root around in your pocket or bag for the card number and expiry date. A good Password Manager makes it easy to use strong, unique passwords everywhere on the web, no matter what platform or browser you happen to use. But to get the most out of them, you need to pay a subscription fee. Do you need a password manager? Is Apple’s Password app enough? Now that Apple has its own standalone Passwords app (which arrived in iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia) do you need another Password Manager? As you will see from our review below, and our full review of Apple’s Passwords app, most users can replace their paid password manager with Apple’s free solution. Most people don’t use a password manager at all, so getting them in the door this way is a good thing – and Apple Passwords is definitely good enough for most everyday users. The problems arise if you are trying to switching from an existing Password Manager. Indeed, the biggest annoyance we ran into was making the switch and getting everything transferred over, as you can see if you read: Apple’s free Passwords app can replace your paid password manager (kinda). If you just love your current password manager and use it to connect to multiple platforms and browsers, it may well be worth continuing to pay its subscription fee. If you’re thinking of switching to save the fee for your existing password manager, by all means move, just expect it to take a little time.

Best Password Managers for Mac and iPhone Apple Passwords – Best For Basics Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Free View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Free at Apple Apple’s Passwords app works well enough for the basic functions most of us rely on. It stores and fills login passwords, Wi-Fi passwords, 2FA codes, and passkeys. It warns you of easy-to-guess passwords, reused passwords, and passwords that appeared in major data breaches. It’s also relatively easy to securely share passwords with others. Apple also provides its own suggested passwords for new signups. It doesn’t give you much in the way of other features–stored credit card and identification info to autofill in forms, secure document storage or notes, and so on. Apple has other apps that do those things in encrypted ways, but if you use other platforms and browsers, this information is not easily available. Increasing the font size on the 2FA codes by a few points would help. There’s text at the top of the Codes screen that shows you how long until the codes reset, but it scrolls off the top of the screen when you scroll down your list–it should stay anchored at the top of the screen. Apple’s Passwords app gets the job done and is fine for the bulk of Apple users who don’t regularly use other platforms or browsers. If you use the required extrensions it will even work for those who use Chrome, Edge – and even Windows.

All of which can be instantly called up to fill out online forms or checkout from websites and apps. Security is front and center, with 1Password boasting AES end-to-end encryption so only you will hold the key to your account. It also uses the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol, which allows you to authenticate your details to a site without the information being sent to a server which could compromise security. A feature called Watchtower analyzes the overall strength of your online security and warns you if passwords are repeated or vulnerable. There’s also a password generator if you want to replace your tired old attempts with something a bit more secure. A free 14-day trial is available, but after that, you’ll need to move on to a paid subscription that starts at $36 (approx £29) per year. For this, you’ll be able to use the software on as many devices as you like, including macOS, Windows, ChromeOS, and Linux, plus the accompanying iPhone and Android apps. 1Password has won numerous awards and is an easy service to recommend.

The app analyses your current passwords to see how secure they are and gives you an overall rating based on how often you reuse login details for multiple sites. Password monitoring will check if any of your details have been exposed in data breaches or have been reused too many times. There’s also a feature to auto-replace passwords instantly with ones generated by Dashlane. It’s not only your account details that you can store in Dashlane, you can store bank details, your address and important documents like your passport and driving licence. There’s also a section for any secure notes you wish to keep safe. The app also supports Passkeys, which are the latest innovation which seem set to replace passwords in the long run. All your transactions between the app and sites are end-to-end encrypted using 256-bit AES technology. There’s also 2-factor authentication available, with the Dashlane app acting as an authenticator, and you get a VPN service as part of the paid tiers. Dashlane is available on a wide range of platforms, with dedicated apps for iOS/iPadOS and Android, plus extensions for Chrome, Safari, Edge and Firefox. Dashlane costs $59.99 (approx £48) per year for the individual account. There is a free tier available, which acts as a taster for the full package, and you can use it indefinitely, but with a limit of only 25 passwords. Read our full Dashlane review Bitwarden – Best Free Password Manager Price When Reviewed: Free tier; From $1 per month (approx 80p), $10 a year (approx £8) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Bitwarden Premium (annually) $10 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $10 at Bitwarden Premium (annually) When it comes to technology, we often say that you get what you pay for, but in the case of Bitwarden, this isn’t quite true. The service offers a really impressive range of capabilities on its free tier, so with this app, you get what you don’t pay for!  Without signing up for a premium account you get unlimited storage for passwords, credit cards, notes, and online account IDs, secure text messaging with individuals, a secure password generator, two-factor authentication, plus the ability to either have your data stored on the Bitwarden servers or one you host yourself. Oh, and you can sync all your devices, rather than the single one offered by most other free tiers.  Should you want to expand the features, then the Premium tier costs $10 (approx £8) per year and adds secure file sharing, 1GB of encrypted file attachments, additional two-factor authentication options, password safety analysis, and access to your account by family if you die or become sick. Encryption is high-grade stuff, with Bitwarden deploying end-to-end AES-256 bit encryption, salted hashing, and PBKDF2 SHA-256, all of which are down locally on your machine.  Apps are available on a wide range of platforms, including macOS, Windows, Linux, pretty much every browser you can think of, Android, and iOS, and there’s even a secure web version if you find yourself without your device.  If you’re looking for value when it comes to password managers, it’s very hard to look past Bitwarden.  NordPass – Easy To Use Password Manager Price When Reviewed: Free 30-day trial; $2.99 per month (currently $1.49), $35.88 a year (currently $35.76 for two years) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price NordPass (first two years) $35.76 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $35.76 at NordPass (first two years) One of the newest additions to the password manager arena is NordPass, which is made by the same fine fellows at NordVPN. The latter is one of our favorite VPNs, as you’ll see from our Best VPN for Mac roundup. NordPass offers full desktop apps for macOS, Windows, and Linux, plus the standard iOS and Android offerings. You can also use NordPass through browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave, Edge, and Safari.  NordPass has all the features you’d expect from a modern password manager, with quick importing of existing passwords from other services, zero-knowledge architecture, local encryption, 2-factor authentication, password generation, and secure storage for credit details and notes. There’s of course autofill for logging into accounts, folders to store passwords for work, home or other classifications, security monitoring for password hacks, support for biometrics, plus a neat interface to manage all of your various data. NordPass offers a decent free tier, which supports unlimited passwords, stores credit card details, and secure notes, plus has the ability to sync across all your devices. The main drawback is that you can only be logged into one device at a time. But if you can work with that it’s a service you should definitely investigate. The paid tiers start at $35.88/£28.68 p/a for a single Premium account, but there are frequent deals (currently $35.76/£28.56 for two years). Read our full NordPass review Roboform – A solid password manager Price When Reviewed: $29.97 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price RoboForm (annually) $11.90 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $11.90 at RoboForm (annually) RoboForm works across iPhone, iPad and Macs, plus you can use it on Windows and Linux as well as Android. Set up is simple. Download the relevant app or extension, then sign up for an account. There’s a free trial that gives you access to the Premium tier features for 14-days, then you can either continue to use it for free on the limited tier or sign up to a fully-functional paid variety. As well as passwords you can store personal details (e.g. address and phone number), your passport, driving license and other sensitive data. You can import your existing login details from other services or your browser. The Mac interface is a little basic–the desktop client looks like a Finder window. On iPhone, the main page has buttons along the bottom that allow you to navigate between Identity (passport, etc.), the built-in Browser, Authenticator, Tools section, secure share, and Emergency Access feature (for family, should something happen to you). The browser version features Roboform’s one-click login where you select the site from your logins or history that you want to access and Roboform opens the page and automatically log into your account. Most people will probably stick with their normal browser, in which case Roboform acts like any other password manager, prompting you with stored account details when you attempt to login. The password generator does a good job of helping you choose new passwords. You can select the number of characters, numbers, symbols, upper or lower case, and create passphrases. There’s a built-in authenticator and Roboform can handle two-factor authentication. You can also use passkeys instead of passwords. There’s a Security Centre that analyses your password integrity. This includes how many times you’ve used the same ones, how complex they are, and if they’ve been involved in hacks. Everything you do is end-to-end encrypted via AES 256-bit encryption, with PBKDF2 SHA256. Roboform offers a limited free tier (one device with unlimited passwords). The Premium tier (which used to be called Roboform Everywhere), adds the security center, access on all your devices, customer support, and web access to your account. It’s available for $29.98/£29.99 p/a but at the time we reviewed it there was a deal for $11.90 a year. Read our full RoboForm Premium review Keeper – Best Of The Rest Price When Reviewed: Free tier; From $2.29 per month, $34.99 a year Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Keeper Security (annually) $34.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $34.99 at Keeper Security (annually) Keeper can store unlimited passwords, auto-generate strong new ones, and sync passwords across multiple devices, all while holding credit card details and other important payment details in its secure vault. There’s also support for Passkeys, which is good. AES 256-bit encryption is all performed locally, so Keeper can never know your details, but there is the option to securely share folders and passwords with friends and family if they need to access any of your accounts. The included secure messaging service is also useful for communicating these requests There’s also support for Touch ID on the Mac and iPhone, with the latter also working with Face ID, plus Apple Watch compatibility and the option of using two-step authentication. Keeper Unlimited Password Manager is available from $34.99/£24.99 per year, but there is a free tier that is limited to one device and ten passwords. LastPass Price When Reviewed: Free tier (one device); $3 per month, $36 per year Best Prices Today: Retailer Price LastPass (annually) $36 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $36 at LastPass (annually) LastPass is probably one of the best-known password manager, thanks to it being one of the original pioneers in the field, however, in recent years it’s lost its crown after being hit with several hacks, including at least one that stole encrypted customer data. This recent history makes it harder to recommend. Not that security measures aren’t there, the company explains that it uses “AES 256-bit encryption with PBKDF2 SHA-256 and salted hashes to ensure complete security in the cloud.” The app does all of its encryption locally, so LastPass never knows your master password, and the Premium tier also supports a form of two-factor authentication for another layer of security. You can either use LastPass locally on your device via dedicated apps (macOS, iOS and iPadOS), or via the web with plugins and extensions available for Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Microsoft Edge all of which allow you to automatically access login details for sites and accounts or have LastPass autofill the login fields on your behalf.  Just like with other managers you have access to a vault where all of your passwords are stored, and these can be changed to more complex alternatives at the touch of a button. LastPass will also advise you on how secure your passwords are for your existing accounts. Getting set up is easy too, as you can import existing passwords from web browsers, email, and other password managers. One drawback is that, at the time of writing, LastPass doesn’t yet support Passkeys, although the company says that the features is on its way. The app offers a digital wallet to store your card details, plus another area for official ID such as passports and driving licenses. The Note section is a place where you can keep Wi-Fi passwords, insurance details and any other important documents that you need to access. It’s also possible to securely share account details and logins with friends and family, even if they don’t have LastPass.  There is a free tier, although this is limited to one device, so if you want to sync across your Mac and iPhone you’ll need to move up to the Premium tier. At the time of writing, this will cost $36/£31.99 per year. Those wanting more scope can opt for the family plan which includes six user accounts and only costs $48/£40.80 per year. One of the advantages of a paid plan is an Emergency backup which means that, should you suffer an accident or even pass away, your family will be given access to your account. Read our full LastPass review Enpass Price When Reviewed: Free tier; From $1.99 per month, $23.99 a year Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Enpass (annually) $23.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $23.99 at Enpass (annually) Those looking for a simple, secure solution that doesn’t break the bank would do well to consider Enpass. The macOS client is completely free, but if you want to add the same features to your iPhone or Android device then you’ll need to move to the Enpass Premium tier that costs $23.99/£19.49 per year. If you prefer to buy a lifetime license, you can pick one up for $99.99/£82.99.  Enpass doesn’t store any of your information on its servers. Instead, everything is encrypted and kept on your personal device so you never lose control of your data. Details can be synced securely via iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box, or ownCloud/WebDAV, to keep all of your devices in step. You still have the classic features of other password managers, such as auto-fill forms, security analysis of your passwords and generating complex replacements easily, secure storage for sensitive information, passkey support, and AES 256-bit encryption, plus support for iOS, Android, and Apple Watch devices. There are plenty of fine-tuning options for those who are a little bit more hands-on, but we like the no-nonsense approach and the fact that your data never leaves your device.",

The browser version features Roboform’s one-click login where you select the site from your logins or history that you want to access and Roboform opens the page and automatically log into your account. Most people will probably stick with their normal browser, in which case Roboform acts like any other password manager, prompting you with stored account details when you attempt to login. The password generator does a good job of helping you choose new passwords. You can select the number of characters, numbers, symbols, upper or lower case, and create passphrases. There’s a built-in authenticator and Roboform can handle two-factor authentication. You can also use passkeys instead of passwords. There’s a Security Centre that analyses your password integrity. This includes how many times you’ve used the same ones, how complex they are, and if they’ve been involved in hacks. Everything you do is end-to-end encrypted via AES 256-bit encryption, with PBKDF2 SHA256. Roboform offers a limited free tier (one device with unlimited passwords). The Premium tier (which used to be called Roboform Everywhere), adds the security center, access on all your devices, customer support, and web access to your account. It’s available for $29.98/£29.99 p/a but at the time we reviewed it there was a deal for $11.90 a year. Read our full RoboForm Premium review Keeper – Best Of The Rest Price When Reviewed: Free tier; From $2.29 per month, $34.99 a year Keeper can store unlimited passwords, auto-generate strong new ones, and sync passwords across multiple devices, all while holding credit card details and other important payment details in its secure vault. There’s also support for Passkeys, which is good. AES 256-bit encryption is all performed locally, so Keeper can never know your details, but there is the option to securely share folders and passwords with friends and family if they need to access any of your accounts. The included secure messaging service is also useful for communicating these requests There’s also support for Touch ID on the Mac and iPhone, with the latter also working with Face ID, plus Apple Watch compatibility and the option of using two-step authentication. Keeper Unlimited Password Manager is available from $34.99/£24.99 per year, but there is a free tier that is limited to one device and ten passwords. LastPass Price When Reviewed: Free tier (one device); $3 per month, $36 per year LastPass is probably one of the best-known password manager, thanks to it being one of the original pioneers in the field, however, in recent years it’s lost its crown after being hit with several hacks, including at least one that stole encrypted customer data. This recent history makes it harder to recommend. Not that security measures aren’t there, the company explains that it uses “AES 256-bit encryption with PBKDF2 SHA-256 and salted hashes to ensure complete security in the cloud.” The app does all of its encryption locally, so LastPass never knows your master password, and the Premium tier also supports a form of two-factor authentication for another layer of security. You can either use LastPass locally on your device via dedicated apps (macOS, iOS and iPadOS), or via the web with plugins and extensions available for Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Microsoft Edge all of which allow you to automatically access login details for sites and accounts or have LastPass autofill the login fields on your behalf.  Just like with other managers you have access to a vault where all of your passwords are stored, and these can be changed to more complex alternatives at the touch of a button. LastPass will also advise you on how secure your passwords are for your existing accounts. Getting set up is easy too, as you can import existing passwords from web browsers, email, and other password managers. One drawback is that, at the time of writing, LastPass doesn’t yet support Passkeys, although the company says that the features is on its way. The app offers a digital wallet to store your card details, plus another area for official ID such as passports and driving licenses. The Note section is a place where you can keep Wi-Fi passwords, insurance details and any other important documents that you need to access. It’s also possible to securely share account details and logins with friends and family, even if they don’t have LastPass.  There is a free tier, although this is limited to one device, so if you want to sync across your Mac and iPhone you’ll need to move up to the Premium tier. At the time of writing, this will cost $36/£31.99 per year. Those wanting more scope can opt for the family plan which includes six user accounts and only costs $48/£40.80 per year. One of the advantages of a paid plan is an Emergency backup which means that, should you suffer an accident or even pass away, your family will be given access to your account. Read our full LastPass review Enpass Price When Reviewed: Free tier; From $1.99 per month, $23.99 a year Those looking for a simple, secure solution that doesn’t break the bank would do well to consider Enpass. The macOS client is completely free, but if you want to add the same features to your iPhone or Android device then you’ll need to move to the Enpass Premium tier that costs $23.99/£19.49 per year. If you prefer to buy a lifetime license, you can pick one up for $99.99/£82.99.  Enpass doesn’t store any of your information on its servers. Instead, everything is encrypted and kept on your personal device so you never lose control of your data. Details can be synced securely via iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box, or ownCloud/WebDAV, to keep all of your devices in step. You still have the classic features of other password managers, such as auto-fill forms, security analysis of your passwords and generating complex replacements easily, secure storage for sensitive information, passkey support, and AES 256-bit encryption, plus support for iOS, Android, and Apple Watch devices. There are plenty of fine-tuning options for those who are a little bit more hands-on, but we like the no-nonsense approach and the fact that your data never leaves your device.

Instead of having to memorize multiple complex passwords for each of the services you use you need only recall one password – or provide a fingerprint or Face ID – and the password manager will automatically fill in the required details for you. Just remember this is only as safe as the password you use to unlock access to all your passwords – so don’t lock them all behind an easy-to-guess password, like your pet’s name.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe password managers also offer various other features. For example, they can generate random, highly secure passwords for your accounts, they can warn you if your password has been compromised, and some can advise you about existing insecure passwords and support your efforts to update them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, security is a high priority—as the manager apps have the virtual keys to your kingdom—which is why all of the options listed below use high-grade encryption to protect your details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany also feature digital wallets so your bank details can be safely stored and used to make purchases online without having to root around in your pocket or bag for the card number and expiry date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA good Password Manager makes it easy to use strong, unique passwords everywhere on the web, no matter what platform or browser you happen to use. But to get the most out of them, you need to pay a subscription fee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"do-you-need-a-password-manager-is-apples-password-app-enough\"\u003eDo you need a password manager?
