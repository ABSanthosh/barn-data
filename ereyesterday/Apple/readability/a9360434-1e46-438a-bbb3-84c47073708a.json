  "text": "Apple has revealed that the winners of the 2025 Swift Student Challenge will be announced on March 27, with the best among them set to receive a trip to Apple Park. The Swift Student Challenge is an annual event that encourages up-and-coming student developers to practice their craft and win prizes. Participants must be over 13, enrolled in an academic institution or homeschool equivalent, and not employed as full-time developers. Participants are required to submit an interactive app playground scene that can be experienced within a three-minute timeframe. The submission must function without an internet connection and cannot be larger than 25MB. Apple evaluates the submitted app playground scenes based on set criteria, including creativity, social impact, and inclusivity. Just as it did in 2024, the company will choose a total of 350 winners of its Swift Student Challenge. The top prize is an all-inclusive three-day trip to Apple Park. Out of the 350 winners, 50 will be classified as \"Distinguished Winners,\" whose outstanding submissions will need to demonstrate excellence and outstanding creativity, among other things. All 350 challenge winners will be rewarded with a free one-year membership to the Apple Developer program, an opportunity to take the Swift certification exam, and AirPods Max. They will also receive a personalized certificate from Apple. The submission window for the 2025 Swift Student Challenge opened on February 3, as was announced previously. The challenge itself was launched back in 2020, and Apple often profiles some of the winners, as was the case in 2024. Winners of the 2025 Swift Student Challenge will be announced on March 27, while Apple's Worldwide Developers' Conference (WWDC) will begin with a keynote video on June 9.",
