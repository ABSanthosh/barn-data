CULVER CITY, CALIFORNIA As Apple Music marks its 10th anniversary this year, Apple unveils its most ambitious creative project to date: a brand-new state-of-the-art studio space in Los Angeles dedicated to artist-driven content, innovation in audio, and deeper fan connection. Opening this summer, the new studio represents a major milestone in Apple’s continued mission to support artists at every level by giving them the tools, platform, and creative freedom to tell their stories in entirely new ways. More than just a studio in the traditional sense, the new space is a creative campus that reflects a decade of Apple Music’s commitment to high-quality sound, authentic storytelling, and artist-first experiences. “Apple Music Radio has always been a home for storytelling and artistry, serving as a space for bold conversations and surprising moments,” said Rachel Newman, Apple Music’s co-head. “With this new studio, we are furthering our commitment to creating a space for artists to create, connect, and share their vision.” A Creative Ecosystem Built for Artists Designed with artists in mind, Apple Music’s new studio space in Los Angeles is a three-story, over-15,000-square-foot facility that includes: Two advanced radio studios with immersive Spatial Audio playback and adaptable setups for live interviews, casual chats, or impromptu performances. A 4,000-square-foot soundstage for live performances, multicam shoots, fan events, and screenings. A dedicated Spatial Audio mixing room outfitted with a 9.2.4 PMC speaker system for next-level sound production. A photo and social media lab, edit room, and green room to support real-time content creation. Private isolation booths for songwriting, podcasting, and one-on-one interviews. The A-List Corridor and Archive Corridor, showcasing images and artwork of unforgettable moments from Apple Music’s past and present. A corridor features framed photos of musicians hanging on the wall. The Apple Music logo. Designed with artists in mind, the new Los Angeles studio is a three-story, over-15,000-square-foot facility.

Global Vision, Local Roots Apple Music’s new Los Angeles studio will anchor a global network of creative hubs already active in places including New York, Tokyo, Berlin, Paris, and Nashville, with additional studios coming soon. With this launch, the service continues to innovate, not just in how music is streamed, but also in how it’s made, experienced, and shared. From radio to live performance, to fan engagement and content creation, this new studio will serve as a creative home for the next decade of music. The LA hub includes two advanced radio studios with immersive Spatial Audio playback and adaptable setups for live interviews, casual chats, or impromptu performances. The Power of Apple Music Radio Since its inception, Apple Music Radio has been a defining feature of the service, a place where fans and artists meet in real time. From global premieres and intimate interviews, to in-depth specials and surprise performances, Apple Music Radio has distinguished itself through expertly curated, artist-led storytelling that makes listeners feel closer to the music they love. Apple Music Radio streams 24/7 and is available for free around the world. “When we first launched Beats 1 it was a leap of faith, the first live global radio station for a digital world,” said Zane Lowe. “We knew we wanted to build something special where artists could come and tell their stories and fans could feel connected. Ten years on, Apple Music Radio is everything we hoped it would be. It’s a place where we can eventize music, a place where music comes first, always. I’m just as excited for what’s to come as I was on day one.” To celebrate the 10-year milestone, Apple Music Radio will feature a week of specials and live programming, kicking off with “Don’t Be Boring: The Birth of Apple Music Radio with Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden” on June 30, from 6 to 8 a.m. PST. From the early days of launching radio on streaming, to the epic artist-led shows that defined a new era, Zane, Ebro, and special guests will reminisce about the last 10 years of Apple Music Radio. Then, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. PST, listeners can tune in to the “10 Years of Apple Music” special. This eight-hour broadcast event on Apple Music 1 will tell the stories of the greatest artist moments, exclusive releases, live events, and cultural milestones that only Apple could deliver. The day will culminate with “Live: 10 Years Of Apple Music” from 4 to 7 p.m. PST. The live broadcast, hosted by Zane and Ebro, celebrates a decade of Apple Music with a lineup of artists who have shaped the trajectory of the service. Listeners can tune in at apple.co/_Radio. Additionally, Apple Music Radio will unveil the service’s top 500 most-streamed songs from the last 10 years in a special countdown beginning on Tuesday, July 1. Tune in to count down 100 songs a day, culminating with Apple Music’s top 100 most-streamed songs of all time on July 5, when the full 10 Years of Apple Music: Top Songs playlist will be available to stream. Apple Music is also launching Replay All Time, a special version of the annual Replay experience that allows listeners to see and stream the songs they’ve played the most since joining Apple Music. With Replay All Time, subscribers can stream this Replay playlist from the Home tab in Apple Music.
