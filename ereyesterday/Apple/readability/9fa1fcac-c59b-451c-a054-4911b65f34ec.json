  "description": "Macworld Just like iPhones and iPads, Apple’s chargers and cables also have tiny computers inside that need occasional updates. Today it’s the MagSafe Charger’s turn—for the first time since May 2023. Apple has issued an update for the 25W MagSafe Charger to bring the accessory to a new firmware version from the previous version (128.0). This is the fifth firmware update the accessory has received but the first for the newest 25W model. There doesn’t appear to be a separate update for the older charger. Apple released the original MagSafe Charger, topped out at 15W and had a 1-meter cable, in 2020 alongside the iPhone 12. This updated model with 25W charging and a 2-meter cable arrived in September 2024 with the iPhone 16. There’s no way to directly update the MagSafe Charger. When it is attached to your iPhone, the firmware will be updated at some point, usually overnight. To check the firmware of your charger, attach it to your iPhone, then head to the Settings app, then General \u003e About and tap the Apple MagSafe Charger tab near the bottom of the page. If the firmware version is later than 128.0, you are on the newest version.",
