  "text": "The latest iPhone models use a ton of auto-enhancing and software to adjust photos that you shoot with the camera, and much of that auto-editing happens immediately on-device after the camera snaps a photo, some of this is Deep Fusion, and some of it are numerous other features that Apple has incorporated into the iPhone camera software. While the results of iPhone Cameras auto-editing often look great, sometimes they don’t represent what you’re hoping to capture, and it’s not unusual for the iPhone Camera auto-editing photo feature to do things like remove the intensity of a sunset, or take pinks/reds/purples out of a colorful morning sky, or to ridiculously auto-enhance someones skin tone to the point where it looks unnatural or certainly not like the person’s complexion does. One way to get around the auto photo enhancement and camera auto-editing features on iPhone is to toggle a feature on called “Prioritize Faster Shooting”, which as the name implies will prioritize taking more photos in quick succession in lieu of tons of auto-enhancements. The result is that photos captured on iPhone Camera will look less processed, and may be more representative of what you intended to capture with the lens in the first place. How to Use “Prioritize Faster Shooting” for Faster Photos \u0026 Less Processing on iPhone Camera This is a simple setting adjustment: Open the “Settings” app on iPhone Go to “Camera” Find the toggle for “Prioritize Faster Shooting” and toggle that switch to the ON position Return to the iPhone Camera and use it as usual, but to really see the change on this setting take a few photos in rapid succession, where now the iPhone will perform less processing and the images will look closer to how they do on the screen. The auto-enhancements can be the result of various technologies and processes that Apple uses to handle images and enhance them automatically. Often these algorithmic enhancements can look really great and improve the appearance of photos, but sometimes they miss the mark or look overly processed. Try toggling this setting on and see if you can notice a difference with your iPhone camera and the photos you take, and let us know what you think in the comments below. And if you have any other tips or tricks to address this issue, share them in the comments too! For what it’s worth, another method to get around the auto-enhancements is to use RAW mode with iPhone camera and then enhance and edit the photos yourself, since often photos taken in RAW look a little drab or boring by default, but with some manual enhancement can end up looking incredible as the RAW image file has so much data that can be utilized during edits. If you’re shooting portraits, macro photos, sunsets, dramatic landscapes, or anything where you want as much control over the visual look of the photo, RAW may be for you. There are many users that voice frustration on Apple support forums (1) about auto-enhancing and auto-editing photos taken by the iPhone Camera, and while Apple has yet to introduce a setting to stop or reduce those auto-edits directly, you can circumvent some of them with this particular toggle. Some users even result to using third party camera apps, some of which use less auto-enhancing than Apple’s Camera default. Don’t forget to check out more camera tips for iPhone!",
