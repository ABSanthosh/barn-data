  "text": "WhatsApp this week released a major update that adds a new way to create and manage sticker packs without having to leave the app. Read on as we detail exactly what’s new for WhatsApp users. Creating WhatsApp sticker packs just got easier WhatsApp already had an option to create and save custom stickers. However, finding and sending these stickers to someone wasn’t exactly an easy task when you have a lot of them in the app. To solve this, WhatsApp is introducing a new option for creating sticker packs. With sticker packs, you can create and organize stickers in multiple folders. More than that, you can also share a entire pack of stickers with another WhatsApp user, instead of having to send each one individually. “Whether it’s a pack of stickers of your dog, or hilarious selfies of your closest friends, now you can make your chats more fun and personal, with sticker packs that are unique to you. Earlier this year we announced sticker pack sharing, so now you can create and share your very own sticker packs with your friends and family in-chat,” a WhatsApp spokesperson told 9to5Mac. In addition to stickers, WhatsApp recently introduced some other new features, including an indicator to show how many people are online in a group chat, a feature to scan and send documents, and the ability to set WhatsApp as the default calling and messaging app on the iPhone. WhatsApp is available for free on the App Store. Make sure you update to the latest version of the app to get access to the new features.
