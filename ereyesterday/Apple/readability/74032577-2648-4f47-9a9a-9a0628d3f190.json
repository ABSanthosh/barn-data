  "text": "Yesterday at WWDC25, Apple announced a new addition to the Wallet app that’ll certainly bridge the gap when it comes to digital ID adoption in the United States: support for passports. Apple announced Drivers Licenses and IDs in Apple Wallet back with iOS 15 in 2021, but since then, it’s only rolled out to a handful of US states. Apple currently supports 9 US states plus Puerto Rico, and will soon add 3 more. Still, 12 is far short of all 50 US states. Soon, however, Apple will introduce support for US passports in Apple Wallet – which’ll allow every US citizen to have a digital ID on their phone. Personally, I was quite excited by this news. According to Apple’s website, you’ll be able to use it at TSA checkpoints, online, and in person. Still, even with virtually everyone in the US being able to utilize digital IDs, it’s still recommended that you keep a real passport on you, especially while traveling internationally. Nonetheless, it’s still a cool thing to have, especially with it now being supported online. What do you think about digital IDs in Apple Wallet? Are you excited for this addition?
