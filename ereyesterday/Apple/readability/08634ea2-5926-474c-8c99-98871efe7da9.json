  "description": "Macworld Apple has announced the dates of this year’s WWDC get-together. As expected, the event will run from June 9-13, 2025. As in prior years, this year’s WWDC will be a hybrid event. The entire five-day program will be available online, but there will also be an in-person gathering at Apple Park on June 9. Attendees will watch the keynote, take part in activities, and get a chance to speak one-on-one with Apple experts. “We’re excited to mark another incredible year of WWDC with our global developer community,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. “We can’t wait to share the latest tools and technologies that will empower developers and help them continue to innovate.” WWDC, or the Worldwide Developers Conference, is the second-biggest event in Apple’s calendar after the iPhone launch in the fall. Each summer the company uses WWDC to inform app developers about new features coming to each of its software platforms. However, the event attracts a large audience of other parties interested in software changes that will affect their Apple devices. WWDC lasts for five days, offering a range of workshops and networking events to help developers in their work and careers. But the keynote presentation on the first day is what gets all the publicity. At the WWDC 2025 keynote, we will definitely hear about iOS 19 and iPadOS 19, macOS 16, and watchOS 12, as well as tvOS 19, visionOS 3, and AirPods and HomePod software. You can expect Apple Intelligence to dominate the agenda. The first betas of the new software will launch straight after the keynote so developers can start getting to grips with the changes. By the time the updates launch to the public in the fall, active apps should (in theory) have had time to adapt and work correctly with the new operating systems. Following the event online will be free. Those who would like to apply to join the event in person can find details on Apple’s WWDC webpage.",
