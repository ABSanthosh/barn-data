  "text": "Recorded in front of a live audience at The California Theatre in San Jose Tuesday evening, special guests Joanna Stern and Nilay Patel join me to discuss Apple’s announcements at WWDC 2025. 3D video with spatial audio: Coming soon, exclusively in Sandwich Vision’s Theater on Vision Pro, available on the App Store. This year’s on-demand version of the show in Theater isn’t ready yet, but it looks really good. Better than last year’s by a long shot, and also significantly better than the bandwidth-constrained livestream Tuesday night. The livestream Tuesday night looked good; the on-demand version coming in a few days looks pretty amazing. Sponsored by: iMazing: The world’s most trusted software to transfer and save your messages, music, files, and data from your iPhone or iPad to your Mac or PC. DetailsPro: Design with SwiftUI anytime, anywhere — on iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Vision Pro. Ooni: Next-gen pizza power. The Koda 2 Pro oven features smarter heat, more room, and easier control. Save 10% with code thetalkshow. As ever, I implore you to watch on the biggest screen you can (real, or virtual). We once again shot and mastered the video in 4K, and it looks and sounds terrific. All credit and thanks for that go to my friends at Sandwich, who are nothing short of a joy to work with.",
