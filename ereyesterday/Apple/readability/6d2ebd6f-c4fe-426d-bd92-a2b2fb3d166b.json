  "text": "Fantastical for Windows is (finally) here! You asked. We listened. Introducing the newest member of the Fantastical family, Fantastical for Windows.Â ðŸŽ‰ Weâ€™ve spent the last 4 years making Fantastical better than ever across Apple devices, and with version 4.0 we decided to go evenÂ biggerÂ by finally bringing the worldâ€™s best calendar app to a Windows PC near you. Fantastical for Windows has all the amazing features you know, and love, including (but definitely not limited to): Fantasticalâ€™s Natural Language Parser You didnâ€™t think we would make an entirely new app without bringing over our most important feature did you? (News flash: We didnâ€™t!) Easily create your events and tasks in Fantastical from your PC using the magic* of our Fantastical parser, including options such as adding locations, adding invitees (on Google accounts), and specifying the calendar or task list the item is assigned to. *The parser is not really run by magic, it just feels like it sometimes. ðŸ˜‰ Tasks Create your To-Do list (and check it twice) with support for Google Tasks, Microsoft 365 tasks, and Todoist. Take advantage of the amazing tasks list view to easily track what is on each individual list, or choose to view all upcoming tasks that need to be checked off. Fantastical Mini Window and main app calendar views Fantastical for Windows includes the entire lineup of calendar views (Day, Week, Month, Quarter, Year, Task) in the main app, and in its own famous Mini Window that you can access directly from your system tray. Whether you need to plan a lunch with friends next weekend, or a work conference in December, we have a view for that! And the list goes on. . . There are so many features in Fantastical for Windows we canâ€™t cover them all in one post, but you can also expect to see customer favorites like: Calendar Sets (that sync across all your devices) Interesting Calendars Conference call support (including Zoom and Webex Integration) Weather Fantastical Scheduling: view your Openings, Proposals, and RSVP events (full support coming soon) â€¦and so much more! Get started with Fantastical for Windows The best news is that Fantastical for Windows is included in your Flexibits Premium subscription so there are NO extra purchases required! Get the Windows app, then sign in to your existing Flexibits Account in the Windows app by selecting the menu button in the top left corner of the app, and choosing File \u003e Settings \u003e Flexibits Account. This will unlock all of the features we mentioned above (along with even more features that didnâ€™t make the list). Our amazing Support team is standing by for any questions you might have, or you can look through our new Windows Help documents for a comprehensive walkthrough of the app. Thank you for your support of Flexibits, and we hope youâ€™re as excited about Fantastical for Windows as we are!",
