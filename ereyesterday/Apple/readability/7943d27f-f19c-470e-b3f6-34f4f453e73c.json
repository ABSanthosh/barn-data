  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. ClosetLog provides you with all of the information you need to know about your wardrobe, and helps you make better decisions on what you should wear. It’s a useful little tool, and helps you balance what you’re wearing on a day-to-day basis. Top features ClosetLog is built with the intention of providing all of the data you need to be more mindful of what you wear. It tells you what you are (and aren’t) wearing regularly, informs you of the weather to help you pick outfits, and even provides you data on how much value per dollar you’re getting out of certain items of clothing. It’s meant to make you more aware and minimal. On top of that, ClosetLog also utilizes Apple’s Vision framework to quickly remove backgrounds from photos of your clothing. You can readily craft new outfits within the app as well. Thanks to the insights tab, you can also decide what clothing you should likely get rid of. The app works fully off of iCloud Sync, and doesn’t require an account. Download the app ClosetLog is available for free on the App Store, with no ads or tracking – and currently, no subscription. It’s usable on iPhones running iOS 17.5 and later. The developer is working on a subscription that’ll utilize AI to help you log entire outfits and more, but that’s later down the road.
