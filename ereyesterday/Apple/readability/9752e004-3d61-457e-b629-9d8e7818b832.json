As is tradition, developers have begun posting their invitations and rejections on social media. Developers must claim their seat to ensure it isn't released for someone else to claim. Those invited will attend a welcome reception at the Infinite Loop campus on Sunday, June 8. There, developers will pick up their event badge and get a chance to mingle. The keynote event on Monday, June 9, will reveal iOS 19, iPadOS 19, tvOS 19, macOS 16, watchOS 12, and visionOS 3. There's also a chance Apple could introduce HomeOS. Apple Intelligence is expected to remain a central theme of the event, especially after key features were delayed into the next year. There's also a slim chance of hardware like a new Mac Pro being revealed.",
