  "description": "Macworld Writing a book can feel overwhelming, especially when you’re staring down a blank page with no clear starting point, but AI can help. Youbooks is an AI-powered platform that helps you turn non-fiction ideas into professional, polished books in a fraction of the time it usually takes. With a lifetime subscription, you get ongoing access to tools that let you generate up to 300,000-word manuscripts tailored to your style, with real research and your own supporting materials built in. It’s also only $49 for a lifetime subscription (reg. $540). What makes Youbooks stand out is that it’s not just using one kind of AI model like other tools do. Instead, it blends the strengths of models like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama to create cohesive, well-researched content. You can upload your own documents, define your writing tone, and even include transcripts or blog posts to help guide the final product. The platform performs live internet searches during writing, so your book includes up-to-date facts and stats. Each month, you get 150,000 credits to use toward generating content or uploading source files. When your book is ready, you can download it in a variety of formats, including DOCX, PDF, EPUB, or Markdown, making it easy to edit or publish. Youbooks also grants full commercial rights, so the book is entirely yours to sell, distribute, or share however you like. Right now, it’s only $49 to get a Youbooks lifetime subscription.
