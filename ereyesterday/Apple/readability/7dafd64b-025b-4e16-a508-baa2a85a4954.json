  "text": "New betas are available as iOS 18.5 beta 2, MacOS Sequoia 15.5 beta 2, and iPadOS 18.5 beta 2, for users who are participating in the beta testing programs for Apple system software. No notable new features or major changes are expected in these beta versions, at least thus far, suggesting they’re likely focused on smaller enhancements, bug fixes, security patches, and maybe some additional refinements or improvements to Apple Intelligence since that has been a focus of Apple with iOS 18 and MacOS Sequoia. There are also new beta versions of watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS available for users testing those. The most recently available stable builds of system software are MacOS Sequoia 15.4, iOS 18.4, and iPadOS 18.4. How to Install iOS 18.5 Beta 2 An iPhone or iPad enrolled in the beta program can find the latest update by doing the following: Open the “Settings” app Go to “General”, and then go to “Software Update” Choose to install iOS 18.5 beta 2 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.5 beta 2 Any Mac enrolled in the beta program can install the latest update by: Go to the  Apple menu, then go to “System Settings”, and then go to “General” Go to “Software Update” Choose to “Update Now” for MacOS Sequoia 15.5 beta 2 Installing the beta updates will require the device to restart. When are iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, and MacOS Sequoia 15.5 going to be released as final versions? Apple usually goes through multiple iterations of beta builds before releasing a final version to the general public. While no known timeline is available outside of Apple, it’s reasonable to expect the final versions of iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, and MacOS Sequoia 15.5 are at least several weeks out, perhaps next month. The latest stable builds of system software are currently MacOS Sequoia 15.4, iOS 18.4, and iPadOS 18.4.",
