  "text": "As previously reported, Apple will no longer sell the iPhone 14 and iPhone SE in the European Union due to local legislation that requires all smartphones sold there to have a USB-C port. After removing these models from the online store in some countries such as Switzerland, Apple has now ended sales of the iPhone 14 and SE in most EU countries. Apple stops selling iPhone 14 and SE 3 in the EU As noted by MacRumors and corroborated by 9to5Mac, it is no longer possible to find the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and the 3rd generation iPhone SE for purchase in Apple’s online store in most EU countries. Local legislation determined that companies had until December 28 to update their products with a USB-C port, otherwise they could no longer be sold in the EU. The devices are no longer available in countries such as Germany, Spain, France, Italy, and Portugal. They remain available in the UK, as the country is no longer part of the European Union. With the iPhone 15, which was introduced in 2023, the USB-C port became standard across all iPhone models. The company has also updated pretty much all of its accessories such as AirPods and Magic Mouse with a USB-C port. However, Apple still sells the iPhone 14 and iPhone SE, both with the Lightning connector. For customers in the EU, this means that they’ll be missing out on the cheapest iPhones – at least for now. iPhone 14 was introduced in September 2022, keeping the iPhone 13 design with some minor hardware improvements – such as Emergency SOS via satellite. As for the iPhone SE 3, it was launched in March 2022 and still has the old iPhone 8 design with a Home button. Apple is rumored to introduce a new, redesigned iPhone SE with USB-C port early next year, which is probably why the company didn’t bother discontinuing the current version in the EU. As for the iPhone 14, the model would probably be discontinued anyway in September 2025 with the launch of the iPhone 17 lineup.
