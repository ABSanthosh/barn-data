Photo: Cult of Mac Deals Ever been annoyed when someone sends you a PDF instead of a file you can edit? An all-in-one PDF editor like PDF Converter Pro can help, and it doesn’t need to cost a fortune. Lifetime licenses for the Mac PDF app are on sale for $24 with code SAVE20 (regularly $99.99) for a limited time. PDF Converter Pro: An Adobe Acrobat Pro alternative for Mac PDFs continue to be one of the most popular file types in the world, so why is it such a pain when you actually need to use one? PDF Converter Pro can make that pain go away. You can create, convert and more with this all-in-one PDF app. If you need to edit a document, PDF Converter Pro can change and back up your PDF files as Word documents, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations with a few clicks. Alternatively, you can save PDFs in HTML, PNG and JPG formats. Then, once you’re done editing, convert your file back again seamlessly. You can even use the built-in OCR technology to extract text from image-based PDFs, including graphs. That means you can scan or download PDFs and make them searchable. Not only that, but with PDF Converter Pro, you  can take existing PDF pages and merge or split them as needed. You can extract every page into a separate PDF or just take the pages you need. Extract images from PDFs And, if you’re just in it for the pictures, you can extract images from PDFs with only one click. No more wasting hours of research only to find a graph you can’t pull or a picture you can’t grab. (You can spend that free time playing games on Apple Arcade.) You can even use PDF Converter Pro to compress and protect your files. For example, the app lets you compress a large PDF or multiple documents into a smaller file size. And you can set up password protection that encrypts your file until the recipient enters the correct password. You might be able to get that same functionality out of Adobe Acrobat Pro, but it costs $19.99 per month — and requires an annual subscription. As verified customer Karlynn M. notes, PDF Converter Pro “seems to do everything that the Adobe .PDF product does for far less money.” Save on PDF Converter Pro lifetime license for Mac or Windows Stop groaning whenever someone sends you a PDF.
