  "description": "Macworld We just found the coolest USB-C charger for your gear and while it may not come from Apple, it sure fits the company’s retro vibe of white and see-through plastic. The Sharge 65W charger is down to $36 at Amazon, a 28 percent discount and one of the best prices you’re going to find. The design of this thing is stunning. Instead of the regular solid black or white charger for which you’d need your own cable, this one brings a transparent element and a two-in-one model. Other than its retro charm, the best thing about this charger is that it comes with a retractable cable. After plugging it in, you can extend exactly as much as the 2.3-foot of cable you need. The 65W charging output makes this model perfect for fast-charging iPhones, iPads, and even the MacBook Air, which will go from 0 percent to 50 percent in about half an hour. So snag this fun Sharge 65W USB-C charger for $35.90 at Amazon and bring some retro fun to your desk. Get the coolest charger for $14 offBuy now at Amazon",
