Others are rugged, but feel like bricks. The BENKS ArmorPro somehow pulls off both. It’s lightweight, works perfectly with MagSafe, and adds real protection without killing the feel of the iPhone. I also tried BENKS MagSafe ring holder that does more than just add grip. It can function as a kickstand, rotates easily, and pops off cleanly when it’s time to charge. MagSafe Monday: Every Monday, Bradley Chambers looks at the latest and greatest in the MagSafe and wireless charging industry to help you get the most out of your Apple devices that support wireless charging. Sturdy protection that doesn’t get in the way The BENKS ArmorPro is built with real Kevlar fiber, not just some plastic knockoff with a cool texture. BENKS is using certified DuPont 600D aramid fiber with this case, and you can feel the difference. I’ve got a few similar cases with knock off material, and you can tell a difference It’s strong without feeling bulky at all, and it doesn’t pick up fingerprints or scratches like a lot glossy cases tend to get with daily. The TPU bumper around the edge gives just enough shock absorption, and the camera ring adds some peace of mind when setting your phone down as it gives it a bit of a lip. The BENKS ArmorPro case has 36 magnets inside, and it’s one of the easily MagSafe connections I’ve tested. MagSafe chargers and accessories snap into place confidently, and it holds just fine on my car mount even when making sharp turns of hitting a speed bump. Wallets don’t slide off easily either, which is a big deal if you’ve ever had your wallet slip off in your pocket, etc The case texture of this case is probably my favorite thing, though BENKS added raised 3D particles that gives it a bit of grittiness without making it feel rough. It’s still easy to slide into your pocket, but it doesn’t feel slippery when you’re walking around one-handed. If you’re someone who hates bulky cases but still wants a bit of protection, this case hits a nice middle ground. BENKS MagSafe ring holder The MagSafe ring holder from BENKS also was surprisingly useful. I usually avoid these kinds of accessories because they either feel cheap or don’t work well in daily practice This one pops on with strong magnets, doesn’t spin unless you want it to, and can be angled however you need. Landscape and portrait both work fine for video or a FaceTime call. The texture on the back feels similar to the case as well. Wrap up on BENKS ArmorPro Overall, I love the BENKS ArmorPro case. It’s become my daily carry for my iPhone. I wish it had a built-in screen protector, but outside of that, it’s amazing. The grip and texture have ruined me for all other MagSafe cases, and 36 magnets are nothing to sneeze at. It’s become my new EDC iPhone case, and I love it. You can buy it from Amazon or directly from BENKS. Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.",
