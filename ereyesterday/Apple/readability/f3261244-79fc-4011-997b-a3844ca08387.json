  "description": "Macworld We know it’s the giving season, but sometimes it’s nice to get a little for ourselves. Like today’s deal: Amazon is selling the 10th-gen iPad for $250 when you click the coupon box, a cool $100 off its already-low MSRP and matching its amazing Black Friday pricing. The 10th gen iPad features Apple’s A14 chip with a pair of 12MP cameras, a stunning all-screen design, and Apple Pencil support. The 10.9-inch tablet has 64GB of storage space, but you can get the 256GB model for $70 off, which isn’t as great, but if you want more storage space, it’s going to have to do. One of the major upgrades for the 10th gen iPad was the 12MP Ultra Wide front camera with Center Stage, which keeps you focused when you move around during your calls. Its only drawback is it doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, but that shouldn’t be a huge drawback at this price. So go ahead and add the 10th-gen iPad to your cart for $250. It probably won’t arrive by Christmas but it’ll be a nice gift to yourself once the hustle and bustle of the holidays are over. Buy now at Amazon",
