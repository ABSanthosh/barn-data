  "text": "If you’re already eagerly waiting for Severance season 3, Apple just dropped a little treat to help with withdrawal. The company has published a rare video on its YouTube channel: the original casting tape of Dichen Lachman (Jurassic World: Dominion) auditioning for the role of Ms. Casey. Watch it below. Mild season 1 spoilers ahead The two-minute video shows Lachman reading through two scenes that fans of the show will instantly recognize: one is the early wellness session with Irving B., and the other is from when Ms. Casey is put to silently observe Helly R. What makes the video especially fun for fans is noticing how different her interpretation was at this early stage. Ms. Casey, as we saw her in the finished show, became known for her stoic, almost robotic delivery. But here, Lachman plays her with a bit more expressiveness, a reminder of how much character development happens between casting and final edit. There are also some subtle differences in the dialogue, with lines that either didn’t make the final cut or were later reworked into something slightly sharper. Or creepier. So, what about season 3? Severance season 3 was officially confirmed by Apple on the heels of the season 2 finale, and it’s already in the works. Writer Beau Willimon (House of Cards, Andor), who was brought in to help iron out issues late in season 2, will reportedly take on a bigger role in shaping season 3. For the most anxious fans, the good news is that showrunner Ben Stiller (Tropic Thunder, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty) himself has said it won’t take as long as the nearly three-year wait between seasons 1 and 2. The bad news is that most estimates still point to a late 2026 or even 2027 release for season 3 on Apple TV+. Watch Severance seasons 1 and 2 on Apple TV+ Apple TV+ is available for $9.99 per month and features hit TV shows and movies like The Studio, The Morning Show, Shrinking and Silo.
