Photo: Apple In partnership with Universal Music Group, Apple Music on Tuesday launched Sound Therapy, a collection of specially enhanced tracks designed to help listeners achieve wellness through better focus, deeper relaxation and improved sleep. It combines the power of your favorite music with cognitive science to improve daily well-being, the companies said in a press release. “Given Apple’s leadership at the intersection of health and technology, the launch of Sound Therapy represents an important validation of our innovative, science-led Sollos initiative,” said Michael Nash, UMG’s executive vice president and chief digital officer. “We look forward to working closely with the team at Apple to expand the ways that music can be harnessed to improve the wellness benefits for its users.” Apple Music Sound Therapy transforms music into wellness tools Sound Therapy’s creation demonstrates how streaming services evolve beyond simple music delivery to create more functional, lifestyle-oriented experiences. By merging entertainment with wellness technology, Apple Music positions itself at the intersection of digital media and health — a space that increasingly resonates with consumers seeking digital tools to support their wellbeing. The Sound Therapy launch follows Apple Music’s recent introduction of the Apple Music Chill radio station, which provides a “sanctuary of sound” throughout the day. Notable hosts include Brian Eno, Stephan Moccio and Zane Lowe, who share personal stories about calm and wellbeing. How does Sound Therapy work? The new collection takes songs from popular artists and subtly enhances them with special sound waves and audio technologies. They Sound Therapy tracks are designed to influence brain activity while maintaining the artistic integrity of the original recordings, Apple said. This science-backed approach aims to make wellness more accessible through the music Apple Music subscribers already enjoy. Sollos, a music-wellness initiative within UMG‘s London headquarters, developed Sound Therapy. A team of producers, scientists and audio engineers worked to create specialized tracks. The collection features extended versions, instrumental renditions and reimagined takes on hits from artists including Imagine Dragons, Katy Perry, Kacey Musgraves, Ludovico Einaudi, Aurora, Jhené Aiko, Chelsea Cutler and Jeremy Zucker. “Every day, people around the world make Apple Music part of their daily routine, and we’ve seen incredible engagement around our personalized mood playlists and the new Apple Music Chill radio station,” said Rachel Newman, Apple Music’s co-head. “Now, with Sound Therapy, we’re proud to work alongside UMG and Sollos to bring a new listening experience to Apple Music — one that’s grounded in artistry, shaped by innovation and designed to support wellness.” The science behind the sound Sound Therapy divides into three distinct categories — Focus, Relax and Sleep — with each using different auditory technologies to achieve specific cognitive effects. Focus These tracks incorporate gamma auditory beats and white noise to enhance concentration and cognitive performance. The white noise component helps mask distracting sounds, potentially helping listeners maintain attention on tasks that require deep focus. For example, an enhanced Imagine Dragons track might help users power through their to-do list with improved concentration. Relax The relaxation category in Apple Music’s Sound Therapy features songs infused with theta auditory beats. Research suggests they can help induce a state of calm. These tracks are specifically designed for moments when users need to unwind and release tension. Sleep For better rest, the sleep category uses delta auditory beats or pink noise. (Pink noise is similar to white noise but with deeper, more natural sounds like rainfall or ocean waves.) Incorporating it into a dreamy version of Katy Perry’s “Double Rainbow” might help listeners drift off more easily. “For years, elevating music’s role in health and wellbeing has been a strategic priority for UMG. [It’s] linked to a potentially significant commercial opportunity, as well as something that our chairman and CEO and the entire management team are passionate about,” said Michael Nash, UMG’s executive vice president and chief digital officer. Apple Music Sound Therapy: Expanding Apple’s wellness ecosystem The introduction of Sound Therapy aligns with Apple’s broader commitment to health and wellness across its product ecosystem. From Apple Watch to HealthKit and Apple Fitness+, the company has consistently developed features and services that support users’ well-being. Apple Music’s new Sound Therapy offering represents a natural extension of that mission, now bringing wellness benefits to the music streaming experience. Apple indicated it will work closely with Sollos and UMG to further establish scientific evidence supporting music and audio for improved well-being, with the goal of making these benefits accessible to people worldwide. Exclusive to Apple Music subscribers Sound Therapy is available exclusively to Apple Music subscribers, adding value to the subscription service. Users can access the collection directly within the Apple Music app, making it easy to incorporate these wellness-focused listening experiences into daily routines. For those interested in learning more about the science and development behind Sound Therapy, Apple Music’s Zane Lowe offers additional insights through the service’s editorial content.
