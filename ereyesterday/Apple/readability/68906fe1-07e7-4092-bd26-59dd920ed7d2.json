Reuters estimates that those fines, which would be on top of the 500 million euro fine already levied against Apple, could be as much as 50 million euros per day. No deal is finished until it’s formally announced, but if Reuters’ sources are correct, we should see an announcement from the European Commission in the coming weeks.",
