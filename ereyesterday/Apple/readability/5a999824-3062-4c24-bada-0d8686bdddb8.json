  "description": "Macworld Learning a new language is a great way to build a mental practice, get ahead at work, and get ready for your next vacation. MosaLingua offers training in 11 different languages on iOS and other platforms to get you fluent, fast. Act fast and get a lifetime subscription for its lowest price ever at $85.97 until July 15. The MosaLingua app is built around three core tenets, the first being accessibility. MosaLingua’s unique AI and language tools like MosaDiscovery can be incorporated into your Netflix streams, your web browsing and more to help you learn languages from the content you’re most familiar with. There’s also a virtual tutor available so you can practice whenever you’re ready to learn. The second is science-based training design. Working closely with top linguists and staying up on trends, MosaLingua structures its lessons around approaches such as vocabulary training with visuals, text, and audio, and uses techniques like spaced repetition and the 80/20 rule to help you learn. Spoken dialogues, flash cards, grammar lessons, audio stories, and more are all used to keep learning fun and help you stay focused. The third is practicality. If you’ve used language software that demands you set aside a half hour every day, you know how hard it can be to stick with it. MosaLingua is built for busy people, and trains you on common words and phrases shared between cultures before building from there. Lessons are concise, just 10 minutes long per session, and MosaLingua has both offline modes for your device as well as cross-platform progression between the apps and their website. Currently MosaLingua offers English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Arabic, with new languages under development. Get started on language learning with a lifetime subscription to the MosaLingua app for iOS and Android for $85.97 until July 15 at 11:59pm Pacific.
