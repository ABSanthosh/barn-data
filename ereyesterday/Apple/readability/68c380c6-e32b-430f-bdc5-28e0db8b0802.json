Earlier we saw what appeared Valentine's Day truce between Netflix and Apple, but unfortunately, that isn't the case. On Friday morning, US Netflix subscribers were prompted to connect their Netflix account to the Apple TV app. For a short time, Netflix series such as \"Squid Game\" are showing up in the Apple TV app's Watchlist and Continue Watching sections. However, it didn't seem to last long, leaving many wondering if the feature was actively being tested for later rollout. We've since learned that wasn't the case. A Netflix spokesperson told The Verge that Netflix's participation in the Apple TV app was an error. It has, since then, been rolled back. So, at least for now, it looks like you'll have to keep using the Netflix app. And don't expect Netflix to be cozying up to Apple, or anyone else, anytime soon.",
