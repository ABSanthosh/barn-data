  "text": "News Apple took an early step toward releasing iOS 18.6. Image: Apple/Rajesh Pandey/CultOfMac The first betas of iOS 18.6 and macOS Sequoia 15.6 went to developers Monday. That’s despite Apple already unveiling their eventual replacements, iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26. While that might seem odd, this is normal. Apple also just seeded iPadOS 18.6 beta 1, watchOS 11.6 beta 1, tvOS 18.6 beta 1 and visionOS 2.6 beta 1 to developers. iOS 18.6 and macOS 15.6 beta testing begins Apple is always working on improving the operating systems for all its devices. And just because it’s already looking ahead to the OS versions it’ll release this autumn, doesn’t mean it’s given up on the current ones. So while Apple used WWDC last week to give the world its first look at iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26, work continues on the versions that initially launched in September 2024. That means the company’s developers are coding two versions of them at the same time. Hence Monday’s release of the first betas for iOS 18.6 and macOS 15.6, along with the first betas of iPadOS 18.6, watchOS 11.6, tvOS 18.6 and visionOS 2.6. It’s not yet clear whether there are any new features in these. It’s possible there aren’t, just bug fixes. While Apple keeps working on these soon-to-be obsolete versions, this late in the cycle, the company saves important new features for the next major upgrades coming in autumn. Just for devs Currently, the first round of updates for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV are available only for those in Apple’s developer program. If Apple follows its usual habits, the second round of betas should come out in two weeks. It’s possible the full non-beta release will come in July. Alternatively, the first betas of iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, etc., are also available for developers to test.",
