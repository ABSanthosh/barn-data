  "description": "Macworld Apple’s brand-new MacBook Pro only just went on sale last week and it already has its first discount: Amazon has dropped the price to $1,474, a savings of $125 off its $1,599 MSRP and a surprising price cut for such a new model. Running on a powerful M4 chip, the MacBook Pro will easily tackle any task you throw its way with extreme ease. And don’t forget, it now comes with 16GB of RAM standard, double the previous model, and essentially a $200 price cut. The MacBook Pro already had a good battery, but they’ve improved on that too. In our test, the laptop ran for about 20 hours before finally shutting down. That’s more than enough for you to leave home without a charger. In our review of the MacBook Pro M4, we gave it a near-perfect score, praising its performance, the powerful Center Stage camera, and the nano-texture glass display. The 14.2″ Liquid Retina XDR display offers stunning colors, high brightness, and sharp details: “The changes that Apple made to the $1,599/£1,599 M4 MacBook Pro not only made it a clear pro laptop (finally), but it also created a package bursting with value.” So there you have it—skip Black Friday and get yourself the MacBook Pro M4 because we don’t know how long this sale will last. Snatch the MacBook Pro M4 at its cheapest price everBuy it now at Amazon",
