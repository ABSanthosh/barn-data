  "text": "Apple released iOS 18.3 beta 3 to developers this afternoon. The update includes a handful of changes to the notification summaries feature of Apple Intelligence. Update 4:30 p.m. ET: A new public beta is also now available with these changes. The changes come after complaints from news outlets such as the BBC. Two weeks ago, Apple promised that a future software update would “further clarify when the text being displayed is summarization provided by Apple Intelligence.” Here are the changes included in iOS 18.3 for Apple Intelligence notification summaries: When you enable notification summaries, iOS 18.3 will make it clearer that the feature – like all Apple Intelligence features – is a beta. You can now disable notification summaries for an app directly from the Lock Screen or Notification Center by swiping, tapping “Options,” then choosing the “Turn Off Summaries” option. On the Lock Screen, notification summaries now use italicized text to better distinguish them from normal notifications. In the Settings app, Apple now warns users that notification summaries “may contain errors.” Additionally, notification summaries have been temporarily disabled entirely for the News \u0026 Entertainment category of apps. Notification summaries will be re-enabled for this category with a future software update as Apple continues to refine the experience. iOS 18.3 was released to developer beta testers today. A new public beta is expected to be released within the next week. There’s no word on when the update will be released to the general public.
