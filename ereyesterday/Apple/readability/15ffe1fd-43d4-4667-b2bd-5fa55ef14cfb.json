  "text": "Apple has released the fourth beta version of iOS 18.2, MacOS Sequoia 15.2, and iPadOS 18.2, for users participating in the beta testing programs for Apple system software. The primary focus of these new betas appear to be introducing additional Apple Intelligence features, including things like ChatGPT integration to Siri, Genmoji for custom Emoji creation, and Image Playground AI image generation. These Ai features are in addition to the helpful writing tools, smart replies, and summary features with Apple Intelligence that debuted in the prior .1 updates. Aside from the new Apple Intelligence features, there are some additional new features as well, like allowing iPhone Mirroring to use Personal Hotspot, sharing functionality in Find My, a weather widget for the Mac menu bar, refinements to Settings app, and some other smaller changes and features. iOS 18.2 and MacOS Sequoia 15.2 are expected to launch next month for all users. The most recent stable version of system software currently available is the just released iOS 18.1.1, iPadOS 18.1.1, and MacOS Sequoia 15.1.1.

According to a recent report from Bloomberg, Apple will release iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and MacOS Sequoia 15.2, in December. Apple typically goes through several beta versions before issuing a final release to the general public, which would be inline with a December release. Because November and December have several holidays, it’s likely the updates will be released before Christmas break.",
