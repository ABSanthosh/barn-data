  "text": "DICKINSON — The Dickinson Public Schools district has announced the retirement of its longtime mascot, the \"Midgets,\" effective at the end of the current school year. District officials say the decision reflects a commitment to inclusivity and evolving community values while mitigating potential legal concerns.The move, which comes after nearly a century, follows growing concerns over the name’s appropriateness, its potential to impact students’ opportunities and the risk of civil rights litigation. According to a letter sent to parents Monday, district leaders emphasized that the change aligns with efforts to foster a more welcoming environment while safeguarding against legal challenges. \"If a family enrolls a child with Achondroplasia in one of our schools, what kind of message does our mascot send to that family?\" Dr. Marcus Lewton, superintendent of Dickinson Public Schools, said. \"What kind of environment might that create for that student?\" Why now? A major consideration in the decision was the impact on students, both at home and in competition. School officials cited concerns from students who felt uncomfortable using the mascot's name while representing the school at state and national events. Some teams and organizations have even been unable to share the mascot’s name at national competitions due to the term’s controversial connotations. In December of 2019, representatives of the Little People of America (LPA) asked the school board to consider dropping what they consider to be an offensive name for the school’s mascot.Dickinson Press file photo Additionally, the district acknowledged the potential legal risks of retaining the name. Achondroplasia, the most common form of skeletal dysplasia, which affects bone growth and development, is a disability protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Officials cited concerns that the district could face civil rights lawsuits over the mascot. Phasing out Rebranding a school mascot can be a costly undertaking, requiring updates to uniforms, signage and athletic facilities. However, Dickinson Public Schools officials said they believe their transition will be significantly more cost-effective due to strategic planning and existing budget cycles.One of the most significant cost-saving factors is the district’s ongoing, bond-approved renovation and expansion of Dickinson High School. By integrating the mascot rebranding into these planned updates, officials estimate they will avoid many of the financial burdens that typically accompany such a transition.Athletic Director Guy Fridley said the gymnasium floor, which currently bears the mascot’s name, was already scheduled to be refinished this fall as part of the school’s standard maintenance plan. Similarly, athletic uniforms will be phased out gradually as part of their regular replacement schedule rather than requiring an immediate overhaul.“We want to reassure everyone that this change will not result in a large rebranding expense,” the letter to parents stated. “These yearly costs are already budgeted within our existing budgets and athletic teams.” Unclear origins The origins of the \"Midgets\" nickname at Dickinson High School stretch back nearly a century, yet the exact story behind its adoption remains a matter of debate. While no definitive records exist to confirm how the name came to be, four prevailing theories have circulated within the community for generations. One popular account attributes the moniker to a sports broadcaster who, upon witnessing a Dickinson team notably smaller in stature than its opponents, coined the nickname on air. Another theory links the name to a post-World War I victory parade that made a stop in Dickinson, featuring a “Mighty Midget” fighter plane that reportedly inspired the school’s athletic teams.A third possibility suggests that Dickinson borrowed the name from an opponent. According to local lore, the school once faced a Fargo team that had previously used the Midgets mascot. Dickinson’s players, being even smaller, are said to have embraced the name as their own. A final theory claims that students in the mid-1920s voted to adopt \"Midgets\" as a tongue-in-cheek selection among other proposed names, and the choice ultimately endured. Path forward While the district has yet to determine a new mascot, officials emphasize that the selection process will be a collaborative effort, engaging students, parents and community members to ensure the new identity reflects Dickinson’s values and traditions. DHS LogoDickinson Press file photo District officials said they plan to gather mascot suggestions from students and residents. Once finalists are selected, students in grades 5-12 will vote on the new name and design. “We understand this decision may be difficult for some, especially those with strong memories and emotional ties to the Midget mascot,” Superintendent Lewton, Fridley and Dickinson High School principal Jeff Brandt said in the letter. “For many in our community, this mascot has been a source of pride, tradition and identity. We don’t take this lightly. However, we must recognize that just because something was once acceptable doesn’t mean it aligns with the values we want to uphold today.” 1/2: DHS Letter sent to parents of students on Monday, March 17 Courtesy of Dickinson Public Schools 2/2: DHS Letter sent to parents of students on Monday, March 17 Courtesy of Dickinson Public Schools James B.

Dickinson’s players, being even smaller, are said to have embraced the name as their own. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA final theory claims that students in the mid-1920s voted to adopt \u0026#34;Midgets\u0026#34; as a tongue-in-cheek selection among other proposed names, and the choice ultimately endured.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003e\n                \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            \u003ch2\u003ePath forward\u003c/h2\u003e\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n      \u003cp\u003eWhile the district has yet to determine a new mascot, officials emphasize that the selection process will be a collaborative effort, engaging students, parents and community members to ensure the new identity reflects Dickinson’s values and traditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \n      \u003cdiv data-align-portrait-right=\"\"\u003e\n                \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \u003cfigure\u003e\n    \n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n    \n    \n        \n            \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n            \u003csource type=\"image/webp\" width=\"330\" height=\"440\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/4899cde/2147483647/strip/true/crop/900x1200+350+0/resize/330x440!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2F93%2F7d5c38ac49e7b7653b9f0cc014e8%2Fdickinson-high-school-logo.jpg 1x,https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/d863508/2147483647/strip/true/crop/900x1200+350+0/resize/660x880!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2F93%2F7d5c38ac49e7b7653b9f0cc014e8%2Fdickinson-high-school-logo.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSI0NDBweCIgd2lkdGg9IjMzMHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"/\u003e\n\n    \n\n    \n        \u003csource width=\"330\" height=\"440\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/964856d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/900x1200+350+0/resize/330x440!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2F93%2F7d5c38ac49e7b7653b9f0cc014e8%2Fdickinson-high-school-logo.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSI0NDBweCIgd2lkdGg9IjMzMHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"/\u003e\n\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n    \u003cimg alt=\"Dickinson High School Logo.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/964856d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/900x1200+350+0/resize/330x440!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2F93%2F7d5c38ac49e7b7653b9f0cc014e8%2Fdickinson-high-school-logo.jpg 1x,https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/1261b8b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/900x1200+350+0/resize/660x880!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2F93%2F7d5c38ac49e7b7653b9f0cc014e8%2Fdickinson-high-school-logo.jpg 2x\" width=\"330\" height=\"440\" data-src=\"https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/964856d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/900x1200+350+0/resize/330x440!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2F93%2F7d5c38ac49e7b7653b9f0cc014e8%2Fdickinson-high-school-logo.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSI0NDBweCIgd2lkdGg9IjMzMHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"/\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n\n    \n\n    \n        \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eDHS Logo\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eDickinson Press file photo\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n      \u003cp\u003eDistrict officials said they plan to gather mascot suggestions from students and residents.
