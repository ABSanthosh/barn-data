We're also donating to the inaugural committee,\" Karan Bhatia, Google's global head of government affairs and public policy, told CNBC in a statement.  The company made its donation on Monday. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Meta both announced $1 million donations to the inaugural fund late last year, and Amazon and Apple CEO Tim Cook have also reportedly contributed.After a candidate wins the presidential election in the U.S., they appoint an inaugural committee to organize and finance inaugural events like the opening ceremonies, galas and the parade. Unlike a direct contribution to a candidate's campaign, there are no limits on how much an individual — or a corporation or labor group — can give to an inaugural committee.Google has donated to inaugurals in the past, and the YouTube livestream and link to the inauguration on Google's homepage are in line with previous inaugurations, a spokesperson said.Read more CNBC tech newsAmazon aims to expand advertising business by letting retailers use its ad tools on their storesMicrosoft confirms performance-based job cuts across departmentsNvidia's Jensen Huang is 'dead wrong' about quantum computers, D-Wave CEO saysEBay shares soar after Meta allows listings on Facebook Marketplace in U.S., EuropeTrump has had a rocky relationship with major tech companies over the years and has not shied away from criticism of the sector following the election.
