  "text": "Finding the perfect spot to use a projector isn’t always easy, especially when it comes to portable projectors and outdoor environments. That’s why XGIMI recently launched its own portable outdoor screen for projectors. Meet XGIMI’s Portable Outdoor Screen XGIMI’s Portable Outdoor Screen is a 70-inch screen that can be easily mounted and dismounted, so you can place it in any room you like or even take it outside with you. According to XGIMI, it weighs just 1.5 kg and can be easily folded to fit into a backpack. According to XGIMI, it only takes 60 seconds to mount the portable screen. The screen frame is made of aluminum and it’s water-resistant. The fabric is washable and wrinkle-free, so it stays smooth even after being folded – which is crucial for good image quality. The XGIMI Portable Outdoor Screen works with any long-throw projector, and is perfect for the MoGo 3 Pro – XGIMI’s 1080p portable projector. I have a MoGo 3 Pro and I love its versatility, especially when combined with the PowerBase Stand that works as a powerbank. I always use it connected to my Apple TV as my karaoke setup. XGIMI is selling its Portable Outdoor Screen for just $99.
