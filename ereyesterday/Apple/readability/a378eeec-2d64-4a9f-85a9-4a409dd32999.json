  "text": "We’ve been talking a lot about the rumored “HomePad,” a device that combines both the functionality of a HomePod and an iPad. However, Apple still has plans to update its HomePods – especially the HomePod mini. Here’s a recap of all the latest rumors about the HomePod mini 2. HomePod mini was introduced in 2020 as a smaller, more affordable version of Apple’s speaker. It has the same features as the larger HomePod, including Siri and multi-room audio with AirPlay. However, almost five years have passed and Apple has never updated the HomePod mini aside from adding new colors to the lineup. So what exactly are Apple’s plans for the HomePod mini 2? Here’s what we know so far about a new generation of the product. Latest rumors on HomePod mini 2 While some people are expecting major updates for the HomePod mini, it seems more likely that the new version won’t bring any major changes, especially when it comes to design. Perhaps the biggest change is on the inside. A Bloomberg report last December revealed that Apple has been working on its own wireless chip to replace Broadcom’s Wi-Fi and Bluetooth module. Similar to the C1, Apple’s first 5G modem, this new wireless chip will be more efficient and will also enable new capabilities. The chip is so advanced that it could be used to extend the Wi-Fi signal, thus turning devices into wireless access points. In other words, a device with this new chip could function as a Wi-Fi mesh router. Citing sources familiar with the matter, Bloomberg says that Apple will add its new wireless chip to the next generation Apple TV and also to the HomePod mini 2. However, it’s unclear whether Apple will highlight the new capabilities at launch. For example, the current HomePod mini has temperature and humidity sensors, but they were only enabled two years after launch with a software update. The new HomePod mini is also expected to feature Wi-Fi 6E support, a big leap from the Wi-Fi 4 standard supported by the current generation. Wi-Fi 6E can achieve much higher data transmission speeds and is also much more energy efficient. The more advanced protocol also provides reduced latency, ideal for streaming audio. Unfortunately, there are no rumors about HomePod mini getting support for Apple Intelligence features – especially since they require the A17 Pro chip or later, which Apple may consider too expensive for a $99 product. Now that the new Siri experience has been delayed, this seems to be even less of a priority for Apple. A new HomePod mini is coming next year, and it definitely needs Apple Intelligence According to Mark Gurman, Apple plans to announce the new HomePod mini by the end of the year. What about the other HomePod models? As for the larger HomePod, multiple leaks have revealed that Apple has been exploring the idea of adding an LCD touchscreen to the top of the speaker. With this display, users would be able to access quick playback controls and check information such as the name of the song currently playing. There’s also the HomePad, which was first expected to be announced in the first half of the year, but ended up being delayed due to its high reliance on the new Siri experience.
