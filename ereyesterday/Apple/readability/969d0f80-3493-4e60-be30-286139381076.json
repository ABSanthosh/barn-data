Photo: Cult of Mac Deals With storms and flash floods becoming more prevalent, it’s more important than ever to stay up to date with the weather in your area. And a weather radar app like Weather Hi-Def Radar lets you do just that. This isn’t just an upgraded version of the bare-bones Weather app on your iPhone. It’s an alert system and interactive map that allows you to plan your day and stay ahead of tornadoes, wildfires and more.

And you don’t just get a static map with this weather radar app, either. You’ll get an HD moving display of current and future cloud cover, along with highlighted trouble spots that could affect your commute. It works on iPhone as well as Android devices.
