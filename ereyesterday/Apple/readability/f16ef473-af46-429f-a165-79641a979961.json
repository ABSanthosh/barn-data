  "text": "Apple has just released iOS 18.3. The release isn’t the most feature-packed, but it does come with some small AI updates and also something for the math crowd. There’s a key Calculator app fix that’s been asked for often and that iOS 18.3 delivers. Repeating operations are now possible again following iOS 18 removal When Apple released iOS and iPadOS 18 in September, the updates came with big and small changes to a wide variety of system apps. Calculator was among them. Apple brought Calculator to iPad for the first time, but it also took the opportunity to make some changes to the app on iPhone. Not all of those changes have been well received though. One negative change—which we now know was unintentional—was the removal of a key feature: repeating operations with the equals button. Previously, when making a calculation, you could hit the equals button repeatedly to perform further calculations. This was a great shortcut with a variety of applications. For example, if you entered 2 x 2 and hit equals, you’d see the answer, 4. But you could then hit equals again to have 4 multiplied by 2 again. That answer could then be multiplied by 2 again with another hit of the equals button. iOS 18 removed that behavior, but now it’s been restored to the Calculator app in iOS 18.3. The next time you open your iPhone’s Calculator app, you can once again hit the equals button over and over to perform new operations to your heart’s content. Were you missing this Calculator feature? What other iOS 18 changes need to be addressed? Let us know in the comments.
