  "description": "Macworld The persistent rumor about next week’s WWDC25 keynote is that Apple will introduce a design overhaul across all of its operating systems. Apple doesn’t usually comment on rumors or offer official correspondence before keynotes, but it does like dropping hints, like using translucent WWDC25 graphics, and on Monday, one week before the WWDC25 keynote, Apple dropped its most concrete clue yet. The Apple Developer website was updated with a new header graphic that includes the tagline, “Sleek peek,” which appears to be a direct reference to the design update. So, just in case you weren’t convinced before, you should get ready for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and everything else to get a new look, which has been rumored to take design cues from visionOS. Apple may be putting a heavy emphasis on the new look during the keynote, since it’s reportedly going to downplay–maybe even not say anything at all–about the AI and AI-related features that have been a challenge, according to reports. That’s not to say Apple will have nothing else to talk about. There will be new OS features to introduce, including, rumors say, a new Calendar app, a new gaming app, developer access to Apple’s AI models, and more. The WWDC25 keynote is on June 9 at 10 a.m. Pacific, and can be watched on Apple.com and the Apple YouTube channel. Be sure to check out Macworld.com for complete WWDC25 coverage.",
