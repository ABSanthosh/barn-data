The long-rumored iPhone Fold is widely expected to be in development and is slowly making its way to becoming a full product. As for when that could happen, the wait for consumers may not be that long at all. In Sunday's newsletter for Bloomberg, Mark Gurman talks about Apple's upcoming foldable device. Potentially called the \"iPhone Fold,\" Gurman says he expects the model to arrive \"next year,\" in 2026. Gurman adds that the design for the model could end up being similar to Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold line, which consists of a book-style smartphone with a large folding internal screen, as well as a more conventional external display. As for the specification, he adds that it should use many technologies used in the iPhone 17 Air. In a previous newsletter, it was alleged that the Air would have a Camera Control button, a single 48MP camera on the back, and a number of internal battery changes to create such a thin device. The C1 modem was also thought to be included in the model, which could also be incorporated in the Fold. Schedule hesitationThe latest claim of a 2026 release from Gurman is the most recent in a string of forecasts about the release of the iPhone Fold. While only Apple truly knows when it will come out, that hasn't stopped rumor producers from making their own guesses. The last few proclamations have been for the same year, including analyst Jeff Pu saying a late 2026 launch could happen earlier in March. A bit earlier again, Ming-Chi Kuo proposed that mass production could start in the second half of 2026, but with a tempered launch period of either late 2026 or early 2027. While a 2026 launch seems feasible, it is only the most recent analyst and leaker speculation for something that has been rumored to be on the horizon for some time already. It also follows speculation that Apple's initial folding device efforts, such as a folding iPad or MacBook Pro, may not arrive until 2027 or even 2028.",
