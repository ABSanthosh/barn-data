  "text": "If you’ve been holding out hope that Apple might soon release a new “mini” version of the iPhone, it’s time to move on. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that Apple has no plans to release another “iPhone mini” device. During a Q\u0026A with Bloomberg subscribers this week, Gurman was asked about the possibility of Apple releasing something similar to the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 mini. He responded: You know, we’ll see what the market tells Apple. Right now they’re not working on anything. They’re not working on a smaller iPhone right now. They’ve really shifted away. They’re trying to make that, you know, roughly 6-inch display that is the base size, and they’re just trying to go bigger and bigger and bigger. And the bigger you go, the smaller the 6-inch phones feel. This doesn’t come as a surprise. There were no previous indications that Apple was working on a new iPhone mini form factor. Nonetheless, there’s a vocal (and I mean vocal) minority of iPhone users out there who want that size-class to return, so this report will crush some dreams. Apple introduced the iPhone 12 mini with a 5.4-inch screen in 2020 and followed it up with the iPhone 13 mini the following year. With the iPhone 14 lineup in 2022, however, Apple abandoned the “mini” form factor and replaced it with the iPhone 14 Plus. The iPhone 13 mini remained a product in Apple’s lineup as a lower-cost option until 2023 when it was discontinued once and for all. This year, the iPhone 16 Plus is expected to be replaced by the all-new, ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air. It seems apparent that neither the “mini” nor “Plus” strategies panned out like Apple had hoped. Do you think Apple should make another “iPhone mini” device? Let us know in the comments.
