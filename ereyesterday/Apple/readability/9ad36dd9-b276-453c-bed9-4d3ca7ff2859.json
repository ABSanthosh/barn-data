  "text": "Apple’s AirPods 4 are available in two different versions: one with ANC active noise cancellation and support for MagSafe chargers. And if you have AirPods 4, read on as we’ve put together a list of some of the best protective cases and lanyards for Apple’s wireless earbuds. Cases for AirPods 4 AirPods come in a charging case that also protects the earbuds when they’re not in use. However, some users may want to add extra protection with an external case, or simply want a decorative case. ESR, a popular accessory maker for Apple devices, has different cases for AirPods 4. One of them, Cloud, has a soft finish and a cleaner look, while the other (Orbit) is made of hard plastic and has a more detailed finish. ESR also has the Cyber series with a more rugged design for full protection. They’re available in a variety of colors. ESR Cloud Case for AirPods 4: $9.99 ESR Orbit Case for AirPods 4: $11.99 ESR Cyber Case for AirPods 4: $12.99 Another popular case for AirPods 4 is the silicone case made by ORNARTO, which covers the entire charging case with double-layer protection. The case is available in 17 beautiful colors and also comes with a lanyard. ORNARTO Case for AirPods 4: $12.99 ORNARTO also has an even more resistant case made of premium TPU with an irridescent finish, which is available in five different colors – and it comes with a lanyard. ORNARTO Iridescent Case for AirPods 4: $17.99 If you’re looking for more fun-looking cases, DamonLight has an amazing game controller case for AirPods 4 that’s also shockproof and comes with a keychain. Another cool option is the Elago case inspired by Nintendo’s Game Boy. And if you prefer something more flower-inspired, the Maxjoy case is just what you need. DamonLight Game Case for AirPods 4: $7.99 Elago Game Boy Case for AirPods 4: $12.99 Maxjoy Case for AirPods 4: $9.98 Spigen also has a sturdy case with a matte black finish for AirPods 4, and it is MagSafe compatible.
