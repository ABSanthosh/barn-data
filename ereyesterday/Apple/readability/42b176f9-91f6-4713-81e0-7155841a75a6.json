  "text": "As part of the Safer Internet Day 2025 awareness campaign, the popular messaging platform Discord announced on Monday a new feature that will help users ignore other people without them knowing. With just a button, you can now easily mute someone on Discord. Discord now has an ‘Ignore’ button Called “Ignore,” the new feature does exactly what it promises – help you ignore other people. Discord says the idea is to let users “take space from specific people without them knowing.” The Ignore button can be used to take some time away or to discreetly avoid talking to someone specific you don’t want to talk to. Discord already has an option to block another user, which prevents any interactions coming from the blocked account. However, the company says it has heard from users that blocking someone sometimes feels “confrontational and scary,” especially among teenagers. The Ignore button also limits interactions, but the other person won’t know they’ve been blocked. When you choose to ignore a person, their messages, DMs, notifications, or any other status updates are hidden from you. All you have to do is go to the person’s profile, tap the three dots button, and then choose Ignore. “While tools like Ignore help you manage your interactions, it’s equally important to stay aware of potential threats online,” Discord warns its users. The platform is also teaming up with a new non-profit organization called ROOST, or Robust Open Online Safety Tools, which will offer free, open-source tools for detecting and reporting child sexual abuse material (CSAM). ROOST is also supported by companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Roblox. You can access Discord on the web or download the iOS app from the App Store.
