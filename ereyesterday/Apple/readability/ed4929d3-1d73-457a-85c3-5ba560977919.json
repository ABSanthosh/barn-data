  "text": "News The Studio mocks movie studio executives… like these. Photo: Apple TV+ Apple TV+ has another hit. Enough viewers checked out the recently launched The Studio to make it the most popular series on streaming, according to a company that tracks ratings. The Apple TV+ comedy stars Seth Rogen and relentlessly mocks Hollywood and the film industry. In addition, Apple’s weird workplace drama Severance stayed popular even after its season 2 finale. The Studio gets good ratings skewering Hollywood While many of the highest-rated series on Apple TV+ are dramas and sci-fi, the streaming service offers plenty of comedies, too. Shrinking is a good example, and of course, there’s Ted Lasso. Apple’s latest foray into the genre is The Studio, starring Seth Rogen, who also serves as co-creator, writer and director. Movie and TV search engine JustWatch publishes a weekly ratings list of the 10 most popular series on streaming, and The Studio sits right up there at No. 1 for the week of March 24 through March 30. Rival service Reelgood put the show in the No. 4 slot on its list for top rated series for the week of March 27 to April 2. A ratings services says The Studio is the most popular streaming series. And Severance still draws plenty of eyes, too.Chart: JustWatch Ratings estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings The official Apple TV+ description says: “In The Studio, Seth Rogen stars as Matt Remick, the newly appointed head of embattled Continental Studios. As movies struggle to stay alive and relevant, Matt and his core team of infighting executives battle their own insecurities as they wrangle narcissistic artists and craven corporate overlords in the ever-elusive pursuit of making great films. With their power suits masking their never-ending sense of panic, every party, set visit, casting decision, marketing meeting and award show presents them with an opportunity for glittering success or career-ending catastrophe. As someone who eats, sleeps and breathes movies, it’s the job Matt’s been pursuing his whole life, and it may very well destroy him.” The Cult of Mac review says, “The Studio blends sharp industry critique with genuine appreciation for filmmaking. Through its clever storytelling, stellar performances, and exceptional production, the series offers viewers a rare glimpse into Hollywood — the good and the bad.” The first three episodes of the series are ready to watch now. The next premieres on Wedneday. Severance keeps a post-season audience Even after its season 2 finale,  Severance stayed near the top of the lists of top-rated streaming series. Not surprising considering one company put the drama at the very peak of its ratings charts five times during the weeks new episodes were appearing. And Apple itself says the drama passed Ted Lasso as the most popular Apple TV+ show ever. Last week, JustWatch put it in the No. 4 slot on its list of popular shows on any streaming service, while ReelGood put it at No. 7. In the hit series, Mark Scout (played by Adam Scott) leads a team of employees who’ve undergone a severance procedure that surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Scout finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work … and of himself. As noted, the season finale of Severance season two debuted last week, so the entire show is ready to binge watch. Be sure you didn’t miss anything important with Cult of Mac’s recaps of episode one, episode two, episode three, episode four, episode five, episode six, episode seven, episode eight, episode nine and episode ten. Plus, start looking forward to Severance season three, which already got an official greenlight from Apple. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming hits like The Studio and Severance, plus many others comes with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. And Apple’s streaming video service also includes a library of drama, comedies, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
