  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Time2Pack is an all-in one app for your travel needs for iPhone and iPad, offering a robust packing list feature, guides to help you pack, flight tracking, and more. It’s an ultimate travel companion, alleviating a lot of the stress that can come with preparing for a trip. Highlights One of Time2Pack’s core features is the ability to easily create a packing list. One of the top travel anxieties for many people definitely has to do with packing, as well as making sure you don’t accidentally forget something important. The app offers robust packing lists, with features to help you build your packing list based on destination, activities, and trip length. Once you have your packing list, the app breaks items apart by category, and separates packed items from unpacked items, making it very clear for the user. On top of that, the app has a nice overview UI, showing you the weather in your destination for your travel days. You can also monitor your flight see all of the photos you took while on the trip, save documents, and keep notes – making it a convenient hub for everything travel. About Time2Pack Time2Pack was developed in 2022 after cofounders (and partners) Kate and Alex took a last minute trip and ended up forgetting some key items. The mistake ended up costing them around 200 euros, and also cost them a whole day of travel to find items! As a result, they got to building, and Time2Pack launched in January 2023, focusing on just the packing list aspects of things. Obviously, it’s grown since then. Recently, they’ve revamped the payment model, with most of the features being available for free, including unlimited trips, packing list suggestions, and more. With the pro plan, you unlock unlimited flight tracking (versus just your first 2 for free), notifications for flight changes/delays, and some additional features like customization. Download the app Time2Pack is available on the App Store for free with most features, and you can subscribe to Pro for $1.99/month, $9.99/6 months, or $14.99/year. You’ll need an iPhone or iPad running iOS 15 or later. It’s also compatible with macOS and visionOS as an iPad app. Follow Michael: X/Twitter, Threads, Instagram Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
