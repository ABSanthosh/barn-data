  "text": "Logitech hasn’t officially launched the successor to the MX Master 3S, a.k.a. my favorite mouse ever, but it might be close. The company recently submitted documentation for Bluetooth certification in Brazil, just as an (accidental?) teaser appeared on its official Instagram. As reported by Brazilian tech site Tecnoblog, the MX Master 4, listed under model number MR0118, has just passed certification by Anatel, Brazil’s telecom regulator and local equivalent of the FCC. Felipe Freitas/Tecnoblog The approval was granted on May 9, and was required due to the device’s Bluetooth connectivity. As such, it falls under the regulator’s “restricted radiation transceivers” category. Whoops! The certification documents didn’t include product images, but Logitech may have taken care of that themselves: a promotional image briefly popped up on the company’s feed and, naturally, it immediately ended up on Reddit before being taken down following a legal request. Which is why we’re only linking to it, as we’re not exactly eager to get acquainted with their lawyers. Based on the leaked image, the changes seem subtle but noticeable. The side scroll wheel appears to have been nudged slightly forward and upward, while the primary click buttons now take up more space, instead of ceding ground to the Magspeed wheel base. While the MX line is best known for high-end productivity use, especially among creatives and coders, its customization, gesture controls and multi-device pairing make it equally appealing for more casual use and even some light gaming. Logitech hasn’t made any public announcements yet, but with certification out of the way and marketing assets already in place, it’s safe to assume the MX Master 4 launch is imminent. And I’m so here for it. Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.",
