It's that time of year again — the Steam Summer Sale. It's the perfect time to snatch up all those games you've been eyeballing for the past year.

Best Mac sci-fi base builder on sale: Oxygen Not IncludedOxygen not Included is a space-colony simulation game where players manage a group of duplicants trying to survive in an underground asteroid base.

Best Mac dystopian adventure game on sale: Cyberpunk 2077In Cyberpunk 2077, players take on the role of V, a mercenary in a dystopian future ruled by body mods and corporate power. Combat, hacking, and shifting loyalties shape a story about how much of yourself you're willing to give up to get ahead. Cyberpunk 2077Keen-eyed readers will not that Cyberpunk 2077 isn't out for macOS — yet. However, the 65% discount drops the price to $20.99, making it too good of a deal to pass up. When it is released, it will be available for Apple Silicon machines. Best Mac retro platformer on sale: BroforceChaos, explosions, and pixelated patriotism define Broforce, a side-scrolling action game where every level is a tribute to over-the-top '80s action heroes.

It requires 8 GB RAM, but the creators suggest having at least 16 GB for the best experience. Best Mac city builder on sale: Cities: SkylinesCities: Skylines is a city-building sim that puts players in charge of everything from zoning and traffic to public services and budgets. As the mayor, you learn that it's less about instant gratification and more about managing slow, but often chaotic, urban growth.

To play, you'll need to be running macOS X 10.11 or better, have 6 GB of RAM, and at least 4 GB of available space.
