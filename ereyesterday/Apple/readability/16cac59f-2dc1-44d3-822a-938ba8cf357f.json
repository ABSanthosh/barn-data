  "text": "One of the most beloved indie weather apps just got a massive overhaul, and it’s worth checking out as your new daily driver. The whole app has been modernized and rebuilt from the ground up, and it feels great. Hello Weather has always been known for its simple, friendly, super readable design, but the new update pairs that simplicity with more depth, sophistication, and powerful new features. There are beautiful new summaries and visualizations for over a dozen data points like Wind, Air Quality, UV Index, and Moon phases. That’s along with extended hourly forecasts, excellent forecasts for the week ahead, and tons of little options to tune the app’s icons, themes, and layouts however you like them. The new update addresses some longstanding feature gaps, too: Hello Weather now has push notifications, a revamped radar, and an excellent refreshed Apple Watch app and complications. It also supports a dozen different data providers. You can switch from Apple Weather’s forecasts to ultra-detailed info from AccuWeather, Foreca, The Weather Company, and lots more. Stick with the source that’s best for your area, or swap between them to compare forecasts. Hello Weather respects your privacy, with one of the best data collection policies in the category. The app doesn’t track any user-identifiable data, sell ads, or anything like that. It’s a customer-focused app, thoughtfully designed, and made with care.
