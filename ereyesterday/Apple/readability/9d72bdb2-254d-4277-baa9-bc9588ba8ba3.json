  "text": "NewsTop Stories Darkly funny thriller series Bad Sisters returns November 13! Photo: Apple TV+ Bad Sisters season two sees the Garvey women scrambling in the aftermath of the darkly funny thriller’s first season, a new trailer Apple TV+ dropped Tuesday shows. Will they get away with the “accidental death”? Or will they break ranks and trip up as the law and nosey strangers close in? Season two of the popular and acclaimed series debuts on Apple TV+ November 13. Watch out for season one spoilers below, by the way, in case you haven’t streamed it yet (and you really should). Update: The first pair of episodes of Bad Sisters season two premiered Wednesday.  It’s two years after J.P.’s death, and it might be time for what the Garvey women did in season one to catch up to them. Bad Sisters season 2: The aftermath The trailer for Bad Sisters season two opens with the sisters opening a car trunk at the edge of a cliff by the sea in the middle of the night. Nothing suspicious here, folks! Before the slowly opening trunk suddenly pops all the way open, scaring the bejeezus out of them, the camera spies what looks like a big spotted dog in there. Possibly dead. Possibly not a dog. So that’s interesting. And that’s just the “hi, we’re back” opener. The show stars Emmy Award nominee and BAFTA Award winner Sharon Horgan (also its co-creator and an executive producer), along with Anne-Marie Duff, Eva Birthistle, Sarah Greene and Eve Hewson. The eight-episode second season premieres on Apple TV+ with the first two episodes on Wednesday, November 13, followed by one episode weekly every Wednesday through December 25. Yeah, right: ‘T’ings are finally looking up’ Darkly funny thriller series Bad Sisters returns November 13!Photo: Apple TV+ Then, as Fiona Apple’s “Criminal” plays in the background, the trailer moves on to scenes of life in their Irish town, including a big wedding. “After everything that happened, things are finally looking up,” a sister says in voiceover as the joyful occasion unfolds. But “everything that happened” involved dealing with a malevolent brother in law in a way that sets the scene for a dicey aftermath as the law closes in, or at least bumbles in their general direction as suspicions build and lies fly. And that would be season two, in a nutshell. “The world is better off without him,” a sister urgently whispers in a pub, trying to reassure a non-sister accomplice. “Even the Pope would say that.” And that reference to the pontiff wins an award-winning glare from the older sister, played by Horgan, like an eye roll without the actual rolling eye. She can do a lot with a look, like any of these tight-knit siblings can. Here’s how the streamer describes the second season of Bad Sisters, which features the excellent Fiona Shaw (Killing Eve) harboring major suspicions: Two years after the “accidental death” of Grace’s abusive husband, the close-knit Garvey sisters may have moved on, but when past truths resurface, the ladies are thrust back into the spotlight, suspicions are at an all-time high, lies are told, secrets are revealed and the sisters are forced to work out who they can trust. A delicious blend of both dark comedy and thriller, the critically acclaimed series welcomes new and returning cast members to its second season, including Fiona Shaw, Owen McDonnell, Thaddea Graham, Barry Ward, Michael Smiley, Saise Quinn, Daryl McCormack, Yasmine Akram, Jonjo O’Neill, Peter Claffey, Deirdre Mullins, Lorcan Cranitch, Liz Fitzgibbon and Justine Mitchell. Watch the trailer for Bad Sisters season 2 Accolades for the show and its bad sisters Apple TV+ pointed out the first season of Bad Sisters landed a BAFTA Television Award for Best Drama Series, alongside a Best Supporting Actress win for star Anne-Marie Duff. The series has also been honored with a Peabody Award and four Emmy Award nominations, including the first acting nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for Sharon Horgan, and Outstanding Casting, Writing and Directing for a Drama Series. And not only those, but recognition rolled in from the Writers Guild of America Awards, the Critics Choice Awards, the Royal Television Society Awards, and the Irish Film and Television Awards. Horgan, Faye Dorn and Clelia Mountford for Merman Television executive produce the show. Dearbhla Walsh also serves as executive producer and director. Additional executive producers include Bert Hamelinck, Michael Sagol, Dave Finkel and Brett Baer. Finkel and Baer adapted the first season with Horgan from the Belgian series Clan, created by Malin-Sarah Gozin. Gozin also serves as an executive producer.
