  "text": "News The new Apple TV+ series Murderbot offers a mix of action and laughs. Photo: Apple TV+ The sci-fi action comedy Murderbot exploded onto the ratings charts the first week it reached streaming. The latest series from Apple TV+ hit high on the top 10 lists of two companies that track ratings. Plus, crime drama Your Friends and Neighbors and the comedy The Studio continues be popular week after week. They give Apple three current hit shows. Murderbot ratings: Immediate popularity Apple TV+ generally does well with sci-fi series, which isn’t surprising for a computer maker. Silo, Dark Matter, Foundation and others have all been hits for the streaming service. Murderbot, Apple’s latest foray into the genre, is about a cyborg — part robot, part human — built to provide security in very dangerous situations. The series follow the cyborg as it breaks the programming that forces it to kill … and then goes looking for a purpose. But don’t expect a traditional action show, as there’s plenty of comedy mixed in. Alexander Skarsgård, who won Emmys, Golden Globes and SAG awards for roles that include Succession, Big Little Lies and True Blood plays the eponymous lead character. The adaptation was done by Oscar nominees Chris and Paul Weitz (About a Boy, Mozart in the Jungle). It premiered on Apple TV+ on May 16, and movie and TV search engine JustWatch put Murderbot in the No. 3 slot of its ratings list of the 10 most popular series in the U.S. on streaming services for the week of May 12 through May 18 (see chart below). Rival service Reelgood also put the show in the No. 3 slot on its list for top-rated series for the week of May 15 through May 21. A ratings service says Murderbot is one of the most popular streaming series. Plus, Your Friends and Neighbors and The Studio draw plenty of eyes, too.Photo: JustWatch Ratings estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. The first three episodes of Murderbot season 1 can be watched now. The next is scheduled to appear on Friday. Your Friends and Neighbors stays popular week after week Since its debut in April, Your Friends and Neighbors stayed consistently popular. Some of this has to be because it stars Jon Hamm, best known for his suave good looks and iconic role as Don Draper in the critically acclaimed television series Mad Men. And the premise is interesting, as well. In the show, Hamm plays Andrew “Coop” Cooper, who gets fired in disgrace from his high-paying job as a hedge fund manager and must resort to stealing from his affluent neighbors’ homes. There, Coop discovers that the secrets and affairs hidden behind those wealthy facades might be more dangerous than he ever imagined. Whatever the cause, JustWatch put the series at No. 5 on its chart of most popular streaming series last week (see chart above), and it’s at No. 4 on Reelgood’s list. The first eight episodes of Your Friends and Neighbors are ready to stream now. The next appears on Friday. The Studio still gets high ratings skewering Hollywood While many of the highest-rated series on Apple TV+ are dramas and sci-fi, the streaming service offers plenty of popular comedies, too. One of Apple’s latest forays into the genre is The Studio, starring Seth Rogen, who also serves as co-creator, writer and director. This is the eighth week in a row that JustWatch placed the show on its top 10 list compiled from streaming ratings. The company put the series at No. 8 on its most recent chart (see above). The official Apple TV+ description says: “In The Studio, Seth Rogen stars as Matt Remick, the newly appointed head of embattled Continental Studios. As movies struggle to stay alive and relevant, Matt and his core team of infighting executives battle their own insecurities as they wrangle narcissistic artists and craven corporate overlords in the ever-elusive pursuit of making great films. With their power suits masking their never-ending sense of panic, every party, set visit, casting decision, marketing meeting and award show presents them with an opportunity for glittering success or career-ending catastrophe. As someone who eats, sleeps and breathes movies, it’s the job Matt’s been pursuing his whole life, and it may very well destroy him.” The Cult of Mac review says, “The Studio blends sharp industry critique with genuine appreciation for filmmaking. Through its clever storytelling, stellar performances, and exceptional production, the series offers viewers a rare glimpse into Hollywood — the good and the bad.” All ten episodes of the series are ready to watch now, as the season finale premiered on Wednesday. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming hits like Murderbot, Your Friends and Neighbors and The Studio, plus many others, come with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. And Apple’s streaming video service also includes a library of drama, comedies, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
