That’s $300 off the Apple retail price on the exact same model! It’s not clear how long this deal price will be available, but if you’ve been in the market for a great entry level Mac laptop, this might be up your alley. The MacBook Air with M2 chip features 13.6″ Retina LCD display (which is easier on the eyes for anyone sensitive to PWM), 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage, a backlit keyboard, 1080p camera, MagSafe charger, two USB-C ports, and is available in a variety of color options. Grab the M2 MacBook Air for just $699.99 (down $300 from $999) The deal price is available on select colors and only for the base model, some of them require the on-page coupon to be clipped as shown below, whereas others will just show the new $699.99 discounted price on the brand new MacBook Air.
