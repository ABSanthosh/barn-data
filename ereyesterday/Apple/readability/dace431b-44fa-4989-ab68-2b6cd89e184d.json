Apple is likely to launch a refreshed Apple Vision Pro headset before a cheaper version of the product arrives, according to a new report. Apple is believed to be working on \"several ideas\" for its overall Apple Vision product line and its future intentions. Currently, it is expected that an updated Apple Vision Pro will be the first, ahead of a rumored cheaper \"Apple Vision\" headset. The next Apple Vision Pro would likely sport an M5 processor and other internal changes, but would otherwise be very similar to the existing model. It's expected to arrive in late 2025, reports Bloomberg, or the spring of 2026. For those hoping for a less-expensive version, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that such a device has been pushed back to at least 2027. Kuo reasoned that simply making a cheaper model wouldn't significantly change sales expectations. Apple is also said to be investigating the \"smart glasses\" concept as seen from Meta, which has already been shown off in demonstrations. Apple hopes to increase interest in the Apple Vision Pro by releasing a second-gen headset with the upgraded processor and other improvements right at the start of the M5 chip cycle. It is thought that this second-gen version would be an upgrade to the existing design, but an all-new version is forecast for some time beyond 2027.",
