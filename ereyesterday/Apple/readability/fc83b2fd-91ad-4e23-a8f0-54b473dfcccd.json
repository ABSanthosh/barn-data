Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeFirst, there's actually not much new to discuss here. He confirmed our suspicions that the glassy edges reflect light based on device tilt, showed a new TabView UI, and more pill shapes across the system that are reminiscent of Apple Vision Pro's operating system visionOS. The biggest part of the leak here is the Home Screen app icons. Prosser shows a more-rounded squircle that's still not quite a circle. If these icon shapes look familiar, it is because some Android skins have this icon shape. Round app icons are also an Android thing, so it seems odd that Apple would abandon its classic squircle. Apps with tabs will get more animations and floating bars Prosser dubbed TabView. These mimic floating UI elements already present in iOS, but have more lively animations like the Dynamic Island. Prosser also showed off a new search UI in iMessage that wasn't in the original iOS 19 leak video. It is simply a floating pill-shaped button that sits at the bottom of the app. The Settings app was also shown with more tweaks and a longer, skinnier toggle switch. It isn't clear if these new tidbits will cross the threshold of \"significant\" by Mark Gurman's definition. Instead of writing a new social media post, he just reposted what he said before, calling the \"images floating around\" not \"representative.\" The new leak may have shown possible new icon shapes, but it really wasn't much in addition to what was shown before. It likely means Prosser will continue to push back against Gurman and attempt to find something more significant to share. Whatever the case, all will be revealed during WWDC 2025 on June 9.",
