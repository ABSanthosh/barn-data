  "text": "We’re likely going to see yet another version of AirPods Pro this September, alongside the launch of the iPhone 17 lineup. Despite the current set of AirPods Pro coming up on nearly three years old, I don’t think that those in the market to buy new AirPods should necessarily waste their time waiting for a potentially upcoming model. AirPods Pro 2 keep getting better Even though we should get a new pair of AirPods Pro in the coming months, that hasn’t stopped Apple from continually making this pair of AirPods better and better. Just last fall, Apple introduced two key health features to AirPods Pro 2: a medical-grade FDA-approved hearing aid feature, and a new hearing protection feature. On top of that, Apple will reportedly be introducing additional software upgrades to AirPods Pro 2 with iOS 26 later this fall. One of the headlining upgrades? A new live translation feature. You’ll be able to have a real-time conversation with someone in another language, and your AirPods Pro 2 will be able to translate the correspondence in real time. Obviously, AirPods Pro 3 will have additional upgrades that may be worth waiting out for, including a new heart-rate monitor – which has already made its debut on Powerbeats Pro 2. That said, it’s not like you’re necessarily buying dated tech if you buy AirPods Pro 2 today. They’re continually evolving. USB-C already arrived Another big reason why AirPods Pro 2 aren’t a bad buy, even today, is because they’ve already made the switch to USB-C. Even though they initially debuted with the Lightning connector in 2022, Apple refreshed them with USB-C a year later, alongside the launch of the iPhone 15 lineup. So, if you’re looking to streamline your charging setup and eliminate the Lightning port from yet another device in your ecosystem, AirPods Pro 2 will do the job for you just fine. There’s no time like the present Even though you could easily choose to play the waiting game for AirPods Pro 3, it isn’t necessarily just a matter of waiting another 4 months. Sure, AirPods Pro 3 could release as early as September. However, once they do release, you’ll have to buy them at full price of $249, potentially even higher if Apple thinks it’s justifiable. With AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation now existing, it is plausible that Apple could choose to move AirPods Pro 3 slightly higher in the lineup, perhaps at $279. If you buy a pair right now, though, you can take advantage of the fact that third-party retailers have incredible deals on AirPods Pro 2. For example, you can pick them up on Amazon right now for just $199. That’s $50 less than what you’d typically pay. You could buy four Apple Polishing Cloths with those savings. Or, more reasonably, an AirTag 4-pack. Wrap up With AirPods Pro 2 continually getting better, combined with all of the great deals of today – there’s certainly something to be said about still choosing to purchase a pair right now. Plus, it certainly can’t hurt to upgrade sooner than later with all of the uncertainty around global tariffs – especially if you’re coming from an older pair of AirPods (or don’t have wireless headphones at all!) AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) – $199 on Amazon (25% off!) One last thing of note: the September launch date of AirPods Pro 3 is just based on current reporting. Things change, and they could easily launch later. Are you eyeing AirPods Pro 2, especially with all of their recent software improvements? Let us know in the comments.
