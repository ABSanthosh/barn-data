  "text": "Apple releases visionOS 2.1 RC 2 The visionOS 2.1 release candidate has been updated just one day after its release with a fix for Apple Music. Apple Intelligence is set to launch with iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 on or around October 28, so Apple is gearing up for those operating system releases. The release candidates went out to developers on Monday for nearly every OS, including visionOS 2.1, but it introduced a minor bug. On Tuesday, Apple patched that bug with a quiet visionOS 2.1 RC 2 release. The release notes state that the new RC fixes an Apple Music bug that prevented songs and videos from playing. visionOS 2.1 RC 2 is build 22N581 up from 22N580. There's not much going on with visionOS 2.1 beyond standard bug fixes and other improvements. Apple Vision Pro is going to get access to Apple Intelligence features at a later date, but it is not among the launch devices. Apple short-cycled the previous beta updates as well, with beta 6 arriving just days after beta 5. These quick beta cycles haven't been accompanied by user complaints about issues with the platform during testing, but Apple may be trying to stay ahead of potential issues with the nascent platform. All signs point to the new operating system updates being released on October 28. The current run of release candidates should be the final version going out to customers.",
