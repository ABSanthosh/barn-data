  "text": "The popular Opera web browser has just released a major update for its iPhone and iPad app. With the new version, Opera is making it easier for users to interact with Aria – the company’s built-in AI – through new Home Screen widgets. Read on as we detail everything that’s new with the latest Opera update for iOS. As detailed in a blog post, the latest version of Opera for iOS brings new Home Screen widgets. These widgets are fully customizable and let users access key features of the web browser in a single tap. For instance, you can use the widget to open a new tab in Private Mode or even Ask Aria. There’s more: if you long-press on the icon, you’ll find even more shortcuts. “These additions speed up your daily browsing by giving you one-tap access to the features that matter most,” Opera says. But there’s another important change coming with this update. Opera’s Aria AI is now available for anyone to use, even when you’re not signed in. With Aria, users can ask questions via text or voice input. Aria can search the web and is even capable of generating images using Google’s Imagen 3 Fast model. According to Opera, all you need to do to use Aria without an account is update the iOS app to the latest version. The only thing to keep in mind is that image generation is limited to five images per day when you’re not signed in, while registered users can generate up to 30 images per day. Opera also thanks iOS users for the “significant growth recently.” Innovative, user-focused updates like these have spurred Opera for iOS to some significant growth recently. Between September and November 2024, our flagship browser for iPhone recorded a 33% increase in new users across the European Union and a 31% rise around the world! So our thanks to you – you’re the reason we keep coming up with exciting new features as we look to craft the very best browning experience possible. The Opera browser for iOS is available for free on the App Store. It requires an iPhone or iPad running iOS 14 or later.
