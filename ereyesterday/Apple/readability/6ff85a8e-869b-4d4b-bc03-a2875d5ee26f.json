Normally, that means three cables and three AC outlets, but that doesn't have to be the case. Wireless charging stations have been around for a long time, and some of them are pretty great. With the launch of Qi2 in 2024, many of them have been refreshed with the upgraded spec — including the Satechi Trio. As the name suggests, this device can wirelessly charge three things simultaneously: an iPhone, an Apple Watch, and AirPods. It does it quickly, and dare I say, it does it in style to boot. I've been testing the upgraded Satechi Qi2 Trio Wireless Charging Pad for a few weeks, so how did it stack up? Let's put it this way: I now have two free AC outlets, and I can finally use StandBy mode. Let me explain. Satechi Qi2 Trio 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad review: Powered-up specsYou could be forgiven for thinking that all chargers are created equal, but you'd be very wrong. That's especially true when moving from a cable to a wireless charger. Satechi Qi2 Trio review: Charge your iPhone using magnets or gravity, it's up to youYou can get a wireless charger for relatively little these days, but they'll charge incredibly slowly. Standard Qi chargers top out at 7.5W, which isn't a lot, whereas newer Qi2 chargers double that to 15W. The Qi2 Trio, predictably, supports the newer Qi2 standard, adding magnets to the specification. If that sounds like MagSafe, it should — Qi2 is based on it. The result is that this wireless charger can charge your iPhone almost as quickly as it can when using the cable that comes in the box. You're still going to want to use that cable if speed is of the essence, though. The Qi2 Trio can even fast-charge modern Apple Watches, too. If you have an Apple Watch Series 7 or newer, it'll charge at 5W, just like Apple's charging puck. That's a relatively new addition for third-party chargers, and it's a welcome one, especially for sleep trackers like me. I throw my Apple Watch Series 10 on the charger before I have a shower, and it's always full when I need it. Finally, we get to the AirPods charger, which also reaches 5W. That's as fast as an AirPods charging case can go, so that's pretty standard fare. The Qi2 Trio holds your Apple Watch vertically so you can use Nightstand Mode. That has the added benefit of meaning you don't need to remove any bands when charging. Next, your AirPods sit flat on their back on the charging pad to the right of your Apple Watch. Things get more interesting when we get to the iPhone charger. Powering your iPhone presents two options: either charge it flat on its back or extend a metal arm that holds it in the air. Choose the latter, and the iPhone can be in any orientation you like, too. This, of course, means that StandBy Mode is supported. If you have an iPhone with an always-on display, that's doubly cool. Even without the always-on component, StandBy Mode turns your iPhone into a futuristic alarm clock — and the Qi2 Trio makes it all possible. It goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway: you can charge all three devices simultaneously. And Satechi includes a 45W USB-C adapter and cable in the box. As for the industrial design, Satechi uses a premium-grade aluminum enclosure that makes everything feel solid. The heft just makes it feel like a quality bit of kit, which doesn't hurt. Satechi Qi2 Trio 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad review: Compatible devicesYou'll need to have a compatible device to use this charger, but the chances are good that you do. All iPhone 12 or newer models support MagSafe and, by extension, will work just fine with all Qi2 chargers. Satechi Qi2 Trio review: It doesn't look much, but this charger has it all.All Apple Watches will charge when using the Qi2 Trio. However, you need an Apple Watch Series 7 or newer to benefit from the fastest charging speeds. Any AirPods with a wireless charging case are good to go here. In the current lineup, that means AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 (ANC) can be charged wirelessly. As for future models, future iPhones will likely work just fine thanks to the Qi2 standard. The same can likely be said for AirPods, although future models might support faster charging that the Qi2 Trio can't match. The Apple Watch could be the outlier here, unfortunately. If Apple chooses to use a new wireless charging system in the future, you might need a new charger to go with it. Satechi Qi2 Trio 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad review: It's time to ditch those cablesAs I said at the top of this review, I've been using the Satechi Qi2 Trio for a few weeks now. And it had pride of place on my bedside table until recently. The only reason it's no longer there? My wife claimed it because she was tired of losing her Apple Watch and iPhone cables down the side of the bed. That, right there, tells a story that will no doubt resonate with plenty of people reading this. You just cannot beat the convenience of just putting your stuff down and watching it charge. Add in the fact that the charging pad opens the door to Nightstand Mode and Standby Mode, and it's a winner for me. The fact that it charges so quickly is the icing on the cake. I'd heartily recommend the Satechi Qi2 Trio Wireless Charging Pad, especially if you can find it at a discount. Its usual $130 price isn't bad considering it comes with a 45W adapter in the box, but it ain't cheap. Satechi Qi2 Trio 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad review: Pros Unbeatable convenience As fast as wireless chargers get You'll get some cables and outlets back The metal construction oozes quality Satechi Qi2 Trio 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad review: Cons $100 might be too much for some Question marks over future Apple Watch compatibility It's so good, yours might be \"borrowed\" by your spouse Rating: 4 out of 5Where to buy the Satechi Qi2 TrioYou can buy the Satechi Qi2 Trio Wireless Charging Pad from Amazon for $99.99. You can also buy it directly from Satechi's website, but you'll pay $30 more if you do.",
