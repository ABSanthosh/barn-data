Following the relocation of stores such as the UK's Apple Trafford Center, and the closure of Apple Northbrook in Chicago, a further store has been announced as being redeveloped. Apple Crocker Park, in the Westlake, Ohio, shopping village looks to be about to relocate and perhaps expand. Apple Crocker Park's website has been updated with a headline that says, \"Get ready. Great things are in store. A brand-new Apple Store is coming soon.\" There are no further details, either as to what may be done to the store, or when. Unlike the Apple Trafford Center store which showed early closing times ahead of its relocation, Apple Crocker Park continues to list regular store hours. Originally opened in September 2008, it hasn't been updated since and continues to be in the same brushed steel-and-glass style that Apple has been moving away from in its more recent stores. Apple Crocker Park is a small store, sandwiched between clothing retailer Buckle and mattress outlet Sleep Number. Apple doesn't even operate the whole plot, as a segment of its floor space has been given over instead to Canary Travel. Overall, Crocker Park shopping village is expanding with a reported 11 new stores and restaurants announced as coming. Thos include more fashion and clothing stores, such as Garage and Tradehome Shoes. According to the shopping village's owners, the existing home furnishings retailer Arhaus — currently on the same Crocker Park Boulevard as Apple — is to both relocate and expand its space in the center. Consequently, given the small size of the current Apple Store, plus the apparent popularity of the shopping village and the option to relocate, it's likely that Apple will be moving to larger or more prominent premises within Crocker Park. Apple's previously-revealed plans for store relocations in 2025 include Perth, Australia, Wichita, Kansas, and three additional store relocations, one of which is presumably Apple Crocker Park.",
