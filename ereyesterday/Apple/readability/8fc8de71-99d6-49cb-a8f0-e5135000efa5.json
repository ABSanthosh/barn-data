  "description": "Macworld If you’ve been waiting for the perfect time to get a new MacBook Pro, now’s the time to do it. Why? Well, because B\u0026H Photo is clearing out the space black M3 Pro models for $900 off, which means you can get one for as little as $1,499. The catch is that this deal is only available today so you have to ask fast. Now available for $1,499, the M3 Pro MacBook Pro features a 14-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, as well as 18GB of memory and a 1TB SSD. If you want a laptop with more oomph, the version with 36GB RAM is available for $1,899, also a $900 discount and a fantastic deal for a loaded machine. It’s not the newest or fastest MacBook, but it’s still an incredible machine with tons of power. It comes as no surprise, but we absolutely loved these laptops. In our review, we gave the MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro chip a 4.5-star rating, appreciating the bountiful RAM, powerful processor, and quiet performance. “The MacBook Pro M3 Pro proves to be a good work tool for everyday tasks. It’s noticeably faster than the MacBook Pro M3–the extra money you must pay to upgrade from the M3 to the M3 Pro is well spent,” reads our review. The MacBook Pro M3 Pro comes with plenty of ports you’ll love, including the versatile Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, and an SC card reader. The laptop uses super-fast Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, too. And of course, it’s got a gorgeous display and design that’s super light and portable. So get your very own MacBook Pro for $900 off at B\u0026H, whether you get the 18GB RAM version or the one with 36GB of memory. Hurry up because this deal ends right before midnight.
