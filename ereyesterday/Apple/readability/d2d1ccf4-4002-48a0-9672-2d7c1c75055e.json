  "text": "So many accessories for MagSafe revolve around charging, docking, etc. Some of them are not technology-related but work with an analog approach. The MOFT Action Inspiration is an awesome product for those who love sticky notes but need something on the go. MagSafe Monday: Every Monday, Bradley Chambers looks at the latest and greatest in the MagSafe and wireless charging industry to help you get the most out of your Apple devices that support wireless charging. What’s in the box The MOFT Action Inspiration is one of those products you didn’t know you wanted until you had it. The package includes a wallet, stand, a very small pen, and a notepad. The pen, especially, is really interesting. It’s a feather-light tri-folding magnetic pen that essentially disappears in the product when it’s not being used. It’s as close to a flat as you can get. Notepad-wise, it includes a pack of sticky notes as well as a traditional notepad. Use cases If you’re the type of person who likes to carry around paper and pen but doesn’t want the bulkiness of a bigger notebook, this is the product for you. Because it snaps onto the back of your iPhone, you won’t feel like you’re carrying around something extra. It can carry some cards, but it’s not ideal for more than a couple in my opinion. If you want a MagSafe wallet, there are better options on the market. I am using it to replace my grocery list in an Apple Note. I find it much easier to cross off a simple list versus unlocking my phone, opening the app, etc. If you work in an office, it’s big enough to take simple meeting notes, etc. You can then scan the note into Apple Notes if you want to digitize it later. Wrap up on MOFT Action Inspiration Another cool use case is it can function as a stand as well. So, in 1 MagSafe accessory, you get: Small wallet Stand Notebook flat pen In a time in my life when I need a little less screen time, I am really enjoying the MOFT Action Inspiration. You can buy it from Amazon. You can also buy refill packets for the paper when you run out. Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.",
