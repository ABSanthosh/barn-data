  "text": "News Jon Hamm and Alexander Skarsgård both have hits on Apple TV+! Photo: Apple TV+ The crime drama Your Friends and Neighbors held onto a large audience for two months now, appearing yet again on a weekly list of the top 10 most popular series, according to a company that tracks ratings. The Apple TV+ show stars Jon Hamm as a very unusual thief. Plus, the Apple TV+ sci-fi action comedy series Murderbot settled into steady popularity. Jon Hamm and Your Friends and Neighbors keeps its strong ratings Jon Hamm is an American actor best known for his iconic role as Don Draper in the critically acclaimed television series Mad Men. With his striking looks, commanding presence, and smooth charisma, Hamm brought complexity and depth to the suave but troubled advertising executive, earning him widespread praise and several awards, including a Primetime Emmy. Beyond Mad Men, Hamm showcased his talent in The Morning Show season 3 on Apple TV+. Hamm’s versatility, dry wit, and classic Hollywood charm have made him a standout presence in modern entertainment, and surely contributes to the success of his new series, Your Friends and Neighbors. The premise likely helps, too. In the show, Hamm plays Andrew “Coop” Cooper, who gets fired in disgrace from his high-paying job as a hedge fund manager and must resort to stealing from his affluent neighbors’ homes. There, Coop discovers that the secrets and affairs hidden behind those wealthy facades might be more dangerous than he ever imagined. Whether the success is caused by star power, good writing or a combination of both, the show got off to a strong start in April and stayed popular ever since. Movie and TV search engine JustWatch publishes a weekly ratings list of the 10 most popular series in the U.S. on streaming services, and Your Friends and Neighbors sits at No. 4 for the week of June 2 through June 8 (see chart). A ratings service says Your Friends and Neighbors is one of the most popular streaming series. And Murderbot draws plenty of eyes, too.Chart: JustWatch Ratings estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. All nine episodes of Your Friends and Neighbors are ready to stream now. The entire season is ready to binge watch. Murderbot still kills it Apple TV+ generally does well with sci-fi series, which isn’t surprising for a computer maker. Murderbot, Apple’s latest foray into the genre, is about a cyborg — part robot, part human — built to provide security in very dangerous situations. The series follow the cyborg as it breaks the programming that forces it to kill … and then goes looking for a purpose. But don’t expect a traditional action show, as there’s plenty of comedy mixed in. It’s a combination that works, because JustWatch put the series at No. 5 on its chart of most popular streaming series last week (see chart above). Rival service Reelgood also put the show in the No. 8 slot on its list for top-rated series for the week of June 5 through June 11. Alexander Skarsgård, who won Emmys, Golden Globes and SAG awards for roles that include Succession, Big Little Lies and True Blood, plays the eponymous lead character. The first seven episodes of Murderbot season 1 can be watched now. The next is scheduled to appear on Friday. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming hits like Your Friends and Neighbors and Murderbot, plus many others, come with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. And Apple’s streaming video service also includes a library of drama, comedies, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
