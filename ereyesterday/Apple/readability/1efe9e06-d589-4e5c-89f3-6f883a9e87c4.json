Photo: Cult of Mac Deals Your walls might not be the color you think they are, even if you’re the one who painted them (and you still have the paint can in the garage). An RGB color sensor like the Nix Mini 3 can help you match the paint on your walls — or any color you see in real life. The sad fact is, colors fade, especially if they’re exposed to sunlight. And it can be a real hassle when you need to patch a hole or cover a blemish. The classic paint swatch method proves time-consuming and puts a lot of pressure on you being able to compare the colors on two different types of material. A modern solution is to use a smart RGB color sensor like the Nix Mini 3. This compact color sensor can identify colors on most surfaces, and right now you can get one for $69.97 (regularly $119). Why use an RGB color sensor? Paint swatches are free, but paint, your time and gas aren’t. Getting a color match wrong means running back to the store for another swatch and another can of paint. It also means you get the joy of watching paint dry, and that’s about as fun as … well, watching paint dry. Pick the right color the first time by using the Nix Mini 3 as your personal paint consultant. This pocket RGB color sensor can scan almost any surface. Then it compares the scan to a library of more than 200,000 brand-name paint colors. This extensive collection includes colors from popular brands, so you’re not limited in your search. The device’s enhanced resolution gives you precise color readings. So, even if you originally painted your wall with Seagull Gray, the Nix can tell you if the sun warped it to Hazy Trail. Using the Nix Mini 3 is easy, too. The Nix Toolkit app comes free for iOS devices. That’s where you’ll connect to your RGB color sensor and initiate scans. The app not only provides essential color codes like RGB, HEX, and CMYK, which are crucial for digital design and print work, but also gives you access to premium color systems like Pantone, RAL and NCS through optional subscriptions. You can even use the app to create your own color libraries and save your favorite colors.
