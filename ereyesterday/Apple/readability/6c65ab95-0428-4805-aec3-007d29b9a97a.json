  "text": "Occasionally, some iPhone users have gone to use their Camera app and discovered the Camera app icon is missing from their iPhone Home Screen. Uh oh! Does this mean your Camera app was deleted? What do you do now? Don’t distress, fixing a missing Camera app on iPhone is usually pretty easy. The Camera app is an integral part of the iPhone and the bundled app experience, and while rarely it may seem to go missing, become inaccessible, or appear to be deleted, it’s still on your iPhone. We’ll show you how to track it down and get using the Camera app again with four helpful tips. 1: Accidentally Removed Camera App Icon from iPhone Home Screen? Here’s the Fix Typically if the Camera app is suddenly missing on iPhone and the Home Screen, it’s because it was accidentally removed from the Home Screen. Fortunately you can still find the Camera app in your App Library, which is the very last screen on your Home Screen and it shows your entire library of apps. If that’s the case, it’s a pretty easy fix to restore the missing Camera icon back to iPhone Home Screen: From the iPhone Home Screen, swipe left until you reach the App Library Use the “Search” feature and type ‘Camera’ Tap and hold on the “Camera” app icon and then drag it back to your iPhone Home Screen to position it to where you want Camera to be 2: Can’t Find Camera? Use Search You can also usually use Spotlight to track down a missing Camera app. Pull down from the Home Screen of iPhone, or tap the “Search” button at the bottom of the screen, type ‘Camera’, and launch it directly. 3: Check Camera Restrictions Occasionally, a Restriction may be enabled on the Camera app which makes it hidden or inaccessible. This rarely happens accidentally, but sometimes settings can get toggled on inadvertently whether by someone messing with your phone, you fumbling around with your iPhone in your pocket, or many other circumstances. Go to the Settings app \u003e Screen Time \u003e Content \u0026 Privacy Restrictions \u003e Allowed Apps \u0026 Features \u003e Camera \u003e make sure this is turned ON And while this is exceptionally rare, a while back there was an issue with the Camera app disappearing due to being restricted for some users after updating iOS, so it’s not totally inconceivable for that type of issue to happen again. It’s an easy setting to check. 4: Helpful Tip: Use the Lock Screen Camera A helpful iPhone Camera tip is to remember that you don’t just need to launch Camera from the app, you can launch it directly form the Home Screen of iPhone! By default the bottom right corner of iPhone Lock Screen will have a camera icon, simply tap on that and you’ll launch the camera. You can also swipe to the left from the iPhone Lock Screen to open the camera right away. This always works unless the Lock Screen camera has been disabled. – Has your Camera app ever mysteriously disappeared or seemed to have gone missing or been deleted?
