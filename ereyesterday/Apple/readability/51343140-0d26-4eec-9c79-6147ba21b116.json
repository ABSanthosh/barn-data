  "text": "Every gaming platform has its own app for managing games, such as Apple’s Game Center, for example. But for those who have multiple consoles, GamePal is a great companion app that helps players keep track of their entire game library. GamePal: a game companion app for iPhone “GamePal is the perfect sidekick for your gaming adventures, designed to elevate your gaming experience and help you keep track of your ever-growing collection. Whether you’re a casual player or a hardcore enthusiast, GamePal is here to make your gaming life more organized, insightful, and fun,” the app description says. With GamePal, you can add all the games you’ve played, are currently playing, or want to play in the future. The app also lets you organize and filter games by those you own in physical, digital, or subscription versions. The best part is that it automatically gets details like the game artwork, description, release date, and screenshots from IGDB. Adding a new game to GamePal is super simple, as all you have to do is search for its name. After that, you choose which platform you play it on, the playing status, and the ownership status. But the app does more than just organize your game library. For instance, you can rate and write a note for each title. You can also log and track your gaming sessions, so you know how long you’ve been playing – it’s also a nice way of knowing which games you spend the most time playing. Data is synchronized between your Apple devices through iCloud, and the app works offline when you don’t have an internet connection available. It also supports notifications, custom app icons, and widgets. You can download GamePal for free on the App Store, although some features require a paid “Platinum” subscription. The app requires an iPhone running iOS 17 or later.
