  "description": "Macworld The Apple MacBook Air M3, which we called “simply the best,” is on sale for $200 off at Amazon right now, a sweet price point that has us wanting to add it to the cart. Our favorite is the 15-inch model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $1,299, but all sizes and configurations of both the 15-inch Air and the 13-inch model have the same discount. That means you can get a brand-new M3 MacBook Air with 16GB of storage for as low as $899 and the M2 model for a staggering $799. This is the best price we’ve seen for this laptop outside of Black Friday when some models were $250 off. That, however, is not a price we’re expecting to see anytime soon for this MacBook Air. This M3 MacBook Air laptop is Apple’s latest model, featuring a powerful chip alongside a hefty 16GB of memory. While the MacBook Pro has a legacy of being the go-to model for professionals, this particular combination should be enough to get any task done, including video editing. We recommend springing for one of the models with a 512GB SSD on board, which is plenty of storage space for whatever it is you need to hold on your computer, from pictures to apps to some light games. One thing this laptop is famous for, however, is that it’s thin and light, meaning you can carry it anywhere you go without minding it one bit. That day-long battery will also keep you going on your adventures. So go ahead and get your very own MacBook Air M3 for as low as $899 at Amazon while you still can.
