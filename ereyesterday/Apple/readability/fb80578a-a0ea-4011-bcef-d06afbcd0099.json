  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. TechniCalc is a fully featured calculator app, with all of the advanced features you’d need – but without a clunky or outdated UI. It focuses on being clean, easy to use, while being good for mathematicians. It’s available for iPhone, iPad, Mac. Interface highlights Many advanced calculator apps feel like they’re out of the 90s still, but not TechniCalc. Its beautiful interface scales nicely across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. It also has both light and dark mode. The developer focused on making two key interactions better than the competition, making it nice to use. When you’re typing an equation, TechniCalc keeps everything visible, whereas some apps like to hide the previous number you typed after pressing plus or whatever else. This allows you to easily read your equation. On top of that, the keyboard is fully featured in both portrait and landscape, reducing the need to rotate your device. It does this by grouping things in submenus behind buttons, allowing the interface to look clean while still retaining over 100 calculator buttons. For example, if you press and hold on degrees, you have a submenu that shows you arcminutes and arcseconds. You can also press and hold on sin for arcsin, and so on. Math capabilities On top of being able to do basic calculations, TechniCalc has mostly everything you’d want out of a fully featured calculator, including the following: Brackets Square and cubic roots Exponents and logarithms Trigonometry Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan) Degrees, radians, and gradians Constants (pi, e, and over 100 other physical constants) It also has a formula book, calculation history, a built in unit and currency convertor, and a statistics mode. For advanced math, it also supports the following: Almost unlimited number sizes – over 1,000,000 factorial Square roots and logarithms with any base Factorial, nPr, nCr, and gamma Hyperbolic trigonometry (sinh, cosh, tanh) Vectors and matrices Imaginary and complex numbers Series sums and products Numerical integration and differentiation Binary, octal, and hexadecimal Programmer mode Whatever you need from your calculator, TechniCalc likely has you covered. Download TechniCalc TechniCalc is available as a one time purchase on the App Store, with no ads or subscriptions – for just $7.99. Once purchased, that’s it – there’s no additional upsells or anything else to worry about.
