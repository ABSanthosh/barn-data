  "text": "Apple’s developer site has shared news of a new API coming for apps that will offer expanded options for managing In-App Purchases. It’s called the Advanced Commerce API, and here’s what we know so far. Advanced Commerce API gives more flexibility to App Store developers Here’s the official announcement: The App Store facilitates billions of transactions annually to help developers grow their businesses and provide a world-class customer experience. To further support developers’ evolving business models — such as exceptionally large content catalogs, creator experiences, and subscriptions with optional add-ons — we’re introducing the Advanced Commerce API. Developers can apply to use the Advanced Commerce API to support eligible App Store business models and more flexibly manage their In-App Purchases within their app. These purchases leverage the power of the trusted App Store commerce system, including end-to-end payment processing, tax support, customer service, and more, so developers can focus on providing great app experiences. Apple’s announcement also includes a link where developers can learn more about eligibility requirements and the application process. As of the time I’m publishing, however, that link is redirecting to Apple’s standard In-App Purchase page for developers. Initially, the link was broken altogether. Hopefully Apple will get the page up that contains more details soon. But for now, it sounds like Apple is expanding the ways that developers can manage In-App Purchases for their apps. Whatever the full details turn out to be, more options and greater flexibility seem like great changes no matter what. Are you a developer interested in using this new App Store API?
