  "text": "News macOS 16 could look more like visionOS. Photo: Apple/Cult of Mac Apple intends to transform the user interfaces for the iPhone, Mac and iPad later this year in iOS 19, macOS 16 and iPadOS 19, according to a reliable source. If the unconfirmed report proves correct, the updates will bring the most significant changes in years to the familiar look of iOS, macOS and iPadOS. iOS 19 and macOS 16 could usher in significant design changes The current iOS 18, macOS Sequoia 15 and iPadOS 18 all look similar, but not identical. A redesign in the coming months will supposedly make them appear much more alike. “The revamp — due later this year — will fundamentally change the look of the operating systems and make Apple’s various software platforms more consistent,” Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported Monday. The broad changes will affect the most basic features of the various operating systems, including “icons, menus, apps, windows and system buttons,” according to Gurman’s unnamed sources inside Apple. “The design is loosely based on the Vision Pro’s software,” says the report. visionOS uses more-translucent design elements than Apple’s other operating systems do, though many other changes are possible, of course. A previous rumor indicated Apple intends to bring the look of visionOS to other platforms, though earlier we thought this might apply only to the Camera app. More profound changes The modifications to iOS 19, macOS 16 and iPadOS 19 allegedly will be more than simply cosmetic. “The company is working to simplify the way users navigate and control their devices,” according to the Bloomberg report. At this point, there are no additional details on what’s in store in the user interface revamp for iPhone, Mac and iPad. If all this turns out to be true, we’ll surely get our first official look at the changes at WWDC25, the company’s annual developer conference traditionally held in June. Months of beta testing will follow. Then, if Apple follows its usual pattern, the new operating system upgrades will reach all customers in the autumn.",
