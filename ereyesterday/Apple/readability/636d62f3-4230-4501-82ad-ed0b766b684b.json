  "text": "News Scott and Arquette take miniscule bites to minimize the pain. Photo: First We Feast/Hot Ones Versus Severance costars Patricia Arquette and Adam Scott faced off in a funny, face-melting hot chicken wing-eating contest Tuesday in a new video from the show Hot Ones Versus. In the words of the show, “today, these co-stars will have two choices: Tell the truth, or suffer the wrath of the Last Dab. Whoever eats the most wings, loses!” The wings are spicy enough for the show to call them “Wings of Death,” and their spicy pain showed in the actors’ suffering as well as the teeny, tiny little bites they took when they missed a question. Watch Severance stars on Hot Ones Versus in a chicken wing battle royale TV show Hot Ones Versus is a spinoff from the popular show Hot Ones. While the original show airs celebrity interviews that take place over hot wings, the spinoff brings in two guests who try to stump each other with questions. When someone can’t or won’t answer a question, they have to take a bite of a hot wing. In this episode, Arquette, who plays Ms. Cobel/Mrs. Selvig on Apple TV+ hit Severance, goes up against Scott, who plays Mark S. on the show. This amusing bit of show promotion follows a host of stunts and videos that came with the start of season two. The Hot Wings Versus episode’s 21-plus minutes are pretty funny and worth a watch. The episode mimics Severance‘s style a bit. And it packs a big surprise when another character from Apple TV+’s intriguing workplace thriller enters the picture as covert help for Scott when he faces a mock employee review from Arquette. Any spoilers? No, just hot AF wings and a few laughs. “From Adam’s last text conversation with Paul Rudd to Patricia’s worst on-screen kiss, these two will either need to be honest or go head-to-head with the Wings of Death,” the show noted, describing some of the questions. “Can Patricia guess Adam’s go-to karaoke song? Who knows the other’s filmography best? Tune in to an all-new episode of Hot Ones Versus, and see who takes home the golden chicken wing trophy!” Yeah, don’t worry. No spoilers here. You’ll have to watch the video to see who triumphs in the ridiculously eye-watering showcase and takes home the chicken wing trophy. And although some questions relate to Severance, don’t expect revelations. At one point, Arquette tucks into a wing specifically to avoid answering a question about which of several fan theories about the show contains the most truth. And she also seems to take advantage of the show’s fairly lax rules, bringing in everything from frozen grapes to a mango lassie yogurt shake to help her with the heat, even though the show already provides milk and water. Scott went for the heat-smothering milk after his first bite. Watch Adam Scott vs. Patricia Arquette on Hot Ones Versus:",
