  "text": "Remember Network Utility, the handy tool for Mac that was bundled with the operating system since the origins of Mac OS X? With Network Utility, you had an easy graphical interface to commonly used network tools like ping, netstat, nslookup, traceroute, finger, port scanning, and whois. But for reasons unknown, Apple removed Network Utility from MacOS after Catalina, and while you can copy that older Network Utility application to a modern MacOS version and get it to run with this trick, if you don’t have a Catalina or older Mac laying around to copy the original Network Utility.app from, that isn’t going to work for you. This is where Neo Network Utility comes in, it’s a free tool from Devon Technology that replaces Network Utility on modern MacOS versions. Neo Network Utility has all the same features of Network Utility, plus a handy connection speed testing tool too. Grab Neo Network Utility free from devontech Installation is as simple as dragging and dropping Neo Network Utility (labeled as “Network Utility” for convenience) into your Applications folder. (Quick side note, if you had previously followed our tip to run Network Utility from an older MacOS version on modern MacOS, the apps share the same name, so you might want to look out for that). Launching Neo Network Utility will immediately be familiar to you, since the interface looks basically identical to Network Utility, making it super convenient. Neo Network Utility lets you do all that you could do with the original Network Utility including find your wi-fi connection speed, perform port scans, use ping, traceroute, whois, netstat, nslookup, and more. Plus there’s a speed test feature that lets you test both your download and upload speeds, a handy addition by Devon Technologies that was not a part of the original Apple application. Technically, Neo Network Utility is compatible with any version of MacOS beyond Ventura (including Sonoma and Sequoia), but we’re focusing on macOS Sequoia here since it’s the latest current version of MacOS. Presumably it’ll work on future versions of MacOS that are released in the future, too. And yes, most of these features are available as command line tools, either bundled with MacOS or available easily through something like Homebrew, but having everything in a central location within a single application makes performing network tasks like these particularly easy. Cheers to TidBits for putting this handy little app on our radar.",
