  "description": "Macworld We’re expecting a new iPad mini any week now, but we’re not expecting much to change. Other than Apple Intelligence compatibility, which is arguably more important for the iPhone than the iPad anyway, the new iPad mini will have the same design, display, and features as the current model. And today, that current model is on sale for $150 off at Amazon, the same price it dropped to for Prime Day, and the lowest we’ve ever seen. Amazon is selling all colors and capacities of the iPad mini for $150 off, including cellular models. Our favorite, however, is the Wi-Fi-only iPad mini with 256GB of storage for $150. Essentially you’ll be getting an extra 192GB of storage for free. Even after three years, the current model is a fantastic small tablet, with a super-light design weighing just a half-pound. Built around an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, it’s got a speedy A15 processor, a 12MP ultra-wide front camera, and a Touch ID-enabled power button.",
