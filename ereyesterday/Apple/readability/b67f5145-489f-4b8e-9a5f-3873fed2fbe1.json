  "text": "The ChatGPT app for Mac is a fantastic AI tool and LLM that makes for a great addition to many Mac users workflows, whether you’re extremely tech savvy, or just a novice. One thing that some users have wondered is how to keep the ChatGPT app for Mac updated, and how to install updates to ChatGPT manually if they need to. ChatGPT will auto-update on the Mac, if allowed By default, ChatGPT will attempt to keep itself updated, and will prompt you when using the app that a new version is available. You can then install the update right away, ignore it, or install it on the next app relaunch. But you can also update ChatGPT manually on the Mac, and that’s easy too. How to Manually Update ChatGPT on Mac Open ChatGPT on Mac Pull down the “ChatGPT” menu and choose “Check for Updates” Choose to install the updates now, skip, or upon next app relaunch Updating ChatGPT for Mac often is important because the app is frequently updated with new features and capabilities, and if you’re using the tool, you’ll want to make sure you’re running the latest versions for this purpose (and to make sure bugs and security issues are resolved if they are found). So that’s it, it’s pretty easy to install ChatGPT updates on Mac, right? For iPhone and iPad, it’s just as simple, but handled through the App Store on those devices instead. Ironically, Google Search AI Provides Inaccurate Information on Updating ChatGPT on Mac ChatGPT has taken the world by storm, and Google is busy breaking its own search engine experience to try and catch up to ChatGPT with its “Gemini” search AI experience, which is often wildly inaccurate. A new case in point pertains to this article, which was sent to us by a reader who couldn’t figure out why ChatGPT on their Mac was not updating. The suggestion provided by Google Gemini when asked how to update ChatGPT on a Mac was inaccurate and false, which instead provided instructions on how to install MacOS system software updates – and no, installing MacOS updates will not update ChatGPT. Take this as yet another warning about trusting the AI results that you see in search results, especially now where the AI generated gibberish is being barfed into search results and is often inaccurate but will present information as if it were true (this is sometimes referred to as a hallucination, which Google describes here, since LLMs don’t necessarily know what is true or false, but they will provide a confident answer anyway). ChatGPT is almost certainly the most widely known chat bot out there, but it’s also probably the best LLM and AI tool as well, and while there are others, they tend to be less accurate or less capable. By the way, if you’re a fan of ChatGPT, AI, and LLM tools, you might get a kick out of running an LLM like Llama locally on your Mac, which allows you to run uncensored models (uncensored in this case simply means without bias, because, as weird as it sounds, basically all LLM’s are being intentionally trained with bias, and that should alarm all of us, even those who ‘agree’ with the slant and bias for the moment. Do you want your AI information to be accurate, or do you want it to be biased and inaccurate? It’s that simple.).",
