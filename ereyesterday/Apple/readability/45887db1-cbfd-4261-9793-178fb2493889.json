  "text": "Apple is reportedly working on a new MacBook Pro refresh, which is set to debut ‘later this year.’ Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman describes this refresh as “a lock”, reaffirming that Apple will follow its tradition of annual MacBook Pro refreshes. What’s new As always, these new MacBook Pro models will come with a new generation of Apple Silicon. That means we’ll see the introduction of M5, M5 Pro, and M5 Max. These chips will still be based on TSMC’s 3nm process, specifically N3P, the third generation of 3nm manufacturing. Performance gains will likely be somewhat modest. Other than internal improvements, there will be nothing new with this MacBook Pro refresh. For that, you’ll have to wait another ~18 months. In late 2026, Apple will update the MacBook Pro with an OLED display, thinner design, and more. You can learn more about that overhaul in our dedicated roundup. While not rumored, it’s likely that these new MacBook Pro models will support Wi-Fi 7, just like the iPhone 16 lineup. The M4 MacBook Pro models missed out on that upgrade. Release date 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M5 should launch in October, as is tradition. This’ll likely accompany a new iPad Pro refresh with M5 as well. Wrap up In short, the M5 MacBook Pro will be yet another minor MacBook Pro refresh. You’re likely better off buying an existing MacBook Pro model, or waiting out for the larger refresh in 2026. If buying a current model is on your mind, you can take a look at great deals on existing MacBook Pro models, including the M4 14-inch model starting at just $1410, and the M4 Pro 14-inch model starting at $1767. These are both around $200 off compared to standard pricing. You can also pick up an M4 Pro 16-inch model for just over 10% off this weekend.
