Even the free version of ChatGPT can do a lot. The real frustration is that if you want good results for generating copy, creating images, transcribing text and doing a myriad of other AI tasks, you often need a whole pile of subscriptions, and those costs add up. The alternative is to get an all-in-one tool that brings top AI models together in one interface. Enter 1minAI. The major benefits of 1minAI are organizational and financial. It gives you access to ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Llama, Mistral AI and more. So you get all your AI tools in one place, and you don’t need to pay for a subscription to each one separately. Right now, you can get a lifetime sub to 1minAI for just $39.99. This all-in-one AI tool has proven incredibly popular with Cult of Mac Deals customers. But this price won’t last forever. If ChatGPT, Stability AI and Google AI teamed up 1minAI doesn’t just make one kind of content. It’s like your own AI Swiss Army knife, with tools for writing, generating images, recording audio and even editing videos. Need some fresh copy? How about some SEO research, too? You might normally pull up ChatGPT, and you still can. In fact, with 1minAI, you can use GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o. Not satisfied with the results? Feed your prompt through one of the other services in this all-in-one AI tool. You can use them for keyword research, writing, summarizing and even rewriting. It’s like having your own creative team, and it doesn’t stop at generating copy. You also can use 1minAI to generate images, transcribe audio, and convert text to speech (or speech to text). It can even summarize the content of a PDF file. Now, instead of skimming documents on your own, the AI can give you the highlights. It also can answer questions and translate text in a PDF. How many AI credits do you get? The only catch with this AI tool is that you can’t generate content endlessly. Your lifetime 1minAI subscription gives you 15,000 AI credits when you log in daily, totaling up to 450,000 per month. In practice, that means every month you can: Generate up to 362,500 words Research up to 1,933 SEO keywords Generate up to 386 images Remove up to 24 backgrounds Generate text to speech for up to 120,833 characters Transcribe up to 4,833 seconds of audio One huge bonus is that your credits don’t go away if you don’t use them. So if you’re on vacation, you aren’t losing money because you aren’t generating a blog post every day. Save on 1minAI, an all-in-one AI tool that’s easy to use Get a lifetime subscription to 1minAI for $39.99. That’s 82% off the regular price of $234.
