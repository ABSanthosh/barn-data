  "description": "Macworld Are you ready for it? And by “it,” we mean the very first discount for the fantastic Beats Powerbeats Pro 2. These buds only launched a few months ago, and this is the first time they’ve gone on sale. It’s not some measly discount either, but an absolutely amazing $50 off, taking the Powerbeats down from $250 to a shade under $200. How do we know they’re fantastic? Well, we reviewed them and gave them a four-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award. We found these earbuds to be light and small with a secure fit on your ear, delivering fantastic sound and impressive battery life. “These are now our hands-down favorite earbuds for exercising and athletics,” the review reads—even better than AirPods Pro. These are the perfect earbuds for exercising because the built-in earhooks mean you won’t worry about them falling off. Plus active noise cancelling will help you focus completely on the task at hand, while transparency mode will keep you safe while jogging on busy roads. Best of all, these buds come with a heart-rate monitor on board that will send your bpm to your iPhone. This is an impressive pair of earbuds even at full price. But this $50 discount to bring the price under $200 at Amazon makes them a must-buy, so go grab this deal while you still can. Upgrade your workout with the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 for $50 offBuy now at Amazon",
