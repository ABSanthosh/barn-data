  "text": "News A smart home doorbell from Apple with Face ID could become a reality. Photo: Apple Apple is reportedly working on a smart doorbell with Face ID-like facial recognition. The device, still in its early development stages, seems unlikely to reach the market before late 2025 at the earliest. This timeline presumes Apple encounters no significant obstacles during development. Apple smart home doorbell might feature Face ID-like authentication Apple made a big splash with the launch of its HomeKit home-automation platform in 2014 as part of iOS 8. But since then, the company largely stayed away from the smart-home market. The original HomePod smart speaker in 2018 — and the more-successful HomePod mini, which launched in 2020 — both served as home hubs. Otherwise, the company’s presence is almost negligible in the smart-home segment. However, this could change in 2025, with reports suggesting Apple is working on several smart home devices, including the Face ID doorbell. Part of a fresh push into smart home products? The most widely reported is a wall-mounted smart home hub that supposedly will pack a 7-inch display. Other rumors indicate Apple also will launch a smart home camera in 2026. But that’s not all. Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman, in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, says Apple is working on a competitor to Amazon’s popular line of Ring products. Apple’s smart doorbell might feature Face ID-like authentication, enabling it to unlock the door just by looking at your face. It supposedly will wirelessly connect to a deadbolt lock. Presumably, the doorbell also will tightly integrate with the HomeKit platform. The report speculates Apple could team up with a lock manufacturer and launch a full system that comes ready to use right out of the box. Alternatively, the company could sell the technology to one of its accessory partners, Belkin or Logitech, with which it works closely. Long wait ahead for Apple’s smart home doorbell with Face ID As mentioned, Apple is in the initial stages of developing its smart doorbell. In a best-case scenario, the report says the device could debut by late 2025. But the company likely will run into challenges, which could affect the smart doorbell’s launch timeframe.",
