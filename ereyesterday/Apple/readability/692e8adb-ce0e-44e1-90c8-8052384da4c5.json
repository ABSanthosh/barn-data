  "text": "Apple published a new iPhone 16 Pro ad this weekend, and this one is quite special. To show the Audio Mix feature in action, the company recorded a music video using the latest iPhone – but that’s not all, as the clip also celebrates the Brazilian Carnival. Brazilian Carnival-themed iPhone 16 Pro ad The song “Brasil em Cena” by Jair Oliveira is performed by Brazilian singer Nilze Carvalho. According to Apple, the film “celebrates Brazilian cinema to the sound of one of the most vibrant musical genres on the planet” and is a “tribute to the culture and grandeur of Brazil, where Carnival and cinema meet to tell an unforgettable story”. With Audio Mix, iPhone 16 and 16 Pro users can choose from three different options that either reduce sounds and voices from sources not visible in the frame, reduce all background sounds and reverb, or put all the voices onto a front-facing track for a more cinematic result. The audio can be edited after the clip has been filmed. In Brazil, the ad was aired on TV during the Oscars 2025 broadcast. The country won its first Oscar with “I’m Still Here” in the Best International Feature Film category. Also to celebrate the Brazilian Carnival, Apple has updated its website in Brazil with a carnival theme. Products such as the recently launched iPhone 16e and AirPods 4 are shown surrounded by confetti. The company has even launched a new section on Apple Music with Carnival playlists. In the past, Apple has made other Carnival ads, such as one to promote the iPhone 7 Plus and another to promote the iPhone X.
