  "text": "The first month of 2025 is almost over, moving us closer to the first Apple product launches of the year—and several strong ones are coming. Here’s a look at five new products expected to arrive in the next few months. M4 MacBook Air Apple’s most popular Mac is about to get its next upgrade. Here’s what to expect from the new MacBook Air: M4 chip 16GB RAM standard Nano-texture display option 12MP Center Stage camera Support for two external displays with lid open Likely improved battery performance thanks to M4 Same design with 13-inch and 15-inch sizes Overall it should be a solid update for the MacBook Air. As for timing, signs point to a February or early March release—some time around when the M3 MacBook Air launched in early 2024. iPhone SE 4 Apple’s next iPhone will be the one most people should probably buy. It’s the new iPhone SE 4, which is expected to debut in March. The new iPhone SE will feature: an iPhone 14-style design, with OLED and no Home Button Face ID and a notch the A18 chip just added to the iPhone 16 Apple Intelligence support, which is otherwise exclusive to 16 and 15 Pro models 8GB of RAM 48MP main camera, likely similar to the iPhone 16’s USB-C port and the first ever Apple-designed 5G modem All of this at a compelling, budget-friendly price point—likely under $499. ‘HomePad’ smart display The product I’m personally most excited about is Apple’s forthcoming ‘HomePad’ smart display. Mark Gurman detailed the forthcoming product extensively in a recent Bloomberg piece, which should bring fresh energy to Apple’s Home product lineup. Expected features, per Gurman, include: Focus is on Siri, Communication, and Home control Runs Safari, Music, Notes, and several other Apple apps but no App Store Device is touch, but will mostly be operated by voice through Apple Intelligence’s new App Intents New OS is a blend of watchOS and iOS StandBy mode; dynamic UI shifts based on user distance Size is roughly two iPhones side-by-side, with about a 6-inch screen Device has speakers, FaceTime camera, and battery Apple is working on wall attachments, plus a speaker base for desks, tables, kitchens, and nightstands Heavy security focus as well as video/audio intercom feature that works with other home devices Home Screen is customizable with the classic Apple widgets and Home controls Taps into video doorbells and video cameras, with support for security alerts I can’t wait to see Apple’s renewed push into Home products come to fruition. Gurman originally said the HomePad was coming in March, but later revised expectations by saying it could be delayed a bit. iPad, 11th generation After a barren 2023 for iPad, Apple was originally expected to update its entire iPad lineup in 2024. We did get new iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini models, but the base iPad was ultimately left unchanged. Very soon though, the iPad will get updated to an 11th generation device. We don’t know much about the new iPad, other than that it will get a faster A-series chip, likely one with 8GB of RAM that supports Apple Intelligence. It will potentially feature Apple’s new Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networking chip too. Mostly, it sounds like a standard iterative update for Apple’s most affordable iPad. M3 iPad Air The base iPad won’t be the only tablet launching soon. Despite Apple just revving the iPad Air last May with the M2 chip, rumors indicate an M3 upgrade is coming before long. Not much else is known about the M3 iPad Air except that it should support some updated keyboard accessories from Apple. Otherwise, it’s likely just a spec bump for the same 11-inch and 13-inch sizes we have already. Wildcard: Apple Watch SE 3 Finally, there’s a possible sixth product that could arrive soon: an Apple Watch SE 3. The last Apple Watch SE arrived in 2022, and leading up to Apple’s September 2024 event, rumors pointed to a launch for the SE 3—but it never materialized. Previous Apple Watch SE models have debuted in September, but there are two reasons to believe the new SE might arrive this spring instead. if the device was indeed targeting September 2024 but just missed it, Apple has little reason to wait a whole extra year an Apple Watch SE launch could pair nicely with the iPhone SE 4’s release Apple’s upcoming products: wrap-up Apple’s plans could always change, but if these five or more products do arrive in the early part of the year, it will make for an especially strong start to 2025 for the company. All leading up to what’s sure to be an exciting WWDC and fall product launch season. Which of Apple’s products coming soon are you most excited for? Let us know in the comments.
