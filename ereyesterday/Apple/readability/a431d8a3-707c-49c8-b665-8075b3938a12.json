  "text": "The passwordless future is rapidly becoming a reality as more than 200 companies have now added passkey support to their websites and apps. This significant milestone, revealed by the company behind 1Password, signals a growing shift towards more secure and convenient authentication methods. The list of companies implementing passkeys has doubled since last year, now including names such as Walmart, Amazon, Target, Playstation, Discord, and Canva. For 1Password, this range of adopters shows the versatility and appeal of passkey technology across various segments. For those unfamiliar, passkeys were introduced two years ago, and they replace traditional passwords with more secure authentication using a security key or biometrics. The technology was developed by FIDO Alliance in partnership with companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft. 1Password is also a member of the FIDO Alliance, and the company has also revealed some interesting data on the adoption of passkeys among its users. For instance, more than 4.2 million passkeys have already been saved in 1Password, and there are an average of 2.1 million passkey authentications per month. 1 in 3.4 1Password customers have at least one passkey stored, and 73% of users with passkeys are consumer accounts. These adoption metrics aren’t just a major milestone for 1Password because we’re at the forefront of passwordless advocacy. It’s a testament to the trust our customers place in 1Password to provide secure and reliable passkey support. As members of the FIDO Alliance, we’re committed to help even more individuals and businesses move away from passwords and embrace a safer and simpler future without them. Earlier this year, 1Password introduced a new “Passkey Ready” tool that helps web developers easily check whether their users are able to upgrade from conventional passwords to a passkey. The FIDO Alliance recently announced new specifications for passkeys that include support for easy import and export of keys between different password managers. When it comes to iOS, the feature has been available in Safari since iOS 16 and was expanded to third-party apps with iOS 17. You can find more details about the adoption of passkeys on the 1Password website.
