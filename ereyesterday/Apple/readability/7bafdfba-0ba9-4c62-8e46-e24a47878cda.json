AI image: ChatGPT A rumor from early November said the iOS 18.2 launch day would be the week of December 2, but that’s now impossible. There are steps that must take place before the operating system can be introduced, and not all of them have happened yet. The release will likely be in the second week of December. It’ll usher in some of the most-anticipated new Apple Intelligence features, including Genmoji, the Image Playground and more. Steps introducing an Apple operating system Apple doesn’t simply finish work on major operating system updates and immediately introduce them. The company wisely puts these through beta testing. During testing, the build numbers for each beta have a letter attached. These usually start around “e” in a countdown to “a,” which is generally the last beta. iOS 18.2 beta 4 ended in “a” and went out on December 20. So the operating system is ready for the final step in this process: the Release Candidate. This goes out to give third-party software developers a week to test their iOS, macOS, etc. applications on the upcoming OS update and make any necessary changes. iOS 18.2 went through extensive beta testing, but no Release Candidate is yet available. Expect iOS 18.2 release date on December 9 As noted, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman predicted in early November that iOS 18.2 would debut the week of December 2. Without a Release Candidate, that’s essentially impossible. The RC certainly won’t be introduced today — it’s a national holiday in the United States. And while it’s possible the company could put out the iOS 18.2 RC on Monday and then the full operating system later in the week, there was tremendous protest the last time developers didn’t get a full week to test a RC before an OS launch. So the Release Candidate will almost certainly go out on Monday, December 2. That makes Monday, December 9 the most likely launch date for iOS 18.2. And that fits with Apple’s regular habits — both iOS 18 and iOS 18.1 went out on Mondays. What’s new in iOS 18.2 The set of AI-powered tools dubbed Apple Intelligence was the star of Apple’s developer conference in June, but Cupertino said from the start that the features will launch in phases. The launch of iOS 18.1, macOS Sequoia 15.1 and iPadOS 8.1 in October brought Writing Tools and the picture Clean Up tool. iOS 18.2 as well as macOS Sequoia 15.2 and iPadOS 8.2 include the Image Playground app and Genmoji, which allow users to create images or personified emojis based on user instructions. Optional integration with ChatGPT is another feature. Visual Intelligence is also included in iOS 18.2, but only when running on iPhone 16 models. Which brings up an important point: most of the best new features in this upcoming iOS version are part of Apple Intelligence and therefore work only on the iPhone 15 Pro models and the iPhone 16 series.",
