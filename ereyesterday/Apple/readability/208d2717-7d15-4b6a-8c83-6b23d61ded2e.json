The third developer beta of iOS 18.2 is now available for all compatible iPhone models, as Apple Intelligence testing continues. Here's everything you need to know about the update. On Monday, Apple released iOS 18.2 developer beta 3, with build number 22C5131e, up from the previous 22C5125e. While the update is compatible with devices as old as the iPhone XS and iPhone XR, the software includes a variety of Apple Intelligence features that only work on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the iPhone 16 range. The iOS 18.2 update introduces support for Image Playground, Genmoji, Visual Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration via Siri. There's also a new FindMy feature that helps users locate lost luggage or AirTags. Monday's developer beta builds upon these changes with various enhancements and quality-of-life improvements, though it also appears to have added some new restrictions. Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeWith the third developer beta of iOS 18.2, Apple introduced a minor change to the existing Writing Tools features, which were added with iOS 18.1. Writing Tools let users edit, proofread, and adjust the tone of texts, all with the help of Apple's generative AI software. Writing Tools are now accessible from the first section of the context menu, while AirDrop has a slightly different icon. Monday's changes to Writing Tools are purely functional. The tools have simply been moved to the first section of the context menu, meaning that users can more easily activate Writing Tools whenever text is selected in Notes. The third developer beta also changes the ChatGPT icon for Writing Tools, which is now black instead of multi-colored. This was likely done to distance OpenAI's software from Apple Intelligence so that users know they are still two separate products, even though the companies have an established partnership. While not related to Apple Intelligence, AirDrop has also received a modified icon in the Share sheet. The new icon features slightly thicker bars, but no other noteworthy changes, bearing a strong resemblance to its predecessor. Sticking to the topic of icons, iOS 18.2 developer beta 3 also contains icons that seemingly reference an upcoming update to CarPlay. The software features redesigned icons for CarPlay's Climate and Media applications. New Camera Control settings, videos are no longer zoomed in when played in Photos The operating system also introduces a minor change to video playback in the Photos application. Videos are no longer automatically zoomed in as soon as playback begins. The third developer beta of iOS 18.2 introduces new settings for Camera Control, and a noteworthy change related to video playback in Photos. For Camera Control, Apple has added a new customization option that lets you open the Camera app even if your screen is off. Located in Settings \u003e Display and Brightness, there's now an option titled Require Screen On, which is enabled by default. Disabling this option lets you activate the Camera app via Camera Control even if the device's display is currently off. It's worth pointing out that the Camera Control button was only introduced with the iPhone 16 range, meaning that this change does not affect older devices. Monday's developer beta contains a new \"Authorized Devices\" list within the operating system code. The list itself appears to be related to Apple Intelligence, and contains a list of iPhone, iPad, and Mac models that officially support Apple's AI feature suite. Though it is currently unclear exactly why Apple opted to include this list, it may have been added as a deterrent and security measure that prevents users of older devices from somehow gaining access to Apple Intelligence features. The new top bar is available in the Apple TV app On the iPad side of things, iPadOS 18.2 developer beta 3 introduces a noteworthy change to the Apple TV application. The in-app tab bar has been made customizable, and now items from the sidebar can be added to it. At the time of writing, iOS 18.2 is still in its early stages of developer beta testing, while a full public release is expected to occur in early December of 2024. Separately, Apple also released a firmware update for select AirPods models, including the AirPods Pro 2, which have recently gained impressive Hearing Health features.
