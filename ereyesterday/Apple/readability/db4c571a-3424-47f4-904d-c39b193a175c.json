Though more than a dozen users appear to have been impacted, it might not be a widespread issue. AppleInsider staff members have not experienced any problems with the Mail application on iOS 18.3.2 or with the latest iOS 18.4 developer beta, released on Monday. Assuming the issue wasn't caused by a short-term outage, Apple will likely address the Mail-related problem with a future software update. The iPhone maker periodically releases new versions of iOS, which often include bug fixes and security enhancements.",
