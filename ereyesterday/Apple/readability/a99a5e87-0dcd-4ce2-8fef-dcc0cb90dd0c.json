  "description": "Macworld On Monday Apple released iOS 18.3.1, iPadOS 18.3.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.3.1, updates that include one major security patch and bug fixes–but nothing much in terms of features and usability. Except for one thing, discovered by Jeff Johnson of the Underpass App Company. It turns out that these updates turn on Apple Intelligence, even if you had previously turned it off. According to Johnson’s blog, he installed the macOS 15.3.1 update on a MacBook Pro with Apple Intelligence off. When the MacBook Pro restarted, Setup Assistant appeared with a screen for Apple Intelligence. There was no option to turn it on or off, only to Continue. When he checked System Settings, Apple Intelligence was on. Johnson also notes that security researcher Will Dormann experienced the same phenomenon on two different iPhones. With the iOS and iPadOS 18.3 update and the macOS Sequoia 15.3 update released on January 27, Apple Intelligence is turned on by default. Apple turning it back on if it’s off during the installation of the newest update is, as Johnson puts it, “user-hostile and annoying.” So why would Apple try and force people into using what are beta features? Besides the fact that Apple is heavily promoting Apple Intelligence, the company wants more people using it so it can make improvements–those large language models aren’t going to train themselves. Still, it’s presumptuous for Apple to expect its user base to want to participate in its largest beta test. But it looks like this is going to be Apple’s way going forward. So after each OS update, if you want to check if Apple Intelligence is on (or want to turn it off), go to Settings (iPhone and iPad) or System Settings (Mac) \u003e Apple Intelligence \u0026 Siri, and look at the Apple Intelligence setting at the top. If it’s turned on the toggle will be green, you can click or tap once to turn it off.",
