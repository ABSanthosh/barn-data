  "text": "Christmas is almost here, and although it’s already a magical time, technology can certainly help make this time of year even more special. With that in mind, an app called “Better Call Santa” lets you arrange a call with Santa for your children, all with the help of AI. AI now helps your children (and you) talk to Santa Better Call Santa uses ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode to generate a natural conversation with Santa, but the app does even more. Children can tell Santa their wish list during the call. AI then creates a gift list in the app, so that parents can find out what their children want for Christmas. “Bring your family’s Christmas spirit to life with Better Call Santa. This magical app allows you to create a holiday memory like no other with a personalized call from Santa himself. Children can share their holiday wishes, and parents can safely view their child’s wish list details—all through one easy-to-use app,” the app description reads. I’ve tried out the app here and it’s quite fun – and I’m sure parents will appreciate the wish list feature. OpenAI also added a Santa Claus voice to the ChatGPT app earlier this week. Even so, the company acknowledged that the developer behind the app did a great job (and before the ChatGPT update was released to the public). ha, this guy beat us to launching a santa voice (by 24 hours!)john used OpenAI's Realtime API, which uses the same stack that powers Advanced Voice in ChatGPT…great minds think alike? please keep on building cool things, johnhttps://t.co/Qc05UEgNLy— edwin (@edwinarbus) December 13, 2024 Better Call Santa is available to download on the App Store. The app requires a $5.99 in-app purchase to work. It’s worth noting that although the app has been designed to work in English, you can ask Santa to speak in other languages – after all, he and AI can do anything.
