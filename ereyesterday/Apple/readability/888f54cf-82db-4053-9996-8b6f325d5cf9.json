  "text": "QUICK READ October 23, 2024 The new iPad mini is available today The new iPad mini is available today, and delivers powerful performance, incredible value, and the full iPad experience in an ultraportable design. Beginning today, the ultraportable new iPad mini, powered by the A17 Pro chip and built for Apple Intelligence, is now available. Starting at just $499 with double the storage of the previous generation, the new iPad mini delivers incredible value and the full iPad experience in an ultraportable design. A17 Pro delivers a huge performance boost for iPad mini, unlocking entirely new experiences — including pro apps used by designers, pilots, doctors, and others — and making it faster than ever for users to edit photos, dive into more immersive AR applications, and more. A17 Pro also brings support for Apple Intelligence, the easy-to-use personal intelligence system that understands personal context to deliver intelligence that is helpful and relevant while protecting user privacy. Deeply integrated into iPadOS 18, Apple Intelligence harnesses the power of Apple silicon and Apple-built generative models to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. The first set of Apple Intelligence features will be available in U.S. English as a free software update this month with iPadOS 18.1 on the new iPad mini, with more features rolling out in the coming months.1 With faster connectivity, users can do even more on iPad mini while on the go. The new iPad mini supports Wi-Fi 6E, so users can download files, play games online, and stream movies even faster, and the USB-C port delivers 2x faster wired connections than the previous generation, with data transfers up to 10Gbps. The 12MP wide back camera on the new iPad mini now supports Smart HDR 4 and uses machine learning to detect and scan documents right in the Camera app. The versatility and advanced capabilities of the new iPad mini are taken to a whole new level with support for Apple Pencil Pro, and iPadOS 18 brings powerful features that enhance the iPad experience. Available in blue, purple, starlight, and space gray, the new iPad mini starts at $499 (U.S.) for the Wi-Fi model, and $649 (U.S.) for the Wi-Fi + Cellular model. The new iPad mini starts with 128GB of storage — double the storage of the previous generation. The new iPad mini is also available in 256GB and 512GB configurations. For full details, visit apple.com/shop/buy-ipad. Apple Intelligence will be available as a free software update for iPad with A17 Pro or M1 and later with device and Siri language set to U.S. English. The first set of features will be available in beta this month with iPadOS 18.1 with more features rolling out in the coming months. Later this year, Apple Intelligence will add support for localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. In the coming year, Apple Intelligence will expand to more languages, like Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Vietnamese, and others.",
