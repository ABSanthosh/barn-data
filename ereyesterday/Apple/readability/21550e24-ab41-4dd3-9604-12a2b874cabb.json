Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeThe service features soundtracks from across all generations of Nintendo consoles from franchises including Mario, Pokemon, Zelda, and many more. There are curated playlists based on characters, games, or themes like starting off an adventure. While much of these soundtracks are available on Apple Music, there are key advantages to having them in a separate app and service. First, you'll not have to worry about video game music clogging up your recommendation algorithm in Apple Music, for example. There's also an important feature only Nintendo would think of — spoilers. Users can toggle off spoilers for specific games so titles, images, and music won't potentially spoil a game they haven't played or finished yet. Nintendo Music is available to download on iPhone and iPad via the App Store. The service requires an active subscription to Nintendo Online.",
