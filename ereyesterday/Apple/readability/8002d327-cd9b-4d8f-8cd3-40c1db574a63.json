  "text": "While more than 3.5 million people have spent the last couple of weeks glued to a brand-new Nintendo Switch 2, X user PatRyk (@Patrosi73) decided to invest their time elsewhere: trying to run iOS on the original Nintendo Switch. And they did it! Sort of. According to PatRyk, they spent two full days working on a way to run a full build of iOS inside QEMU, an open-source machine emulator and virtualizer that can simulate entirely different hardware architectures in software. The result is a full iOS environment being emulated directly on the Switch‚Äôs Nvidia Tegra X1 processor. The ‚Äúworld‚Äôs slowest‚Äù, but funnest iPhone Before anyone gets too excited, let‚Äôs set expectations: per PatRyk‚Äôs own admission, this thing is barely functional: I‚Äôve lost my mind (and 2 days of my life to install this)Behold: the world‚Äôs slowest ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù üéâüéâTakes over 20 minutes to boot, kernel panics every 2nd thing you do, can‚Äôt open any apps (they all time out and crash) üöÄüöÄ pic.twitter.com/r3B3JPDUDV‚Äî PatRyk (@Patrosi73) June 17, 2025 Still, the fact that it even boots at all is impressive enough, especially considering that iOS is famously hard to get running on anything other than Apple‚Äôs own devices (or at best, inside Apple‚Äôs Xcode simulator on a Mac). But‚Ä¶ why? I mean, why not? For Patrosi, the project seems to have been more about having fun than creating anything remotely practical. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost my mind (and 2 days of my life to install this),‚Äù they joked in their post. ‚ÄúBehold: the world‚Äôs slowest iPhone.‚Äù Is it usable? Not even close. But as a proof of concept, and a great excuse to say you‚Äôve booted iOS on a Nintendo console, it‚Äôs undeniably cool. The project builds on the QEMU Apple Silicon emulation effort, which aims to make it possible to run ARM-based Apple operating systems in virtualized environments, and you can learn more about the project on its GitHub page.
