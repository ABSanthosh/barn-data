RR Auction's \"Steve Jobs and the Apple Revolution\" has wrapped up, with a few items of note pulling in serious money. The auction began in late February and bids were finalized on March 20, 7. While the auction contained over 200 Apple- and Jobs-related goods, there was one item that raked in the most amount of cash: a fully functional Apple-1 with an original manual. It brought in $375,000, which is about what RR Auction expected. Other items of note in the auction included a Apple/Bandai Pippin EVT Prototype which sold for $4,038, and a sealed first-generation iPhone 4GB which sold for $87,514. Two checks, one of which sold for $112,054. In 2020, another functional Apple-1 sold at auction for $458,711.25. In 2024, Apple-1 owned by Apple's first applications engineer, Dana Reddington, sold for over $315,000. An auction in February titled \"Remarkable Rarities\" was held in February, with a highly coveted 1983 Apple Computer business card autographed by Jobs among the items listed. The card wound up bringing in just over $100,000, second only to an autographed image of Albert Einstein.",
