There are a lot of e-bikes out there and it's been a while since I've tried an Aventon model. They've definitely stepped up in the tech space with the Aventon Control Unit, and the Abound SR is a great mid-sized bike as well. I tested the black model that comes with a rear rack and mesh covers on the rear tire. It has a 750W motor, three pedal assist modes, and comes out of the box as a class 2 e-bike. It's one of the few e-bikes that have an option for a 4G data sync and theft deterrent system with GPS. I reviewed an e-bike packed with tech features in 2023, but it tacked on $1,000 to the price tag. There's a lot to like here with the Aventon Abound SR, but a few small complaints buyers should be aware of. Overall, I'm quite happy with this model's price and specs. Aventon Abound SR review: designAventon didn't go out of its way to differentiate the Abound SR much. At a glance, it's a lot like other e-bikes of its size class. Aventon Abound SR review: BMX handlebars, fat tires, and turn signalsHowever, it's the small details that stand out. For example, I love the BMX-style handlebars that remind me of the bikes I rode as a kid. There are fenders, thankfully, and the mesh on the rear tire is a nice touch. The rear rack is useful, and there are options to attach a large basket, seat, or other accessories. It's been a while since I've had an e-bike with turn signals and powered brake lights. It feels like a must-have for any e-bike these days, especially if you're going to be on or around roads. There's a low-travel front suspension and a bit of suspension in the seat as well. These make rides feel much smoother, even over some of the big roots pushing up on the bike path. Aventon Abound SR review: main interface looks like a classic MP3 playerThe interface is very simple and a callback to classic MP3 players. I've taken to liking my iPhone as a main display versus having a large, bright touch display in the middle of the handlebars. The small display on the left handlebar tells me the battery level and pedal assist setting, and that's about all I need while riding. My iPhone mounted handily to the handlebar crossbar, shows the Fitness Live Activity while I ride with an easily readable speedometer. The right side is a familiar Shimano gear shifter, though I don't use it much. It seems that pedal assist works best when in the highest gear. The kickstand has proven interesting. It's kind of a horseshoe shape that sits on both sides of the rear wheel. When the kickstand is down, the rear wheel is elevated off the ground. Aventon Abound SR review: 3-inch tires help with stability but don't add too much to the weightIt's a smaller e-bike overall with 20-inch by 3-inch fat tires. It weighs 80 pounds. I'm an even 6 feet tall and weigh about 230 pounds, so I'm at the upper end of who might be comfortable on this size class. It's been a good e-bike though, and I haven't faced any issues with discomfort or awkward leg angles. Aventon says people down to about 4 feet 11 inches can ride the bike comfortably. It has a 440-pound payload capacity, and the rear rack is rated for 143 pounds. Abound SR e-bike review: featuresMany of the bells and whistles found on the Aventon Abound SR can be found in the app. It is a highly configurable e-bike with several settings that affect how it rides. Aventon Abound SR review: configure everything in the Aventon appOut of the box, it is a class 2 e-bike, but users can easily take it up or down a class. Increase the speed limit over 20 MPH to up to 25 MPH to make it a class 3 e-bike, or remove the throttle to make it class 1. The Aventon Control Unit (ACU) is a custom chipset built into the bike's technology stack. It offers 4G and GPS so users can monitor the bike, change settings, and sync data even without a direct Bluetooth connection. There's an option to set an on-bike passcode using the simple four directional buttons. This can be reset easily from the app in case you forget your combination. Note that there isn't a lever or keyhole on the bike to access the battery. Instead, users can remove the battery by accessing a submenu in the controller and ejecting it. Aventon Abound SR review: lock the kickstand in place to deter potential thievesThe bike can also be locked via software. If the kickstand is down, it can be locked in place, and pedal assist can be locked out too. Thanks to the GPS, if the bike is stolen, you'll be able to find it easily. And it won't be easy to power off the bike without knowing the access passcode, so tracking will continue without interruption. Also, users can turn on an audible alarm that will play if the bike is moved while locked down. A notification is also sent to the user's smartphone if this occurs. In case you didn't lock up your bike while stepping away for a moment, there's also the option of geofencing. If the e-bike is taken outside of that area, it'll lock up and notify you. Aventon Abound SR review: pay for peace of mind with 4G control and GPS trackingThe service for 4G connection is free for the first year, then $20 per year after. It's a pretty extensive system for security that I've not seen in many e-bikes. Also, the Aventon app has a function to tune what each of the three pedal assist modes does. There's Eco, Sport, and Turbo. Since this is a torque sensor e-bike, it feels like the bike is helping you pedal rather than automatically accelerating to a pre-set speed. It's my preferred method of pedal assist, though the default settings left me leaning to Turbo most. Riding the Aventon Abound SRThe 3-inch tires are a good size for the area I'm riding an e-bike through. I even took the Abound SR out while there was still a lot of snow on the ground, and I felt confident riding through areas not caked in ice. Aventon Abound SR review: stick to the highest gear for the most pedal assistIt seems the top speed available depends a lot on the gear in use. This may be due to how pedal assist works in a torque sensor e-bike, but this is the first time I've noticed it specifically. Because of this, I find myself riding in gear 8 on Turbo almost all the time. The lower gears feel like I'm pedaling against empty air with no forward push, and Sport or Eco don't feel like I'm getting enough return for the effort. Luckily, the e-bike has a hefty battery that is rated for about 60 miles of travel in Eco mode. My weekly outings are about 20 miles total with several uphill portions, and the battery is usually at about 60% when I return home. Aventon Abound SR review: the rear rack has a 143-pound capacityAnd yes, that's cruising mostly on Turbo and using the throttle to assist with hills or long open stretches. Overall, I'm quite pleased with the Aventon Abound SR. It's not too big but still rides like a sturdy fat tire e-bike. The ability to fold it for storage would just make it 20 pounds heavier, so maybe it's not missing that. It's small enough to fit in the spot in my bedroom where it is stored without issue. Premium features, mid-level priceI've reviewed a wide variety of e-bikes ranging from the sub-$1,000 to nearly $3,000. The biggest difference between them is usually more to do with motor power and smart features than construction. Aventon Abound SR review: premium features in a mid-range e-bikeThough, of course, certain materials make bikes lighter and much more expensive. The Aventon Abound SR strikes a good middle ground. The features punch much higher than its price class. It's a tad heavy but no heavier than other e-bikes of its size class. I quite like the kickstand that can be locked and the lack of a need for physical keys. If you're looking for something that'll get you up hills and make rough terrain feel smooth, Aventon Abound SR is a good choice. The added premium benefits and optional 4G connection are just a bonus. Aventon Abound SR - Pros Sturdy build, fat tires Heavy, but not overweight Torque sensing makes riding natural BMX-style handlebars are a fun design choice Cheap 4G, GPS, remote security options Interesting locking kickstand Battery doesn't need keys Widely configurable for riding needs in app Turn signals, headlight, and brake light are all musts Aventon Abound SR - Cons Shouldn't need to be in max Turbo and level 8 gear to feel most natural Lower gears and pedal assist feel tedious in default settings Rating: 4.5 out of 5Aventon has an excellent mid-range e-bike that should set the example for what customers should expect at this price. The smart features and strong motor are an excellent combo and worth the price. Where to buy Aventon Abound SRGet the Abound SR from Aventon's website for $1,899. There are blue, purple, and black color options and several accessories.",
