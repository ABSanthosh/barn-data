  "text": "News Add terabytes of ProRes video storage to your iPhone with SanDisk Creator Phone SSD. Photo: SanDisk The SanDisk Creator Phone SSD sets itself apart from rival portable drives with MagSafe. This means the drive magnetically clings to an iPhone where it’s available to hold up to 2 TB of ProRes video as it’s recorded. SanDisk unveiled the SSD at CES 2025, along with other new storage options. SanDisk Creator Phone SSD targets creators With an iPhone 16 Pro or Pro Max or the iPhone 15 series equivalents, you can record high-resolution ProRes video, but only if the data is going directly to an external drive. The SanDisk Creator Phone SSD is ready to be that drive. And because it connects to the back of the iPhone, the combination isn’t cumbersome to use. It offers data transfer speeds of up to 1000 MB/s read and up to 950 MB/s write, so creators can use it to record 4K video at 60fps. While SanDisk emphasizes using the drive with an iPhone Pro or Pro Max, it certainly isn’t limited to handsets. The drive comes with the USB-C cable necessary to connect to any Mac and most iPad models. And there’s even a stick-on magnetic ring so it can cling to a MacBook. SanDisk says the Creator Phone SSD is “specifically designed for producing content on the move.” It features a durable silicone shell, up to three-meter drop protection and IP65 water and dust resistance. Pricing starts at $109.99 for the 1 TB version. The cost for the 2 TB version was not announced. Whatever the capacity, the product is scheduled to launch sometime this spring. Buy it from: SanDisk More from SanDisk at CES 2025 CES 2025, going on this week in Las Vegas, is a major trade show with about 140,000 expected attendees. SanDisk is using the huge event to unveil a lot more than only the SanDisk Creator Phone SSD. Among the highlights is the Extreme PRO Dual Drive with both USB-A and USB-C connectors. The new SSD is SanDisk’s fastest dual drive yet, boasting read speeds up to 1,000MB/s and write speeds up to 900MB/s. Pricing starts at $59.99 for a 256GB version, and the product goes up to 2 TB for $299.99. It is expected to launch in the spring. Buy it from: SanDisk Also coming soon is the SanDisk Creator Phone Drive. It’s another dual-connector flash drive — this time with Lightning and USB Type-C. The drive starts at $49.99 for 128GB of storage, or there’s a 256 GB version for $69.99. It is scheduled to launch in February. Buy it from: SanDisk",
