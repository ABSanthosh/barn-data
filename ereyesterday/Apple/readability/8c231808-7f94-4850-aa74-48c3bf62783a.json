The upcoming updates are now in beta testing, and are expected to focus on bug fixes and security enhancements as usual. Some new features are likely to be included as well, with perhaps the most notable addition thus far being the introduction of Genmoji on the Mac. If you’re actively enrolled in the beta testing programs, you can find the updates available through the regular software update channels. How to Install iOS/iPadOS 18.3 Beta The iOS 18.3 beta build is available to beta testers through Software Update: Open “Settings”, and then go to “General” Select “Software Update” Choose to update to iOS 18.3 / iPadOS 18.3 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.3 beta The first MacOS 15.3 beta build is available in Software Update to beta testers right now: Go to the  Apple menu, then go to “System Settings” Select “General”, then go to “Software Update” Select to “Update Now” to install MacOS Sequoia 15.3 When will iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and MacOS Sequoia 15.3 be released for everyone? iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and MacOS Sequoia 15.3 will likely be available in January or February of 2025, after multiple rounds of beta releases have been tested thoroughly by Apple. Only Apple knows the timeline for software updates however, so this is pure speculation based on their typical beta and release cycle. The most recently available system software available for Apple devices are the freshly released macOS Sequoia 15.2 update, and iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 update.",
