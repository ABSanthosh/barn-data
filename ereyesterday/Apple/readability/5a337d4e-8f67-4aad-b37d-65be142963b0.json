  "text": "A second release candidate build of iOS 18.2, MacOS Sequoia 15.2, and iPadOS 18.2, has been made available for all beta testers. The 2nd RC build follows after issuing the first RC build a week prior. RC, or Release Candidate, are usually the finalized beta version of system software that is made available to beta testers before the final version is released to everyone in the public. This suggests the final release of iOS/iPadOS 18.2 and MacOS Sequoia 15.2 is soon, perhaps even this week. iOS 18.2 and MacOS Sequoia 15.2 will include a round of bug fixes and security patches, along with new AI features, a few smaller features like the ability to use iPhone Mirroring with Personal Hotspot, a weather widget for the Mac menu bar, and sharing for devices in Find My. By far the biggest change coming in iOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2 are the inclusion of more Apple Intelligence AI features, including ChatGPT integration and Image Playground which allows for generating images with AI. Currently, Apple Intelligence features are mostly summarization abilities and various useful writing tools. Apple’s AI features are strictly limited to newer devices however, meaning those capabilities will not be available for all users. How to Install iOS/iPadOS 18.2 RC 2 RC 2 build is available to beta testers through Software Update: Open “Settings”, and then go to “General” Select “Software Update” Choose to update to iOS 18.2 / iPadOS 18.2 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.2 RC 2 The RC 2 build is available in Software Update to beta testers right now: Go to the  Apple menu, then go to “System Settings” Select “General”, then go to “Software Update” Select to “Update Now” to install MacOS Sequoia 15.2 When will iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and MacOS Sequoia 15.2 be released for everyone? Because this is the second RC build, it’s likely the final version of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and MacOS Sequoia 15.2, will be available quite soon, perhaps by the end of this week, or next week. MacOS Sequoia 15.2 release notes Release notes included with the RC 2 build of MacOS Sequoia 15.2 are as follows: This update introduces new features powered by Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that unlocks powerful new ways to communicate, work, and express yourself, all while protecting your data with an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI.
