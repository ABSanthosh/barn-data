  "description": "Macworld Apple just unveiled watchOS 26, the latest version of its wrist-sized OS, and it’s bringing big changes this fall, including a new Workout Buddy and Liquid Glass design. You’ll need an Apple Watch Series 6 or later to install it, so if you have something older, today’s a great day to upgrade. Amazon is selling the 42mm Apple Watch Series 10 for $299, a savings of $100, matching the best price we’ve seen. The Series 10 is Apple’s latest watch, with a beautiful, thinner design, gorgeous edge-to-edge screen, and an array of health features and sensors, including ECG, temperature, and heart rate. It’s also. Got IP6X dust resistance and water resistance so good that you can even wear it when diving. And the battery life will get you through a complete day and a full night’s sleep with just a short charge before bed. In our 4.5-star review, we praised the performance and called it “the best smartwatch around.” And watchOS 26 will only make it better. So go grab one now before the price jumps back up.",
