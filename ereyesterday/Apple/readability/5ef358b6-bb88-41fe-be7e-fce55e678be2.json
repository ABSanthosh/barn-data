  "description": "Macworld As is tradition, Apple released beta versions of its new operating systems to developers on the first day of WWDC on June 9. The first beta release of iOS 26 had everything Apple demonstrated in its WWDC keynote: Liquid Glass, the new Phone app and features, the new Camera and Photos experience, and more. Subsequent releases have made refinements to the interface and fixed bugs. There are still plenty of bugs and unrefined areas, as you would expect with a major iOS update still weeks from release. Not everything is working as it should, and it is not advised to run this version of the OS unless you’re a developer or have a high tolerance for buggy or unoptimized software. You can read all about all the new features in our iOS 26 superguide and find out the latest information about the iOS beta including when it will launch and how to install it in a separate story. Update July 22: Apple has released iOS 26 beta 4. This is still a developers-only release, but we expect the Public Beta to be released as early as tomorrow, likely with the same build number. What’s new in the latest beta release Here’s what’s new in the fourth beta of iOS 26: The “liquid glass” interface effects have been further tweaked, now a little more glass-like than beta 3 but still more legible than earlier betas. On first launch, you are asked which notifications you want summaries for. You can individually select from: News \u0026 Entertainment, Communication \u0026 Social, and All Other Apps. There is a new Dynamic option for the iOS 26 wallpapers that cycles through them based on time of day. Silence Unknown Callers has three options: Never, Ask Reason for Calling, and Silence. Silence functions as it did in previous versions of iOS, and Ask Reason for Calling is the new Call Screening feature. The Camera app has a new splash screen to prepare you for the new simplified design. iOS 26: How to install the public beta The iOS 26 public beta test is expected to begin in July, but you can sign up now so you’re ready for it. Click Sign Up on the Apple Beta page and register with your Apple ID. Log in to the Beta Software Program. Click Enroll your iOS device. Open the Settings app, tap General, then Software Update. In the Beta Updates section, select the iOS Public Beta. It may take a few moments after registering for the beta option to appear in Software Update. iOS 26: How to install the developer beta You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer, but a free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app: Download the Apple Developer App from the App Store. Open the app. Tap on Account. Sign in using your usual Apple ID. Find out everything you need to know about iOS 18 in our iOS 26 superguide.",
