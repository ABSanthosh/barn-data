  "description": "Macworld Picture this: you’re on the go, your boss calls and you have to pick up the phone for a meeting. The meeting keeps getting longer and longer and, suddenly, your phone’s low-battery warning pops up. Instead of scrambling for power cable, you just take out the Baseus Picogo MagSafe portable power bank and magnetically connect it to the back of your phone. Crisis averted! Of course, the scenario may differ. You may be at a concert, you may be running late to meet a friend, or you may be trying to catch an Uber late at night—whatever the situation, a power bank like the Baseus Picogo can solve the problem for you. The Baseus Picogo MagSafe portable chargers are absolutely gorgeous, with a slim build and a sleek design. The aluminum alloy casing makes it easy for heat to dissipate, thus avoiding overheating during charging, plus they feature an AI monitoring chip that checks temps thousands of times every hour. The wear-resistant silicone surface is soft to the touch and leaves no messy fingerprints. This tiny power bank from Baseus is super-thin, so you’ll barely even feel the difference when you have it magnetically attached to the back of your iPhone (or your Android phone with a MagSafe case). Its edges are curved, so they won’t dig into your hand, either, which is such a smart detail. The device is also light enough that it won’t bother you to hold it while using your phone. There are two versions of the Baseus Picogo, and which you choose depends on your charging needs. Both 5,000mAh and 10,000mAh capacity versions are available. The 5,000mAh Picogo is only 0.3 inches thick and weighs 4.6oz, so you’ll barely even feel that you’re holding it. The 10,000mAh version is a bit thicker, measuring 0.5 inches, and weighing 7.8oz. Still, the devices otherwise have the same size, measuring just 2.62 inches in length and 3.93 inches in height. A key difference between these devices is their charging output, for both wired and wireless connections. The 5,000mAh Picogo delivers 7.5W wireless charging, but you can also use a type-C-to-C cable if you want a faster recharge–this can reach up to 20W. Don’t worry, the cable comes in the package. For the 10,000mAh Picogo, you can expect faster 15W Qi2-certified wireless charging and 27W wired charging via the USB-C port. Another thing to consider when making your choice is that the 5,000mAh Picogo typically offers a single recharge for your phone, while the 10,000mAh should deliver two full recharges. Of course, this all depends on your phone’s battery capacity. Since we know price matters, you should know the Baseus Picogo is on sale over at Amazon. The 5,000mAh Picogo costs $26.99 right now, a 55% discount from its MSRP. The 10,000mAh version is a bit more expensive, and and you can get it for $39.99, 20% under its MSRP. These deals are not going to last forever, so you should definitely move fast if you want to get one of these Baseus Picogo MagSafe power banks. The Baseus Picogo 5,000mAh is $26.99Buy now at Amazon The Baseus Picogo 10,000mAh is $39.99Buy now at Amazon",
