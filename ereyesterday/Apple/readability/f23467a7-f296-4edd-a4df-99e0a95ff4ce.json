Apple is reportedly overhauling the look of its various OSes with its next set of releases, expected to arrive in the fall of this year. Adopting the nomenclature of vehicle models, the company is set to jump from version numbers to reflecting the year ahead of release. According to a new report from Bloomberg, macOS 26 will adopt the name Tahoe, after California's Lake Tahoe resort area. The name is said to signal the significance of the update. Alongside new features, macOS Tahoe will feature a refreshed look to its interface. The name was chosen to reflect the significance of the changes. The last major overhaul of the look of the OS came in 2014 and was named Yosemite after the imposing rock formations of the national park. The macOS release accompanying the shift to Apple's own chips was named Big Sur, after the rugged mountainous region in central California. MacOS Tahoe has apparently been chosen to reflect the fresh look coming to the interface elements of the next release. Lake Tahoe is a popular resort location for Apple employees â€” image credit: ForbesLake Tahoe is a large freshwater lake straddling the border of California and Nevada, known for its natural beauty, high altitude, and various resorts. It is said to be a frequent vacation and second-home location for a number of Apple employees. The lake is also known for its deep blue water, reflecting the surrounding mountains and sky. Given the reports of updated icons and other interface elements, the name seems appropriate for a refreshed look coming to Apple's operating systems later this year.",
