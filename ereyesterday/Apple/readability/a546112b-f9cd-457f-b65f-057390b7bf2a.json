  "text": "Update: A spokesperson for Netflix has told The Verge that the integration with the Apple TV app’s Watchlist and Continue Watching features was a mistake and is being reversed. Perhaps the reaction to the change will cause Netflix to reconsider its refusal to participate in the TV app, but I wouldn’t hold your breath waiting for that to happen. FlatpanelsHD has discovered that Netflix, long a holdout that was unavailable in Apple’s TV app, is beginning to prompt users to add the service to the TV app: Today, FlatpanelsHD received a prompt on Apple TV 4K to integrate Netflix into the Apple TV app, as shown at the bottom. After accepting, Netflix content appeared in the Continue Watching queue and Watchlist within the Apple TV app, as seen below. FlatpanelsHD says the feature is currently limited to Netflix Originals programming and users who are also U.S. account holders. I’ve looked for this myself and haven’t seen it yet, but it may just be that the rollout is happening gradually. As of publication, I haven’t seen an update to the Netflix app (though the update may be a server-side change) and as 9to5Mac points out, Apple’s list of apps that support Watchlist hasn’t been updated in almost one year. So, it’s possible that after more people have the new feature, we’ll see an official announcement from Apple and/or Netflix. This is great news, although my enthusiasm is tempered by the reported limitations. I hope the feature extends beyond Netflix Originals and to other countries. Still, for a lot of people I’m sure the only service they use that isn’t in the TV app is Netflix, so any integration after all these years is better than none. I know I’ll be checking my Apple TV throughout the day to try this myself.",
