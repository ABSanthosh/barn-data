Anker stands out as one of the leaders of the home energy industry. Thanks chiefly to its wide range of products for every potential need, including charging electronics and portable power stations. With a reputation for quality and efficiency, Anker actively tries to push the boundaries of its approach to energy. It has a track record of consistently creating smaller, more powerful, quiet, and cost-effective options for home, campsite, and worksite. I'm looking at Anker's new C1000X portable power station. What is the Anker Solix C1000XThe Anker Solix C1000X is a portable power station. One that Anker advertises as a stable solution for portable power and durability, with increased charging speeds and precise power management with its brand-exclusive app. Anker Solix C1000X review: Specifications25 lbs. 10in height x 14in length x 8in width Capacity: 1056Wh Output: 1,800W Cycle Life: 5-year warranty and up to 3,000 charging cycles over 10 years before capacity reduces. AC input: 1,300 watts Solar input (optional): 600W Max Ports: AC outlets (x 6), USB-A (24-watt x 2), USB-C (100-watt x 1/30-watt x 1), Car \"cigarette-lighter\" port (120-watt x 1) Uninterruptable power supply (UPS) mode with 20ms switchover timeAnker Solix C1000X review: Inside the BoxThe C1000X arrived in a single box that was well packed and padded for protection during shipping. Anker Solix C1000X review: The front of the deviceInside the box, Anker includes everything needed to put the C1000x to work. Just the unit, the AC charging cable, solar charging cable, and a QR code to the full user manual on the Anker site. Anker Solix C1000X review: Quality and FeaturesOut of the box, the C1000X is well-made, and doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Everything from the case to the buttons and the cables feels heavy and durable. Anker pushes the flexibility of the station for outdoor use and camping adventures . It's not hard to believe this little power station could thrive in wilderness environments or on worksites with steel-toed boots and heavy tools. Unlike other portable power stations, the C1000X weighs only 25 pounds. I say only, as other power stations I recently reviewed tipped the scales as high as 53 pounds while still being advertised as \"portable\". Anker Solix C1000X review: Chunky handles are great for lifting. Understanding that 25 pounds is not light for some with possible injuries or health issues, the C1000X does make it easier to transport with sturdy construction and built-in handles. All the outlets are on the front of the C1000X and easily accessible. The charging inputs for AC wall charging and the optional solar panels are accessible on the sides of the station. The C1000X has a large, bright display, with text that is easy to read in the dark and in direct sunlight. This is a great display for a portable power station, and the ambient light bar across the front of the station is great for nighttime use. Anker Solix C1000X review: Charging OptionsAnker claims the C1000X will reach a full charge in under one hour. For testing, I allowed the C1000X to run to nearly empty before plugging it into an outlet. Though I was skeptical, the C1000X did reach a full 100 percent charge in one hour. Be aware that when the internal cooling fans kick on, it sounds like you are trying to land a small aircraft in the house. Charging the station at full wattage brings speed and noise, so a quiet nighttime charge is not viable at the default setting. However, the Anker app does allow you to reduce the wattage for recharging the station, cutting the need for the noisy fans. Anker Solix C1000X review: Some extra ports on the side.Anker offers a variety of solar panels on its website for outdoor charging for the C1000X separately. They range from 30W to 400W, and from $109 US to $1,199 US. I did not have access to solar panels for my review, but I have heard positive reviews, and Anker's reputation for high quality products precedes it. Anker Solix C1000X review: UsageA common trend with power station manufacturers is the use of brand-specific apps to control features and monitor levels. The Anker Solix app is excellent, allowing you to sync up the Anker Solix C1000X over your Wi-Fi network or Bluetooth. It can control everything from recharging wattage to timers for the various outlets, and even the light bar on the station. This is the best power station app I have used to date. For testing, I wanted to put the Anker Solix C1000X through a series of scenarios that occur in my life as a work-from-home artist. Specifically, when I lose power in the stormy tornado seasons here in the southern United States. Working from home means the loss of power is the loss of everything, and in the dark, I am relegated to my phone and Nintendo Switch to pass the time. To simulate a blackout, the C1000X was fully powered up with the standard wall charging option, and it was used to run various appliances from its connections. I ran my refrigerator and router, charged my iPhone, iPad, and Nintendo Switch with ease for 8 hours on just the C1000X alone. It still had some charge left to burn afterwards. The C1000X handled this very well, and adding a set of solar panels would extend the usage time further. Anker Solix C1000X review: The display gives you essential stats on power usage.I ran my router, Mac Studio, and Xencelabs drawing tablet for 8 hours with zero issues, and I also tested the UPS functionality with my workstation. It all worked perfectly. However, the C1000X is not as quiet as other power stations on the market. The fan noise while operating high-wattage devices and recharging the station at full speed from an outlet is noticeable. This is the tradeoff for a system that monitors battery temperature 100 times per second to prevent overheating. Anker Solix makes a point to state that the C1000X is protected against bumps, drops, UV light, and fire. However, it does not mention waterproofing. I did not drop water on the power station to test this, but using a tarp or keeping it out of the rain are probably very good ideas. Anker Solix C1000X review: A high cost for portable powerThe Anker Solix C1000X normally retails for $1,299 US for just the power station and nothing else. This is not inexpensive or consumer-friendly. For many households, this is an investment, and for this level of retail cost, and as said in other power station reviews, including the smallest solar panel option with this power station is not too much to ask for. The C1000X is advertised as compact and portable. But weighing 25 pounds and not being waterproofed means this station is good for permanent indoor use, glamping campsites, and dry worksites. It is portable, and the range of outputs is great. However, the fan noise when you run the C1000X at full speed is a deterrent when other power stations run and charge at comparable speeds and outputs at barely a whisper. The battery life, charging speed, and output of the C1000X is more than good enough for home use as an emergency power station, and as a static UPS for workstations. But there are better on-the-go options on the market that are cheaper and more travel-friendly. Anker Solix C1000X ProsExcellent storage capacity and power output Excellent array of outlets Sturdy, high-quality build Excellent app and app controlsAnker Solix C1000X ConsVery high cost for entry Solar panels are not included Fan noise for battery cooling Not lightweight Not waterproofRating: 3.5 out of 5Where to buy the Anker Solix C1000XThe Anker Solix C1000X and all the Anker Solix accessories are available from Anker directly.",
