  "text": "While we aren’t getting a new Apple Vision Pro model in 2025 as some may have hoped, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that Apple is planning a ‘feature-packed release’ for visionOS 3 this year at WWDC. According to Mark Gurman, a second-generation version of Vision Pro with a new M-series chip is still in the pipeline, as well as cheaper versions of the headset. However, neither of these things will come to fruition in 2025, despite the fact that the current generation headset still uses 2022’s M2 chipset, which’ll be four years old by the time there’s a refresh. However, despite Apple’s future headset plans sounding somewhat lackluster, its software plans certainly aren’t. Last month, Apple introduced visionOS 2.4 beta, bringing Apple Intelligence to the headset, as well as a much needed Vision Pro app for iPhone. It also introduces Spatial Gallery, and the company will release it to the public in April. As exciting as those features are, that isn’t the end of it. Reportedly, visionOS 3 will be a pretty major update as well – although Gurman is unfortunately light on details: All signs are pointing to the company’s Vision Products Group shifting its resources to other form factors. But Apple can’t just let the Vision Pro die out. It has invested too much and needs to keep churning out the device’s visionOS updates (the third edition will be a pretty feature-packed release, I’m told).  While new hardware, especially if it were cheaper, would be very exciting – it seems Apple’s priority is having visionOS be as robust as possible. This move will likely play off in the long run.
