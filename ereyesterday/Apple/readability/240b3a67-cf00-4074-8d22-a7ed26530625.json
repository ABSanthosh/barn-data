  "description": "Macworld With a gorgeous ProMotion display, all you need to turn your iPad Pro into a MacBook Pro is the right keyboard, and that’s exactly what the iPad Magic Keyboard case is—and today it’s available for a brand new best price. Amazon is selling the Magic Keyboard for the M4 iPad Pro 11-inch for $250, a savings of $50 off its $299 MSRP. This new Magic Keyboard is sleeker than previous models, and it was created specifically for the new iPad Pro models that were released earlier this year. It’s thinner than other Magic keyboards, and there’s even a function row to allow you to quickly control volume, brightness, or media, just like you would on a laptop. The new trackpad is also larger and comes with haptic feedback. It also supports various Multi-Touch gestures, enabling you to scroll, swipe, or zoom. Another nice touch is that the keys are backlit, making them easier to see when you’re using the tablet in the evening. We know the iPad Pro M4 is rather pricey, but it does deliver a fantastic performance thanks to the new chip and all the other upgrades Apple delivered. It’s so good that we gave it a super-rare 5-star rating. But adding the Magic Keyboard will give you a more MacBook-like experience while also offering the tablet the protection it needs when you travel. So snatch the Apple Magic Keyboard for the M4 iPad Pro for $250 at Amazon, the best price yet. This is the best price we've seen for this new Magic KeyboardBuy it now at Amazon",
