  "text": "LG unveiled a beautiful new 6K display at CES 2025, dubbed the LG UltraFine 6K Display. It marks the first 6K monitor to incorporate Thunderbolt 5, a feature recently introduced by Apple in the new M4 Pro Mac mini and M4 Pro MacBook Pro models launched in November. Details, including price and release date, are still unknown, but we can learn a few things from LG’s teaser. The LG UltraFine 6K display, though still shrouded in technical details, boasts a few crucial specifications. Notably, it’s a 6K display, though the exact resolution remains undisclosed. Apple’s Pro Display XDR stands as a comparable 6K display, boasting a native resolution of 6016 x 3384 pixels across a 32-inch panel. This equates to a whopping 20.4 million pixels and an impressive 218 pixels-per-inch. LG also collaborates with Dell to produce a panel for their 6K UltraSharp, which features a resolution of 6144 x 3456. Based on the model number 32U990A, we can confidently deduce that this display is a 32-inch model, matching the dimensions of the Pro Display XDR and the Dell UltraSharp 6K. Another key aspect is the panel technology employed, which is a Nano IPS Black panel. This panel boasts a wide color gamut, spanning 99.5% of Adobe RGB and 98% of DCI-P3. While it’s definitely not a direct competitor to the Pro Display XDR in terms of color accuracy or contrast ratio, the Nano IPS Black technology offers a significant advantage in terms of cost-effectiveness. By opting for IPS Black instead of miniLED or OLED, LG ensures that the display remains within an accessible price range for consumers. The most pressing question is the refresh rate. Will LG opt for a 60Hz panel, or will the UltraFine 6K offer at least a 120Hz refresh rate? Considering the monitor’s Thunderbolt 5 connection, I believe a 6K/120Hz option is feasible, but we can’t confirm until LG confirms it. A 6016 x 3384 display running at 120Hz would necessitate approximately 79.64 Gb/s of bandwidth. Thunderbolt 5 supports 80Gb/s of bi-directional data and 120Gb/s in one direction with bandwidth boost enabled. However, this is purely speculative, disregarding technologies like Display Stream Compression. It’s reasonable to assume that LG would acknowledge the demand for a higher resolution monitor with a higher refresh rate. This would be an ideal companion for Pro Motion-enabled MacBooks. If the price is reasonable, LG could sell many of these units. The other significant factor is adoption. The majority of potential buyers don’t own Macs with Thunderbolt 5 capability. Therefore, will the monitor support a lower resolution at a reduced refresh rate, such as 6K60 like the Pro Display XDR? While this seems plausible, we’ll have to wait for more details. However, I believe LG wouldn’t want to restrict the market for its new display to Mac owners of the M4 Pro models. The original LG UltraFine 5K Display…that forehead, though. Finally, let’s delve into the design of the LG UltraFine 6K. In a word, it’s breathtaking. The front panel boasts a striking symmetry, almost devoid of bezels, creating an all-screen illusion. Not a single logo, button, or any other visual element graces the display. This is undoubtedly an improvement over the LG UltraFine 5K Display, which launched back in 2019. The display build materials are intriguing. While I’m not certain if it’s entirely made of metal, the teaser image certainly wants us to believe that. Moreover, it comes equipped with a height-adjustable stand that bears a resemblance to the one found on the Apple Studio Display. Personally, I’m very excited to learn more – if LG plays its cards right, it could have a bonafide hit on its hands. In the meantime, I’d love to hear your thoughts.
