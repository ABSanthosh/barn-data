RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA Apple today announced the expansion of Apple Retail into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with the launch of the Apple Store online and Apple Store app, introducing support directly from Apple in Arabic for the very first time. The arrival of the online store marks a new era for customers in Saudi Arabia, who will be able to shop Apple’s full range of products with exceptional service delivered by Apple’s talented, dedicated team members. “We are thrilled to bring the Apple Store online and the Apple Store app to Saudi Arabia, offering customers a new way to explore and shop Apple’s extraordinary lineup of products and services,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail and People. “Our customers in Saudi Arabia are passionate about the things they can do with technology, and our teams can’t wait to connect with customers and help them discover how Apple innovations can meaningfully enrich their daily lives.” The Most Personalized Shopping Experience The Apple Store online is the best place for customers in Saudi Arabia to discover and shop Apple’s full lineup of products. With the Apple Store app, customers can enjoy a personalized shopping experience with recommendations tailored to the Apple products they already own. Additionally, customers can compare different models, access their saved items, and easily track their orders. The Apple Store online and Apple Store app offer the most personalized experience for customers to shop iPhone. The iPhone 16 lineup is built from the ground up for Apple Intelligence, unlocking exciting new capabilities that make iPhone even more helpful and powerful, all while taking an extraordinary step forward for privacy.1 Apple offers configure-to-order options for Mac customers, allowing them to select and customize the device to their specific requirements, including chip memory and storage. Customers can also personalize their Apple Watch case and band combination to create a unique look. For the first time ever, free engraving is available in Arabic and English on apple.com/sa-en/store. Customers can personalize their AirPods, Apple Pencil, AirTag, and more with text, emoji, and numbers in dual language. Free engraving is available in English and Arabic for the first time, allowing customers to personalize items like their AirPods in dual language. Apple’s Retail Services Apple’s incredible retail services make it easier than ever for customers in Saudi Arabia to discover and shop Apple technology. Personalized shopping support via chat and phone helps customers to find the best product that suits their needs. After receiving their order, customers can also connect with an Apple team member online to get help with Personal Setup, switching to iOS with easy and safe data migration, as well as cellular activation. To support flexible shopping, the Apple Store online will offer an affordability option through Tamara. With Buy Now Pay Later, customers can shop their favorite lineups and pay in four-month installments at 0 percent interest. The Apple Trade In program allows customers in Saudi Arabia to trade in their current device and receive credit toward a new one. If their device is not eligible for a credit, Apple will recycle it for free, diverting electronic waste from landfills and saving precious materials. With AppleCare+, customers can receive one-stop service and support from Apple experts available on iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch. AppleCare+ provides customers with two years of priority support and service, priority access to experts, and protection for their devices. Through the Apple Education Store, higher education students, their parents, and teachers and staff at all levels can exclusively save on a Mac or iPad with Apple education pricing. And until September 30, eligible customers can take advantage of a special back-to-school offer that includes AirPods or an accessory of their choice when they buy an eligible Mac or iPad. Apple announced its plans to begin opening the first of several flagship Apple Store locations in Saudi Arabia starting in 2026. As part of this expansion, Apple is in the initial stages of planning an iconic retail store coming to Diriyah, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Apple’s retail expansion builds on its existing investments and activities in the country. This includes the region’s first Apple Developer Academy, which opened in Riyadh in 2021 in partnership with the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Tuwaiq Academy, and Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University.
