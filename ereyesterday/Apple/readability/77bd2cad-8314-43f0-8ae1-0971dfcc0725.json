MacPilot shows you how to tap into macOS’s Unix underpinnings to deliver under-the-hood tweaks and customizations that will make your Mac life simpler. For a limited time, you can get lifetime access to MacPilot for just $29.97 with code MAC10 (regularly $99). The MacPilot tools are built on the Unix that underlies every modern version of macOS. Apple introduced the Unix-based Mac OS X operating system at the turn of the millennium. And down at the kernel, macOS remains a Unix system. That said, Apple made numerous changes over the years — not least because not everyone wants to monkey around with a command line. That’s where MacPilot comes in. Building off of Unix, MacPilot offers more than 1,200 options for you to customize your Mac precisely to your liking. In addition, it takes what could be intimidating about Unix and presents it in the Mac interface, so you won’t need to tap commands into Terminal. MacPilot lets you operate your Mac more like a Unix machine. You can run common Unix scripts or reveal hidden files, for example. The options range from cosmetic changes like turning off animations and changing how your Mac’s Dock is organized to serving up access to your Mac’s statistics to ensure it’s running at top efficiency. This tool for customizing your Mac proves so helpful that it earned 4 out of 5 on MacUpdate. And Tech Journey called MacPilot a “Swiss Army knife” for day-to-day Mac maintenance and customization. Save on a MacPilot lifetime license and commence tweaking Everyone is different, and we all use our Macs for different things. This lifetime MacPilot license lets you easily customize your Mac your way for $29.97 with code MAC10 at checkout. That’s a 70% discount off the regular price of $99.
