After Upgraded makes that payment, your account will be credited the amount of the payment and you are responsible for paying any other remaining balance on your Line of Credit. Citizens Pay has no involvement in or responsibility for assessing the condition of a device, your eligibility for an upgrade, determination or application of Upgraded’s upgrade policies, or the amount of the payment made by Upgraded, and any dispute related to any aspect of upgrade will be directed to Upgraded.
