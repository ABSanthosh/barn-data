Apple Watch Series 10 – $299 (down from $399) Amazon is taking 25% off the price of brand new Apple Watch Series 10 models in various color and band options. Apple Watch Series 10 features a 42mm always-on display, fitness and activity tracking, heart rate monitor, ECG, crash detection, fall detection, Emergency SOS, ovulation tracking, GPS, pinch gestures, water resistance, voice control, Siri commands, all-day battery life, and more.

Yes Apple just updated the MacBook Air lineup with M4 chips, but those start at $999, so if you’re looking to save some cash and you don’t mind having a prior generation chip, the M2 is available at a great place and is no slouch. The M2 chip supports Apple Intelligence and is speedy and energy efficient, making this a great portable Mac for an unusually low price point.

That’s in addition to the standard great AirPods Pro features, like high fidelity sound, active noise cancellation, Spatial Audio, water and sweat resistance, custom fit, transparency mode for ambient sounds, ear detection, Siri command support, and a USB-C charging case. AirPods Pro 2 – $169.99 (down from $249) AirTags 4-pack for $70 (down from $99) Amazon is still offering a 4-pack of AirTag trackers for just $70, down from the $99 retail price.
