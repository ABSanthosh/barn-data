  "description": "Macworld On January 17, “Severance,” Apple’s most popular show not named “Ted Lasso,” will begin its long-awaited second season. And Apple is so excited to mark the occasion, it wants to make sure everyone is caught up on the first season. This weekend, Apple is making Apple TV+ free for everyone. That means you can watch as many shows and movies as you can handle in a 48-hour period, beginning at midnight on Saturday and continuing until 11:59 pm on Sunday. You can access Apple TV+ through the Apple TV app on all Apple devices, Roku, Google TV Streamer, and most smart TVs, including Samsung and LG. Apple has already received several Golden Globe nominations, including Best Drama for “Slow Horses” and Best Limited Series for “Disclaimer.” Other critically acclaimed shows airing in 2024 are “Shrinking” starring Harrison Ford and “Presumed Innocent” led by Jake Gyllenhaal. But of course, you can’t watch everything. Here are our picks for what to check out in the allotted time: Severence: Apple’s delightfully strange and gripping drama is one of the best shows you’ll find on any platform. There are a total of nine episodes inthe first season, about an hour each. Total time: About 9 hours Shrinking: Shorter and lighter than “Severence” but just as entertaining, “Shrinking” centers on a therapist (Jason Segel) who becomes very involved in his patients’ lives. Hilarity and emotion ensue in this fast watch with just 10 half-hour episodes in the first season. Total time: About 5 hours The Morning Show: The show that started it all. Starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, the show is about, you guessed it, the trials and tribulations of a morning news show. There are three seasons, but check out the first, with 10 episodes at about an hour each, and you’ll be hooked. Total time: About 10 hours Fly Me to the Moon: Even if you’re not a moon landing conspiracist, this brisk comedy starring Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum will make you a believer. Total time: About 2 hours, 11 minutes Ted Lasso: If you haven’t seen the show everyone was talking about in 2021, it’s still worth a watch. A heartwarming and hilarious fish-out-of-water tale, “Ted Lasso” is as good as everyone says it is. Season 1 is 10 half-hour episodes. Total time: About 6 hours Apple TV+ normally costs $9.99 a month with a seven-day free trial for new subscribers. Additionally, customers who purchase and activate a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, or Mac get three months of Apple TV+ for free. For more information about all the trials on offer, read about how to get Apple TV+ for free.",
