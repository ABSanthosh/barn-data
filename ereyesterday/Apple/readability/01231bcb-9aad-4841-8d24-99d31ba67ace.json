  "text": "BLUETTI has long been an innovator in portable energy storage, and has long been committed to clean and sustainable energy. Its focus on compact, durable, and affordable power solutions has made BLUETTI a market leader. With BLUETTI’s spring sale, you can get up to 54% off of products across their lineup, including an all time low on its Elite 200 V2 portable power station. You can also use our exclusive discount code, 9TO5MAC5OFF, to save an additional 5% on all purchases made through the official BLUETTI store and Amazon. These products are great for van life, road trips, camping, and more. Elite 200 V2 Portable Power Station Elite 200 V2 offers a 2kWh automotive-grade LFP battery. This battery, thanks to its cutting-edge LiFePO4 technology and smart battery management system, will last up to 6000 cycles. That’s 12 times the industry standard, so you can rest easy with this power station. BLUETTI promises an up-to 17 year lifespan. It packs 2kWh into a very compact form factor, around the same size as other 1kWh power stations. It can also output up to 2600W, which allows you to power tons of appliances on the go. This includes microwaves, refrigerators, routers, and more. Plus, it offers up to 3900W of output through power lifting, allowing you to power even higher wattage accessories, such as hot plates and hair dryers. It also runs as quiet as a whisper while running, at just 16dB. That’s quieter than leaves rustling, and over twice as quiet as sitting in a library. You can also recharge the Elite 200 V2 to 80% in an hour if you tap into AC charging and its 1000W solar panel. For just $899, you can pick up this incredible power station. This is the lowest price BLUETTI has ever offered, 47% off now on both BLUETTI’s store and on Amazon. Remember, you can save an additional 5% on the Elite 200 V2 and BLUETTI’s entire solar generator lineup, with our special discount code 9TO5MAC5OFF. BLUETTI Charger 1 Alternator Charger BLUETTI Charger 1 is known for being widely compatible. It works with all BLUETTI power stations, as well as 95% of other brands on the market. With this alternator, you can take advantage of the kinetic output of a moving vehicle, allowing for a much faster charge than a car’s cigarette lighter. With the Charger 1, you can pull up to 560W of power, which’ll provide a 6x faster charge than a cigarette lighter. It also has active cooling for sustained peak performance. The Charger 1 is also equipped with a number of safety features, to ensure your vehicle battery and power station stay safe from short circuits, undervoltage, and overheating. It also intelligently powers itself on and off, ensuring that it doesn’t drain your car’s battery. BLUETTI also offers an app for easy control and setup, and it comes with a 2-year warranty. It also comes with DC input cables out of the box, so you won’t need to buy them separately. You can pick up the Alternator Charger 1 from BLUETTI’s store for just $249. Plus, save 5% with code 9TO5MAC5OFF. Smaller power stations If you don’t quite need the 2kWh battery that the Elite 200 V2 offers, BLUETTI also has you covered with more compact and more lightweight offerings. Its AC70 and AC180 offerings pack a good chunk of power at a much lower price tag. BLUETTI’s AC70 offers 768Wh of capacity. It can output up to 1000W standard, or 2000W in power lifting mode. This can power a refrigerator for nearly 8 hours, or recharge your smartphone up to 24 times. It offers 7 outlets, and can be recharged up to 80% in just 45 minutes. You can buy the AC70 on BLUETTI’s store for $359. For even more power, AC180 kicks everything up by a notch, offering up to 1800W of output, or 2700W in power lifting mode. It also packs 1152Wh of capacity, and offers 11 varying output ports. With this capacity, you can power a light for 103 hours, a fan for 26 hours, or recharge your laptop 17 times. The AC180 can be purchased at BLUETTI’s store for $449. Make sure you use our exclusive discount code, 9TO5MAC5OFF, to save 5% on any of your BLUETTI purchases. You can also follow BLUETTI on Facebook and X/Twitter for updates. There are a number of other BLUETTI products on discount during this spring sale. You can check out all of BLUETTI’s spring offerings on its official website and its Amazon store. You can save up to 54%!
