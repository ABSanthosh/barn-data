  "text": "The popular messaging app has just released another update that brings improvements and some new features. The latest version of Telegram brings an AI-powered sticker search, as well as enhancements to the app’s video player. Read on as we break down everything that’s new in Telegram. Searching for stickers with AI on Telegram As detailed in a blog post (via MacMagazine), today’s update makes it much easier to find a specific sticker to send in a chat. Thanks to AI, users can better describe the sticker they’re looking for, even using more complex keywords like “thinking monkey” and “space dog.” Telegram says the feature works in 29 languages, including English, Spanish, Arabic, and Hindi. “With this update, the AI model now returns results from millions of custom stickersand emoji uploaded by Telegram users,” the post reads. Telegram also notes that anyone can create their own stickers in “just a few simple steps.” When it comes to video, the Telegram app now has many new features. This includes the option to copy the link of a video with a specific timestamp. This way, you can share the exact moment of a video with your friends. In addition, Telegram now allows users to set a custom cover photo for videos in channels. Another new feature saves the progress of videos, so you can close the app and then continue watching exactly where you left off. There’s also a new section to find a list of bots similar to the ones you already use and an option to react with Stars on channels to support creators. The updates are now being rolled out to Telegram users on iOS. Telegram for iOS is available for free on the App Store. Make sure you have the latest version of the app installed on your device to get access to all the new features.
