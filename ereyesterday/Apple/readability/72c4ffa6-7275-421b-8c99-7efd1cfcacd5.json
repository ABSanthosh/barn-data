It will not be released for AirPods Max or other non-H2 devices. With the firmware version 7B19, Apple introduced Hearing Health features to the AirPods Pro 2, which let users perform hearing tests or use the device as a hearing aid in cases of mild to moderate hearing loss. While the exact contents of Monday's firmware update are unclear, the software likely includes various bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements rather than new features. Apple has not provided any release notes for this version. Monday's new firmware update is installed automatically for users when the AirPods are plugged into their charging case and connected to an iOS device. There is no manual installation method for this firmware update.
