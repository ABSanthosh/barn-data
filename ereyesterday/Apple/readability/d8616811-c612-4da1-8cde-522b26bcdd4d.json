Photo: Cult of Mac Deals With storms and flash floods becoming more prevalent, it’s more important than ever to stay up to date with the weather in your area. And a weather radar app like Weather Hi-Def Radar lets you do just that. This isn’t just an upgraded version of the bare-bones Weather app on your iPhone. It’s an alert system and interactive map that allows you to plan your day and stay ahead of tornadoes, wildfires and more. And now, the Weather Hi-Def Radar Storm Watch Plus plan is priced at only $28 for life with code TAKE30.

Enable location services, and you can see your local conditions at a glance, along with those of any cities or towns you’ve keyed in as favorites. And you don’t just get a static map with this weather radar app, either. You’ll get an HD moving display of current and future cloud cover, along with highlighted trouble spots that could affect your commute. It works on iPhone as well as Android devices. Select the type of local weather data that affects your life If you’re focusing on one particular factor, you can remove layers to see just the temperature, snowfall levels, wind speed, road conditions and even water surface temperature. Just select whatever factors seem relevant to you. With this weather radar app, you can plan your day with confidence. Rain alerts will tell you when precipitation is detected within 10 miles of your location. And its severe weather alerts can do the same with earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and wildfires, making this handy app a potential lifesaver. Those with asthma or sensitivity to allergens can monitor the air quality. Other options let you set marine and coastal alerts, view lightning strikes and check snow conditions.
