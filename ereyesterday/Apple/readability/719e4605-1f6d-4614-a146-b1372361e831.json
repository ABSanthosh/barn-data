One of the biggest reasons I like my iMac is because it has a single cord. Of course, that doesn't stop me from finding myself plugging in a bunch of stuff to the Hyperdrive iMac Hub when it comes time to charge just about anything. And I'd argue a bunch of cords coming out of the front of my computer looks worse. That's why I was pretty stoked to try out Basus' Nomos 5-in-One Desktop Charging Station. When it comes to design, I tend to highly prioritize function over form. I think the best products in your life are ones that integrate into your life seamlessly, like they've always been there. The Nomos 5-in-1 is way more centered on function than form. It's a little black rectangle that sits on your desktop and won't be mistaken for anything other than a charging station. Do I love the aesthetics of the Nomos 5-in-1? No, not particularly. But what I love is that, if I'm not using it, I barely notice it. And when I do use it, it does what it says on the box, does it well, and solves problems other products don't. It's got a flip-up 15W Qi2 charger, which makes it a great general-purpose charger. If you've got an iPhone 16, you might be a bit bummed that it's not a 20W charger, but I'm still using the iPhone 13 mini, so it fits my criteria perfectly. Baseus Nomos 5-in-1 desktop charger - Charging an iPad and Steam Deck simultaneously I love that the Qi2 charging pad flips up. That means you throw your iPhone on and use it in nightstand mode. You can also orient it vertically, if that's more your style. On the front of the Nomos 5-in-1, from left to right, you have a 100W retractable charging cable, a 100W USB-C 2 port, a 140 USB-C 3 port, and a 15W USB-A port. I'm floored by the fact that I haven't had a retractable cable charging station at this point. Being able to unhook my Steam Deck and then hide the charging cable is a game changer as far as desk clutter goes. To the right of the Qi2 charging pad is a little LCD display designed to give you feedback about the power you're delivering to your devices. This is pretty neat, though admittedly I don't really need the feature. And, I initially thought,\"Oh, this would make this entirely unusable for a nightstand, that's a shame.\" But I'm happy to report that I was wrong. On the side next to the diplay, there's a barely noticeable button. Pressing it once will cycle it to a more advanced readout that tells you how much power each port is drawing. Baseus Nomos 5-in-1 desktop charger - this is the advanced readout showing individual port power drawBut, if you press and hold the button, it turns the display off. Suddenly, you have the perfect nightstand charging dock. I'd argue that it's probably even better on a night stand than it is a desk, though your milage may vary. Maybe you're not like me, the kind of person who has a few too many electronics beside their bed. Baseus Nomos 5-in-1 Desktop Charger - Performance As I stated above, my favorite products are ones that seamlessly integrate into my life when I need them, and sort of disappear into the background when I don't. I think the Nomos 5-in-1 fits that criteria handily. The main thing I use this little charging station for is charging my iPhone. Sure, I could do that with just about any MagSafe charger. But I like the option to connect other devices if I needed it. My only real complaint is that I'd like it a little more if it nixed the display and opted for a second, flat Qi pad. It wouldn't even need to be a Qi2 charger. Just something you could easily toss a second smartphone on — if you're like me, your AirPods Pro. Baseus Nomos 5-in-1 Desktop Charger - The final verdict It's a solid charger, provided you find yourself needing the option to charge a few devices at a single time. And, for me, that's hardly rare. I have an iPad, an iPhone, AirPods Max, AirPods Pro Baseus Nomos 5-in-1 desktop charger on deskOf course, it doesn't entirely solve the problem of cord clutter. If I'm charging three or four devices at once, I'm still going to have excessive cords on my desk. But, its small footprint does mean that I can scoot it to the back corner of my desk, rather than having a bunch of cords hanging out of the front of my iMac. It's also a good reason to dig out all those short cords. that have been piling up in the back of your junk drawers — they'll work perfectly here.
