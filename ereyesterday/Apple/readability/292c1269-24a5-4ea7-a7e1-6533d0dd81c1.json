Photo: Cult of Mac Deals thThe two sleep aid devices in this bundle might be the most unexpected sleep hack since warm milk: a Bluetooth headband and a guided meditation light, working together to help you beat insomnia. You can listen to hypnotic stories and meditations (or your favorite podcasts) through the comfy HoomBand headband, while the Dodow light guides you through breathing exercises to help you fall asleep naturally. This bundle is for anyone who’s tired of being tired, and doesn’t know where else to turn. Get both sleep aid devices for just $116.99 (regularly $138.90). Sleep aids that help you get a good night’s sleep … every night You’ve tried white noise, meditation apps and blackout curtains. But somehow, you’re still staring at the ceiling at 2 a.m., feeling wide awake. Sure, you could pop some pills and wake up groggy. But the sleep aids in this bundle give you a high-tech way of summoning the Sandman. The HoomBand plays bedtime stories for grown-ups The HoomBand is a Bluetooth-enabled headband with flat, built-in speakers that sit comfortably against your ears. And yes, it even works for side sleepers. It’s an alternative to Soundcore’s well-reviewed Sleep A20 sleep earbuds and competitors like the more-affordable SleepEez earbuds. Like those devices, the HoomBand pairs with your iPhone and plays anything you like. However, it comes with a secret weapon: exclusive access to the Livlab app. That means 100+ hours of sleep-inducing stories, meditations and ambient soundscapes designed by actual sleep experts. Want the HoomBand to shut off after one story? You got it. Or perhaps you prefer a white noise loop to drown out your upstairs neighbor’s late-night stomping? Done. Plus, the headband sleep aid is adjustable, breathable and comes with 10 hours of battery life on a two-hour charge. The Dodow meditation light teaches your brain how to chill The Dodow looks like a minimalist puck, but it’s actually a breathing and meditation coach that projects a soft blue light onto your ceiling. Tap once for the eight-minute mode or twice for 20 minutes. Then, you simply sync your breathing with the light’s rhythm, inhaling as it expands and exhaling as it contracts. This slows your breathing, activates your parasympathetic nervous system, and gently guides your brain out of overthinking mode. No app, no noise and no nonsense. It even turns itself off when you’re (hopefully) half or fully asleep. Together, these sleep aids are your all-natural, all-digital sleep stack With this sleep aids bundle, there are no subscriptions. No pills. And no pressure. Just smarter sleep through surprisingly simple tech. If you’ve had it with dazed mornings and overpriced sleep apps, this bundle could become your new nighttime routine.
