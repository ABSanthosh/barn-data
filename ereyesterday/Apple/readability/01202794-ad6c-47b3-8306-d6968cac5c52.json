  "text": "Apple Intelligence is here on Mac, iPhone, and iPad, and while the system requirements are strict, the Apple devices that are new and powerful enough to use the AI tools now gain some really fantastic features. We’re going to show you six helpful Apple Intelligence features and uses that you’ll find beneficial to your workflow, and they’re available for use on iPhone, Mac, and iPad, right now. Apple Intelligence Features Have Strict System Requirements Remember, you must meet system requirements to be able to use Apple Intelligence. For iPhone that means iPhone 15 Pro or better, and for iPad that includes any M1 chip or A17 Pro chip or better, and for Mac it includes any M1 Apple Silicon or better chip. You’ll also need to be running at least iOS 18.1 or later, iPadOS 18.1 or later, and MacOS Sequoia 15.1 or later, to have access to these features. If you do not have an Apple Intelligence compatible Mac, iPhone, or iPad, you can still use AI features through fantastic free third party tools, like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and other AI tools. Useful Apple Intelligence Features to Try Right Now As more Apple Intelligence AI features roll out, there will be even more uses for them, but for now don’t miss these: 1: Auto-suggested Replies to Emails \u0026 Messages Apple Intelligence will suggest quick replies to emails and messages, allowing you to quickly send off a response without having to type it out. For the most part, these auto-suggested replies are pretty good and appropriate, and can really help to shorten response times for many users. 2: Summarizing Messages \u0026 Texts Apple Intelligence will automatically summarize messages and texts, giving you an overview of the context of whatever the message(s) are. In the example screenshot here, an AI summarization of a message is shown working on a spam/scam text, though unfortunately it’s not quite smart enough (yet) to recognize the message is an unsolicited scam. 3: Rewrite Text to be Friendly, Professional, or Concise We can all use a little help writing from time to time, even if it’s just to improve the tone of a message, or to make something sound friendlier, more professional, or more concise. And those are exactly the options that are available with the Writing Tools AI feature that is now available on Mac, iPhone, and iPad. On Mac, iPhone, or iPad, you can select any text, and then access the Writing Tools feature from either the long-press menu or a right-click, and choose how you would like to rewrite something. 4: Summarize, Proofread, Rewrite What You Have Written Another fantastic item in the Writing Tools toolbox is the ability to proofread and to re-write whatever you have written. This helps you to check grammar and spelling, and if you simply don’t like the way you wrote something, you can have Writing Tools rewrite it completely. You can also summarize whatever text you select, whether it’s something you found online, in an email, or something you wrote yourself. 5: Clean-Up Photos to Remove Objects, People, Obstructions The Clean Up feature in Photos uses AI to to intelligently remove unwanted objects, people, and obstructions from photos. If you’ve ever had a photobomber dive into your picture or maybe there’s something in the foreground or background that you simply don’t want to be there, you can use Clean Up to get rid of it, and it works really well. All you have to do access Clean Up from the “Edit” section of a photo, then either circle or highlight the object/item you want to remove from the photo. Then Apple Intelligence works its magic, and does a really great job of making the photo look completely natural and unedited, despite removing whatever you selected for Clean Up. What about blah blah and other cool Apple Intelligence features? We are aiming to cover a series of AI tools that can be used right now on any Apple device you have that is compatible with Apple Intelligence, and we want to keep it as inclusive as possible, so features that are not yet available will not be covered here. More Apple Intelligence features will debut in future iOS, MacOS, and iPadOS updates.",
