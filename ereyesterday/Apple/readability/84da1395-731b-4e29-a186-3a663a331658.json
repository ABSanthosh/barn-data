It appeared that Apple would take a half-step in renaming the Gulf of Mexico by showing Gulf of America when users searched for the term, but that wasn't enough. After the official database run by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) finally updated with the new name, Apple is changing the name to satisfy the Republican lawmakers. According to a report by Bloomberg on Tuesday afternoon, Apple will make the change for all Apple Maps users around the globe. It's not yet known what form that update will take. Google changed the name for US users. For international Google Maps users, both names are presented with Gulf of America in parentheses. The name change was proposed by US President Trump in an executive order signed on January 20. The move has been criticized by historians, mapmakers, and the Mexican government since the United States has no authority on what bodies of water outside of its jurisdiction are named. Here's what the BGN update states: Secretary's Order 3423 directs the Board on Geographic Names (\"BGN\") to immediately rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and to update the Geographic Names Information System to appropriately reflect the change. This Order implements President Trump's direction in Executive Order 14172, \"Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness,\" that the name be changed.It wasn't clear if Apple would make the change initially, as the company tends to lean towards progressive values and avoids making changes that aren't written in law. The Gulf of Mexico has been called such for over 400 years, and the whims of a nation's leader normally wouldn't cause the name to change universally. However, the US President has been utilizing financial pressures through tariffs to try and ensure his demands are met. While such a threat wasn't levied against Apple publicly, tariffs targeting Apple's products or regulations affecting the company aren't out of the question considering other actions taken since inauguration. Mounting pressure from Republican lawmakers that back the President's decisions also suggested Apple likely wouldn't be able to let the half-measure stand. That, and the official update from BGN, may have been enough to convince Apple to finally make the move. Regardless of how people feel about the change, Apple likely didn't want to start a battle with the current administration over text on a digital map when it's already dealing with regulation battles abroad. The database rollout may still be occurring as the change isn't visible to all users. Some report the Gulf being blank. Others see the Gulf of Mexico as text on the map, but the Gulf of America as text in the modal search box. The previous information modal about the Gulf of Mexico no longer appears with photos and information about the body of water. The Gulf of America modal doesn't have any photos or information beyond the name for now. Users should expect to see the updated name in Apple Maps soon.",
