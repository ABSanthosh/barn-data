MacBook deals for Black Friday 2024: Our advice There are a few things to consider before you make a purchase. Apple released the newest M4 MacBook Pro models in late October 2024. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models bring new M4 chips, but they also offer more RAM than the previous generation. This means that when considering deals on older M3 Macs it is important to account for the fact that there may be less RAM in those models, especially since Apple usually charges $200/£200 to upgrade from 8GB to 16GB. Also M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBooks also had less RAM previously, now they have 24GB RAM as standard, rather than 18GB. This doesn’t only apply to the MacBook Pro. When the M4 MacBook Pro was introduced, Apple also doubled the RAM in the M3 MacBook Air from 8GB to 16GB as standard, effectively a $200/£200 price cut. So it is important to pay attention to how much RAM is included in an M3 MacBook Air, or you might not be getting the bargain you think you are.

Just make sure you are buying the 16GB RAM model or getting a reasonable discount if not. Black Friday shopping tips We tend to find that the biggest savings are on older models, but be aware that these aren’t always the best value for money. Check the generation of the model that is discounted to make sure you know exactly what you are buying and what it’s really worth. We’ve seen resellers switch to selling refurbished or used when the stock of brand-new models run out, so check that the model discounted isn’t actually a used Mac and therefore not as good a deal as it might look. That’s not to say you should avoid refurb models – you just need to make sure that you aren’t buying refurb without knowing. Mac deals aren’t limited to Black Friday. We see good deals all year round, so don’t feel pressured into buying during Black Friday. Where to get Black Friday Mac deals Many resellers offer Black Friday discounts.

Apple released the newest M4 MacBook Pro models in late October 2024. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models bring new M4 chips, but they also offer more RAM than the previous generation. This means that when considering deals on older M3 Macs it is important to account for the fact that there may be less RAM in those models, especially since Apple usually charges $200/£200 to upgrade from 8GB to 16GB. Also M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBooks also had less RAM previously, now they have 24GB RAM as standard, rather than 18GB.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis doesn’t only apply to the MacBook Pro. When the M4 MacBook Pro was introduced, Apple also doubled the RAM in the M3 MacBook Air from 8GB to 16GB as standard, effectively a $200/£200 price cut. So it is important to pay attention to how much RAM is included in an M3 MacBook Air, or you might not be getting the bargain you think you are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2
