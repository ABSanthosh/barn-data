  "description": "Macworld If you’ve got your eye on the new iPad mini that just arrived, you might not have noticed that it adds support for the new Apple Pencil Pro (and removes support for the 2nd-gen model. But we have good news—the Apple Pencil Pro is available for $90 at Amazon, its best price yet, and a 30 percent discount from its $129 MSRP. The Apple Pencil Pro is the stylus you need if you have one of the M3 iPad Pro models or the recent iPad Air versions with an M2 chip. And, as Apple announced today, you’ll also be able to use it with the cool new 7th gen iPad Mini. The stylus is fantastic for precise drawing and writing, can detect the angle and pressure of your strokes for natural-looking shading, and even supports gestures. For instance, you can squeeze the pen to activate the barrel roll gesture which quickly allows you to switch between drawing tools or undo/redo actions. You can also use a neat hover feature to preview your mark, allowing you to adjust the position or angle if necessary before you start drawing. This feature, which debuted for the M2 iPad Pro before expanding to other models, is available for the iPad mini. So don’t let this deal slip through your fingers, and snatch the Apple Pencil Pro for $90 at Amazon while you still can. Get the Apple Pencil Pro for 30% offBuy it now at Amazon",
