  "text": "Pretty much every video streaming platform has DRM-protected content, which aims to prevent users from distributing copyrighted material. Unfortunately, this also means that users can’t easily share screenshots of specific moments of something they’re watching with others – but Netflix is introducing a new feature that will change that. Netflix introduces ‘Moments’ for sharing screenshots of movies and shows Called “Moments,” the new feature lets Netflix subscribers save specific scenes from a movie or show they’re watching. Not only does this make it easier for users to rewatch that specific moment whenever they want, but it also adds another cool option: the ability to share these moments. After saving a moment, the Netflix app will let users share a custom screenshot of that scene on social media. The image includes things like the name of the show, episode, and the exact timestamp of the saved moment. “You can revisit your Moments anytime on your phone, and if you rewatch the episode or film, it will start playing right from the scene you bookmarked,” Netflix explains in a blog post. “You can share a Moment as you create it or, from the My Netflix tab, you can select a scene and tap to share it across all of your platforms,” the company adds. While you’re watching something on Netflix, just tap the screen and you’ll see the Moments option in the player. Netflix says the feature is being gradually rolled out to iOS users around the world. The company says it will expand the Moments feature to Android in the coming weeks. Of course, make sure you have the latest version of the Netflix app installed on your device in order to get access to the new features. Now I really hope that other streaming platforms such as Apple TV+ will implement a similar feature in the future.
