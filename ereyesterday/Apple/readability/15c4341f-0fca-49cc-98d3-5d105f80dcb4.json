  "text": "Apple has released the first teaser for Chief of War, a historical drama starring and co-created by Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Dune: Part One). This nine-episode series follows the story of Ka‘iana, a Native Hawaiian warrior fighting to unify the islands before the arrival of Western colonizers in the late 1700s. Momoa’s back on Apple TV+ The show, which was inspired by true events, premieres on Friday, August 1, with the first two episodes, followed by new episodes every Friday through September 19. Told from an indigenous perspective, Chief of War marks a personal project for creators Jason Momoa and Thomas Pa‘a Sibbett, who are both of Native Hawaiian descent. The cast features a predominantly Polynesian ensemble, including Luciane Buchanan, Temuera Morrison, Cliff Curtis, Te Kohe Tuhaka, and newcomer Kaina Makua, among others. Behind the camera, the series is produced by FIFTH SEASON, the same production company behind the hit show Severance, and Chernin Entertainment. Doug Jung serves as showrunner and executive producer. Momoa directs the finale and executive produces alongside Sibbett, Peter Chernin, Jenno Topping, Brian Andrew Mendoza, and others. Justin Chon (Pachinko, Blue Bayou) directs the first two episodes. The music is composed by none other than Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, Interstellar) and James Everingham, with the score produced by Zimmer’s Bleeding Fingers Music collective. Chief of War marks Momoa’s second major Apple TV+ series, following the global success of See, which was among the platform’s first series and concluded its three-season run in 2022. Apple TV+ is available for $9.99 per month and features hit TV shows and movies like Ted Lasso, Severance, The Studio, The Morning Show, Shrinking and Silo.
