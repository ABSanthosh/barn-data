  "text": "Apple has issued a second release candidate build of tvOS 18.1. Apple has issued a second release candidate build for tvOS 18.1, following the first release candidate deployed Monday. On October 21, release candidates for most of Apple's major operating systems were made available to registered developers. This was done in preparation for the debut of Apple Intelligence, scheduled for October 28. This is when iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1 are expected to receive their official public release. On Tuesday, a day after the initial batch of release candidates was sent out, visionOS 2.1 received a second RC build. Now the same thing has happened with tvOS 18.1, the operating system for Apple TV. Wednesday's RC version of tvOS 18.1 changes the build number to 22J580, from the previous 22J6578. While the exact contents of the second release candidate are still unknown at the time of writing, the software update likely contains various bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements. As iOS 18.1 and its corresponding software updates for other platforms exit beta testing, Apple has issued the first developer beta of iOS 18.2. The update introduces support for various Apple Intelligence features, including Image Playground, Genmoji, and Visual Intelligence on iPhone 16.",
