Jump on this deal now to secure a 20TB lifetime subscription, which usually costs $4,900, for just $400. Note: You must use code STORAGE20 at checkout to secure this deal. What makes Internxt cloud storage so special? 20TB is a lot of space. Whether you work with huge video files, need a single place to store hundreds of thousands of pictures of your pets, or want to consolidate all your other saved files into one place, this Internxt deal offers space to spare. Internxt works well for people who want more than just space, though. It’s a private, open-source cloud service designed to keep your files safe and fully under your control. Just as with Apple’s Advanced Data Protection, every file you upload is encrypted, so it’s virtually impossible for anyone else to access. Only you have the keys. The platform works across pretty much everything: macOS, iOS, Windows, Android, Linux and even popular web browsers. You can store, share and sync files from any device, making it easy to access important documents, photos or work projects wherever you are. Internxt’s clean, intuitive interface also means you won’t waste time hunting through menus or settings. Privacy and easy-to-use tools For privacy-focused users, Internxt checks all the right boxes. It’s zero-knowledge, GDPR-compliant and uses post-quantum encryption to keep you safe even as technology evolves. Whether you need it for work, personal backups or sharing large files, Internxt is a solid alternative to more mainstream cloud storage. Internxt also offers handy tools like automatic syncing, file versioning and easy sharing across platforms. And because there’s no cap on devices, you can keep your files flowing smoothly across laptops, phones, desktops and tablets without constantly logging in and out. Plus, since it’s totally open-source, you can dig into the code on GitHub.
