In September 2024, Apple introduced a slate of new, clinical-grade hearing aid and hearing aid features to the AirPods Pro 2. The features included a hearing health test, allowing AirPods Pro 2 to function as hearing aids, which Apple calls \"clinical grade\" for moderate hearing loss. Apple has recently expanded the list of countries that can use these features, as discovered by MacRumors. The countries listed below can now utilize the hearing test feature to assess their potential level of hearing loss. Argentina Ecuador Honduras Indonesia Israel Kazakhstan Moldova Palestinian Territories Serbia Taiwan Thailand Ukraine VietnamAirPods Pro 2 uses your Hearing Test results to personalize how ambient sounds are amplified. These real-time adjustments are tailored to your hearing profile. The test is available in the AirPods Pro section within the iPhone or iPad Settings app. It takes roughly five minutes to complete. After the test, users receive a summary showing the level of hearing loss in each ear. This audiogram is securely stored in the Health app. Users have the option to share their audiogram with a healthcare provider for additional guidance. As always, the information stays private and fully under the user's control at all times. In addition to the above list, users in the following countries can use the AirPods Pro 2 as Hearing Aids: Cyprus Ecuador Honduras Indonesia Israel Kazakhstan Moldova Palestinian Territories Serbia Taiwan Thailand Ukraine VietnamThe Hearing Aid feature helps users stay engaged with people and surroundings. They also improve clarity in media like music, calls, videos, and games by applying the same personalized profile. AirPods Pro 2 also includes Loud Sound Reduction to limit harmful environmental noise. It helps protect hearing during everyday exposure to loud sounds. Hearing Protection features are currently supported in: Antigua and Barbuda Canada Colombia Costa Rica Ecuador Guam Puerto Rico Saint Kitts and Nevis Sint Maarten United States US Minor Outlying Islands US Virgin IslandsThe rollout of Hearing Aid features has been a bit asynchronous, largely because many regions require approval from local health authorities before the AirPods Pro 2 can legally be used that way. Apple maintains an up-to-date breakdown of which hearing features are supported where on its AirPods Pro Hearing Health Availability page. In March, Apple expanded the features to Australia, Brazil, Colombia, and Saudi Arabia.",
