Apple has issued its second release candidates of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, macOS Sequoia 15.2, visionOS 2.2, and tvOS 18.2 for testing, as the eventual public release gets closer. The second RC round takes place after the first, which came out on December 5. This time around, the second RC versions are of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, macOS Sequoia 15.2, visionOS 2.2, and tvOS 18.2, but not watchOS 11.2. The second RC builds of iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2 share build number 22c151. RC 2 of the macOS Sequoia 15.2 build is 24C100. The second RC of tvOS 18.2 is build 22K155, and the second visionOS 2.2 RC build is number 22N841. A final public release of Apple's operating systems that are undergoing testing is expected to occur in December. The existence of RC versions means that the release is getting very close. The big changes in Apple Intelligence for macOS, iOS and iPadOS are image-based, with the introduction of Genmoji and Image Playground. iPhone 16 owners can also use Visual Intelligence, asking queries using the iPhone camera. The Writing Tools, part of the first Apple Intelligence wave, gains a new API for third-party apps. Siri gains a ChatGPT integration this time around, which will answer some user queries. Apple is also making Apple Intelligence available in more regions, albeit only in English-speaking formats. The third beta round introduced a new feature that added Share Item Location to Find My. Users can share the location of an AirTag or other Find My-enabled accessories to third parties, including airlines if they lost their luggage. AppleInsider and Apple strongly advise that users do not install test operating systems or other beta or RC software onto \"mission-critical\" or primary hardware, due to the small chance of issues that could result in the loss of data. Testers should therefore use secondary or non-essential devices and make sure they have sufficient backups of any critical data.",
