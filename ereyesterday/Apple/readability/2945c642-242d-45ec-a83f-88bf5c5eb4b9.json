One of the early features of Apple Intelligence, Clean Up is a Photos tool that can be used to remove unwanted objects from within a picture. Its effectiveness is aptly demonstrated in a new ad from Apple. Posted to YouTube on Monday, the video titled \"Clean Up Photos: Flex\" shows a young man showing off his physique to the iPhone 16's camera. The photographs are all taken by an older woman, using an iPhone 16. Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeAfter the photo session, the protagonist is laid in bed near some exercise equipment, reviewing the shots. However, he realizes that his photographer is in the background, reflected in a mirror and spoiling the composition. Irritated by the mistake, he taps Clean Up in the image editing mode of Photos, selects the woman's glowing reflection, and watches her disappear from the shot. The video, set to Giraffage's \"Workout,\" concludes by declaring \"Clean up photos with a tap,\" and closing out with the Apple logo. No lawsuits this time...The new ad will almost certainly differ from a previous Apple Intelligence spot, promoting the future usage of contextual data to fuel Siri results. While that ad spot was careful enough to include disclaimers that they were arriving \"over the next year,\" that didn't stop the filing of a lawsuit seeking class action status. It was believed that the massive media blitz gave the expectation to consumers that the features were available from the iPhone 16's release, despite the visible disclaimers. At least with the new \"Flex\" ad, there's no expectations lawsuit risk. The feature is available to use right now on devices running iOS 18.1 and later.",
