The new true-crime drama on Apple TV+ that stars Taron Egerton made it into the top 10 most popular streaming series, according to two companies that track ratings. Plus, the Apple TV+ sci-fi action comedy series Murderbot stayed strong in the run-up to its season finale, and the sports comedy Stick still draws a large audience, too. Taron Egerton’s crime drama Smoke ratings push it onto top 10 lists Inspired by the popular podcast Firebug, Smoke reunites the creative team behind Apple’s critically acclaimed limited psycho-drama Black Bird. The new series tells the story of a high-stakes cat-and-mouse game inspired by true events. Egerton (Black Bird, Tetris) stars as Dave Gudsen, an arson investigator who partners with determined police detective Michelle Calderone, played by Emmy Award-nominee Jurnee Smollett (The Order, Lovecraft Country) as the two track the destructive paths of two serial arsonists. Perhaps it’s the fascination with true crime, but after debuting June 27, the show quickly got a sizable audience. Movie and TV search engine JustWatch publishes a weekly ratings list of the 10 most popular series in the U.S. on streaming services, and Smoke sits at No. 6 for the week of June 30 through July 6 (see chart). Rival service Reelgood also put the show in the No. 6 slot on its list for top-rated series for the week of July 3 through July 9. A ratings service says Smoke is one of the most popular streaming series. Plus, Murderbot. and Stick drew plenty of eyes, too.Chart: JustWatch Ratings estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. The first four episodes of Smoke are ready to stream now. The next should appear on Friday. Murderbot still kills it Apple TV+ generally does well with sci-fi series, which isn’t surprising for a computer maker. Murderbot, Apple’s latest foray into the genre, is about a cyborg — part robot, part human — built to provide security in very dangerous situations. The series follows the cyborg as it breaks the programming that forces it to kill … and then goes looking for a purpose. But don’t expect a traditional action show, as there’s plenty of comedy mixed in. It’s a combination that works, because it stayed popular its entire run. JustWatch put the series at No. 4 on its chart of most popular streaming series last week (see chart above). And Reelgood put the show in the No. 3 slot on its list of top-rated series last week. Alexander Skarsgård, who won Emmys, Golden Globes and SAG awards for roles that include Succession, Big Little Lies and True Blood, plays the eponymous lead character. The entire Murderbot season 1 can be watched now, as the finale appears on Friday. And fans can look forward to season 2. Stick lands on the green again Stick stayed near the tops of the streaming TV popularity charts yet agin. The Apple TV+ series stars Owen Wilson in a feel-good sports comedy that’s been a hit since it debuted. In the series, Wilson plays an over-the-hill, ex-pro golfer whose career went off the rails decades ago. After his life gets even worse — his marriage fails and he’s fired from his job at a sporting goods store — the ex-pro bets his future on a troubled 17-year-old golf phenom. That might sound like a drama, but Apple calls it “a heartfelt, feel-good sports comedy about a found family and their relationships.” Perhaps it’s Wilson’s star power, maybe it’s the premise, but the new series found an audience. JustWatch put the series at No. 8 on its most recent chart (see above). Rival service Reelgood put the show in the No. 9 slot of popular streaming series last week. The first eight episodes of Stick season 1 are ready to watch now. The next premieres on Wednesday. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming hits like Smoke, Murderbot and Stick, plus many others, come with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial.
