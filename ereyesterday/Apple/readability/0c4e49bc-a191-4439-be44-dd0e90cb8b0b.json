With TRMNL, you’ll switch apps less and focus more because everything is right in front of you on an elegant 7.5” display. A Plugin for Every Occasion. Choose from more than 78 free plugins from the TRMNL team, or from the hundreds developed by the community, displaying the weather, tasks, calendars, website stats, and fun content like quotes from The Office. You can display any plugin full screen or mix and match them with Mashups, TRMNL’s widget-like system. You can create plugins yourself with TRMNL’s API or the Apple Shortcuts app, and schedule what appears throughout the day, too. A Battery You Never Have to Think About. TRMNL’s rechargeable battery lasts from two months to 1.5 years depending on how you set it up. That’s because the data displayed is cleverly formatted as static images that are only sent from TRMNL’s servers when the device refreshes. The rest of the time, the device sleeps, but your information remains visible. DIY-Friendly. TRMNL is open-source. There are instructions on TRMNL’s website for building your own hardware and running your own server. Three Styles, One Incredible Experience. Choose black or white ($139) or clear ($154) frames. Whether it lives on your desk, kitchen counter, or conference room wall, TRMNL adapts to your space with a wall hook and kickstand. Limited-Time Offer. MacStories readers can save $20 using this link. Act fast to save now. Stop flipping between apps and reclaim your focus with TRMNL. Our thanks to TRMNL for sponsoring MacStories this week.
