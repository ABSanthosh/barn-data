Image Credit: residentevil-survivalunit.com \"Resident Evil: Survival Unit\" is now available for pre-order on the App Store, months ahead of the game's anticipated late 2025 release date. Capcom's iconic horror franchise has received yet another installment, this time a game for iPhone and iPad called Resident Evil: Survival Unit. The game was announced on July 10, and you can already pre-order it on the App Store, provided you're fine with waiting until December 31, 2025. As spotted by 9to5mac, a YouTube livestream was held the day after, revealing more details about the game. Its story takes place between Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3. However, the game presents \"a parallel storyline distinct from the original titles,\" and it looks like the gameplay will be significantly different as well. Most of the Resident Evil titles available on iPhone and Mac, such as Resident Evil: Biohazard and Resident Evil: Village, have been first-person or third-person shooters. Resident Evil: Survival Unit, meanwhile, \"marks the first time a Resident Evil entry will be a full-fledged strategy game,\" said Masachika Kawata, producer of the game series at Capcom. \"Resident Evil Survival Unit is the result of Capcom's collaboration in supervising the world, perspective, and characters that have been portrayed throughout the series for nearly 30 years,\" Kawata explained. The game lets you play as many of the protagonists and characters from previous games, including Leon Kennedy, Claire Redfield, Jill Valentine, Carlos Oliveira, and Marvin Branagh. Executive producer Shinji Hashimoto says that Resident Evil: Survival Unit offers players a new perspective by combining the signature \"survival element\" of the Resident Evil franchise with the strategy genre. You'll still need to collect resources and fight your way through enemies to progress. Resident Evil: Survival Unit can be pre-ordered from the App Store and Google Play, though it won't be playable until December 31, 2025. There's also a dedicated website with additional details about the game.",
