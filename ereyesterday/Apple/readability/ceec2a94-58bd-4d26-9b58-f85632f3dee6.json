  "description": "Macworld Apple is all in on its new Liquid Glass user interface that it introduced at WWDC last June. So much so that the company may be expanding the Liquid Glass concept beyond its software and into its hardware. According to leaker Setsuna Digital on a Weibo post, Apple may be releasing the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro in a color option that has ties to the Liquid Glass UI design of iOS 26. Setsuna Digital identifies the color as white, but it will show different effects based on the light hitting it. Setsuna Digital/Weibo Setsuna Digital has not seen the Liquid Glass iPhone and has only heard about it. Setsuna Digital made some correct reports about Apple products prior to official release, such as a report on the Titanium Milanese Loop watchband for the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and the iPhone 14’s Yellow color option. Macworld on Wednesday reported on the iPhone 17 colors and noted that White will be an option and that it will be the same as the iPhone 16 Pro. Maijin Bu reported on Thursday about the iPhone 17 Pro colors with a lineup that closely matched Macworld’s, with one exception. While Macworld’s report included a Steel Gray option, Bu’s report only included four colors: orange, white, black, and dark blue. When asked about the gray color on X, he replied, “The answer may be more complex than expected.” The iPhone 17 lineup is expected to be revealed by Apple at a yet-to-be-announced event in September. Besides the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro models, Apple is expected to introduced a new iPhone 17 Air model.
