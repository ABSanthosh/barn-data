Or you can hook up the Mymanu Link to your car stereo and enjoy a podcast while your passengers sleep. You can even use it with game consoles, gym equipment and stereos. And you can broadcast the sound to two sets of earbuds simultaneously. The Mymanu Link transmits with Bluetooth 5.0, offering a range of more than 30 feet. Plus, it comes equipped with aptX Low Latency, aptX and SBC audio codecs for premium audio quality. You get superior sound, whether you’re listening to movies, music or podcasts.
