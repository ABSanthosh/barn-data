  "text": "Today, Meta is announcing Edits: a new mobile video editing platform. This comes just hours after TikTok (and as a result, CapCut) were banned in the US – though TikTok is currently being restored, at least temporarily. Meta has a history of sitting on new features until they’re forced to move, and this is yet another example of that. With a surprise mid-day Sunday announcement, the company unveiled Edits, a new mobile-first editing tool, meant to serve as an alternative to popular editing tool CapCut. Adam Moserri, head of Instagram, announced the new ‘Edits’ app today on Threads, describing it as a tool for “those of you who are passionate about making videos on your phone.” He also stated that “There’s a lot going on right now, but no matter what happens it’s our job to provide the best possible tools for creators”, likely in reference to the TikTok and CapCut ban. In terms of features, Edits is going to offer the following, per Moserri’s post: A dedicated inspiration tab Another tab to keep track of your ideas A “much higher quality camera” for shooting videos “All the editing tools you’d expect” Ability to share drafts with friends and other creators Easy export to Instagram, and powerful insights for Reels content Other than these details, we don’t have much to go off of. Hopefully, Meta will share more in the coming weeks. The company says its been testing this out with creators in recent past. Edits is available for pre-order on the App Store starting today, and will be available on iOS sometime in February, according to Meta. However, the App Store pre-order page has the launch listed as March. No timeline is specified for an Android launch, other than the fact that it’ll come “soon.” Follow Michael: X/Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
