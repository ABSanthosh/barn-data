  "text": "Mozilla is shutting down Pocket, the handy bookmarking tool used to save articles and webpages for later. The organization announced that Pocket will stop working on July 8th, 2025, as Mozilla begins concentrating its “resources into projects that better match their browsing habits and online needs.”Following the shutdown, you’ll only be able to export saves until October 8th, 2025, which is when Mozilla will permanently delete user data. Mozilla says it will start automatically canceling subscriptions as well, and will issue prorated refunds to users subscribed to its annual plan on July 8th.It has also taken down the Pocket web extension and app as of May 22nd, 2025, but users who have already installed the app will be able to re-download it until October 8th.Pocket — originally called Read It Later — launched in 2007 and grew in popularity as people used it to keep track of the articles, recipes, videos, and more that they planned to revisit. In 2015, Mozilla added Pocket to Firefox as the browser’s default read-it-later app, and then acquired it two years later. Mozilla says it’s shuttering Pocket because “the way people save and consume content on the web has evolved.” Pocket’s email newsletter, called Pocket Hits, will continue under a new name, “Ten Tabs,” but it will no longer have a weekend edition.In addition to shutting down Pocket, Mozilla is also sunsetting its fake reviews detector, Fakespot. “We acquired Fakespot in 2023 to help people navigate unreliable product reviews using AI and privacy-first tech,” Mozilla says. “While the idea resonated, it didn’t fit a model we could sustain.” Review Checker, the Fakespot-powered tool built into Firefox, is shutting down on June 10th, 2025, too.”This shift allows us to shape the next era of the internet — with tools like vertical tabs, smart search and more AI-powered features on the way,” Mozilla says. “We’ll continue to build a browser that works harder for you: more personal, more powerful and still proudly independent.”",
