  "text": "News The cast should be more excited! Image: Apple TV + The Apple TV+ adventure movie Fountain of Youth shot to the top of the charts the first week it hit streaming, according to two companies that track ratings. The flick stars John Krasinski and Natalie Portman in a dangerous hunt for the legendary spring with the power to restore the lost youth of anyone who drinks from it. Plus, the sci-fi comedy Murderbot, the crime drama Your Friends and Neighbors, and the comedy The Studio all continue to pull in large audiences. Apple TV+ subscribers have plenty of popular content to enjoy this week. Fountain of Youth ratings: It’s a hit! Real archaeology is about excruciatingly careful examination of ruins, looking for the slightest clues about lost civilizations. The movie version of archaeology is best demonstrated in Indiana Jones films and features gunfights and high-speed car chases as daredevil archaeologists foil the fiendish plots of supervillains. The new Apple TV+ film Fountain of Youth offers the unrealistic version — which is good because anctual archeology isn’t exciting to watch. The movie follows the adventures of two estranged siblings, played by John Krasinski and Natalie Portman. The brother found clues leading to the Fountain of Youth but needs his sister’s help unraveling them. Together, they’ll use their knowledge of history on what Apple TV+ promises is “an epic adventure that will possibly lead to immortality.” It seems plenty of people are in the mood for some action because movie and TV search engine Reelgood put Fountain of Youth in the No. 1 slot of its ratings list of the 10 most popular films in the U.S. on streaming services for the week of May 21 through May 28. Rival JustWatch service also put the show in the No. 3 slot on its list for top-rated movies for the week of May 19 through May 25 (see chart below). The Fountain of Youth came out hot its premiere week.Chart: JustWatch Ratings estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. Fountain of Youth is ready to watch now on Apple TV+. Murderbot kills it Apple TV+ generally does well with sci-fi series, which isn’t surprising for a computer maker. Murderbot, Apple’s latest foray into the genre, is about a cyborg — part robot, part human — built to provide security in very dangerous situations. The series follow the cyborg as it breaks the programming that forces it to kill … and then goes looking for a purpose. But don’t expect a traditional action show, as there’s plenty of comedy mixed in. It’s a combination that works, because JustWatch put the series at No. 2 on its chart of most popular streaming series last week (see chart below), and it’s at No. 6 on Reelgood’s list. A ratings service says Murderbot is one of the most popular streaming series. Plus, Your Friends and Neighbors and The Studio draw plenty of eyes, too.Chart: JustWatch The first four episodes of Murderbot season 1 can be watched now. The next is scheduled to appear on Friday. Your Friends and Neighbors stays popular week after week Since its debut in April, Your Friends and Neighbors stayed consistently popular. Some of this has to be because it stars Jon Hamm, best known for his suave good looks and iconic role as Don Draper in the critically acclaimed television series Mad Men. And the premise is interesting, as well. In the show, Hamm plays Andrew “Coop” Cooper, who gets fired in disgrace from his high-paying job as a hedge fund manager and must resort to stealing from his affluent neighbors’ homes. There, Coop discovers that the secrets and affairs hidden behind those wealthy facades might be more dangerous than he ever imagined. Whatever the cause, Reelgood put the series at No. 3 on its chart of most popular streaming series last week, and it’s at No. 4 on JustWatch’s list (see chart above). The first nine episodes of Your Friends and Neighbors are ready to stream now. The next appears on Friday. The Studio still gets high ratings skewering Hollywood While many of the highest-rated series on Apple TV+ are dramas and sci-fi, the streaming service offers plenty of popular comedies, too. One of Apple’s latest forays into the genre is The Studio, starring Seth Rogen, who also serves as co-creator, writer and director. The first season is over already, but viewers keep tuning in. JustWatch placed the series at No. 5 on its most recent chart (see above). The official Apple TV+ description says: “In The Studio, Seth Rogen stars as Matt Remick, the newly appointed head of embattled Continental Studios. As movies struggle to stay alive and relevant, Matt and his core team of infighting executives battle their own insecurities as they wrangle narcissistic artists and craven corporate overlords in the ever-elusive pursuit of making great films. With their power suits masking their never-ending sense of panic, every party, set visit, casting decision, marketing meeting and award show presents them with an opportunity for glittering success or career-ending catastrophe. As someone who eats, sleeps and breathes movies, it’s the job Matt’s been pursuing his whole life, and it may very well destroy him.” The Cult of Mac review says, “The Studio blends sharp industry critique with genuine appreciation for filmmaking. Through its clever storytelling, stellar performances, and exceptional production, the series offers viewers a rare glimpse into Hollywood — the good and the bad.” All ten episodes of the series are ready to watch now, as the season finale premiered earlier in May. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming hits like Fountain of Youth, Murderbot, Your Friends and Neighbors and The Studio, plus many others, come with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. And Apple’s streaming video service also includes a library of drama, comedies, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
