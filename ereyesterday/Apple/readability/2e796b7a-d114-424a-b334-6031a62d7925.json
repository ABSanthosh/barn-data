The device in question would have looked like a standard pair of glasses, but would feature built-in displays. It also would have required a persistent tether to a Mac. This device, which was code-named N107, would have been seen as a more affordable alternative to the Apple Vision Pro. After all, one of the biggest complaints about the Apple Vision Pro is its nearly $3,500 price tag — before taxes. The glasses featured projectors that could display content in the wearer's field of view for each eye. It likely would have been pitched as a way to allow users to work in a digitally augmented space. The Apple Vision Pro already has this feature, ultra-wide Mac display mirroring, and it's often cited as the most compelling reason to own one. N107 would have addressed some of the problems that consumers had with the Apple Vision Pro. Notably, it would have been light enough to not require a head strap. According to Bloomberg, developers had hoped N107 could be used with an iPhone. However, the device seemingly required too much processing power and had a penchant for draining iPhone batteries. By connecting it to a Mac, the glasses would have access to faster processors and a significantly larger battery. However, the change was not embraced by executives during reviews. Those who were a part of the Apple Vision Products Group complained about the project's lack of focus. Without a clear direction, developers feared the project would be destined for the chopping block. The group had their fears confirmed when Apple pulled the plug on the project in late January. Meta Platforms is said to continue working on its augmented reality Ray-Ban smart glasses, which it hopes to have ready by 2027. However, Apple is allegedly still working on a direct successor to the Apple Vision Pro. N107 is the most recent of Apple's canceled projects. In February 2024, Apple killed off its secretive Apple Car project, code-named Project Titan, which Apple employees referred to as a \"Titanic disaster.\" Apple also allegedly canceled plans to offer a discrete iPhone hardware subscription service. However, that may have been because the iPhone Upgrade Program already achieved what the service would have done.",
