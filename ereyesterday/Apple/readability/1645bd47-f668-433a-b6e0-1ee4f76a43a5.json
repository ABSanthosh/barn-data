  "text": "iPhone 16e is now officially available in stores. Apple’s new entry-level phone looks similar to an iPhone 14 from the outside, but features the A18 chip inside. And thanks to a teardown video shared on the web, we can now take a better look at what’s new and what’s different inside the iPhone 16e. Teardown video shows what’s inside the iPhone 16e The 5-minute video shared on YouTube by REWA Technology shows how to tear down the iPhone 16e, as well as a closer look at its internal components. Despite the similarities to an iPhone 14 in its external design, the iPhone 16e comes with some surprises inside. Internally, most of the components are arranged in almost the same way as in the base iPhone 15 model. The most obvious difference is in the rear camera. While the iPhone 15 has two lenses (one wide and one ultra-wide), the iPhone 16e has a single 48-megapixel wide lens. Because of this, the camera module is significantly smaller, which probably helped Apple put a bigger battery in the iPhone 16e. iPhone 16e uses the same system based on low-voltage electric current to remove and replace the internal battery, which makes the process much easier and safer. Interestingly, the teardown shows that the battery has 4005 mAh of capacity – more than was previously reported by some YouTubers. For comparison, the iPhone 16 battery has 3561 mAh. When it comes to the Face ID module, it’s pretty much identical to the one in the iPhone 14 as the new iPhone 16e features a notch instead of the Dynamic Island. The teardown also shows the C1 chip, Apple’s first 5G modem. It combines 4 nanometer baseband technology with 7 nanometer transceiver technology. As previously revealed by a lab test, the new modem is much more efficient and uses less power than the Qualcomm modems in other iPhones. You can watch the full teardown below: iPhone 16e starts at $599 for the 128GB version. Alternatively, you can buy other iPhone models at a discount.
