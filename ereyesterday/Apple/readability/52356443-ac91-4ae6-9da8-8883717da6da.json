  "description": "Macworld The latest visionOS 2.2 update doesn’t add much. Compared to iOS/iPadOS 18.2 with its numerous Apple Intelligence features, the updates in visionOS 2.2 seem positively threadbare. But if you have one, you should upgrade right away, as there is one new feature we’ve been waiting for since it was first announced: Support for wide and ultrawide resolutions when using Mac Virtual Display. Since Mac Virtual Display replaces your Mac’s output with the floating display in VR space, the feature in its original form didn’t offer much benefit other than being larger than your Mac’s original display. With support for wide and ultrawide formats, however, the feature can now actually add significant new screen real estate compared to the built-in display on your Macbook or standard monitor hooked up to a desktop Mac. As Apple says, it’s like working on two 5K monitors side by side. VisionOS 2.2: Release notes Here are Apple’s release notes for visionOS 2.2: Mac Virtual Display– Use Mac apps and games with a new aspect ratio: wide (21:9) and ultrawide (32:9) – the equivalent of two 5K monitors side by side– Route audio from your Mac to Apple Vision Pro Apple TV– Watch up to five MLS and MLB games at once with Multiview– Watch live sporting events together with SharePlay Safari– Tap to view spatial photos and videos embedded on web pages visionOS 2.2: How to update your Apple Vision Pro Go to Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update. If an update is available, tap Download and Install or Install Now. When the update is ready to install, an alert asks you to take off your Apple Vision Pro. You can see the progress of the update on the front of your device.",
