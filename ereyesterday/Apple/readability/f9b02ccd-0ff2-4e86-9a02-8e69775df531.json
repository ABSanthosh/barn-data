  "description": "Macworld iPhones are built to last a long time, which means that there are a lot of Lightning-equipped iPhones still in use, even though Apple replaced the Lightning port on its iPhones with USB-C in 2023 with the iPhone 15. And with USB-C connectors and cables becoming more and more ubiquitous, Lightning iPhones can leave you unable to connect if you don’t have an adapter handy. Ken Pillonel’s new invention makes life easier for Lightning iPhone users. His company, Obsoless, is offering the iPh0n3 USB-C Protection Case, which has a built-in Lightning-to-USB-C adapter, so you never have to worry about carrying one around with you. The case has a Lightning connector inside that works with the USB-C port on the corner of the case. It supports fast charging, data transfers, and CarPlay, but devices that draw power from the iPhone through the port (like some USB-C speakers or headphones) will not work. The cases is available only in “strong dark gray,” but it does work with MagSafe. Obsoless states the the case is available for iPhones as old as the iPhone XS, but many of the cases made during the first production run are sold out. A second run is in the works, with availability by the end of August. Of the inventory remaining, prices range from CHF 43.90 (Swiss francs—Oboless is in Switerzerland) for an iPhone 13 mini case to CHF 49.90 for an iPhone 14 Pro Max case. That’s about $55 and $63, respectively. The prices do not include shipping. Learn more about the iPh0n3 USB-C Protection Case by watching the YouTube video below. Pillonel made headlines four years ago when he modified an iPhone X (or Xs) and replaced the Lightning port with USB-C. He eventually sold that iPhone and started a business making accessories that are sold through Obsoless. If you don’t care about the mod and just want an iPhone case for your brand-new iPhone, check out our guide for the best iPhone 16 cases for 16 \u0026 Plus, 16 Pro \u0026 Pro Max, 16e.",
