This Mini 4G dual-SIM smartphone is fully functional but actually fits in your pocket. This little phone is about the size of a credit card, but comes packed with the features you expect from a smartphone. The only thing it skimps on is the price: It’s on sale for just $94.99 (regularly $119). Leave the big screen at home Naturally, we’re hooked on the iPhone here at Cult of Mac. And while Apple’s phones come with big, beautiful screens, sometimes it can feel like overkill. The Pro Max models are just too big for some people and Apple killed the iPhone mini. And iPhones aren’t getting any cheaper. If you want a small, cheap phone, the iPhone is definitely not the way to go. But the Mini 4G phone delivers on both counts. Weighing just 2.8 ounces and measuring 0.4 inches by 3.5 inches by 1.8 inches, it’s lightweight and fits comfortably in your hand. That makes it easy to navigate your favorite apps single-handedly. With its responsive 3-inch HD touchscreen, you can effortlessly send messages, check emails and scroll through social media without feeling like you’re lugging around a tablet. One of the coolest features of this phone is its dual-SIM capability. If you want to separate work from personal calls or prefer to keep a local SIM card for data while traveling, this little gadget does the trick. You can switch seamlessly between numbers without the hassle of carrying multiple devices, giving you flexibility. 4G connectivity and solid battery life Despite its small size, the Mini 4G doesn’t skimp on performance. Its 4G connectivity means acceptably fast browsing and streaming, so you can stay connected to what matters most. Whether you’re sharing a quick photo, catching up on the latest news or making video calls, this phone delivers. The 2,000mAh battery offers impressive longevity, so you can go about your day without constantly worrying about recharging. It’s designed to keep up with your routine, whether you’re at work, running errands or simply enjoying some downtime. Storage is also a breeze with the Mini 4G. It supports expandable storage so you can use a Micro SD card to keep all your important files, photos and apps handy. Save on the Mini 4G dual-SIM smartphone Get a small phone without the hefty Apple price tag. Snatch up a Mini 4G dual-SIM smartphone on sale for just $94.99. That’s a 20% discount off the regular price of $119.99. Buy from: Cult of Mac Deals Prices subject to change. All sales handled by StackSocial, our partner who runs Cult of Mac Deals.
