  "text": "In what must be the most exciting thing to happen on a Monday since the prior Monday, Apple has released the third beta version of iOS 18.5, MacOS Sequoia 15.5, and iPadOS 18.5. These new thrilling third beta versions are available to the developer wizards participating in the beta testing programs of Apple system software, and other than roughly marking when the next software update is arriving for the average person, the release of a new beta version aren’t particularly relevant to most people who use Apple devices. Doesn’t matter, I’m covering it anyway. If your excitement just to know there’s a third beta version available wasn’t enough, you just might erupt with joy when you discover that there are no major new features or changes included in these beta versions, suggesting they’re mostly for bug fixes and security patches. Maybe the most revolutionary feature of all time will be included before final release, but don’t plan on that. Maybe Siri will finally know when the full moon is? Probably not. Aside from the riveting release of iOS 18.5 beta 4, macOS Sequoia 15.5 beta 3, and iPadOS 18.5 beta 3, you’ll even find new beta updates for watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS too, just in case you want to run beta software on those devices. Beta software is intended for developers working on their apps and compatibility, but anyone, even non-developers, can run the beta releases if they enjoy a more bug-prone system software experience. If you prefer stable final releases, then the most recent builds are MacOS Sequoia 15.4, iOS 18.4, and iPadOS 18.4. How to Install iOS 18.5 Beta 3 Your iPhone or iPad can get the beta 3 update if it’s enrolled in the beta testing programs: Open the “Settings” app on your device Go to “General”, and then choose “Software Update” Select to download and install iOS 18.5 beta 3 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.5 beta 3 If your Mac is enrolled in the beta program, getting the latest beta release is a matter of doing the following: Go to the  Apple menu and select “System Settings” Go to “General” and then to “Software Update” Select to “Update Now” for MacOS Sequoia 15.5 beta 3 Installing a beta update requires the device to restart. If you’re not a developer you really should not be installing these betas, they don’t even include exciting new features so there’s not much purpose for the average person. Keep these for the developers out there. When is the final version of iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, and MacOS Sequoia 15.5 going to be released? Nobody outside of Apple knows the release schedule of system software. However, running through multiple beta versions before finalization is the typical pattern of releases in the Apple beta cycle, so we can reasonably predict that final versions of iOS 18.5 and MacOS Sequoia 15.5 will probably be out in the next few weeks. But who really knows? People at Apple know, but we don’t, and you don’t either. Most people should just keep the stable builds on their devices, which are currently versioned as MacOS Sequoia 15.4, iOS 18.4, and iPadOS 18.4.",
