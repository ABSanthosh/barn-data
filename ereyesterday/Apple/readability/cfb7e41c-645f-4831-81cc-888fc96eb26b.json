  "description": "Macworld The tiny Mac Mini M4 Pro just dropped to its very best price over at Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. Now available for just $1,249 $1,199, this micro machine is $150 $200 off its usual $1,399. This is easily the most powerful mini PC you can get right now from Apple. We loved pretty much everything about it in our testing outside of its price, but this discount is a great step to alleviate those worries. Running on the latest M4 Pro chip with 24GB of memory and a spacious 512GB SSD, this mini monster can tackle any task you throw its way, from mundane browsing and Netflix watching to more difficult image and video editing. “Apple’s new smaller Mac mini gives up very little after being hit with a shrink ray, and the M4 processors deliver great performance at a reasonable price,” we wrote in our 4-star review. With an M4 chip, it’s also ready for Apple Intelligence, from writing tools to mail summaries and upcoming Siri upgrades, as well as macOS updates for many years to come. So, don’t miss out on this amazing discount for the M4 Pro Mac mini, the first time it’s dropped this low.. This is the best price for the M4 Pro Mac Mini so farBuy now at Amazon",
