  "text": "Have you ever wondered what it’d look like to see a Windows Phone, specifically – Lumia 1020, would look like if it were running iOS? I haven’t either, but it’s still a pretty cool project to look at. Seeing iOS run on radically different form factors is pretty uncommon, so it certainly piqued my interest. On the r/hackintosh subreddit, one tinkerer posted a project of theirs: an iPhone SE 3 modified to fit inside of the housing of a Nokia Lumia 1020. That phone was certainly unique, but obviously its become less usable because of the fact that Windows Phone is now a defunct operating system. When I say it uses the internals of an iPhone SE 3, I really mean it. Everything – including the 12MP rear camera, taptic engine, and the Touch ID sensor – has been transplanted into the Lumia 1020’s form factor. SIM card tray? Check. Flash? It’s there. 5G also works. Even the Lightning port made its way over, which would normally be a downside, but since the Lumia 1020 used microUSB, that’s an upgrade. Touch ID has been moved to the back of the phone to preserve the design of the Lumia 1020. The Lumia 1020 even had a camera shutter button, somewhat similar to the concept of Camera Control on iPhone 16. Obviously, it’s much harder to to wire an additional button into the iPhone while maintaining proper software integration. However, the tinkerer still found a way to preserve it. Instead of being a real shutter button, it’s a second volume down button – which serves the purposes of taking a photo while in the camera app. Creative solution if you ask me. In short, everything crucial about the Nokia Lumia 1020 has been preserved, and I’m quite impressed that this is even possible. It’s a neat little project, with the only crucial loss being the headphone jack. You can read the full Reddit post for more details, as well as additional photos.
