  "text": "If you love hitting your local spin class but don't want to leave the comfort of home, the Speediance VeloNix brings the spin class to you — for a price. I'm not much of a \"cardio girlie\" as it were. You can get me in the gym to strength train all day every day — that's never been an issue. However, getting me on a treadmill or elliptical — or, God forbid the stairmaster — is nigh impossible. The one thing that I do like, though, is cycling. In 2023, I tested out the Ride 1UP Roadster and I've been hooked since. In fact, I biked more than 1200 miles in 2024 alone. The downside? I live in the Great Lakes region, meaning that my biking season is upsettingly short. Between days that routinely fall well below freezing and a propensity for extreme blizzards, it's not unlikely for bike season to end in November and not pick back up until April or May. And, double-unfortunately, my bike is also my sole method of transportation, beyond taking ride shares. This means not only do I not get to bike, but I also don't get to head to the gym as much as I'd like. So, inevitably, I tell myself that I'll figure out a home workout routine, never do it, and then complain about how I never work out. Spring shows up and I shake the dust from my bones and I promptly regret not doing workouts. When Speediance reached out to me to offer up the VeloNix for review, I was intrigued. However, historically I haven't been so great with stationary bikes because I often get bored. But, seeing as it doesn't look like bike season is going to happen anytime soon, I decided to take a look at it. After all, who knows, maybe the VeloNix will change my mind on stationary bikes. Assembling the VeloNixWhen I heard that some assembly was required, I wasn't sure what to expect. When it showed up at my house, I was sort of dreading putting it together. The box weighs a lot — somewhere north of 100 pounds. While the weight wasn't too big of a deal for me, the size of the box was. After a significant struggle to get it inside my house, I realized that there was no way I was going to be able to set it up downstairs. No, I was going to have to take it upstairs. In case you were wondering what a cross-section of the bike box looks like. It's well packed! - Speediance VeloNixThis is where I deviated from the assembly plans. I knew that they wanted me to assemble the bottom of the bike while it was still in the box, and then flip the box 180 degrees. If I had two people, or if I had planned on assembling it downstairs, that would have been great. But instead, I needed to take the body of the VeloNix out, carry it upstairs, and then bring the other boxes up after. While it wasn't easy getting it upstairs, I wouldn't say it was particularly hard. Again, I am vertically challenged, you may not have these issues. And while I was initially dreading assembling the VeloNix, it was quite easy. I was surprised — it only took me about 30 minutes. The instructions were clear, all the tools were included, and it felt very solid once I was finished. As far as looks go, the VeloNix certainly dominates a room. It's not an unattractive bike, but it is a very large bike. Needless to say, I'm pretty happy that I have a dedicated room in my house for fitness equipment. If you've got a small apartment or a cramped house, this is probably not going to work for you. But, if you've got a roughly 10 square foot (0.85 square meters) corner of your garage, basement, or home office that can fit, you can fit the bike. The measurements, by the way, are about 63-inches by 24-inches by 63-inches. If you've got kids or pets, it's nice to know that the motor is entirely enclosed. That means no worrying about pinched fingers, paws, or tails. The bike puts you in a sport riding position, or something you'd see in a spin class. If we're being honest, that's not my favorite position to be put in by default. I have a lingering issue with my lower back. While I've put in the work to train up my hamstrings to help compensate, I don't love being at an angle for long periods. I can get around this by pulling the seat as far forward as it will go, dropping the seat down, and making sure the handlebars are high enough. It's not a perfect solution, though. The bottle cage is a nice touch. You'd think for $2600 they'd include a bottle - Speediance VeloNixIf you don't have a bad back — well, aren't you lucky. You'll probably do just fine here. Also, I'd say that I'm about two or three inches too short to comfortably use this bike for extended periods. For reference, I stand tall at 5'2 (157cm). You'll probably have better luck if you're 5'5 (165cm). I will also point out that this problem isn't unique to this bike, either. I struggle with quite a few designs of spin bikes and stationary bikes — I just wanted to prevent anyone from making a costly purchase if they're in the same boat. My partner, for instance, is 6'3 (190cm) and found the bike comfortable once some minor adjustments were made to the seat and handlebar height. If you're a tall rider, don't worry, Speediance says the VeloNix can accommodate riders of up to 7'3 (220cm). But what about the screen?The real reason you'd want this bike is because of the screen and all the features that come with it. And let's be clear, it's a solid screen. It's a 21.5-inch screen with a 1920 by 1080 resolution. The arm it's attached to can swivel and tilt easily, which is great for adjusting easily for multiple users or different riding positions. If you're like me, you need to be visually stimulated to do anything you don't want to. That's why a bike with a screen on it is a pretty nice alternative to an outdoor ride. It's not as great as an actual outdoor ride, but it's a lot better than staring at a wall. Speediance VeloNix stationary bike - setting up the software sideBecause it's a bike with a computer attached to it, you're going to need to set it up to use it. When I first got the bike, this was hardly an easy task. There was a persistent language bug that required me to pull out my phone and do a visual translation to figure out what was going on. It took me about 20 minutes of futzing around, but I eventually got it set up. The language bug may still persist, make sure you update the firmware - Speediance VeloNixFortunately, Speediance has already resolved the bug, so now setup is much easier. However, if your VeloNix ships with an older version of the firmware, you're going to want to update as soon as you can, otherwise it'll be stuck in a weird half-step between your native language and Chinese. Essentially, you power on the bike, turn on the screen and follow the on-screen setup. It's just as easy as setting up any other tablet, now. My only other note about the setup is how strange I found the interface. I thought it odd that the interface is clearly designed to mimic an iPad, but it's running an Android operating system. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. Speediance VeloNix stationary bike performanceUnfortunately, once again, I have been forced to purchase a bike seat to use a bike. This has happened pretty much every time I've received a bike to test. By default the VeloNix comes with a \"performance saddle\" that feels like it's designed for men. And it's kind that you'd want to use for sport cycling. I am not a man, and I don't do sport cycling. So, that means I swapped it for a wider, more cushioned seat. I wasn't getting saddle sore for this review — I'd rather give it a chance. This is a very small, very hard seat - Speediance VeloNix Once the seat was swapped, I knew I wasn't going to get saddle-sore. When it came to riding, barring the length issue, I found it to be a solid ride. The 2300W brushless motor allows you to dial in the resistance to your perfect level. In fact, it is a little insane how granular you can get with the resistance on here. You can sync it with Apple Health and your Apple Watch to log your data and track your heart rate. You can sync it with most fitness trackers. I was able to sync it with my Power Beats Pro in order to track my heart rate while riding. Speediance provides guides on how to connect specific health trackers to the Velonix — but you can connect more than just theseIt also integrates with a handful of third-party apps. This includes Zwift, the insanely popular cycling app that lets you compete against other Zwifters. VeloNix Classes, virtual environments, and streaming The point of a $2600 bike isn't so much the bike, it's the luxury features you get with the purchase of the bike. There are intense spin classes that you can take on. There are leaderboards for digital courses you can do. I thought it was great that they added a bunch of virtual real-world environments you can bike. There are a bunch of them, and they have appropriate resistance levels mapped to the elevation gains — that's really fun. One of the greatest things about the screen is that you don't need to use it to take spin classes or bike virtual scenic routes. Of course, you can do those things, and if you're interested in them, it's nice that they're included. But let's be real — it streams content from major streaming services. That's why I like it. Watching YouTube while you ride is nice, but there are cheaper ways to do it - Speediance VeloNix Smart Exercise Bike You can stream from YouTube, HBO, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+. And, while you're streaming, you still get access to your metrics, right at the bottom of your screen. This is, by far, my favorite feature. Maybe it speaks to my dopamine addiction, but there's something nice about throwing on my favorite YouTube videos and just zoning out. Working with Apple-specific gearSyncing with Apple Health is pretty easy. You'll just need to download the Speediance app and log in. Once logged in, it will ask you to permit it to read data from Apple Health. The VeloNix Smart Exercise Bike can read Apple Health data via the Speediance appAs it stands right now, the VeloNix bike doesn't support GymKit. The developers may choose to add this feature in the future, but I wanted to mention that it doesn't exist currently. The one feature I would have loved to see added to the VeloNix is AirPlay. It doesn't have it at the moment, so you can't stream Apple Fitness+ directly to the bike. That alone would have made this bike a fairly easy recommendation for at-home gym enthusiasts. Speediance VeloNix stationary bike - the subscription issueIf I were just using an in-home gym setup with nothing else, I wouldn't be quick to gripe about subscription fees with this bike. However, the cost of my Planet Fitness membership is roughly $32 a month once you factor in the annual membership fees. And by going there, I can get access to stationary bikes and a whole host of other cardio and strength training equipment. And I can get all the hydro-massages and Total Body Enhancement treatments I want. And, the VeloNix doesn't replace my gym membership. I can't do leg presses, I can't row on it, and it certainly isn't going to massage my calves after I go too hard on the calf extension machine. That being said, I'm not inherently against fitness equipment with subscriptions. After all, you are paying for trainer-led classes and a host of other features that should cost extra money. I think Speediance has priced its premium features pretty well. At $15 a month, I feel like I'd get my money's worth when it comes to features. Any higher and I'd start to be hesitant over recommending it to anyone with a busy schedule who may not get to work out a few times a week. Speediance VeloNix stationary bike versus actual bikingYou know how when you talk to an outdoor runner they constantly complain about any time they need to use a treadmill instead of running outside? It's the same for cyclists, even hobbyists like myself. If given the option between biking outside and indoor stationary biking, I'm almost always going to default to biking outside. I like the fresh air, and the fact that I can do it with friends — sometimes I get to see a cute dog or a weird bird. These are all positives that don't have an equivalent on a stationary bike. Unfortunately, because I live in the land of the Ever Winter, I don't get twelve months of biking weather. Sometimes I'm lucky if I get eight. During biking season I tend to hop on my bike anywhere between four to seven days a week. Let's say, for the sake of simplicity, the average is five days a week. My current go-to ride is the Ride1Up Roadster V2 Gravel editionEvery time I go out biking, I try to get somewhere between one and three hours in. It's urban biking, so it's definitely not intense cycling, but I think it's respectable. Let's say I get 1.5 hours a day in. So, per week, I'm getting 7.5 hours of moderate aerobic exercise. Spread across four weeks, that's 30 hours per month. Not too shabby for someone who works a desk job and lists \"reading Wikipedia\" as a hobby. By that logic, that means I'm missing out on 120 hours of aerobic exercise in the winter. I'm nearly 40, that honestly seems like a bad idea. Sure, I can use my standing desk more. I can take frequent walks around my house during breaks. I could even pay for Apple Fitness+ and do a HIIT workout right from the comfort of my iPad. But, if you remember what I said at the top of the article here, I hate HIIT. I hate aerobics. I don't want to do pilates. So, if it was between riding a stationary bike or not riding at all, the option is easy and immediate: I would prefer the stationary bike. If you're one of those people who loves spin classes but doesn't necessarily need an in-classroom setting, this is, more or less, the same thing. Lets discuss cost vs value The VeloNix is not a cheap bike. In fact, it's about $54 more expensive than Peloton's Bike+, which is obviously the style of exercise bike this is trying to be. At just under $2600, I'd consider this a major purchase for most people, and I'm going to factor that into my overall rating. If you don't care about screens or on-board classes, or if you're likely to quit using it early on, I'd straight up avoid buying it. After all, this thing is about seven years worth of a Planet Fitness membership — and at least you can cancel an unused membership. If you just want a bike with a screen that enables you to watch video, you can just get an iPad holder for a much cheaper stationary bike. Yet, if you're someone who loves spin classes or is looking to supplement an already robust fitness regimen, the VeloNix is a good bike. If you've got multiple people in your household who would routinely use an exercise bike, it's certainly going to be cheaper in the long run than paying for multiple gym memberships. What I'm saying is, it's a good bike for the right audience. Unfortunately, I'm not entirely sure how big that audience is. If it were me, I would not be purchasing the VeloNix. I prefer riding outdoors. However, Speediance makes not one but two home gyms that I would strongly consider buying if I had the expendable income. But, again, I like strength training. Ultimately, the choice is up to you, as it are most things. I'm just here to let you know if it does what it says on the box. Speediance VeloNix prosAbility to set exact resistance levels Access to classes, virtual rides, and training programs Compatible with Apple Heath and Apple Watch Has built in streaming service support for HBO, Hulu, Disney+, and more Screen is spacious and easy to navigate aroundSpeediance VeloNix consVery expensive Will not work for short riders Takes up 10 square feet Weighs more than 100lbsRating: 3 out of 5 starsNote: A star system, while convenient to look at, doesn't always convey the nuances of a review. A 3-star rating assumes that you fall in the target demographic. We highly suggest that you do your own research before making such a significant purchase. Where to buy:Currently, the Speediance VeloNix is sold out on the Speediance website, but it normally retails for $2549 with free shipping. Speediance recommends that you sign up for email updates to know when the next batch are available for order.",
