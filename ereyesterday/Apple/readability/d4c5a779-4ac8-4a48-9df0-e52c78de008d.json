  "text": "Update: The new Nintendo Music app is now live on Apple’s App Store and Google Play.  After stretching its P-wings a little bit into the (sort of) smart alarm clock world with the new Alarmo earlier this month, today the Mushroom Kingdom is moving over to your smartphone with the new Nintendo Music app. Nintendo has nearly 40 years of absolute iconic soundtracks under its belt at this point, and it is now ready to bonk the Music Block on your iPhone to serve them up to fans, on-demand and at no additional cost…providing you’re a Switch Online member that is.  Official Nintendo Music app debuts today Today Nintendo is officially announcing the new Nintendo Music app that will be available “later today” on all of “your smart devices” – it is now available on Apple’s App Store and Google Play. Kick back and enjoy some Nintendo tunes with Nintendo Music, the exclusive smart-device app for Nintendo Switch Online members that lets you stream or download Nintendo soundtracks, create and share playlists, browse music by different categories, and more! The new app will presumably carry all of the most iconic tunes from all of your favorite Nintendo franchises, but we do know it will have the “iconic beats of Super Mario Bros. and the grand soundscapes of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” right through to the “tentacle-tapping tunes of Splatoon 3 and beyond.” Songs from Animal Crossing are also included as well as Super Mario Odyssey, the absolutely brilliant tunes from the original Donkey Kong Country (that water stage, am I right?), Metroid Prime, Starfox 64, Pokémon titles, Kirby games, and much more.  Scope out the announcement trailer below: Enjoy Nintendo game music—now on your smart device! Nintendo Music features a variety of tracks from Nintendo franchises, plus curated playlists based on characters, in-game moments, and moods. From recent releases to nostalgic classics, even more music will be added in the future. Screenshot From within the Nintendo Music, users can “can stream songs right from the app or download them to the app for offline listening.” Nintendo is also pointing out that you can “loop songs or extend select tracks to 15, 30 or 60 minutes for uninterrupted listening” or even “filter out soundtracks that may spoil certain moments for you.” There are some expected features like the ability to create your own playlists or “browse curated playlists created by Nintendo.”  Nintendo Music will be available later today at no additional cost for “Nintendo Switch Online and Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack members in the U.S. and Canada.”  FTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on affiliate links Subscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!",
