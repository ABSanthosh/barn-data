The app, which Apple just announced, is iPhone-only and allows users to send and receive invitations to events – yes, invitations, invites is not a noun. Here’s what the onboarding looks like: The app can generate full-screen graphics for invitations to any sort of event. The invitations allow you to mix a combination of photos and AI-generated images that are combined with details about the event and the Memojis of the people you invite. There are multiple font choices, the option to add a playlist from Apple Music, and sections for draft invitations, upcoming events, events you’re hosting, those you’re attending, plus past and upcoming events. Invitees can send notes back to the sender too. Here’s one Federico made for my imaginary birthday party: I won’t be using the Image Playground integration. Fortunately, you aren’t required to use Apple Intelligence to make your invitations, although it is notable that this is one of the first Apple apps we know of that is calling the Image Playground API directly. The app also has a wide variety of backgrounds and supports multiple frameworks and apps system-wide, like Photos, Contacts, Maps, Weather, Calendar, Music, and more. Here are some more screenshots of the app and what it offers: Anyone can receive and respond an invitation using the app, but only iCloud+ subscribers can send invitations. I won’t be using Apple Intelligence to generate images for invitations, but putting the Image Playground integration aside, the app looks nice and is a fun way to approach what is usually a chore of back and forth emails or text messages.
