  "text": "Apple and Beats on Tuesday unveiled the much-anticipated Powerbeats Pro 2 wireless earbuds. Surprisingly, the new version of the Powerbeats Pro comes with features that aren’t even present in Apple’s AirPods. Luckily, we already know some of Apple’s plans for the future of the AirPods. Latest rumors about future AirPods Certainly one of the highlights of the new Powerbeats Pro 2 is the built-in heart rate sensor. This is the first accessory from Apple apart from the Apple Watch to include a health-related sensor and hints at even more health sensors coming to such devices in the future. Of course, Powerbeats Pro are workout-focused earbuds, but it’s still surprising to see Apple choosing to introduce such technology first in a Beats product. What about AirPods? Will they also get a heart rate sensor in the future? We don’t need rumors to assume that they will, but multiple sources have already corroborated that Apple is working on AirPods with health-related sensors. The first and most obvious would be the same heart rate sensor built into the new Powerbeats Pro 2. More specifically, Apple has plans to include the sensor in the next generation AirPods Pro. We don’t know when exactly Apple will launch AirPods Pro 3, but given that AirPods Pro 2 were launched in 2022, it probably won’t be much longer. Possibly later this year. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported last year that Apple has also been exploring sensors that can determine body temperature through the ear canal. The company is also working on camera sensors for AirPods, but these technologies won’t be ready in time for AirPods Pro 3. What else can we expect? For AirPods Pro 3, a refreshed design, although there’s little information about what it will look like. The entry-level AirPods model was recently updated with a new design and ANC, so it’s unlikely that a new version will be on the way any time soon. Apple also has no “meaningful” plans for AirPods Max after last year’s refresh with USB-C. What about you? What do you expect from future AirPods models? Let us know in the comments section below.
