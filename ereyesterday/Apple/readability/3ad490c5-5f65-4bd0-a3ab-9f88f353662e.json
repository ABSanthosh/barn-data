Photo: Cult of Mac Deals For many Apple TV owners, there’s still one kink to be worked out: the remote. The Siri Remote is all about being skinny and putting Apple’s AI assistant front and center. But some people prefer an alternative Apple TV remote with lots of buttons, like the recently upgraded Button Remote from Function101. Upgraded with Bluetooth connectivity in addition to infrared, it works with Apple TVs and more than a hundred other television brands. And you can get one for only $34.97. That’s just two-thirds the price of a replacement sixth-gen Siri Remote from Apple. Function101 Button Remote offers simpler Apple TV navigation While the Apple TV’s official remote looks sleek and aesthetically pleasing (much like most other Apple products), it’s not necessarily the most user-friendly, especially for young children or older adults. Fortunately, you can enjoy a more intuitive experience when you upgrade to this Apple TV-compatible button remote. The first thing users will notice about Function101’s Button Remote is that it looks much like the TV remotes you might likely used in the past. Just as importantly, it feels like a TV remote, boasting a slim profile that fits easily into your hand. This alternative Apple TV remote connects seamlessly to Apple’s streaming set-top box, as well as to more than 100 other major smart TVs. Plus, if you own a sound setup consisting of HomePods, a soundbar or other devices, the Button Remote can control the audio without needing an additional remote. An alternative way to control Apple TV — with lots of buttons! You can easily control your Apple TV with this remote’s clearly marked buttons. It connects to your Apple TV and/or other devices with Bluetooth Low Energy and infrared for easy pairing. After a quick setup, this alternative Apple TV remote lets you take control of the volume and mute functions. Plus, you can pause, fast-forward or rewind your movies and shows on almost every popular streaming service, whether that’s Hulu, Netflix, YouTube TV or Apple TV+. You can even use this button remote to quickly switch between Apple TV apps — simply click “P DOWN” — and quit apps that aren’t responsive.
