And if you’re considering buying new headphones or earbuds this Black Friday, there are two great options with special discounts: AirPods Pro 2 and Beats Studio Pro. Our friends over at 9to5Toys have all the latest details on the best Black Friday deals. AirPods Pro 2: Black Friday deals The second generation of AirPods Pro was launched in September 2022, with a revised version introduced last year with a USB-C charging case replacing Lightning. Two years later, the AirPods Pro 2 remain my favorite wireless earbuds, and are probably the best you can buy right now. Compared to the first generation of AirPods Pro, the second generation has brought a lot of improvements. I’ve never been a fan of earbuds with silicone tips, but the AirPods Pro 2 have convinced me. Thanks to the H2 chip, active noise cancellation has been significantly improved, which was crucial for me to adopt the AirPods Pro 2 as my everyday earphones. I also have AirPods Max, but I use them much less often since I bought AirPods Pro 2. They’re undeniably lighter and more discreet, but they offer the same or even better sound quality and ANC. I simply can’t imagine traveling without AirPods Pro 2 anymore. The sound is immersive with decent bass, while the ANC is the best I’ve ever tested. AirPods Pro 2 also include an extra-small ear tip for a better fit, while you can slide on the earpieces to adjust the volume. Another cool aspect is that the charging case features Apple’s U1 chip with Find My and Precision Finding support. If you buy the revised USB-C version, you also get Lossless support for Apple Vision Pro. Again, even though they’re two years old, AirPods Pro 2 are still the best earbuds on the market in my opinion. If you have old AirPods or are tired of your AirPods Max, you should give the AirPods Pro 2 a try. While they usually cost $249, you can buy them for just $154 on Amazon during Black Friday. Beats Studio Pro: Black Friday deals The Beats Studio Pro headphones were launched last year and are the first big update to the Beats Studio lineup since 2017. The iconic Beats design has been kept and improved – and in some ways, the Beats Studio Pro are even better than the AirPods Max. As someone who owns both AirPods Max and Beats Studio Pro, the Beats headphones are much lighter. More specifically, they weigh just 260g, while AirPods Max weigh 385g. This makes them ideal for wearing for long periods or even during workout activities. When it comes to sound quality, Beats Studio Pro headphones don’t disappoint. I still think AirPods Max sound a little bit better, but considering the huge price difference, it’s a worthwhile trade-off. The Beats headphones also feature ANC and Transparency Mode. What’s more, they support Lossless audio – while AirPods Max don’t. Beats Studio Pro also has Find My support and integrates with the Android ecosystem too. And thanks to the USB-C port and headphone jack, they’re ideal for those using non-Apple devices. Review: Beats Studio Pro are here, and they make AirPods Max impossible to recommend (for now) While regularly priced at $349, you can buy the Beats Studio Pro for just $159 during Black Friday. At that price, they’re totally worth it. Are there any other headphones you like? Let me know in the comments section below.
