  "text": "It started with a planetarium. Now Theater for visionOS has become the best Plex video player on Apple Vision Pro. That’s because of a collection of new features in today’s version 2.1 update. Plex playback is still new as part of the 2.0 upgrade. As I mentioned from the launch of Theater 2: Theater 2 already streamed YouTube. Now it can stream content from your personal Plex Media Server. Sure beats the visionOS Plex app that doesn’t exist yet. OK, the Plex iPad app on AVP isn’t tough competition, but the team behind Theater just upped their Plex game in a huge way. Adam Lisagor of Sandwich fame explains: Updated the app this morning to 2.1 with MUCH better Plex Media Server support, 2FA and OAuth, MKV, TV libraries, remote servers to share libraries with your friends. https://t.co/QegU81VxV3— Adam Lisagor (@adamlisagor) January 6, 2025 2FA support, which was on the app roadmap, unlocks the ability to stream local Plex servers for lots of people. Remote server support unlocks access for their friends. Theater just officially became my favorite Apple Vision Pro app. Theater 2.1 is available on the visionOS App Store today. The app is free to download and enjoy. Plex support is included in the $4 unlock everything in-app purchase. If you’re a Plex user, the unlock is easily worth $40 on its own.
