  "text": "News Sennheiser's latest open-back cans, at $300, are financially within reach for many folks. Photo: Sennheiser Sennheiser’s latest offering are the new HD 550 open-back headphones, designed to bridge the gap between audiophile-grade sound quality and gaming performance, the company said Wednesday. For Mac users who demand great audio whether they’re working with Logic Pro, enjoying Apple Music with lossless audio or diving into the latest Apple Arcade titles, these headphones promise to deliver a compelling listening experience. “Audiophiles looking for featherlight headphones with honest voicing and deep bass extension are in for a treat,” said Sennheiser Audiophile Product Manager Klas Hanselmann. “While the HD 550’s airy detail is obvious, customers will fall in love with its delightfully polite touch — perfect for listening for hours on end.” Legendary for headphones and becoming well-known for earbuds, Sennheiser put custom 38mm transducers in its new HD 550 open-back headphones. It makes the transducers at its audiophile production facility in Tullamore, Ireland. The drivers deliver an impressive frequency response range from 6Hz to 39.5kHz with less than 0.2% total harmonic distortion. That ensures clear audio reproduction across the entire sound spectrum, the company said. With 150 ohms impedance, the headphones pair well with a variety of audio equipment, including MacBooks and other Macs with impedance-sensing headphone jacks. The open-back design uses a new acoustic mesh that protects the transducers while creating an expansive soundstage. For more on open-back vs. closed-back headphones, read our guide. The HD 550’s frequency response graph shows near-flat sound across a wide range. In this case, that means solid bass response and slightly elevated high frequencies before a natural roll-off at the extreme high end. The tuning strikes a balance that should complement both the detailed production work Mac users might do in audio applications and the immersive experience needed for gaming. Gaming performance These lightweight headphones are wired for lossless audio.Photo: Sennheiser For Mac gamers, HD 550 promises “superb, lag-free spatial awareness and immersion.” Those are critical features for both competitive and casual gaming sessions. Sennheiser said it engineered the headphones to deliver punchy bass, crystal-clear transients and neutral mids without compromising the accurate sound reproduction that audiophiles prefer. The wired design ensures zero latency. That makes them an excellent choice for rhythm games and competitive titles where timing is crucial. While Apple’s ecosystem increasingly embraces wireless solutions, the direct 3.5mm connection (with included 6.35mm adapter) provides a reliable, high-quality audio path free from compression or connection issues. Sennheiser HD 550 open-back headphones: Design and comfort Weighing just 237 grams (8.4 oz), HD 550 is lighter than many popular gaming controllers. The light build, combined with a more relaxed clamping force compared to other 500-series models, makes HD 550 comfortable for extended sessions. That comes in handy whether you’re editing a podcast, mixing tracks or engaged in marathon gaming. The headphones feature a soft-touch textured headband and ventilated metal mesh ear cups, providing comfort along with durability. Following the 500 series tradition, the HD 550 maintains a modular design, allowing users to easily swap cables and ear pads. This modularity ensures longevity and adaptability to different use cases. Value proposition for Mac users At $299.95, HD 550 positions itself as a premium but accessible option. While slightly more expensive than the recently released HD 505 ($279), the gaming-focused tuning might make it a more versatile choice for Mac users who split their time between professional audio work and gaming. Unlike most dedicated gaming headsets, HD 550 doesn’t include a microphone. So Mac users can choose their preferred microphone solution separately. That could be a studio-quality USB mic for podcasting or a more discrete option for video calls. You can preorder Sennheiser HD 550 fort $299.95 on Sennheiser’s website, with shipping expected to begin in the first week of April. Preorder from: Sennheiser Source: Sennheiser",
