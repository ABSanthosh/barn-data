Apple's next-generation iPhone SE could be the next to run Apple Intelligence, but at a much lower price. It is expected to look similar to the iPhone 14 but with a single camera on the rear. According to a report from Bloomberg, Apple could release the iPhone SE 4 \"as early as next week.\" That means it could be announced anywhere between now and Valentine's Day. Pre-orders will likely begin shortly after the announcement, and shipments will go out by the end of February. That timeline aligns with previous predictions of a February or March release, though it is a miss for predictions suggesting the M4 MacBook Air would be first. Apple is apparently using the iPhone SE 4 as a testbed for its in-house modem, which replaces the Qualcomm one used now. The device is also expected to feature Face ID, the A18 processor, and USB-C. The iPhone SE 4 is one of several products expected in the first half of 2025. The new PowerBeats Pro 2 with a heart rate sensor could arrive around the same time as the budget iPhone. Then, the M4 MacBook Air and iPad Air update are expected to arrive later.",
