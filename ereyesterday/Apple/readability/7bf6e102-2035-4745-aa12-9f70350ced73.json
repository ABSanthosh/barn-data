  "text": "The year is almost over, but the team behind the popular fitness and wellness app Gentler Streak still had a few cards up their sleeve for 2024. The latest update to the app adds improvements to health metrics, as well as the long-awaited Activity Recap 2024. With version 5.1 of the app, Gentler Streak has improved health metrics so that users can now see 7-day charts for each available metric, with an expanded 14-day view option. Moreover, the app now uses RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) calculations for Heart Rate Variability, providing more accurate insights. Gentler Streak has also expanded its menstrual cycle tracking capabilities, including new metrics such as previous cycle length and 1-year cycle variability, perimenopause guidance, improved period duration logging, enhanced HealthKit integration, and new insights on emotions, menopause and staying active. For those who use the Apple Watch as a sleep tracker, the Gentler Streak app now shows health metrics such as sleeping heart rate, HRV, and oxygen levels within the Sleep Stages chart, offering a comprehensive view of the body’s behavior during sleep. And of course, the Activity Recap 2024 is now available, so you can get an overview of your year in terms of health and fitness. “Check out what you’ve achieved this year – since 2024 is still ongoing, your recap will be updating daily until the end of December so you can track your progress until the very last day. Whether you took it slow or pushed yourself to new heights, your recap celebrates your tempo,” the developers say.
