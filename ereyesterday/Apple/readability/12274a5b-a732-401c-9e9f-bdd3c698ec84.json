Photo: Apple TV+ In the upcoming The Last of the Sea Women documentary, the way of life of South Korea’s haenyeo, or sea women of Jeju Island, is disappearing. But it won’t happen without a fierce fight from the grandmother-warrior divers, often called “real-life mermaids,” and a younger generation of helpers, according to the trailer Apple TV+ dropped Thursday. The documentary film from producer Malala Yousafzai and director Sue Kim premieres on Apple TV+ on October 11. Update: Documentary film The Last of the Sea Women started streaming on Apple TV+ Friday. Reviews seem to say this one is a keeper, like a pearl found in an oyster. The Last of the Sea Women chronicles the lives of South Korea’s ‘real-life mermaids’ The trailer offers an interesting glimpse at a rare way of life sadly compromised by passing time, industrialization, pollution and climate change. The haenyeo of South Korea’s Jeju Island have practiced free diving to harvest seafood from the ocean for generations. And while some are still at it in their golden years, their way of life is dying. But the remaining “warrior grandmothers” and a host of younger women who want to help don’t want to see it end. Here’s more description from Apple TV+: Even the oldest of the haenyeo, in their 80s, probably have more lung capacity than you do.Photo: Apple TV+ In The Last of the Sea Women, an extraordinary band of feisty grandmother warriors wage a spirited battle against vast oceanic threats. Often called real-life mermaids, the haenyeo divers of South Korea’s Jeju Island are renowned for centuries of diving to the ocean floor — without oxygen — to harvest seafood for their livelihood. Today, with most haenyeo now in their 60s, 70s and 80s, their traditions and way of life are in imminent danger. But these fierce, funny, hardworking women refuse to give an inch, aided by a younger generation’s fight to revive their ancestral lifestyle through social media. Peering into what drives haenyeo young and old, this moving documentary zeroes in on their tight-knit friendships, savvy independence, and infectious sense of empowerment, unfolding into an uplifting tale of women taking on world powers to protect their beloved ocean and inspiring a new generation. The co-production hails from A24 and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai’s production company, Extracurricular. It partners with Apple TV+ to create original programming.
