  "text": "OpenAI is full steam ahead in its plan to turn ChatGPT into a true productivity assistant, especially for teams and small businesses. Starting today, these users will get access to a new Record Mode and cloud drive integration. Here’s how it works. Starting today, ChatGPT Team, Enterprise, and Edu users who use the ChatGPT Mac app will get access to a Record button next to other prompt tools. Once pressed, the button launches a widget that instantly starts recording and transcribing audio. The transcription is then turned into structured notes with overall summaries, key points, action items, open questions, etc. One key differentiator of this feature is that, unlike Notion or Zoom’s meeting bots that need to join as a participant, ChatGPT’s new tool doesn’t require any of that. It simply listens through the device and turns what is being said into structured notes. Cloud drives Alongside recording mode, OpenAI is rolling out built-in integrations with cloud services including Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box, and SharePoint. That means ChatGPT can now fetch data from your own files to answer context-rich questions like “What was our Q1 revenue last year?” or “How many times did I use maritime transport in my latest trip report?” OpenAI says that by default, it doesn’t train on data across Teams, Edu, and Enterprise, and that includes connected data. Moreover, the assistant responds with structured answers, complete with citations pulled from your documents, all while respecting existing file permissions as well. More connectors Aside from cloud drives, today’s update also includes new connectors for platforms like HubSpot, Linear, and select Microsoft and Google tools, allowing teams to generate research reports or project documents (via OpenAI’s Canvas tool) by combining internal data with external sources. The list of supported platforms includes: Box Dropbox GitHub Gmail Google Calendar Google Drive (Docs, Sheets, Slides) Hubspot Linear Outlook (Calendar, Email) SharePoint Teams OpenAI also said its Pro, Team, and Enterprise customers will also be able to use Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect even more tools to Deep Research. This is likely to make the compatibility list even longer, as platforms and companies like Replit, Atlassian, Cloudflare and Zapier have been adopting the protocol as well.
