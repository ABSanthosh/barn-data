  "description": "Macworld Getting a new laptop doesn’t necessarily mean you have to spend a fortune on the latest model—especially when you can get it for the lowest price ever. B\u0026H Photo is selling the 15-inch M3 MacBook Air for just $899 right now, a savings of $400 and the best price we’ve ever seen. With 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, the M3 MacBook Air is an absolute gem for $899, especially considering all that it has to offer. Let’s start with the 15.4-inch Liquid Retina Display that’s absolutely gorgeous, no matter what you’re doing on your laptop (but especially when streaming your favorite shows). When leaving the house, the laptop will keep you going for up to 18 hours and you’ll also appreciate how light this 3.3-pound laptop is because no one likes lugging around a super heavy backpack. We fell in love with this MacBook Air back when we reviewed it, giving it a 4.5-star rating and claiming it’s an “outstanding performer in its class.” And there’s not all that much new with the M4 model other than an improved FaceTime camera. And that’s at its full price. For $899, this M3 MacBook Air is an absolute steal so go take advantage of this discount while it’s still here. Get the M3 MacBook Air for $400 offBuy now at B\u0026H",
