Photo: Cult of Mac Deals This amazing ear camera will help you combat earwax buildup that can seriously impact your hearing. Earwax impaction occurs in 57% of older adults and 10% of children, But you don’t have to be stuck blindly going at it with a cotton swab (which experts recommend against, BTW). Use this earwax removal tool instead! The Smart Visual Ear Cleaner gives you a clear view of what’s happening in your ear — and a better way to clean up shop in there. You can get this earwax removal device for just $24.97. Ear camera gives HD view for easy earwax removal With this easy-to-use ear camera, you can stream a 360-degree, wide-angle view of your ear canal to your iPhone. The 1080P HD camera can help guide your hand so you can know exactly where you’re cleaning. The silicone ear spoons are designed to neatly scoop out wax without scratching the delicate inside of your ear. Soaking a warm compress is another common way of trying to clear out or soften earwax for removal. With that in mind, the Smart Visual Ear Cleaner is built with an IPX7 waterproof lens, so you can pair it with any water-based method of earwax removal. Also works in your mouth, nose, etc. Its waterproof lens and LED light mean you can even safely use this innovative earwax cleaner to check out your mouth before a trip to the dentist. Or you can take a look at your nasal cavity, throat or scalp roots. The 360 mAh battery supports 1.5 hours of continuous use, meaning this device boasts enough battery for 45 days’ worth of daily use. This earwax removal tool won’t stop buildup, but it can help you clean more regularly and carefully. Pairing this tool with simple solutions like avoiding in-ear headphones can also help further decrease wax buildup so you don’t need to clean your ears as often.
