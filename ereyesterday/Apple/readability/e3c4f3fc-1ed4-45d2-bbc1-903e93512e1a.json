Originally a successful Kickstarter campaign that raised over $3.5 million, Lymow has enhanced its offering to create the new Lymow One. An advanced robot lawnmower with quite a few smart features. Its Dual Blade Mowing Deck is designed to work with multiple types of grass, with the use of two high-speed spinning mulching blades and a centrifugal fan. The system cuts clippings while avoiding clumping to nourish the lawn, while also distributing the clippings evenly. Using a brushless motor with a peak output of 1,200W, it can spin the blades at up to 6,000 RPM, with a cutting width of 16 inches. The terrain-adaptive floating deck can adjust from 1.2 inches to 4 inches, while its omniwheels follow the ground across uneven terrain. The LySee Multi-Fusion navigation system uses a combination of real-time kinematic (RTK) satellite positioning as well as visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) to know where it is with centimeter-level precision. While RTK signals can be affected by trees, bad weather, and other environmental factors, VSLAM can handle times when the satellite is not available. The VSLAM system uses stereo cameras with image-based semantic recognition and depth-sensing to understand its surroundings. Its onboard processing can also adapt to obstacles, including pet waste, animals, and sprinklers, avoiding them if necessary, as defined in the Lymow app. It also has five ultrasonic sensors, two front bumpers, and off-ground sensors in the blade deck for safety. It can stop the blades within a second once it detects a hazardous situation. Lymow has also made it a speedy mower, with it able to cover 0.23 acres an hour, 0.57 acres per charge, or 1.73 acres per day. Its traction allows it to handle obstacles up to two inches in height, 45-degree slopes, and even some staircases. Built to be rugged, it is made from a one-piece die-cast aluminum alloy frame, as well as an IPX6 waterproof rating. The Lymow One is in production, with delivery expected from April 2025. It is priced at $2,999.",
