  "text": "Apple’s popular “Back to School” campaign is officially returning for customers in Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, offering free accessories for students and educators purchasing new Apple products in these countries. Apple gives free AirPods and Apple Pencil with its Back to School campaign This year, Apple is offering a free pair of AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation with the purchase of a new MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, or iMac. For those buying a new iPad Pro or iPad Air, Apple is including a free Apple Pencil – which can be either the Apple Pencil Pro or the USB-C version When it comes to the offer to buy a new Mac, customers can also upgrade to AirPods Pro 2 or AirPods Max and receive a discount equivalent to the price of AirPods 4 with ANC. The campaign aims to help students and teachers gear up for the academic year with the latest Apple technology. In addition to free accessories, students and teachers can buy Macs, iPads, and eligible accessories at a discount. As noted by MacRumors, AppleCare+ plans are also 20% off for students. In these countries, Apple’s Back to School campaign runs until March 13, 2025. For countries like the US and Canada, the campaign usually starts in June. You can find more information by visiting the Apple website or an Apple Retail Store in your country. Of course, you can also buy Macs and iPads at a discount from stores like Amazon – even if you’re not a student.
