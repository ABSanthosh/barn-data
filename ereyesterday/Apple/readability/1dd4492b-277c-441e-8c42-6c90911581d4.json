Survivors and bodies are still being pulled out from collapsed buildings, according to BBC News. Our hearts go out to all those in Myanmar and Thailand affected by the devastating earthquake. Apple is donating to support relief efforts on the ground.— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) March 30, 2025 Eighteen people died in Thailand as well. A second earthquake measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale struck approximately 12 minutes after the first one. The epicenter was located in Sagaing, a city near Myanmar's second-largest city, Mandalay — about 60 miles north of the country's capital, Nay Pyi Taw. Aftershocks of up to 5.1 magnitude have continued through Sunday, March 30, northwest of Mandalay. In Thailand, the capital of Bangkok saw relatively little damage from the tremors, but an unfinished building collapsed as a result. Bangkok is about 621 miles from the quake's epicenter, giving an indication of the quake's reach and power. Apple routinely donates to the Red Cross and other relief organizations following disasters in the US and many other countries. In October of 2024, Cook posted an almost-identical message noting that the company would be donating to Hurricane Milton relief when it struck South Florida. The company also provided funds and resources for relief efforts following Hurricane Helene, which killed over 100 people in the southern US just a few weeks earlier. Apple sent money and resources to numerous countries in 2024, including Pakistan and Brazil as aid relief.",
