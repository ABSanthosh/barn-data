  "text": "Apple has released a new beta 3 update. Just hours after the recent debut of beta 3 for tvOS and HomePod only, watchOS 11.3 has received its beta 3 update too. New beta brings software updates closer to launch Apple’s current beta cycle has been fairly quiet. For example, watchOS 11.3 currently has no known exclusive features. More broadly across Apple’s platforms, there’s new robot vacuum support coming to the Home app on supported devices, a Calculator app fix, and Genmoji on the Mac. But that’s about it for noticeable changes so far. Last year, Apple’s x.3 releases were similarly sparse on features. As a result, the beta cycle wrapped up surprisingly quickly. We may see the same thing happen this time around. Apple only released three betas before the RC (release candidate) versions last winter, so it’s very possible the same pattern will play out again. Assuming that the short beta cycle does happen, we could see a public launch of these updates in the next couple weeks, before the end of January. Of course, Apple needs to release beta 3 for its flagship iPhone, iPad, and Mac platforms first. And for now at least, those releases are mysteriously MIA. Have you installed beta 3 of watchOS 11.3?
