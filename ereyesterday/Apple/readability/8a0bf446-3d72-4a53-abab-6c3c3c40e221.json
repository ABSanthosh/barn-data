  "description": "Macworld Ever since Apple unveiled its ambitious next-gen CarPlay in-car experience at WWDC 2023, we’ve been waiting for the first vehicles to arrive. Nearly two years later, the first models running the new system are finally rolling off the lot—and it finally has a proper name. Apple and Aston Martin announced on Thursday that CarPlay Ultra will be available as a standard feature on all new vehicle orders in the U.S. and Canada, and will be available for existing models that feature Aston Martin’s “next-generation infotainment system” through an upcoming software update. The system, which “builds on the capabilities of CarPlay and provides the ultimate in-car experience by deeply integrating with the vehicle to deliver the best of iPhone and the best of the car,” appears to be very similar to the one that debuted at WWDC 2023. Aston Martin will be the first car maker to ship CarPlay Ultra support.Aston Martin According to Apple, CarPlay Ultra provides content for all the car’s displays, including the instrument cluster, with “dynamic and beautiful options for the speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, and more.” Drivers can also choose to show information from their iPhone, including maps and media, right in the instrument cluster. Like regular CarPlay, the system requires an iPhone to work and will default to the car’s standard infotainment system otherwise. CarPlay Ultra lets automakers tailor the look to their “distinct design philosophy” with custom themes, personalized color options, and unique wallpapers. Apple says many other automakers around the world are working to adopt CarPlay Ultra, including “newly committed brands Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis.” CarPlay Ultra isn’t replacing CarPlay, which is still available for millions of cars worldwide. However, the Ultra branding suggests a top-of-the-line product, like the Apple Watch Ultra and M2 Ultra processor.",
