Image source: OpenAIThird-party artificial intelligence tools have been available for a while to help with coding on macOS, but OpenAI is throwing its hat in the ring with the latest ChatGPT app update. Users can communicate with ChatGPT and share what's within Xcode and other IDEs thanks to the \"work with apps\" capability.TechCrunch reports that the update comes with an \"auto-apply\" mode so ChatGPT can edit code without additional permission prompts every time. The function is shown in a video posted to social media by OpenAI team member Alexander Embiricos. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums",

Windows users will get the feature \"soon.\" Xcode already has Swift Assist , an Apple-made generative coding assistant that runs via private cloud servers. Users have also been able to install tools like GitHub Copilot to assist with coding. Developers will need to weigh the risks involved with exposing code to third-party AI tools. Apple promises that code isn't stored or used for training. Apple could introduce more features for Swift Assist during WWDC in June. Until then, third-party options like ChatGPT will help developers solve coding problems alongside Apple's built-in tool.",
