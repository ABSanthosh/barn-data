  "text": "News Suddenly, Apple's AR glasses project goes the way of Apple Car. Photo: Jon Prosser/Front Page Tech In a significant shift in its augmented reality strategy, Apple suddenly discontinued development of its lightweight AR glasses project this week, according to a new report Friday. This marks another adjustment in the company’s pursuit of mainstream wearable technology. The project, known internally as N107, aimed to create normal-looking glasses with built-in displays that would connect to Mac computers. Apple’s decision to end the AR glasses project came after multiple design iterations and technical challenges, according to Bloomberg sources familiar with the matter. The company declined to comment on the development. It comes at a crucial time in the augmented reality market, with Meta Platforms making significant progress on its Ray-Ban smart glasses line. Meta aims to launch AR-capable glasses by 2027, potentially giving them a substantial lead in the consumer AR space. Apple had positioned AR glasses as a potential breakthrough following the mixed reception of Vision Pro, its $3,499 mixed-reality headset. The glasses project represented a more accessible approach to augmented reality, designed to appeal to everyday users rather than early adopters and professionals. Unlike the Vision Pro, these glasses would have been lightweight enough to wear without a head strap and wouldn’t have included the device’s signature EyeSight display. Tough technical hurdles The technical hurdles proved substantial, according to Bloomberg. Initially conceived to pair with iPhones, the team encountered issues with processing power and battery life limitations. A pivot to Mac connectivity aimed to leverage more powerful processors and larger batteries, but the prototype’s performance fell short during executive reviews. The cancellation reflects broader challenges within Apple’s Vision Products Group (VPG). Team members have reportedly expressed concerns about unclear direction and focus, impacting morale. However, Apple continues to develop Vision Pro successors and maintains other innovative concepts, including AirPods with cameras. The company hasn’t abandoned its long-term ambition to create standalone AR glasses, continuing work on fundamental technologies like custom microLED displays. For current and prospective Vision Pro users, Apple remains committed to the platform’s development. During a recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook highlighted growing corporate adoption of the Vision Pro, though consumer usage patterns have raised some concerns. Early data suggests that device usage among owners hasn’t met initial expectations, presenting a challenge for Apple’s mixed-reality strategy. Looking forward to Vision Pro platform developments The broader context includes Apple’s recent pattern of retiring ambitious projects, including last year’s cancellation of the self-driving car program and the 2024 termination of custom Apple Watch screen development. These decisions reflect the company’s willingness to adjust course when projects don’t meet their stringent standards for market readiness and user experience. Looking ahead, Apple’s augmented reality efforts will likely focus on evolving the Vision Pro platform while continuing research into more accessible form factors. The company faces the challenge of balancing innovation with practical limitations, all while competing in an increasingly dynamic market for wearable technology. For Apple users interested in augmented reality, the focus remains on the Vision Pro ecosystem, though the dream of lightweight AR glasses remains a future possibility rather than an imminent reality. The development also raises questions about Apple’s strategy in the broader wearables market, where the company has previously found success with products like the Apple Watch and AirPods. As these accessories continue to generate significant revenue, the challenge of finding the next breakthrough wearable device becomes increasingly important for Apple’s future growth.",
