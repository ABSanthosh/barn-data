  "text": "It has been a year since Apple provided insight on its total install base, but on the earnings call Thursday, CEO Tim Cook shared that it is 2.35 billion devices. The first-quarter earnings call revealed a lot of small details about Apple's business. One metric anticipated by investors hasn't been shared since January 2024. The previous number was 2.2 billion devices, which was 400 million higher than the number shared in 2022. Apple CEO Tim Cook shared that the number has reached a new record high of 2.35 billion active devices. That is a sharp increase over two years of 550 million devices, though more in line with the 2022 increase and not the incredible 2023 increase. Over all, the install base increase has slowed overall. Apple's iPhone may have shrunk a bit year over year to $69.1 billion, but it is still selling in droves and helping add to Apple's install base. Cook did try to associate iPhone growth with Apple Intelligence during the call, but analysts have stated otherwise. However, the earnings call did reveal that the iPhone reached a new all-time high install base in every region. Unit revenue as percentage of total 2021 to 2025The total revenue for quarter one of 2025 is $124.3 billion. As Apple expands into new categories like Apple Vision Pro, its revenue and install base are sure to grow too.",
