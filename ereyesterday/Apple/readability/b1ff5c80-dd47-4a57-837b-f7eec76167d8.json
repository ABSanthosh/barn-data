  "description": "Macworld While macOS 26 Tahoe is still months away from landing on our Macs, Apple is already gearing up for major changes in the next major version of macOS. After revealing that Tahoe will be the last version to support Intel Macs, Apple is also warning users that another long-standing feature will be deprecated in macOS 27. According to a post on X by user @stellafudge, Apple is giving users notice that the next major version of macOS, presumably version 27, will “no longer support AirPort Disk, or other Time Capsule disks, for Time Machine backups.” Apple discontinued AirPort and Time Capsule in 2018, but has supported the Apple Filing Protocol network protocol in macOS Mojave and subsequent versions of macOS. It’s possible that ending support signals a new Wi-Fi router is on the way. While there haven’t been any specific rumors to support the launch of a new AirPort, Apple is expected to use its own homegrown Wi-Fi chip in the iPhone 17 this fall and expand support to the Mac through 2026 and 2027.  With its own chip, Apple could build in support for the necessary bands and protocols to build a new router. Rumors also suggest that Apple could be combining the Wi-Fi chip with its C-series modem, which could bring the first MacBook with cellular connectivity.",
