  "text": "Mac gamers are probably familiar with CrossOver, a platform that lets users run Windows software on macOS and Linux as if it were native software. CodeWeavers, the company behind the app, has now released CrossOver 25 with a series of enhancements – including support for more games like Red Dead Redemption 2. What’s new with CrossOver 25 According to the developers, CrossOver 25 comes with more than 5,000 changes that improve support for a variety of apps and games on macOS and Linux. The new version of CrossOver is based on Wine 10.0, which includes better HiDPI support for Retina displays and updated Vulkan drivers. For Mac users, CrossOver now includes a new configuration system that will make it easier to play games “out of the box” without additional mods or the need to use game-specific CrossTies. With the update, games such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition, and Fallout 4 now work without the need for patches. It also enables multiplayer support in Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition. But perhaps one of the main highlights of CrossOver 25 is support for Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2, which now finally runs on the Mac. Other games now supported by CrossOver 25 are Street Fighter 6, Need for Speed Heat, Nioh 2 – The Complete Edition, Teardown, Age of Wonders 4, Dragon’s Dogma 2, and The Last of Us Part 1. The new version of CrossOver also enables DXMT, which is a Metal-based implementation of Direct3D 11. DXMT will be available alongside wined3d, DXVK, and D3DMetal, so users can choose which works best for them. The developers note that DXMT offers better performance on Macs with lower specs. Last year, with CrossOver 24, CodeWeavers improved support for running 32-bit apps and games on macOS. CrossOver for Mac costs $64, but you can try it for free here.
