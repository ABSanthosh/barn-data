  "text": "Whether you’re a regular video and audio editor or just have occasional needs to do so, you might appreciate using the handy free LosslessCut app, the “swiss army knife of lossless video/audio editing”, which allows for lossless editing and cutting of video and audio files. LosslessCut lets you quickly extract, remove, add, and combine audio and video tracks from both video and audio files, helping you to make quick work of these tasks without having to re-encode the media file, which typically results in losing quality (hence the lossless feature, and namesake). It’s quite fast and uses the command line ffmpeg tool under the hood. Get LosslessCut from Github here for free If you’re unfamiliar with downloading apps from Github, check this out. LosslessCut is available for Mac, which is obviously our focus here, for both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs, but you can also get LosslessCut on a Windows PC or Linux machine if you’re interested in having some cross-platform compatibility or usage. Why does any of this matter? Well, editing lossless video and audio can be essential for modern media workflows, whether you’re a professional, filmmaker, video editor, influencer, producer, broadcaster, hobbyist, or myriad other situations. Lossless editing preserves the original quality of video or audio without introducing compression artifacts, which gains additional importance if you are making multiple edits to the same video or audio, since recompressing lossy media formats will degrade quality over time. So if you’re worried about maintaining pristine quality and fidelity, lossless editing with a tool like LosslessCut ensures that your video and audio will be available for distribution, streaming, archives, publishing, or whatever your needs may be. And yes, you can make many types of video and audio edits and modifications with iMovie, which is also a great app, but iMovie will re-encode the video thereby making it lossy. If you want some ultra fast lossless video editing (or audio editing), LosslessCut is a great solution, so check it out.",
