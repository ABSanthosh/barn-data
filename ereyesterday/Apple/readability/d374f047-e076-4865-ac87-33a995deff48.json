  "description": "Macworld If you’re looking for a basic Apple Watch for calls, notifications, and health tracking, the Apple Watch SE is a fantastic pick, especially when it’s on sale for its best price of the year. Amazon is selling the Apple Watch SE 2 for $170, a massive 32 percent discount and the best price we’ve seen since Black Friday. The 2nd-generation Apple Watch SE is a couple of years old, but it still has a classic design with slim bezels and rounded corners. Under the hood, there’s an S8 SiP processor—the same you can get in the Apple Watch Series 8 and original Apple Watch Ultra, so it’s going to be fast and capable no matter what you want your watch to do. You can get about 18 hours of battery life from a single charge, so it’ll last from morning to night—or through the night for sleep tracking with a quick 1-hour charge. Overall, the Apple Watch SE is a greater starter watch for $80 off that will bring you everything you need without adding tons of pricey bells and whistles. So take advantage of this 32% discount at Amazon while it’s still around. Get yourself a budget-friendly Apple Watch for 32% offBuy now at Amazon",
