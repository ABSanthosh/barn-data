  "text": "Apple allegedly working on game focused App Store Apple is allegedly working on an entirely new App Store-type application made specifically for games, in an effort to make its products more appealing to gamers. Currently, iPhone games can only be downloaded from the existing App Store, or through Apple Arcade, which is the company's subscription-only approach to mobile gaming. Apple's new application is said to combine aspects of the existing App Store and Game Center in one place. Specific details about the alleged application as well as its content, layout, and features were all revealed via a dedicated report. The report from 9to5mac claims Apple's new game-focused app store will feature a \"Play Now\" tab, along with a tab for the user's friends. The \"Play Now\" tab will supposedly contain content hand-picked by the app's editorial staff, while the application will also feature challenges, leaderboards, and achievements. Both Apple Arcade games as well as those from the existing App Store will reportedly be available. FaceTime and iMessage integration are also rumored for this potential app, which would allow users to communicate with each other during games. Developers will be able to use App Clips for game demos. The report credits anonymous people familiar with the matter, and there is no information as to when this rumored app might be released. There is no way to confirm the accuracy of the rumor since the sources cannot be verified, but the move isn't outside the realm of possibility, so it is rated as possible.",
