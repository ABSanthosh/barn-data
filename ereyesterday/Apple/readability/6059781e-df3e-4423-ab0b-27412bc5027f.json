  "text": "The popular encrypted messaging platform Signal announced on Monday some new features coming to its users. With the update, it’s now easier to join group calls using custom links, so read on as we detail what’s new in Signal. Signal brings new features for group calls As announced in a blog post, Signal’s latest update adds a new way for users to join a group call. Previously, users had to create a group chat before starting a group call. Now with the update, users can simply create a link to invite others to join the call. To create a link, simply open the Signal app and look for the links tab. Then tap the button to create a new link. Users can choose a custom name for the link and even require approval before someone joins the call. You can also remove people from calls and optionally block them from the call so they can’t join again. Another cool option is the ability to reuse the same link for future calls, which is useful for weekly meetings, for example. Signal supports group calls with up to 50 people. In addition to these improvements, the update adds some other new features. For example, there is now a raise button during calls so that everyone can see who wants to talk next. Users can also now react with emojis during a call. Moreover, the call controls have been updated to make it easier to turn the camera or microphone on and off. The new features are now being rolled out to Signal users on desktop, iOS, and Android. When it comes to iPhone and iPad, the app is available for free on the App Store. Make sure you have the latest version installed on your device in order to get access to the new features.
