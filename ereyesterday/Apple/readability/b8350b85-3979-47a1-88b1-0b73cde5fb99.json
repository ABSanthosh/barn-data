  "text": "A short while ago, I was browsing Apple deals on Amazon (as one does) – and something stuck out to me. High-end iPad Pros, particularly 12.9-inch models, are surprisingly cheap. I saw M1 models with 1TB and cellular for nearly $600. Given the recent iPadOS 26 overhaul that makes the iPad much more Mac-like, I figured these deals would be worth a share. While renewed iPad deals are the focus here because of their affordability, new iPad deals are also mentioned at the end. Renewed M1 iPad Pro deals Amazon has a fairly robust refurbishment program called “Amazon Renewed”, where it offers a wide variety of used, cleaned, and tested electronics for good prices. There’s also a 90 day return window if you run into any issues. In 2021, Apple introduced its M1 iPad Pro models, with a number of noteworthy upgrades. It brought Thunderbolt to the iPad for the very first time, an all new 12MP front facing ultra-wide camera with Center Stage, 5G connectivity, and on the 12.9-inch models, an all new mini-LED display, which Apple calls “Liquid Retina XDR.” The display offers up to 1600 nits of peak brightness. It was certainly one of the first major iPad Pro overhauls since the 2018 redesign. Now that the iPad is a few years old, there are some remarkable deals available! All models listed are in excellent condition: 12.9-inch iPad Pro (M1) – 2TB/16GB, Wi-Fi + Cellular: $709 on Amazon Renewed 12.9-inch iPad Pro (M1) – 1TB/16GB, Wi-Fi + Cellular: $609 on Amazon Renewed Even if you don’t necessarily need the storage, I highly recommend getting at least a 1TB model, seeing as those come with 16GB of memory baked in, versus the 8GB on the 512GB and lower models. In case you do want to save some additional money, you can also pick up 128GB for $509, 256GB for $539, and 512GB for $605. The deals on 11-inch models aren’t as incredible, but in case you’re interested, here they are: 11-inch iPad Pro (M1) – 1TB/16GB, Wi-Fi Only: $649 on Amazon Renewed 11-inch iPad Pro (M1) – 256GB/8GB, Wi-Fi + Cellular: $529 on Amazon Renewed 11-inch iPad Pro (M1) – 128GB/8GB, Wi-Fi Only: $489 on Amazon Renewed Renewed M2 iPad Pro deals The M2 iPad Pro is fairly similar to the M1 model, with the main differentiator being Apple Pencil hover support. With Apple Pencil hover, you can preview exactly where your Apple Pencil will touch down on the display, allowing for additional precision. Some third-party apps also have special features that work with Apple Pencil hover. M2 iPad Pro also supports the newer Wi-Fi 6E standard. If that feature sounds appealing to you, or if you just want an even newer iPad without breaking the bank, the M2 iPad Pro is a great choice for you: 12.9-inch iPad Pro (M2) – 512GB/8GB, Wi-Fi + Cellular: $739 on Amazon Renewed 12.9-inch iPad Pro (M2) – 256GB/8GB, Wi-Fi Only: $719 on Amazon Renewed Given the minimal pricing differences, I’d recommend springing for higher if possible. There currently aren’t any compelling deals available on 11-inch models with M2. These are all listed in excellent condition, and have an extended 90 day return window in case you run into any issues. If you want a keyboard and trackpad case to go alongside your new 12.9-inch iPad Pro, Logitech Combo Touch is a great pairing at $147. Renewed iPad Air deals While M1 and M2 iPad Pros are the focus here, I thought it’d be worth mentioning Apple’s more recent iPad Air models, which also sport these same chipsets. You do compromise on the display, connectivity, and speakers, but you otherwise can save a fair chunk of change. Unlike the iPad Pros, the iPad Airs come in a variety of colors. Renewed M1 iPad Air deals: iPad Air 10.9-inch (M1) – 256GB/8GB, Wi-Fi + Cellular: $439 on Amazon Renewed iPad Air 10.9-inch (M1) – 256GB/8GB, Wi-Fi Only: $413 on Amazon Renewed iPad Air 10.9-inch (M1) – 64GB/8GB, Wi-Fi + Cellular: $359 on Amazon Renewed At the time of writing, there are no noteworthy deals on renewed M2 iPad Air models. Wrap up I’m certainly impressed at how affordable these renewed iPad models are. It’s easy to get caught up in the latest and greatest, but that does ultimately cost you a fair bit more. With these renewed deals, you can save substantial amounts of money while only being behind one or two generations. To put these deals into context, if you wanted to pick up a new M4 13-inch iPad Pro with 1TB of storage and 16GB of memory, that’d currently run you $1699 on Amazon. Those same specs but on an older M2 model? Just $759. That’s nearly a thousand dollars less, for what’s still an incredibly great iPad model. In case renewed iPads aren’t up your alley, here’s a quick mention of current iPad deals in new condition: M4 13-inch iPad Pro (256GB) – $1099 on Amazon M4 11-inch iPad Pro (256GB) – $899 on Amazon M3 13-inch iPad Air (128GB) – $699 on Amazon M3 11-inch iPad Air (128GB) – $499 on Amazon A16 11-inch iPad (128GB) – $299 on Amazon A17 Pro iPad mini (128GB) – $399 on Amazon What do you think of iPadOS 26?
