  "text": "A new report claims that Apple's expected iPhone SE 4 will remain the lowest-cost model, but its price could rise anywhere up to $500. Previous reports have said that the iPhone SE 4 will remain a sub-$500 device, but now a regular leaker claims that a Japanese news service has confirmed it. \"The information about the shipping price of the Apple iPhone SE 4th generation model has come out again [via a] Japanese news agency channel,\" writes yeux1122 on his or her blog. \"It's a Japanese source with Apple's own chip, etc., 500 dollars or less.\" That reference to Apple's own chip is about how the iPhone SE 4 is rumored to be the first iPhone to use an Apple-designed 5G modem. All 5G iPhones to date have used Qualcomm modems, but Apple has been working to replace the third party's chipset. This new rumor does not specify which Japanese news agency is reporting the price, and we could not immediately find it. Even if it's correct that a news agency has a source, it's likely that this is another case of \"me too\" rumor reporting, as it brings no further detail or confirmation from other recent rumors. The current iPhone SE retails for $429, so Apple has room to increase the price by up to $70 and still be below $500. Whatever price it comes in at, though, it is surely going to be the lowest-cost Apple Intelligence device in Apple's lineup. Apple has of course not said when the iPhone SE 4 will launch, but persistent rumors suggest that it will arrive in early 2025. It's strongly expected to resemble the iPhone 14, including the move from a Home button to Face ID. Leaker yeux1122 is known for \"me too\" rumors, for claiming to have information that other leakers have previously presented. Consequently, yeux1122 has only a middling track record for accuracy.",
