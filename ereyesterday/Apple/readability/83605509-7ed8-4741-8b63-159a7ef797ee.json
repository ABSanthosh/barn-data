  "text": "The SwitchBot Hub 3 is officially certified as ‘Works with Apple Home‘. It’s the company’s first Hub/bridge device to earn Apple’s smart home badge, which allows for easier control of SwitchBot devices inside the Home app and HomeKit. For users deep in the Homekit ecosystem, it means hacks/workarounds. You can now bring your SwitchBot gear into the Home app and let it run like any other HomeKit-native device. Alongside the new certification from Apple, SwitchBot is also rolling out a new feature called Smart Schedule. The goal is to make automation easier without needing to create complex routines. With Smart Schedule, you can set up simple on/off times for devices right inside the SwitchBot app. It’s designed Smart Schedule works alongside the SwitchBot Hub 3’s Matter support and its built-in sensors, so it’s not operating in a silo from HomeKit. This update is similar to how other platforms like Aqara build functionality into their own apps that Matter can’t yet do, and it runs alongside it. Wrap up SwitchBot is an extremely versatile platform/ecosystem, and it’s great to see them leaning into HomeKit and Matter. The company continues to build some really interesting products, and now that Apple has made it easier to bring accessories into the Home app through Matter, it’s a win for customers. I really underestimated how critical Matter would be for HomeKit adoption from vendors. You can buy the SwitchBot Hub 3 from Amazon.
