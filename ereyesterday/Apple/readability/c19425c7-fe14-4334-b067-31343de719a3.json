  "text": "The season two finale of Severance is almost here, and amidst the huge success that the show has become, Google has added a fun easter egg to make Severance fans smile. Severance easter egg on Google As noted by Ben Stiller, director of the show, Google now shows a bunch of blue balloons floating on the screen when you search for “Severance.” This, of course, is a reference to the blue Lumon balloons that Mr. Milchick gives Mark S. when the employee returns to the office. The balloons are seen in other scenes in the first episode of the second season. If you want to see the balloons yourself, all you have to do is open Google on your computer or mobile device and search for “Severance.” Tap the confetti button to show the balloon animation on the screen. Ahead of the premiere of the second season in January, Apple has launched a webpage where you can take or upload a photo to put your own face on one of Lumon’s blue balloons. The company also promoted the show with images of the balloons on the Apple.com homepage. According to Apple, Severance has broken all Apple TV+ records and is now the most popular show ever on the platform, even overtaking Ted Lasso – previously Apple’s most popular show. The company also said that the second season premiere of Severance pushed Apple TV+ subscription growth in January compared to the previous month. For those unfamiliar, Severance is a sci-fi show in which employees of a company agree to participate in a program to separate their workplace memories from their personal memories. The last episode of Severance’s second season will air next Thursday night on Apple TV+. Although the show has not yet been renewed for a third season, Ben Stiller has suggested that the show’s writers are already working on a third sequel. And, of course, please try to enjoy each search result equally.
