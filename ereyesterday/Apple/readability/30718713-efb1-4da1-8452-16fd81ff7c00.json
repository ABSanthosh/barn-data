  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. If you’re trying to find an ideal spot outdoors, whether that be a coffee shop, bar, or restaurant – but want to know whether or not it’ll be in the sun or shade, Coffee in the Sun is the premier app for you. It’s a vibe coded app, but it certainly works well – and the developer put an adequate amount of effort into crafting it. Top features The name is rather self explanatory, but nonetheless: Coffee in the Sun provides a real time map with sun and shade data, helping you find your ideal location. It calculates shade based on sun location and building height, and even allows you to skip forward a few hours in case you want to see how things will play out later in the day. Coffee in the Sun works worldwide, and is localized in 34 languages. It’s a great app to utilize, especially if you’re traveling to a brand new place. There’s tons of locations on the app, so you’ll never be short of options. Coffee shops, bars, and restaurants aren’t the only option for filtering. There’s also ice cream parlors, food courts, pubs, and fast food locations. As I implied, you can filter through all of the options, so if you only wanted to see ice cream spots, for example – you could do that. It’s essentially a maps app with weather and shade data added on top of it, but Coffee in the Sun solves a much needed problem of going somewhere on a hot day and ending up stuck in the sun. Download the app Coffee in the Sun is available on the App Store as a one time purchase, for just $1.99. There are no ads, tracking, or further subscriptions required. You’ll need an iPhone or iPad running iOS 17.0 or later.
