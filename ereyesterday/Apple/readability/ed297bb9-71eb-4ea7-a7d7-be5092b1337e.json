  "text": "Apple today provided developers with the fourth betas of iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 for testing purposes, with the updates coming two weeks after Apple seeded the third betas. Registered developers can download the new beta software using the Software Update section of the Settings app. ‌iOS 26‌ and ‌iPadOS 26‌ feature Apple's new Liquid Glass design aesthetic, with a focus on translucency and glass-like interface elements. The design extends to the Lock Screen, Home Screen, and Control Center, along with menus and buttons in apps. Apple's software includes features for apps like Messages, Phone, Shortcuts, and Apple Music, along with new Apple Intelligence features, a revamp for CarPlay, and more. In ‌iPadOS 26‌, there's a whole new multitasking system that supports multiple app windows for a more Mac-like experience. For more on the features in ‌iOS 26‌, we have a dedicated iOS 26 roundup and a separate iPadOS 26 roundup. Several new features were found in beta 2 and we rounded them up, plus we did the same thing for beta 3. Popular StoriesiOS 26 Public Beta Expected This Week as First iOS 27 Rumor SurfacesThe first iOS 26 public beta should arrive this week, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. \"All indications are that iOS 26 should go into the public beta phase this coming week,\" said Gurman, in his Power On newsletter today.

Instead, it was buried on Apple's developer website. iPhone users will be able to...iPhone 17 Series Is Less Than Two Months Away: Everything We KnowApple is expected to hold its annual iPhone announcement event during the week of September 8, 2025, with September 9 or 10 emerging as the most likely dates.

The ‌Plus device is being replaced with an all-new ultra-thin model, while the iPhone 17 Pro and ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max are set to...Apple Sues Jon Prosser Over iOS 26 LeaksThursday July 17, 2025 8:40 pm PDT by Eric SlivkaEarlier this year, YouTuber Jon Prosser shared multiple videos showing off what he claimed to be re-created renderings of what was then presumed to be called iOS 19 and which was eventually unveiled by Apple as iOS 26 at WWDC in June. In his first video back in January, Prosser showed off a Camera app redesign with a simpler set of buttons for moving between photo and video modes, and he...Apple Says These Automakers Will Offer CarPlay UltraA few months ago, Apple announced the launch of CarPlay Ultra, the long-awaited next-generation version of CarPlay. CarPlay Ultra is currently limited to newer Aston Martin vehicles in the U.S. and Canada. Fortunately, if you cannot afford a $250,000 luxury vehicle, the software system will eventually be available in more affordable vehicles. Apple said \"many\" other automakers around...New iPad Pro Expected This Year With M5 Chip and Two Front CamerasApple's next-generation iPad Pro models will be equipped with two front-facing cameras, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. In his Power On newsletter today, Gurman said the upcoming iPad Pro models with the M5 chip will have both portrait and landscape cameras, letting you capture photos and go on video calls without having to worry about the device's orientation. The current iPad Pro...Top Stories: iPhone 17 Colors, iOS 26 Public Beta Incoming, and MoreWe're less than two months away from the official unveiling of the iPhone 17 family, and it seems like things are starting to firm up about just which color options we might see across the four models in the lineup.
