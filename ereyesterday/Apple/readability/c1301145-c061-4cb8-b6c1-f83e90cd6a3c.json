Photo: Navee I’m having so much fun riding the Navee ST3 Pro Electric Scooter. It’s powerful enough to be exhilarating, while also being a practical way to get around. Honestly, I haven’t been as stoked about a product since I got the first iPad. That’s why I’m happy to say that Navee is having a special promo deal that knocks $290 off the e-scooter when you buy it straight from the manufacturer. That’s 30% off.  Or you can get it from Amazon at 28% off. If you want one, now is a great time to buy. A brilliant e-scooter Fun and functional Navee ST3 Pro 5.0 This electric scooter for adults delivers unmatched performance and reliability. It’s perfect for your daily commute, weekend adventures, or even a quick trip across campus or town. Pros:Powerful, with many miles of rangeWell builtApple Find My tech built in It’s been a very long time since I was excited to drive my car. I have a classic sports car that I love, but after decades of driving, getting around in it is very routine. Riding the Navee ST3 Pro is the opposite of routine. Without a ton of metal wrapped around me, I feel like I’m flying, even at relatively slow speeds. Rather than driving the car on the same streets I’ve been over hundreds of times, I’m planning out routes on my iPhone, zooming down sidewalks on the scooter, or ducking into neighborhoods looking for shortcuts. I live in the suburbs about halfway between two large shopping areas. These are too far to walk to, but are just right for the scooter. For example, I needed to pick up a couple of items in the grocery store. This could have been just another boring trip in the car, but I took the Navee ST3 Pro instead, so just getting to the store was fun. No doubt a big part of the thrill is that riding a scooter is slightly dangerous. I have to constantly watch the road for potholes, and sidewalks are full of hazards. Being careful not to get run over by inattentive drivers is equally important. I’m enjoying the extra excitement with a hint of danger. Maybe your life has also gotten tediously safe, like mine had. Taking a scooter to the store isn’t sailing solo around the world, but it’s not boringly safe, either. Read my in-depth review to learn more about why I absolutely love this thing. Navee ST3 Pro Electric Scooter deal: Save 30% The Navee ST3 Pro is a top-of-the-line electric scooter. Its 1350W motor offers plenty of power, a big battery means many miles on a single charge, and damping arms on the wheels make the ride comfortable. It even has support for Apple’s Find My tracking system. But all these features push up the price — it’s ordinarily $949.99. But you can save $190 when buying the e-scooter on naveetech.us, and then apply a $100-off discount code (use “ST3PRO100”) to lower the cost way down to $660. Buy it now at a deal from: Navee Or Amazon also offers $190 off the regular cost, then a further 10% discount (hit the check box!) drops the total price to $684. Buy it at a discount from: Amazon Fun and functional Navee ST3 Pro 5.0 This electric scooter for adults delivers unmatched performance and reliability.
