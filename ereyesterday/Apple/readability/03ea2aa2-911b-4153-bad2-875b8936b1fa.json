Cult of Mac may earn a commission when you use our links to buy items. GameSir X3 Pro mobile controller brings plenty of features to iPhone gaming The range of AAA games available for recent iPhone models is growing, including multiple titles in the Resident Evil franchise. But on-screen controls are far from ideal when playing advanced RPGs and FPSs. A clip-on game controller like this one from GameSir provides a much more familiar gaming experience. Designed to be portable, the X3 Pro nevertheless uses the familiar layout of game controllers. And it includes features many mobile controllers don’t, such as a built-in 6-axis gyroscope plus detachable and replaceable stick caps, D-pad, face button caps and grips. A highlight is the 900mm² cooling plate, part of a system powered by advanced Peltier technology that delivers a maximum cooling power of 12W. It’s for really graphics-intensive games that can — unfortunately — heat up your iPhone. And some Androids get crazy hot. Heat is bad for the long-term health of your handset’s battery, The accessory fits the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 series, as well as a range of Androids. Relatively small when being carried around, the telescoping design allows it to fit even the largest iOS handset.  Removable grips make it more portable. Grab one today The GameSir X3 Pro Mobile Gaming Controller launched Wednesday. It sells for $79.99/£79.99. Buy it from: Amazon, Amazon UK or the GameSir website As an alternative, check the Cult of Mac review of the GameSir X2s Type-C Mobile Controller, which uses a similar design but doesn’t include all the advanced features and costs quite a bit less.",
