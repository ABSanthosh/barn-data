  "text": "If you’re looking for a way to stream the 2025 Super Bowl in 4K for free, Tubi will be showing the entire event – including Kendrick Lamar’s halftime show. The Tubi app is available for iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and Vision Pro, as well as on the web. FOX Sports says that it will be doing a special takeover of Tubi for the game, with no sign-in required … The company said that coverage will also include the pregame show. As part of the network’s extensive coverage, this year marks the first time FOX Sports rolls out its special takeover of Tubi for The Big Game – inclusive of streaming FOX’s telecast of the Super Bowl on the platform live in 4K. Super Bowl LIX is available to watch on FOX, FOX Deportes, Tubi, Telemundo and across NFL digital properties with unauthenticated access across devices. Featured content is set to include FOX’s SUPER BOWL LIX PREGAME SHOW, Super Bowl LIX and a first-of-its-kind live pre-show titled the TUBI RED CARPET AT SUPER BOWL LIX. Hosted by Olivia Culpo, the TUBI RED CARPET AT SUPER BOWL LIX, which starts at 3:30pm ET, covers the celebrity, fashion and culture behind America’s biggest sports event live from Caesars Superdome. Fans can get ready for the game by tuning into the NFL Channel on Tubi to catch its Countdown to the Super Bowl starting Jan. 28, with historical Super Bowls, iconic halftime shows, best of NFL Honors, NFL analysis and more. FOX says that full details of its programming and on-screen line-up will be revealed nearer the time.
