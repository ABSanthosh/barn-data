  "description": "Macworld A good MacBook bag shares many qualities with Apple’s laptops. We want it to be tough, so it needs to be made from good materials. We want to use it for multiple tasks, so it needs to have plenty of pockets and compartments. Let’s admit it, with the diminishing number of ports on the MacBook, the bags often have the edge. And since we all admire good design here, we certainly don’t mind if the bag looks fantastic. Plus, whatever MacBook you’ve got, Air or Pro, you’ve probably spent enough on it that you don’t want to risk it breaking—and don’t mind spending just a little more to keep it safe. There’s no shortage of companies out there that make protective accessories for MacBooks, from laptop bags and rucksacks to sleeves, covers, and cases that clip on directly, and plenty of them do their best to be just as stylish as the Mac they’re protecting. We’ve rounded up a selection of our favorite cases, sleeves, backpacks, roll-tops, shells and totes for the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, whether you have a 13-, 14-, 15- or 16-inch model, to keep your Mac safe. All of the bags below fit those criteria, but we’ve been careful to choose bags that meet specific needs. Keep in mind that every bag here won’t fit every MacBook, but if a bag can’t handle the 16-inch MacBook Pro, we’ve been sure to make a note of it.

The shoulder strap is easy to adjust and has a non-slip pad to make it more comfortable. With a subtle luggage trolley sleeve, it can slip onto the telescopic handle of a suitcase for easy of use when not on your back—handy for busy travel interchanges and crowded trains and buses. It’s well-made, with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) coated webbing handles with rivets, reverse coil zippers, and water-repellent C6DWR coating applied to the fabric. Inside there are plenty of sections and pockets (we counted 10 but there could be even more hidden away) to help with organization. Cable-routing means you can charge your laptop or other devices while still in the bag. if you fancy something more business-like check out the Troubadour Apex Briefcase, reviewed further down, which is smarter but costs a fair amount more than the STM Myth.

And, like Apple’s products, the Troubadour Apex 3.0 comes with a premium price tag attached. You do get your money’s worth, with chic styling and a generous selection of storage pockets, including one for your iPhone hidden in one of the straps, which means you can access it—or other valuable item such as your wallet—without having to remove the bag from your shoulders.

Pakt Travel Backpack 2.0 – Best MacBook travel backpack Pros Premium build Plenty of storage Smart organizer sections Multiple carry options AirTag pocket Sustainable materials Price When Reviewed: From $325 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Pakt $325 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $325 at Pakt Fits: up to 16-inch We haven’t found a laptop backpack that beats the Pakt Travel Backpack for storage smarts, comfort and versatility. There are many imitators but this remains our favorite, and there’s a recent version 2.0 that makes it even better and more environmentally friendly. The 35L backpack model meets the carry-on criteria for most airlines. It weighs 4.1lbs, and measures 21.5 x 12.5 x 8 inches (55 x 32 x 21 cm). The 45L backpack, however, exceeds those limits so you’ll have to pray that you’re not pulled aside as you check-in or board the plane. It weighs 4.4lbs, and is sized 23 x 13 x 9 inches (60 x 33 x 24 cm). You can use it as a backpack, but also hide away the straps and carry by the side handles as a duffle or via a top handle. This might make the 45L bag appears smaller than it looks strapped to your back, and you can get it through check-in with all that extra storage. An expansion pocket adds additional packing space without adding to these dimensions. Check your favorite airline for carry-on limits. It features a handy clamshell interior with two compartments, so you can pack the backpack like a suitcase. Spread out open, it should fit under a bed or couch, saving you from unpacking to a wardrobe for short stays. Between the compartments, a padded sleeve gives robust but luxury protection to your MacBook (up to 16 inches). You can access the laptop from the top, making a security check much less hassle. There’s a multi-section front admin pocket that will handle a bunch of tech gear you might need close to hand, such as AirPods, chargers, power banks and cables, or even an iPad. There’s also a key leash in this part. Pakt sells a 15L Everyday Bag that can fit inside the Travel Backpack. On the plane, you could remove this and store by your feet for easy access, and then slide it back in the pack when you take that out of the overhead when you disembark. There are so many great extra features: the water-bottle holder is generous in size yet a tight elasticated hold; a zipped, hidden pocket at the back and bottom of the pack is handy for placing your phone, wallet and pocket fodder when you are passing through airport security; one of the pocket sections includes a deep AirTag holder; you can pull out hidden accessory straps on one side; and there’s roller-luggage passthrough to give your back a rest. With this version 2.0 of its Travel Backpack, Pakt uses rNylon (recycled nylon), which it claims can be recycled indefinitely—making it a more sustainable material than even rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate). It is covered in a water-repelling, tear-resistant PFC-free DWR coating, and is available in either Black, Forest or Ocean colors. Stubble \u0026 Co The Roll Top 20L – Best MacBook roll-top backpack Pros Premium look and feel Plenty of accessible pockets Striking range of colors Price When Reviewed: $170 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Stubble \u0026 Co $170 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $170 at Stubble \u0026 Co Fits: 13-inch (15L bag) and 13-16-inch (20L) versions A roll top bag is simple to use as they have fewer straps and zips than a traditional backpack. They feature a wide top opening so you can quickly see what’s inside and make it easier to reach in and pull out your belongings. It is adjustable in volume as unused space can saved and bulking reduced by rolling up the top flap as you close it. Tighten the strap to condense the loa or loosen when more space is required. Previously we have championed the Ogio Alpha Convoy 525r Rolltop Backpack, which I have used happily for several years. However, our heads and minds have been turned by Stubble \u0026 Co’s The Roll Top, available in either 15L or 20L capacities. We tested the spacier 20L model. Its more waterproof than the Ogio and has smarter colour accents as well as eight overall color options: Black, Yellow, Urban Green, Arctic White, Tasmin Blue, Concrete, Sand and Ember Orange. The padded laptop compartment is easily accessed at the side of the bag. The 20L version fits up to a 16-inch MacBook; the 15L allows for a 13-inch laptop. Inside the laptop compartment and also lining inside the main bag are contrasting colours: inside the black, white, concrete and green bags, it’s a striking orange. The main compartment has a reinforced, magnetised roll top closure. I’m used to a more click-tight buckle fastening but am getting the hang of the G-hook fastener. There are five internal organiser pockets, including two with mesh. On each side are generous elasticated side pockets for your water bottle, umbrella or bike lock. And, an essential if carrying the bag off your back, there’s a top grab handle. Roll-tops are often used by cycle couriers for their fast, easy access, and the Stubble \u0026 Co Roll Top features a bike light anchor and reflective trim for enhanced visibility and road safety.

Harber London Rugged Laptop Briefcase – Luxury MacBook briefcase Pros Can hold MacBook and iPad Pockets for tech organization Premium build Made from 100% Recycled Plastic Bottles Handle and detachable shoulder strap Cons Expensive Price When Reviewed: $545 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Harber London $545 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $545 at Harber London Fits: up to 16-inch If carrying a briefcase just reminds you of your schooldays or executives on Mad Men, think again as today’s stylish briefcases are less boxy and make a far better impression than dropping a boring backpack on the boardroom floor. While this smart and stylish, without being too formal, laptop briefcase is called Rugged, its looks and build quality are at the luxury end of the laptop bag scale—and it’s priced accordingly, although it’s not over the top for a premium business briefcase that’s handmade by expert craftsmen in Spain. And, yes, it is rugged with a water-resistant outer fabric shell made of recycled plastic bottles, so environmentally friendly too. That said, we wouldn’t take this laptop briefcase out hiking in the woods—it’s just too lovely to dump in some mud outside your tent. Available in two sizes—5.6L capacity for 13/14-inch and 7.5L for 15/16-inch laptops, it can hold a MacBook and a large iPad in its padded laptop and tablet compartments. It’s got special pockets for notebooks and your passport, as well as two clever detachable magnetic pouches for your chargers or other tech essentials. There are nine interior sections, holders for pens, and a row of card slots, as well as a dedicated integrated AirTag pocket. It can be carried by its full-grain cowhide leather handle or the detachable leather carry strap, and is available in Mocha, Black or Olive.

Mujjo Envoy Laptop Sleeve – Smart sleeve with storage Pros Premium look and feel Accessory pockets In-sleeve charging Cons No sealed pockets Price When Reviewed: $76 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Mujjo $76 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $76 at Mujjo Fits: 14-inch, 16-inch Made from top-quality waterproof vegan leather, the Envoy Laptop Sleeve from Dutch design brand Mujjo offers portable storage not just for the MacBook but your favored accessories, too. There are tight outside pockets to store your charger and cables plus phone and other essentials.

The Mujjo Envoy is available in Black or Blue and for both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, although 13-inch and 15-inch MacBooks are comfortably (if slightly loosely) held, too. Harber London Nomad Organiser – Best Premium Organizer for MacBook Pros Pockets for tech organization Premium luxury leather looks Can hold MacBook and iPad Handle and detachable shoulder strap Cons Bulks up quickly if over-stuffed Expensive Price When Reviewed: $404 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Harber London $404 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $404 at Harber London Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch While a laptop seems like a self-contained unit, with keboard, screen, trackpad, hard drive and everything all in one tidy package, it’s not quite as easy as that. You need a charger and charging cable for starters, and when you’re on the move you have to carry around your AirPods, and maybe you prefer a proper mouse to the MacBook’s trackpad. And what if you have an iPad to work on, too? A simple sleeve can’t cope with all that lot, but the Nomad Organiser, from luxury bag maker Harber London, certainly can. The Nomad has ten pockets: a padded one for your MacBook Pro, and another padded pocket that fits an iPad from 9.7 to 12.9 inches, and capacious enough to handle the tablet with a Smart Cover. Be warned, though, that holding both laptop and tablet, the sleeve can be tricky to close if you are stuffing in chargers and other tech too. One lower pocket is big enough for your MacBook charger, but you’ll notice a bump in the fine lines when closed. I prefer to keep my bulky stuff in a wider-opening bag—check out our favorite tech organizer bags—and use this sleeve for the thinner essentials. Two pockets are zipped for safe-keeping (for example, cash or memory cards) and there’s a handy key fob strap. There’s a couple of holders for pens or an Apple Pencil. There’s a phone pocket, too, but I’m not sure I’d want all my devices in one place, and most of us prefer our phone at hand in a pocket or more-easy-to-dip-in bag. If you do, it’s large enough for a Pro Max iPhone. Below that pocket are a couple of slots for credit or travel cards, and above it are five straps that will hold an AirPods case, cables and even an AirTag—after, all, at this price, even the sleeve on its own is definitely worth keeping tabs on at all times. I’d have preferred elasticated straps for a firmer hold but I can appreciate the all-leather design looks super lush. You can carry the Nomad Organiser under your arm, via a subtle built-in handle, or you can attach a matching strap to sling it over your shoulder like a messenger bag. It is a premium MacBook sleeve, handcrafted with full-grain Spanish leather, and really does shout cool luxury. Available in Tan, Dark Brown, Black and Navy. Leather Sleeve from Manuel Dreesman – Quality, luxury leather MacBook sleeve Pros Good quality and unique Cons Gaps at the bottom make it less waterproof Expensive Price When Reviewed: $197 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Manuel Dreesman $197 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $197 at Manuel Dreesman Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch, 16-inch The Leather Sleeve from Manuel Dreesman isn’t cheap at $197/£153/€175, but you get luxury MacBook protection. It’s a slim leather sleeve that the MacBook slots into. I tried the 13-inch MacBook Air version, but there’s a sleeve for every current MacBook size, and the company says they can make a sleeve for any laptop. Manuel Dreesman is an independent atelier of handcrafted leather products, based in Barcelona, Spain. It ships all over the world. Sliding it in at first was a bit tight, but it got easier over time, leather being one of those materials that gets softer with use. The gaps at the bottom of the case, which probably make it easier to slide it in and out, stop it from being as waterproof or as protective as it might otherwise be. The sleeve comes in a range vegetable-tanned leather colors. We tested the tan version, but there’s also black, cream, red, green, blue, orange, light blue and light green on offer.  Leather is a good choice for a case like this, but it’s an expensive choice. Manuel Dreesmann claims that it sources the leather locally and that it is fine grain, which means it’s top quality. It makes the cases in its workshop in Barcelona using traditional techniques and ships all over the world.  Read our full Manuel Dreesmann Leather Case review Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve Pros Premium look and feel Accessory pockets Wool felt interior Cons No sealed pockets Price When Reviewed: $98 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $84.13 View Deal Harber London $98 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $84.13 at Amazon$98 at Harber London Fits: 11-inch, 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch Similar to the Mujjo Envoy Laptop Sleeve, reviewed above, the Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve is made from premium full grain leather and features outside pockets to store your charger and cables.

We recommend getting a well padded backpack that is designed for carrying a laptop. A well designed backpack will include lots of areas insider the bag to store things in: such as a front pocket, a large main compartment and a large side pocket.

  "text": "Image: Foundry A good MacBook bag shares many qualities with Apple’s laptops. We want it to be tough, so it needs to be made from good materials. We want to use it for multiple tasks, so it needs to have plenty of pockets and compartments. Let’s admit it, with the diminishing number of ports on the MacBook, the bags often have the edge. And since we all admire good design here, we certainly don’t mind if the bag looks fantastic. Plus, whatever MacBook you’ve got, Air or Pro, you’ve probably spent enough on it that you don’t want to risk it breaking—and don’t mind spending just a little more to keep it safe. There’s no shortage of companies out there that make protective accessories for MacBooks, from laptop bags and rucksacks to sleeves, covers, and cases that clip on directly, and plenty of them do their best to be just as stylish as the Mac they’re protecting. We’ve rounded up a selection of our favorite cases, sleeves, backpacks, roll-tops, shells and totes for the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, whether you have a 13-, 14-, 15- or 16-inch model, to keep your Mac safe. All of the bags below fit those criteria, but we’ve been careful to choose bags that meet specific needs. Keep in mind that every bag here won’t fit every MacBook, but if a bag can’t handle the 16-inch MacBook Pro, we’ve been sure to make a note of it. Bellroy Laptop Sleeve – Best MacBook sleeve Pros Premium feel Magnetic closure Colors Fits: 13-14-inch and 15-16-inch versions Bellroy is a Australian accessory brand that makes premium bags, cases and wallets, and its laptop sleeves offer high-quality protection. Outside, the woven, water-resistant material is eco-friendly—made from 100% recycled PET bottles. Inside, the quilted microfiber lining features a soft ridge that holds your laptop in place. The sleeve snaps shut with a neat magnetic bumper. Available in Black, Slate, Navy, Bronze and a leather-free Saltbush. Bellroy Apple sells only one MacBook sleeve in its online store: the leather-free Bellroy Caddy for Mac Laptops, which is available in two sizes for 13-14-inch MacBooks and the 15- and 16-inch MacBooks. There’s fold-down, front-pocket access and a foam-padded laptop sleeve, as well as two stretch mesh pockets and mesh pen slips. Case Logic Laptop Sleeve – Best budget MacBook sleeve Pros Tight fit Padded Color range Price When Reviewed: $31.99 Fits: 13-inch Case Logic makes many laptop sleeves that are suitable for various sizes of MacBook and come in all number of colors. The Case Logic Laptop Sleeve fits a 13.3in MacBook, such as the M1 MacBook Air or M2 MacBook Pro. It’s form-fitting, so the MacBook shouldn’t slip about inside, and it features padding for extra protection. There is woven webbing along the sides to further protect the laptop and strengthen the case. It’s a slim case that should fit nicely inside your bag.  Available in a range of strong colors, including Pink, Dark Blue, Lime Green and Teal.

As well as protecting your laptop during travel, it includes two wireless chargers (one MagSafe compatible) and can work as both a deskpad and mousepad to free your workspace of clutter. Slide your MacBook into the soft but padded-for-protection vegan leather sleeve, and you’ll be impressed by the luxury feel of this premium laptop sleeve. When you arrive at the office, hotel or just back home, it doubles up as a deskpad with chargers for your iPhone (7.5W MagSafe) and AirPods (5W). While it comes with a USB-C cable, you’ll need to add your own charger (check our roundup of the best iPhone chargers) to connect with the USB-C port in the sleeve. Alternatively you can charge the MacBook itself while it sits protected in the sleeve—for this you’ll need a more powerful MacBook charger. The Journey NEXA 4-in1 Laptop Sleeve is available in Black or a fetching stone-like Dove Gray. Read our full Journey NEXA 4-in-1 Laptop Sleeve with Wireless Charging review STM Myth Laptop Brief – Best MacBook shoulder bag Pros Slim 7L storage bag with pockets Handle and detachable shoulder strap Price When Reviewed: $79.95 Fits: up to 14-inch STM’s Myth laptop bag will fit up to 14-inch MacBooks, although it officially stated up to 13-inch laptops. It comes in Black, Granite Black, and Slate Blue depending. The slim shoulder bag protects your laptop by suspending it, so that it doesn’t touch the bottom of the bag. It’s also encased in foam. The shoulder strap is easy to adjust and has a non-slip pad to make it more comfortable. With a subtle luggage trolley sleeve, it can slip onto the telescopic handle of a suitcase for easy of use when not on your back—handy for busy travel interchanges and crowded trains and buses. It’s well-made, with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) coated webbing handles with rivets, reverse coil zippers, and water-repellent C6DWR coating applied to the fabric. Inside there are plenty of sections and pockets (we counted 10 but there could be even more hidden away) to help with organization. Cable-routing means you can charge your laptop or other devices while still in the bag. if you fancy something more business-like check out the Troubadour Apex Briefcase, reviewed further down, which is smarter but costs a fair amount more than the STM Myth.

Troubadour Apex 3.0 Backpack – Best premium MacBook backpack Pros Super stylish Plenty of storage Smart organizer sections Hidden iPhone pocket AirTag pocket Price When Reviewed: $245 Fits: up to 17-inch Apple builds its MacBooks to a high spec and premium design, so if you are carrying yours around in a backpack maybe that should also be top-notch, too. And, like Apple’s products, the Troubadour Apex 3.0 comes with a premium price tag attached. You do get your money’s worth, with chic styling and a generous selection of storage pockets, including one for your iPhone hidden in one of the straps, which means you can access it—or other valuable item such as your wallet—without having to remove the bag from your shoulders. And there’s even a special pocket for an Apple AirTag. The laptop section is at the back and easy to access, with easily enough space for a 16-inch MacBook Pro. Altogether there are 14 sections or pockets, pen holders and zipped enclosures. It features a trolley sleeve on the back to attach to a suitcase handle, and a robust handle at the top for when you want to give your shoulders a rest or not bump into people in crowded spaces.

Further down we review the Apex Tote and Apex Briefcase for flexibility in the. smart range. Full Troubadour Apex 3.0 Backpack review. Pakt Travel Backpack 2.0 – Best MacBook travel backpack Pros Premium build Plenty of storage Smart organizer sections Multiple carry options AirTag pocket Sustainable materials Price When Reviewed: From $325 Fits: up to 16-inch We haven’t found a laptop backpack that beats the Pakt Travel Backpack for storage smarts, comfort and versatility. There are many imitators but this remains our favorite, and there’s a recent version 2.0 that makes it even better and more environmentally friendly. The 35L backpack model meets the carry-on criteria for most airlines. It weighs 4.1lbs, and measures 21.5 x 12.5 x 8 inches (55 x 32 x 21 cm). The 45L backpack, however, exceeds those limits so you’ll have to pray that you’re not pulled aside as you check-in or board the plane. It weighs 4.4lbs, and is sized 23 x 13 x 9 inches (60 x 33 x 24 cm). You can use it as a backpack, but also hide away the straps and carry by the side handles as a duffle or via a top handle. This might make the 45L bag appears smaller than it looks strapped to your back, and you can get it through check-in with all that extra storage. An expansion pocket adds additional packing space without adding to these dimensions. Check your favorite airline for carry-on limits. It features a handy clamshell interior with two compartments, so you can pack the backpack like a suitcase. Spread out open, it should fit under a bed or couch, saving you from unpacking to a wardrobe for short stays. Between the compartments, a padded sleeve gives robust but luxury protection to your MacBook (up to 16 inches). You can access the laptop from the top, making a security check much less hassle. There’s a multi-section front admin pocket that will handle a bunch of tech gear you might need close to hand, such as AirPods, chargers, power banks and cables, or even an iPad. There’s also a key leash in this part. Pakt sells a 15L Everyday Bag that can fit inside the Travel Backpack. On the plane, you could remove this and store by your feet for easy access, and then slide it back in the pack when you take that out of the overhead when you disembark. There are so many great extra features: the water-bottle holder is generous in size yet a tight elasticated hold; a zipped, hidden pocket at the back and bottom of the pack is handy for placing your phone, wallet and pocket fodder when you are passing through airport security; one of the pocket sections includes a deep AirTag holder; you can pull out hidden accessory straps on one side; and there’s roller-luggage passthrough to give your back a rest. With this version 2.0 of its Travel Backpack, Pakt uses rNylon (recycled nylon), which it claims can be recycled indefinitely—making it a more sustainable material than even rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate). It is covered in a water-repelling, tear-resistant PFC-free DWR coating, and is available in either Black, Forest or Ocean colors. Stubble \u0026 Co The Roll Top 20L – Best MacBook roll-top backpack Pros Premium look and feel Plenty of accessible pockets Striking range of colors Price When Reviewed: $170 Fits: 13-inch (15L bag) and 13-16-inch (20L) versions A roll top bag is simple to use as they have fewer straps and zips than a traditional backpack. They feature a wide top opening so you can quickly see what’s inside and make it easier to reach in and pull out your belongings. It is adjustable in volume as unused space can saved and bulking reduced by rolling up the top flap as you close it. Tighten the strap to condense the loa or loosen when more space is required. Previously we have championed the Ogio Alpha Convoy 525r Rolltop Backpack, which I have used happily for several years. However, our heads and minds have been turned by Stubble \u0026 Co’s The Roll Top, available in either 15L or 20L capacities. We tested the spacier 20L model. Its more waterproof than the Ogio and has smarter colour accents as well as eight overall color options: Black, Yellow, Urban Green, Arctic White, Tasmin Blue, Concrete, Sand and Ember Orange. The padded laptop compartment is easily accessed at the side of the bag. The 20L version fits up to a 16-inch MacBook; the 15L allows for a 13-inch laptop. Inside the laptop compartment and also lining inside the main bag are contrasting colours: inside the black, white, concrete and green bags, it’s a striking orange. The main compartment has a reinforced, magnetised roll top closure. I’m used to a more click-tight buckle fastening but am getting the hang of the G-hook fastener. There are five internal organiser pockets, including two with mesh. On each side are generous elasticated side pockets for your water bottle, umbrella or bike lock. And, an essential if carrying the bag off your back, there’s a top grab handle. Roll-tops are often used by cycle couriers for their fast, easy access, and the Stubble \u0026 Co Roll Top features a bike light anchor and reflective trim for enhanced visibility and road safety. Troubadour Apex Briefcase – Best MacBook briefcase Pros Can hold MacBook and iPad Pockets for tech organization Premium build Handle and detachable shoulder strap Price When Reviewed: $245 Fits: up to 16-inch If you desire the convenience of a shoulder or messenger bag with the smartness of a modern briefcase, another part of the stylish if pricey Apex line of laptop bags is the Apex Briefcase—in black only. Made from a fabric that’s spun from recycled plastic bottles, the 15L Apex Briefcase features fluorocarbon-free waterproofing plus a eaterproof, tear-resistant lining. The leather trim is vegan.

There isn’t much “everyday” about the Apex Everyday Tote. It is most definitely a special tote, with zipped inside storage and nine interior mesh, zipped or open pockets and compartment, plus two on the exterior. You can pack a lot of gear in the 16.5L bag, including organized spaces for cables and chargers, power banks and passport. You can keep a water bottle tightly upright inside, and still feel confident that your laptop is safe from spills with the padded laptop pocket boasting a neoprene hood.

Harber London Rugged Laptop Briefcase – Luxury MacBook briefcase Pros Can hold MacBook and iPad Pockets for tech organization Premium build Made from 100% Recycled Plastic Bottles Handle and detachable shoulder strap Price When Reviewed: $545 Fits: up to 16-inch If carrying a briefcase just reminds you of your schooldays or executives on Mad Men, think again as today’s stylish briefcases are less boxy and make a far better impression than dropping a boring backpack on the boardroom floor. While this smart and stylish, without being too formal, laptop briefcase is called Rugged, its looks and build quality are at the luxury end of the laptop bag scale—and it’s priced accordingly, although it’s not over the top for a premium business briefcase that’s handmade by expert craftsmen in Spain. And, yes, it is rugged with a water-resistant outer fabric shell made of recycled plastic bottles, so environmentally friendly too. That said, we wouldn’t take this laptop briefcase out hiking in the woods—it’s just too lovely to dump in some mud outside your tent. Available in two sizes—5.6L capacity for 13/14-inch and 7.5L for 15/16-inch laptops, it can hold a MacBook and a large iPad in its padded laptop and tablet compartments. It’s got special pockets for notebooks and your passport, as well as two clever detachable magnetic pouches for your chargers or other tech essentials. There are nine interior sections, holders for pens, and a row of card slots, as well as a dedicated integrated AirTag pocket. It can be carried by its full-grain cowhide leather handle or the detachable leather carry strap, and is available in Mocha, Black or Olive. Grams (28) Leather Folio – Best luxury sleeve with storage Pros Premium look and feel Neat accessory pockets Price When Reviewed: $229 Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch This super-stylish MacBook sleeve doesn’t just keep your laptop safely protected in transit, it also includes exterior and interior pockets to allow you to ditch the backpack and just look the business carrying a sleek fine Italian leather sleeve. The spacious interior has plenty of room for your MacBook Pro and is padded for extra care. Inside there are two pockets for your phone, a charger, cables, or other accessories such as a paper notebook, plus two pen holders and a card pocket.

Mujjo Envoy Laptop Sleeve – Smart sleeve with storage Pros Premium look and feel Accessory pockets In-sleeve charging Fits: 14-inch, 16-inch Made from top-quality waterproof vegan leather, the Envoy Laptop Sleeve from Dutch design brand Mujjo offers portable storage not just for the MacBook but your favored accessories, too. There are tight outside pockets to store your charger and cables plus phone and other essentials. The laptop is secured by the classy sleeve’s magnetic opening that combines fast access with a firm close. Handily, there’s a generous side opening that allows for easy in-sleeve charging. At the back there’s an easy-access slip pocket for a notebook or passport. You can carry just about anything slim in this sleeve so don’t leave it unattended at the café! The Mujjo Envoy is available in Black or Blue and for both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, although 13-inch and 15-inch MacBooks are comfortably (if slightly loosely) held, too. Harber London Nomad Organiser – Best Premium Organizer for MacBook Pros Pockets for tech organization Premium luxury leather looks Can hold MacBook and iPad Handle and detachable shoulder strap Cons Bulks up quickly if over-stuffed Expensive Price When Reviewed: $404 Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch While a laptop seems like a self-contained unit, with keboard, screen, trackpad, hard drive and everything all in one tidy package, it’s not quite as easy as that. You need a charger and charging cable for starters, and when you’re on the move you have to carry around your AirPods, and maybe you prefer a proper mouse to the MacBook’s trackpad. And what if you have an iPad to work on, too? A simple sleeve can’t cope with all that lot, but the Nomad Organiser, from luxury bag maker Harber London, certainly can. The Nomad has ten pockets: a padded one for your MacBook Pro, and another padded pocket that fits an iPad from 9.7 to 12.9 inches, and capacious enough to handle the tablet with a Smart Cover. Be warned, though, that holding both laptop and tablet, the sleeve can be tricky to close if you are stuffing in chargers and other tech too. One lower pocket is big enough for your MacBook charger, but you’ll notice a bump in the fine lines when closed. I prefer to keep my bulky stuff in a wider-opening bag—check out our favorite tech organizer bags—and use this sleeve for the thinner essentials. Two pockets are zipped for safe-keeping (for example, cash or memory cards) and there’s a handy key fob strap. There’s a couple of holders for pens or an Apple Pencil. There’s a phone pocket, too, but I’m not sure I’d want all my devices in one place, and most of us prefer our phone at hand in a pocket or more-easy-to-dip-in bag. If you do, it’s large enough for a Pro Max iPhone. Below that pocket are a couple of slots for credit or travel cards, and above it are five straps that will hold an AirPods case, cables and even an AirTag—after, all, at this price, even the sleeve on its own is definitely worth keeping tabs on at all times. I’d have preferred elasticated straps for a firmer hold but I can appreciate the all-leather design looks super lush. You can carry the Nomad Organiser under your arm, via a subtle built-in handle, or you can attach a matching strap to sling it over your shoulder like a messenger bag. It is a premium MacBook sleeve, handcrafted with full-grain Spanish leather, and really does shout cool luxury. Available in Tan, Dark Brown, Black and Navy. Leather Sleeve from Manuel Dreesman – Quality, luxury leather MacBook sleeve Pros Good quality and unique Cons Gaps at the bottom make it less waterproof Expensive Price When Reviewed: $197 Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch, 16-inch The Leather Sleeve from Manuel Dreesman isn’t cheap at $197/£153/€175, but you get luxury MacBook protection. It’s a slim leather sleeve that the MacBook slots into. I tried the 13-inch MacBook Air version, but there’s a sleeve for every current MacBook size, and the company says they can make a sleeve for any laptop. Manuel Dreesman is an independent atelier of handcrafted leather products, based in Barcelona, Spain. It ships all over the world. Sliding it in at first was a bit tight, but it got easier over time, leather being one of those materials that gets softer with use. The gaps at the bottom of the case, which probably make it easier to slide it in and out, stop it from being as waterproof or as protective as it might otherwise be. The sleeve comes in a range vegetable-tanned leather colors. We tested the tan version, but there’s also black, cream, red, green, blue, orange, light blue and light green on offer.  Leather is a good choice for a case like this, but it’s an expensive choice. Manuel Dreesmann claims that it sources the leather locally and that it is fine grain, which means it’s top quality. It makes the cases in its workshop in Barcelona using traditional techniques and ships all over the world.  Read our full Manuel Dreesmann Leather Case review Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve Pros Premium look and feel Accessory pockets Wool felt interior Fits: 11-inch, 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch Similar to the Mujjo Envoy Laptop Sleeve, reviewed above, the Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve is made from premium full grain leather and features outside pockets to store your charger and cables. It looks classy and is available in tan or black. There are versions for all recent models of MacBook. It boasts a soft but protective dense 100% wool felt interior that will keep your MacBook cosy. However, there’s no magnetic closure or charging port like you’ll find on the Mujjo sleeve reviewed above. Read our full Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve review Woolnut Leather Sleeve for MacBook – Luxury leather sleeve Pros Premium look and feel In-sleeve charging Cons Lack of pockets Expensive Price When Reviewed: $119 Fits: 12-inch, 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch Available in four deeply stylish colors (Black, Cognac, Green and Gray), the Woolnut Leather Sleeve snugly fits every recent MacBook from the 12-inch original, the Air and all the Pro models. Each size is tailor-made for every model. This minimalist sleeve might lack pockets but it is as luxe as you’ll find and will draw admiring looks and awed strokes from fellow MacBook owners. The exterior is made from full-grain Scandinavian leather, with the interior soft 100% natural wool felt from Germany. Speck SmartShell – Simple, colorful shell Price When Reviewed: $49.95 Fits: 13-inch If you want to protect your laptop while you are using it you can pop a clear or tinted case on it. The Speck SmartShell case comes in various sizes to suit different MacBooks. There’s clear cases as well as a few different colored options, including Cosy Pink, Obsidian and Clear variant for the M2 MacBook Air, so you can pick one to suit your personality. Pros Premium backpack Plenty of pockets Decent 28L capacity Price When Reviewed: $159 Fits: 15-inch If you have an Apple laptop and intend to take it outside the house or office from time to time, it goes without saying that you will need a good sturdy bag to carry it in. We recommend getting a well padded backpack that is designed for carrying a laptop. A well designed backpack will include lots of areas insider the bag to store things in: such as a front pocket, a large main compartment and a large side pocket. Quilted shoulder straps and a padded back should ensure the backpack is comfortable to wear. It’s pricy, but the Timbuk2 Authority Laptop Backpack Deluxe is a good option. Cons Particular about exact MacBook model Price When Reviewed: $79.95 Fits: 13-inch Some shell cases are built to do more than give your MacBook a bit of color. A number of manufacturers build hard shell cases that will add an extra layer of protection to your MacBook Pro or Air. UAG (Urban Armor Gear) makes impact resistant armour for your MacBook. The Plyo series has extra strength built into the cushioning corners and cooling vents to ensure that there is adequate airflow (to stop your laptop from overheating). Make sure you buy the exact shell for your model MacBook. Thule Gauntlet Attaché – Laptop briefcase Pros In-use hard-shell case Detachable shoulder strap Price When Reviewed: $74.95 Fits: 13-inch If you are looking for a smart, tough-looking briefcase style bag with a solid construction, a good option is the Thule Gauntlet attaché. It’s a slim and rugged case with enhanced corner and edge protection. There is a single, removable shoulder strap as well as handles. You don’t even need to remove the Mac from the case to work.   Twelve South SuitCase for MacBook – Hard shell, carry-on fabric hybrid Pros Slim but in-use hard shell Handle Price When Reviewed: From $39.99 Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch, 16-inch Laptop backpack and bags can be bulky, expecting you constantly to be travelling to airports or on trains, when sometimes you just need the convenience of a slim briefcase with the protection of a hard shell. SuitCase from Twelve South is an odd name for what is effectively a briefcase with a recessed handle, but it’s a great hybrid of sleeve, shell and carry on. There are three layers of protection: a water-resistant, quilted gray fabric exterior; underneath the twill textile is a layer of hard plastic to protect your MacBook from impacts; and inside is a soft layer of microfiber to protect the surface of your Mac.

We want it to be tough, so it needs to be made from good materials. We want to use it for multiple tasks, so it needs to have plenty of pockets and compartments. Let’s admit it, with the diminishing number of ports on the MacBook, the bags often have the edge. And since we all admire good design here, we certainly don’t mind if the bag looks fantastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlus, whatever MacBook you’ve got, Air or Pro, you’ve probably spent enough on it that you don’t want to risk it breaking—and don’t mind spending just a little more to keep it safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s no shortage of companies out there that make protective accessories for MacBooks, from laptop bags and rucksacks to sleeves, covers, and cases that clip on directly, and plenty of them do their best to be just as stylish as the Mac they’re protecting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve rounded up a selection of our favorite cases, sleeves, backpacks, roll-tops, shells and totes for the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, whether you have a 13-, 14-, 15- or 16-inch model, to keep your Mac safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the bags below fit those criteria, but we’ve been careful to choose bags that meet specific needs.

It ships all over the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSliding it in at first was a bit tight, but it got easier over time, leather being one of those materials that gets softer with use. The gaps at the bottom of the case, which probably make it easier to slide it in and out, stop it from being as waterproof or as protective as it might otherwise be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe sleeve comes in a range vegetable-tanned leather colors. We tested the tan version, but there’s also black, cream, red, green, blue, orange, light blue and light green on offer. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLeather is a good choice for a case like this, but it’s an expensive choice. Manuel Dreesmann claims that it sources the leather locally and that it is fine grain, which means it’s top quality. It makes the cases in its workshop in Barcelona using traditional techniques and ships all over the world. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2435144/leather-sleeve-from-manuel-dreesman-review.html\" score=\"4\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tManuel Dreesmann Leather Case review \t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ch2 data-p_name=\"Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve\" id=\"harber-london-classic-leather-macbook-sleeve\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHarber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/h2\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cfigure data-wp-context=\"{\u0026#34;uploadedSrc\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https:\\/\\/b2c-contenthub.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2024\\/01\\/Harber-Classic-Leather-MacBook-Sleeve-Tan.jpg?quality=50\\u0026strip=all\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;figureClassNames\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;figureStyles\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;imgClassNames\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;product-chart-item__image\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imgStyles\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;targetWidth\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;none\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;targetHeight\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;none\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;scaleAttr\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;ariaLabel\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Enlarge image: Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;alt\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve\u0026#34;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" width=\"1200\" height=\"814\" alt=\"Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Harber-Classic-Leather-MacBook-Sleeve-Tan.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"1200\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003ePros\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePremium look and feel\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eAccessory pockets\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eWool felt interior\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFits\u003c/strong\u003e: 11-inch, 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar to the Mujjo Envoy Laptop Sleeve, reviewed above, the Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve is made from premium full grain leather and features outside pockets to store your charger and cables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt looks classy and is available in tan or black.
