  "text": "News Maybe an Apple TV+ historical comedy starring Noel Fielding isn’t completely over. Photo: Apple TV+ We might not have seen the last of The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin. Despite the abrupt — and somewhat baffling — departure of star Noel Fielding, the producers of the Apple TV+ comedy series are reportedly trying to convert what was already filmed for season two into a movie of some sort. But that still leaves plenty of people wondering what the heck is going on with Fielding. The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin could return to Apple TV+. Sort of. Apple TV+ historical comedy The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin puts gentle and friendly actor Noel Fielding in the unlikely role of a famous 18th-century English highwayman. The actual Dick Turpin — a poacher, burglar and murderer — was executed in 1739 for stealing horses. Fielding’s portrayal injected some kindness into Turpin’s robbing of travelers. Season one of the series, which premiered last March, did well enough with viewers that Apple TV+ greenlit season two. And all apparently seemed to go well until production took a break for the Christmas holiday. A break Fielding never returned from. This resulted in the cancellation of Dick Turpin season two. But that might not be the end of the story. British tabloid The Sun reported Wednesday that “producers are now trying to use the footage they do have from what would have been a full second series to potentially create an hour-long special.” An unnamed source told The Sun that Dick Turpin’s “creators sank millions into making the show, and it was around 70 to 80 percent filmed by the time the axe fell.” That would seem to give them enough to salvage something. Where is Noel Fielding? The cancellation of The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin is being laid completely at the feet of Fielding. He is reportedly ill, but that’s all anyone knows. A source told The Mirror, “Noel has said that he can’t film anymore, and so there was no choice but to stop.” But whatever unnamed illness is affecting Fielding won‘t stop him from returning to host the next season of The Great British Bake Off, according to his spokesperson. The cast and crew of Dick Turpin are reportedly considering a lawsuit against the producers of the series, including Fielding. They found themselves abruptly unemployed, with months of their work wasted.",
