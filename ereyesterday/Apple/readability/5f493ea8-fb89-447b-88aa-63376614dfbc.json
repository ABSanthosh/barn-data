  "description": "Macworld Apple holds a Back to School promotion every year (now known as the Higher Education Offer to avoid confusion because it’s only open to students once they enter higher education, and the institutions and teachers, not school-age children). As part of the deal, Apple offers an incentive with purchases of qualifying Apple products. Apple’s ‘Back to School’ deal runs in various locations around the world during the summer months. The deal usually ends about a month after the first university semester/term begins in that country. The offer is currently running in Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and South Korea (it went live on 8 January in that region). It will run until March 13, 2025. See the Terms and Conditions. Australian and New Zealand students can get AirPods 4 with ANC or Apple Pencil’s for free when they purchase certain Macs or iPads (more information below). This is different to 2024 when Apple gave away gift cards in Australia and New Zealand. The deal is the same for students in Brazil who can also claim free AirPods with a Mac or free Apple Pencil with their iPad purchase in January-March 2025. However, this is the same offer as those students had in 2024. Does it follow therefore that U.S., Canada and U.K students will also get free AirPods and Apple Pencils in the summer of 2025? AirPods were Apple’s student giveaway of choice a few years ago, but in recent times Apple has given away gift cards in those locations. However, in Europe and India, customers got money off the purchase of AirPods in 2024, so we could be moving back to the incentive of free AirPods and Apple Pencil (both of which are popular with students). Apple Higher Education Offer won’t start in the U.S., U.K., Europe and Canada until later in 2025. In 2024 it kicked off in the U.S., Canada and India in June 2024 and in early July in the U.K. and Europe. Read on to find out when Apple’s Higher Education giveaway will start where you live and what the deal is likely to include. We also explain who qualifies and how to take advantage of Apple’s education deal. What is Apple’s Back To School offer? January-March 2025: AirPods or Apple Pencil in Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and other southern hemisphere locations. June-October 2025: To be confirmed. Previously Apple Gift Cards in U.S., U.K, Canada. AirPods in Europe and India. For a long time, Apple gave away a pair of AirPods with qualifying sales of certain Macs and iPads as part of its education promotion, but in 2022 Apple stopped giving away AirPods in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Australia. Instead, Apple offered gift cards with qualifying purchases during the promotional period. Students could get different gift card denominations depending on the products purchased. Not all Apple products are included in the offer. Apple also offers gift cards during its Black Friday shopping event. With Apple switching back to AirPods in the Australian Back to Uni deal for 2025 it is possible that the company will revert back to AirPods later in 2025 when the same promotion is run in the U.S., U.K. and other northern hemisphere locations. Apple doesn’t offer the same deal everywhere though. In parts of Europe and India, for the summer of 2024, the promotion allows shoppers to get discounted AirPods or Apple Pencil with qualifying purchases. There was a similar deal in January 2024 where those based in Brazil could claim free AirPods with a Mac or free Apple Pencil with their iPad purchase in January-March 2024. So Apple has a precedent of offering gift cards to some countries and AirPods and Pencils in others. This isn’t the only education-related saving Apple offers. Apple doesn’t only offer education-related deals during the summer months. All products sold to students via Apple’s Education Store include a discount all year round, so you can always make a saving on Apple products, as long as you qualify. The summertime education-focused deal is in addition to these year-long discounts Apple offers to students and education institutions. We explain everything you need to know about getting a discount, including how much you can save as a student and how to use Apple’s Education Store, in our Guide to shopping in the Apple Education Store. We also have advice about the Best Mac for Students and the Best iPad for Students. You may also like to read our Apple student buying guide.

Which products are part of Apple’s Education offer? Qualifying purchases for Apple’s deal in January 2025 include: MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, iPad Pro and iPad Air. Qualifying products may differ depending on whether Apple has recently updated them. For example, over Black Friday Apple offers gift cards with select purchases, but its newest products are always left out of the deal. Hence, if Apple has just updated the iPad or Mac you want to buy you may not be able to get the vouchers or other gift alongside your purchase. Qualifying purchases for Apple’s deal in 2024 included: iMac 24‑inch, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac mini, iPad Pro 11- and 13‑inch, iPad Air 11‑ and 13-inch. (In Australia in early 2024 the iPad 10th generation was included, but this wasn’t the case later in 2024). In summer 2023 qualifying purchases included: iMac 24‑inch, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac mini, iPad Pro 12.9‑inch, iPad Pro 11‑inch, and iPad Air. Students can also take advantage of a reduced subscription to Apple Music with which they get access to Apple TV+ when they buy an Apple product. Read: How to get the student deal for Apple Music and free Apple TV+. How to get Apple’s Back To School deal As long as you are based in an area where Apple is running the deal at the time of your purchase, and are a student in higher education, or about to start higher education, you can qualify for Apple’s Higher Education deal and get gift cards with your purchase. There are more details about who the deal applies to below. Note that if you qualify you are able to get discounts all year round by shopping in the Apple Education Store, so you don’t need to shop during the Back to Uni deal period to get a bargain. You can also get discounts on other products not included in the offer (although there is no education discount for the iPhone). In the U.S. you need to visit Apple’s U.S. Education Store, but logging on from your university network may make the process easier.  In the U.K. you can visit the U.K. Education Store, but you will also need to verify your student or staff status with UNiDAYS. Go to the Apple Education Store for other regions using the links below: Canada Australia New Zealand Brazil South Korea India France Germany When you make your purchase you will be able to request the Apple Gift Card or discount depending on your location. Who can get Apple’s Back to School deal? If you are registered at a higher education facility (that’s post-K12 education: universities and colleges) you will qualify for the free AirPods deal as well as Apple’s usual education discount. Employees of these institutions can also qualify. If you are a parent buying for your student offspring then you can also qualify. Here are Apple’s Ts\u0026Cs for the U.S. Alternatively, if you are an employee of a public or private K-12 institution/school in the U.S. or Canada you are also eligible. Apple’s Education pricing isn’t available to parents with kids at school, but a homeschool teacher can qualify. Even when Apple isn’t running the Back to School Deal students and education institutions can still take advantage of its standard educational pricing on its Educational Pricing page (U.S. here / U.K. here). How much can you save with Apple’s education pricing? Students can save up to $200/£220 on Macs and up to $100/£100 on iPads at any time of the year. More here: How to get an Apple student discount at Apple’s Education Store. Which iPads are included in Apple’s Back to School deal? You can get discounted Educational Pricing on all iPads if you qualify, you just won’t be able to get the freebie unless it is one of the models mentioned below. We anticipate that if Apple updates the 10th gen iPad just before June/July it won’t be included in the deal for northern hemisphere locations. January 2025: Australia/New Zealand/Brazil, etc M4 iPad Pro M4 iPad Air The 10th gen iPad could be a good partner to have at university. Macwelt/Apple/Amazon June/July 2024: U.S., Canada, U.K., Europe, India, etc. M4 iPad Pro M4 iPad Air It’s notable that Apple didn’t include the cheaper iPad 10th gen in the 2024 deal (although it did in Australia earlier that year). The iPad mini was also omitted. If you don’t qualify for the education pricing we have a separate guide on where to get the best deals on the iPad. For advice about which iPad to buy read: Which iPad is best for students. Which Macs are included in Apple’s Back to School deal? Not every Apple product you can buy in the Education Store is included in the promotion. Apple doesn’t usually offer incentives to buy the newest Apple products. So, if Apple updates the MacBook Air to an M4 just before the deal starts in June/July 2025 we don’t expect that the MacBook Air will be included. You can take advantage of education pricing for all Macs all year round. January 2025: Australia/New Zealand/Brazil, etc M3 MacBook Air M4 MacBook Pro M4 iMac A MacBook Air is a good choice for students. Foundry June/July 2024: U.S., Canada, U.K., Europe, India, etc. M3 MacBook Air M3 MacBook Pro M3 iMac M2 Mac mini If you don’t qualify for an education discount have a look at these round-ups of the best deals on a new Mac: Best MacBook Pro deals MacBook Air deals Mac mini deals Best iMac deals Best Mac Studio deals We also have this advice about which Mac is best for students.",

Which products are part of Apple’s Education offer? Qualifying purchases for Apple’s deal in January 2025 include: MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, iPad Pro and iPad Air. Qualifying products may differ depending on whether Apple has recently updated them. For example, over Black Friday Apple offers gift cards with select purchases, but its newest products are always left out of the deal. Hence, if Apple has just updated the iPad or Mac you want to buy you may not be able to get the vouchers or other gift alongside your purchase. Qualifying purchases for Apple’s deal in 2024 included: iMac 24‑inch, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac mini, iPad Pro 11- and 13‑inch, iPad Air 11‑ and 13-inch. (In Australia in early 2024 the iPad 10th generation was included, but this wasn’t the case later in 2024). In summer 2023 qualifying purchases included: iMac 24‑inch, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac mini, iPad Pro 12.9‑inch, iPad Pro 11‑inch, and iPad Air. Students can also take advantage of a reduced subscription to Apple Music with which they get access to Apple TV+ when they buy an Apple product. Read: How to get the student deal for Apple Music and free Apple TV+. How to get Apple’s Back To School deal As long as you are based in an area where Apple is running the deal at the time of your purchase, and are a student in higher education, or about to start higher education, you can qualify for Apple’s Higher Education deal and get gift cards with your purchase. There are more details about who the deal applies to below. Note that if you qualify you are able to get discounts all year round by shopping in the Apple Education Store, so you don’t need to shop during the Back to Uni deal period to get a bargain. You can also get discounts on other products not included in the offer (although there is no education discount for the iPhone). In the U.S. you need to visit Apple’s U.S. Education Store, but logging on from your university network may make the process easier.  In the U.K. you can visit the U.K. Education Store, but you will also need to verify your student or staff status with UNiDAYS. Go to the Apple Education Store for other regions using the links below: Canada Australia New Zealand Brazil South Korea India France Germany When you make your purchase you will be able to request the Apple Gift Card or discount depending on your location. Who can get Apple’s Back to School deal? If you are registered at a higher education facility (that’s post-K12 education: universities and colleges) you will qualify for the free AirPods deal as well as Apple’s usual education discount. Employees of these institutions can also qualify. If you are a parent buying for your student offspring then you can also qualify. Here are Apple’s Ts\u0026Cs for the U.S. Alternatively, if you are an employee of a public or private K-12 institution/school in the U.S. or Canada you are also eligible. Apple’s Education pricing isn’t available to parents with kids at school, but a homeschool teacher can qualify. Even when Apple isn’t running the Back to School Deal students and education institutions can still take advantage of its standard educational pricing on its Educational Pricing page (U.S. here / U.K. here). How much can you save with Apple’s education pricing? Students can save up to $200/£220 on Macs and up to $100/£100 on iPads at any time of the year. More here: How to get an Apple student discount at Apple’s Education Store. Which iPads are included in Apple’s Back to School deal? You can get discounted Educational Pricing on all iPads if you qualify, you just won’t be able to get the freebie unless it is one of the models mentioned below. We anticipate that if Apple updates the 10th gen iPad just before June/July it won’t be included in the deal for northern hemisphere locations. January 2025: Australia/New Zealand/Brazil, etc M4 iPad Pro M4 iPad Air The 10th gen iPad could be a good partner to have at university. Macwelt/Apple/Amazon June/July 2024: U.S., Canada, U.K., Europe, India, etc. M4 iPad Pro M4 iPad Air It’s notable that Apple didn’t include the cheaper iPad 10th gen in the 2024 deal (although it did in Australia earlier that year). The iPad mini was also omitted. If you don’t qualify for the education pricing we have a separate guide on where to get the best deals on the iPad. For advice about which iPad to buy read: Which iPad is best for students. Which Macs are included in Apple’s Back to School deal? Not every Apple product you can buy in the Education Store is included in the promotion. Apple doesn’t usually offer incentives to buy the newest Apple products. So, if Apple updates the MacBook Air to an M4 just before the deal starts in June/July 2025 we don’t expect that the MacBook Air will be included. You can take advantage of education pricing for all Macs all year round. January 2025: Australia/New Zealand/Brazil, etc M3 MacBook Air M4 MacBook Pro M4 iMac A MacBook Air is a good choice for students. Foundry June/July 2024: U.S., Canada, U.K., Europe, India, etc. M3 MacBook Air M3 MacBook Pro M3 iMac M2 Mac mini If you don’t qualify for an education discount have a look at these round-ups of the best deals on a new Mac: Best MacBook Pro deals MacBook Air deals Mac mini deals Best iMac deals Best Mac Studio deals We also have this advice about which Mac is best for students.",

The deal is the same for students in Brazil who can also claim free AirPods with a Mac or free Apple Pencil with their iPad purchase in January-March 2025. However, this is the same offer as those students had in 2024.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDoes it follow therefore that U.S., Canada and U.K students will also get free AirPods and Apple Pencils in the summer of 2025? AirPods were Apple’s student giveaway of choice a few years ago, but in recent times Apple has given away gift cards in those locations. However, in Europe and India, customers got money off the purchase of AirPods in 2024, so we could be moving back to the incentive of free AirPods and Apple Pencil (both of which are popular with students). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eApple Higher Education Offer won’t start in the U.S., U.K., Europe and Canada until later in 2025.

Instead, Apple offered gift cards with qualifying purchases during the promotional period. Students could get different gift card denominations depending on the products purchased. Not all Apple products are included in the offer. Apple also offers gift cards during its \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672787/apple-black-friday.html\"\u003eBlack Friday shopping event\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith Apple switching back to AirPods in the Australian Back to Uni deal for 2025 it is possible that the company will revert back to AirPods later in 2025 when the same promotion is run in the U.S., U.K. and other northern hemisphere locations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eApple doesn’t offer the same deal everywhere though. In parts of Europe and India, for the summer of 2024, the promotion allows shoppers to get discounted AirPods or Apple Pencil with qualifying purchases. There was a similar deal in January 2024 where those based in Brazil could claim free AirPods with a Mac or free Apple Pencil with their iPad purchase in January-March 2024. So Apple has a precedent of offering gift cards to some countries and AirPods and Pencils in others. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t the only education-related saving Apple offers.
