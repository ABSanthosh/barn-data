  "text": "NBA fans are still recovering from the shocking trade of star Luka Doncic from the Mavericks to the LA Lakers. And in a new interview with Doncic, he reveals that his iPhone might still be recovering a little too. NBA star Luka Doncic threw his iPhone after learning of trade, but ‘it still works’ Luka Doncic recently sat down with ESPN’s Malika Andrews to discuss the shocking trade from Dallas to LA. And in the interview, he reveals that when he first got the call with the news, his first reaction was to throw his iPhone across the room. You can find the video here on X or on ESPN’s website. As you can see in the images above and below, the iPhone sustained significant damage. Despite the damage though, Doncic says he’s still using that same iPhone. ”It still works,” he tells Andrews. So what’s the takeaway? Other than the obvious: that Dallas never should have traded Doncic. Perhaps it’s two-fold: The next time you get some bad news, maybe don’t throw your iPhone? But if you do, your phone might be just fine—though who knows Maybe the most surprising detail for me personally? That the aesthetic damage didn’t lead superstar Luka Doncic to buy himself a new iPhone.
