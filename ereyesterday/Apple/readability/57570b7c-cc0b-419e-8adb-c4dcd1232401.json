  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Access is a great companion app to Apple’s new Passwords app, allowing users to securely store sensitive information such as card numbers, gift cards, license keys, and anything else you’d like to keep secure that isn’t necessarily a password. Top features Access allows you to store payment cards, bank accounts, IDs, various documents, drivers licenses, insurance cards, passports, certificates, rewards cards, gift cards, software license keys, and more. While other password apps, such as 1Password, allow you to store these things, Apple Passwords doesn’t. Access aims to close that gap by providing a very familiar UI to Apple Passwords. The app lets you sort things into folders by category, lock it with Face ID/Touch ID, and use it across all Apple platforms (except tvOS). It syncs your data via iCloud, with nothing stored on external servers, ensuring your privacy. The developer also states they collect no user data, and if you use Advanced Data Protection in iCloud, it’ll be end to end encrypted. iOS 18 update Access has recently been updated for iOS 18, with a number of neat new features: App Intents with support for Shortcuts \u0026 Siri Controls for Control Center \u0026 Lock Screen Spotlight Search Refreshed design with the three-column layout, new sorting options, new system interactions (multiple selection, drag \u0026 drop), and more Attachments — add a photo or file to a saved item Download the app You can download Access on the App Store for free on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. It was recently featured on the App Store in the “Best Apps for Apple Vision Pro” category as well. Access+ is available for $3.99/month, $9.99/year, or $24.99 lifetime. Access+ unlocks the ability for unlimited items, whereas you can only use 5 items for free. You’ll need a device running iOS 18, macOS 15, or visionOS 2.
