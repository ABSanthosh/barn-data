In a new image and post on his website, leaker Majin Bu, who has offered a mixed track record on rumors, claims that the new arrangement for the camera expected in the forthcoming Pro model will cause Apple to reposition the Apple logo lower. A new post from Bu says will be moved to the center bottom portion, below the camera bar. \"[A] company we collaborate with, specializing in producing cases for the iPhone 17 Pro line, has confirmed they are already working to start production of cases with the updated design,\" Bu reported, providing a illustration of the change. Both the repositioning of the Apple logo and the introduction of a full camera bar across the top are presently unconfirmed, but the latter change is seen as very likely. The leak follows many others that have consistently claimed that the iPhone 17 Pro will feature a new layout for the top back portion of the device. There have been no previous rumors that this would lead to a change in the logo position, and there is no practical requirement for Apple to move it. However, the company did reposition the logo with the launch of the iPhone 11 in 2019. Prior to that, the iPhone X for instance had the logo higher up the back, and there was also the word \"iPhone\" written lower down. Apple centered the logo and removed the word \"iPhone\" with the iPhone 11, which also saw the introduction of a redesigned camera arrangement. Previously, the cameras had been in a vertical line but the iPhone 11 range introduced the now familiar rounded square arrangement. The expected new camera system for the iPhone 17 Pro will be the first major change in the cameras since the iPhone 11. It's speculated that the redesign will see the three cameras remaining on the left side as they do now, but the flash and LiDAR sensor would shift to the right side, making an almost iPhone-wide arrangement. The alleged new look for the back of the iPhone 17 Pro. Image credit: Majin BuBu also recently claimed that the iPhone 17 Pro will gain a \"vapor chamber\" cooling system, but was less confident on the rumor. While the report was claimed to have come from an \"internal source,\" the report hedges its bet by saying that the chamber's design is \"still evolving, with some challenges to address.\"",
