  "text": "News Cancelled. Image: Apple TV+ The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin reportedly won’t return to Apple TV+ after all — it’s been cancelled. The blame is being laid on star Noel Fielding. The comedy series first aired in 2024, and had been renewed for a second season, but word came Wednesday that it stopped in mid-production. The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin cancelled The humor in The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin derives from Noel Fielding being ridiculously wrong to portray a murderous, 18th-century English highwayman. He’s gentle and friendly, though he does love dressing up in black clothes. This deliberately absurd version of Turpin’s goal is to put some kindness into robbing travelers. Season one of the comedy, which premiered last March, did well enough with viewers that Apple TV+ greenlit season two. But then the wheels came off. “Noel Fielding’s multi-million pound comedy The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin has been axed mid-production after he failed to come to work,” reported the British tabloid The Sun. Production on new episodes started in the autumn, and then halted for the holidays. It was supposed to resume in January, but its star never came back. “Creatives, cast and crew this week received the devastating news this week and were simply told it was down to ‘the illness of a key cast member’,” according to The Sun. No one knows any more than that. The other people who worked on the series, including Ellie White (The Windsors), Marc Wootton (High \u0026 Dry) and Duayne Boachie (Blue Story), are all now abruptly out of work. And the series’ production company is out the money it spent in the autumn, though it likely could file an insurance claim. Fielding’s mysterious illness also raises questions about whether he’ll return as a co-presenter in the upcoming season of The Great British Bake Off, which is set to begin production this spring.",
