In March, we'd heard rumors that the iPhone 17 display would be improved. Specifically, the glass would be more scratch-resistant and less reflective. Then, in April, an anonymous source alleged that Apple abandoned the plans for that same anti-reflective, scratch-resistant display. And now, it seems like the iPhone 17 might get its scratch-resistant, anti-reflective display after all. Or at least, some of the iPhone 17 lineup. Allegedly, a source told MacRumors that the iPhone 17 Pro and the iPhone 17 Pro Max will get the new display technology. However, the iPhone 17 and the supposed iPhone 17 Air will not. Initially, adding the anti-reflective layer was deemed \"Too laborious,\" and caused production slowdowns. MacRumors says that it seems as though Apple must have nailed down the process at some point between April and now. Apple often promotes the durability and hardness of the iPhone screen. With the release of the iPhone 16e, for instance, Apple said that its Ceramic Shield front was \"tougher than any smartphone glass,\" and the company's claims have often been backed up by independent testing.",
