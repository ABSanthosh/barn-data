  "description": "Macworld The craziness of Prime Day is over, but when your deliveries finally start to roll in, you might realize that you prioritized things you wanted instead of things you need. If you blew your budget on fun things like new golf clubs and a flatscreen, but soon realized your old Mac sounds like a jet plane taking off, this deal is for you. This near-mint 13″ MacBook Pro is now just $324.97 — that’s 78% off retail. With a new macOS predicted to come in September, older models of MacBooks will become obsolete and no longer be able to be serviced or have their software upgraded. If your Mac was purchased between 2015 and 2016, it’s likely to be included in that list. This 2017 MacBook Pro features the powerful Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB of memory and up to 512GB of flash storage to handle all your streaming, scrolling, and side hustles with ease. It also features the beloved second generation Touch Bar for controlling brightness, volume, Touch ID, and Apple Pay. As a Grade A refurb, this device comes in a near-mint condition without any major flaws, but it comes at just a fraction of the price. Pick up this incredible deal on the MacBook Pro through July 15th.
