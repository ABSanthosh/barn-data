Photo: Cult of Mac Deals Staying connected while traveling can feel like a nightmare, especially when those international roaming fees hit you like a ton of bricks after your trip. An international eSIM like aloSIM makes it easy to stay online while you travel abroad. Sure, you could buy a SIM card for every new place you visit, but aloSIM is a simpler option. The company’s international eSIM plans let you tap into local data networks in more than 175 countries. That means you can ditch those pesky roaming fees and stay connected without worrying about your budget. It costs just $24.97 to get the base eSIM (which lasts for life), and you also get a $50 credit. How to use aloSIM, an international eSIM for iPhone and Android Apple began supporting eSIM years ago because eSIMs offer a much better experience than fumbling around with physical SIM cards.  In fact, for iPhones sold in the United States, Apple ditched physical SIM cards entirely. (Read our explainer on how eSIM works.) This aloSIM deal is a two-parter. First, you get the international eSIM itself. This lasts for life with no extra fees or anything like that. Setting up the eSIM is a breeze. Just make sure your device is compatible, install the eSIM, and you’re all set — no more dealing with those annoying physical SIM cards. But like your normal SIM card, your eSIM needs a plan. That’s where aloSIM’s $50 credit comes into play. You can use that credit to buy prepaid data packages that match your travel style, starting at just $4.50 per week. So, if you’re heading out to the Old Country to visit family, you can just get enough data to last your trip. No need to overpay for something you won’t use. The data plans are pretty impressive, too. You’ll enjoy reliable internet on 5G and LTE networks, so you can navigate easily, share updates or stay in touch while you’re off exploring. Just a quick heads-up: While the eSIM itself doesn’t expire, the data packages you buy do come with specific validity periods, usually ranging from a week to several months. This way, you pay only for the data you need. That’s what makes this international eSIM deal perfect for travelers looking to keep costs down while staying connected. Save on international roaming with aloSIM Checking your email after a relaxing vacation is hard enough. Finding an extra bill for all those roaming charges you accrued on the move doesn’t make it easier. Roam free without roaming fees with this international eSIM deal.
