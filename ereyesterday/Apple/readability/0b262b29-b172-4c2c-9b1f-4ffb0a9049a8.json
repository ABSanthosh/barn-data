With this spring cleaning sale, you can pick up many of Dreame’s home cleaning products, including robot vacuums, stick vacuums, wet-and-dry vacuums, and its hair dryer – all for up to 50% off. Spring is peak season for home improvement, and Dreame’s smart home cleaning products are a cutting-edge and efficient way to get all of your cleaning taken care of. Plus, save an additional 5% on select products using our exclusive promo code DREAME9to5. Remember, this sale only runs through March 31st. Robot vacuums: X40 Ultra and more Dreame’s flagship X40 Ultra vacuum normally runs for $1499.99, but during the spring sale, you can pick it up for just $899.99 during the spring sale. That’s over $600 off, and allows you to bring Dreame’s best robot vacuum into your home for a much more affordable price. The X40 Ultra has an RGB camera and 3D sensors, allowing the vacuum to precisely map out your home, avoid obstacles, and provide top-notch cleaning in all environments, including the smallest spaces with suboptimal lighting. It also offers powerful suction, up to 12000 Pa, coupled with extendable side brushes. Between the great suction and robust brushes, you can expect the Dreame X40 Ultra to leave your place spotless. It also comes with a self-cleaning base, so you don’t even need to worry about emptying it regularly. You can also get an additional 5% off of the $899.99 price tag using code DREAME9to5. For more affordable options, you can also consider the Dreame L40 Ultra and Dreame L10s Ultra Gen 2. L40 Ultra equips similarly powerful suction to the X40 Ultra, and packs the same AI-driven navigation. It also has a self-cleaning base, and comes in at just $699.99 during the spring sale. L10s Ultra Gen 2 also packs similar tech, just without the fancy auto-cleaning mop. However, it comes in at just $459.99 during the spring sale, making it substantially more obtainable. Wet-and-dry vacuums: Powerful and sleek Cleaning up your home this spring will be easier than ever with the Dreame H12 Pro stick vacuum. It has an all-new edge-to-edge cleaning brush, allowing you to easily get deep into corners and clean in tight crevices, like around your baseboard. It simultaneously vacuums, mops, and washes – getting rid of grime in a snap. Plus, the included base allows you to automatically clean the brush in just an hour. The built in base dries using hot air, preventing any sort of mold from developing. Dreame H12 Pro comes in at just $269.99 during the spring sale, over $180 off of its original price. With its unmatched suction and intelligent capabilities, its a killer value at this price. Plus, save an additional 5% using code DREAME9to5 at checkout. You can also check out Dreame’s more premium vacuums with lie-flat capabilities. The H14 and H14 Pro allow you to reach places with tighter clearances, such as under your couch. Dreame H14 Pro comes in at $399.99 during the spring sale, over $300 off! With the H14 Pro, you can get the best of the best in terms of lie-flat vacuum capability. Dreame H14 packs the same powerful suction and self cleaning capabilities as H14 Pro, but at an even more accessible price point of $299.99. You can’t go wrong with either model. Stick vacuums offer unmatched power Dreame Z30 is the pinnacle of Dreame’s stick vacuum technology. It offers class-leading suction power with 310AW of suction, and an impressive 99.99% filtration rate. With the Z30, you should have no issue capturing the finest dusts. It also offers Dreame’s smart sensing technology, which actively monitors debris size and dynamically adjusts suction, making the Z30 an efficient cordless vacuum. Despite all of this cool tech (including a built-in LCD display), the Z30 can still last up to 90 minutes on a single charge, and can be recharged in just 4 hours. The Z30 also offers a HEPA filter, allowing it to capture particles as small as 0.1 micrometers. You can pick up the Dreame Z30 during the spring sale for just $399.99 during the spring sale, which is $300 off from typical pricing. Plus, save an additional 5% with code DREAME9to5. You can also pick up the Dreame R10 for a more affordable option. It offers an advanced 5-state filter system and an hour of runtime, but comes in at just $189.99 – $110 off the normal price tag. Take care of yourself with the Pocket Hair Dryer Beyond intelligent home vacuuum tech, Dreame also offers a lightweight and compact hair dryer. It comes in at just 1.97 inches tall and weighs a mere 300 grams, making it easy to carry around with you. Dreame Pocket Hair Dryer is foldable, stylish, and has a number of useful features.

Pocket Hair Dryer also offers precise temperature control with five different profiles, allowing you to tailor your drying to your hairs needs. Dreame Pocket Hair Dryer is remarkable quiet, operating at just 60dB – which is around the same level as ambient music or hearing a background conversation. You can pick up the Pocket Hair Dryer for just $89.99 during the spring sale, which is $70 off its starting price. Save an additional 5% with our exclusive promo code, DREAME9to5.
