  "text": "News Spy drama Slow Horses will see a seventh season on Apple TV+. Photo: Apple TV+ Even with seasons five and six yet to stream, here comes Slow Horses season 7! Apple TV+ officially greenlit a seventh season of its hit spy drama “Slow Horses” Tuesday. So the adventures of dysfunctional British MI5 intelligence team continue. The announcement comes as the Emmy and BAFTA Award-winning series continues to garner critical acclaim and build a devoted fanbase. “Slow Horses has won fans all over the world with its unique mix of self-deprecating British humor and high-octane action,” said Jay Hunt, creative director, Europe, Apple TV+. “I’m delighted viewers will have another season to enjoy Gary’s magnificent performance as Jackson Lamb alongside the Slow Horses’ slightly inept spycraft.” So right now fans can watch four seasons of Slow Horses on Apple TV+. The upcoming six-episode seventh season will once again star Academy Award winner Sir Gary Oldman as the irascible Jackson Lamb, the brilliant but cantankerous leader of MI5’s most troubled agents. Oldman’s powerhouse performance earned him Golden Globe, Emmy and BAFTA Award nominations, cementing his role as one of television’s most compelling antiheroes. Another adaptation from the beloved book series Season seven will adapt Bad Actors, another installment from Mick Herron’s CWA Gold Dagger Award-winning “Slough House” book series. The new season promises to deliver the same darkly comedic espionage thriller elements that have made the show a standout in Apple TV+’s growing catalog of premium content. In the upcoming season, Lamb and his team of misfit spies face their most critical mission yet. They must down and neutralize a dangerous mole embedded within the British government before they can bring down the entire state apparatus. This high-stakes premise sets up what could be the series’ most intense storyline to date. Critical success drives continued investment The decision to renew Slow Horses for a seventh season reflects the show’s remarkable critical reception and growing popularity among Apple TV+ subscribers. All four currently available seasons maintain Certified Fresh scores on Rotten Tomatoes, with two seasons achieving perfect 100% critics’ scores. Season four was notably recognized as the number one series of 2024 on the review aggregation site. The third season’s impact was particularly significant, earning nine Primetime Emmy Award nominations and securing a win for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. Critics have consistently praised the series with glowing reviews, calling it “undoubtedly the best spy series on television” and “utterly brilliant.” Production timeline and availability Apple TV+ subscribers can currently stream the complete first four seasons of Slow Horses, with season five scheduled to premiere on September 24, 2025. Season six was previously announced and is expected to bridge the gap before the seventh season arrives. See-Saw Films, part of the Mediawan group, produces the series. An impressive roster of executive producers includes Jamie Laurenson, Hakan Kousetta, Iain Canning, Emile Sherman, Dan Hassid, Mick Herron, Gail Mutrux, Douglas Urbanski and Oldman himself. For season seven, Ben Vanstone will adapt the screenplay and serve as executive producer, while Robert McKillop set to direct. What makes Slow Horses special “Slow Horses” distinguishes itself in the crowded spy thriller genre through its unique blend of self-deprecating British humor and high-octane espionage action. The series follows agents who have been relegated to Slough House, MI5’s equivalent of a dumping ground for intelligence operatives whose career-ending mistakes have made them liabilities to the service. The series successfully carved out its own niche by balancing moments of genuine tension with dark comedy. It creates a viewing experience that feels both familiar and refreshingly original in the espionage genre. Watch Slow Horses on Apple TV+ You can stream Slow Horses season one through four and other Apple TV+ content by subscription for $9.99 with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. For a limited time, customers who purchase and activate a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac or iPod touch can enjoy three months of Apple TV+ for free. After launching in November 2019, “Apple TV+ became the first all-original streaming service to launch around the world, and has premiered more original hits and received more award recognitions faster than any other streaming service in its debut. To date, Apple Original films, documentaries and series have earned 464 wins and 2,083 award nominations and counting,,” the service said. Those include multi-Emmy Award-winning comedy Ted Lasso and historic Oscar Best Picture winner CODA. Source: Apple",
