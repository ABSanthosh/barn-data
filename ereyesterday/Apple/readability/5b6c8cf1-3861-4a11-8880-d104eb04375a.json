  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Qewie is a new iPhone app that allows users to generate unique, eye-catching QR codes in a breeze, providing a clean interface for the whole experience. It’s ad-free, simple, and easy to understand. The developer calls it the best and last QR generator you’ll ever use. Qewie features With Qewie, you can customize QR codes to your hearts content. You can change the color, the borders, the corners, pixels, pupils, and eyes of your QR code. You can also add a custom logo to the center of your QR code, although that’ll require the pro membership. The app also offers a neat little randomize button, allowing you to swap the look of your QR code with a simple tap. With the free version of Qewie, you can only generate QR codes for URLs, but if you subscribe to Pro, you can also generate QR codes for Wi-Fi networks, locations, and contacts. Qewie is also built to be private. Qewie generates QR codes on device, never sends them to a server, and doesn’t collect data. Once you generate a QR code, theres a simple button to share it, save it to photos, export as PDF or SVG (pro required), or add it to your collection. If you add it to your collection, it’ll be saved within Qewie so you can access it later. About the developer Joseph developed Qewie because QR code apps in the App Store have notoriously been terrible, either with poor user experience or sketchy practices. QR code apps will often have ads, or generate QR codes that eventually expire, which Qewie won’t do. He wasn’t happy with QR code apps on the App Store, so he decided to make one himself, and this is his first app on the App Store. In the future, he’d like for Qewie to support iPadOS and macOS, have more customization options, and include options to print QR code stickers. Download Qewie Qewie is available for free on the App Store for iPhones running iOS 17 and later. Qewie Pro, which enables branded QR codes, additional export options, and more versatility for QR code generation, is available for $1.99/month, $14.99/year, or $19.99 lifetime.
