This is the powerful M4 model we’re talking about with 16GB of RAM, so it’s truly a geat deal. The 14-inch MacBook Pro went from “meh” to marvelous, we wrote in our 4.5-star review. The laptop got a near-perfect score from us, with our main praise being the bump to 16GB of unified memory (over 8GB) and the introduction of the Space Black option, which was unavailable on this model last year. The laptop runs on the blazing-fast M4 chip with a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU for incredible speed in tackling demanding tasks. You’ll also get fantastic battery life, with our tests clocking the battery at about 20 hours of use, good for a whole day’s work and then some. And of course, you’re getting a fantastic 14.2-inch display with ProMotion and 1,600 nits peak brightness. Like the rest of the Apple silicon machines, this laptop is also ready to run Apple Intelligence, allowing you to perform work more efficiently with features such as Writing Tools and the upcoming next-gen Siri.
