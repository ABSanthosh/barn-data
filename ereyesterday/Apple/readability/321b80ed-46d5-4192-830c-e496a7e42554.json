  "text": "Following a recent expansion of Tap to Pay on iPhone to more countries in Europe, Apple this week announced that it is bringing the feature to yet another country this year. As of today, users in New Zealand can count on the feature that turns the iPhone into a payment terminal. The news was confirmed by Apple on its website (via MacRumors). In New Zealand, Adyen, ANZ Bank, Stripe, Windcave and Worldline are the first platforms to support Tap to Pay on iPhone. For those unfamiliar, Tap to Pay enables merchants to accept contactless payment via a compatible iOS app running on an iPhone Xs or newer, equipped with the latest iOS version. During the checkout process, the merchant will only need to instruct the customer to hold their iPhone, Apple Watch, or compatible NFC card near the merchant’s iPhone to make a payment. Just like any Apple Pay transaction, Tap to Pay is securely processed using NFC technology, and there’s no requirement for extra hardware to facilitate contactless payments. In countries where the feature is available, developers can use an API available in iOS 15.4 and later to implement Tap to Pay support. Tap to Pay on iPhone supports contactless credit and debit cards from leading payment networks, including American Express, Discover, JCB, Mastercard and Visa. Tap to Pay on iPhone first debuted in the US in 2022, and expanded internationally to the UK, France, Taiwan, Australia, the Netherlands, Brazil, Ukraine, Japan, Canada, Italy and more.
