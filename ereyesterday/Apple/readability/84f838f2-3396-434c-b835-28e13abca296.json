  "text": "As a result of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) antitrust legislation in the EU, Apple has had to change how iOS and the App Store work for users in European countries. And there are more changes coming with iOS 18.2. More specifically, iPhone and iPad users will soon be able to delete the App Store, Safari, and many other built-in iOS apps. iOS 18.2 lets EU users delete the App Store and more It‘s already possible to delete some of Apple’s native apps such as Calculator, Calendar, Music and Notes. However, with iOS 18.2 beta, which was released on Wednesday to developers, Apple is expanding this list with even more apps – but only for users located in the EU. With the latest beta version of iOS, users in the EU can now delete the App Store, Camera, Safari, Messages, and Photos. The change aims to comply with one of the DMA’s articles requiring tech companies to make it easy for users to uninstall any apps they want. Apple had already confirmed back in August that it would bring this option with a future iOS update. In the EU, users can download alternative App Marketplaces to replace the App Store. The company has added a button in the Settings app for users who want to restore Apple’s App Store after deleting it. There are also some other changes coming for users in the rest of the world. iOS 18.2 adds a new menu that makes it easier for users to set their default apps. There are options to set the default app for email, messages, calls, web browser, password manager, and keyboard. iOS 18.2 also adds Image Playground, Genmoji, ChatGPT integration, and Visual Search for iPhone 16 models. For now, iOS 18.2 beta is only available for devices compatible with Apple Intelligence. That means iPhone 15 Pro or later and M1 iPads or later. Of course, the update will eventually be available for other devices too. Apple previously suggested that iOS 18.2 will be released to the public in December.
