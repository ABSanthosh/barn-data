  "text": "Apple is expected to hold their next keynote in October, probably towards the end of the month. Theres four major products we’re expecting to see this time around, and they’re expected to be released on November 1st. M4 MacBook Pro Although we’ve already seen unboxings of this computer, it actually isn’t out yet – believe it or not. Apple is expected to unveil the new 14″ and 16″ MacBook Pro lineup with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips at the end of the month. The base model is definitely the more interesting product this time around, as its expected to have 16GB of RAM for the first time, come in Space Black, and have an extra thunderbolt port on the right side. M4 Mac mini We’re expecting the largest redesign to Mac mini in over 14 years later this month, with a much smaller design, as well as frontal ports for the first time. It’s also expected that the next Mac mini will drop support for USB-A. It’ll be available with M4 and M4 Pro chips, starting with at least 16GB of RAM. M4 iMac We’re also expecting an update to the iMac in October, although a much smaller update. We’ll be bumping up from the M3 chip to the M4 chip, as well as from 8GB of RAM to 16GB of RAM on the base model. There aren’t many other expected changes. It’s highly possible that we’ll see new Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad updates with USB-C, given the fact that Apple needs to transition all of their products to comply with European regulations. iPad mini 7 Last but not least, we should also be getting the first iPad mini refresh in over three years. We’re expecting an A18 chipset with support for Apple Intelligence, and hopefully a new display that fixes “jelly scrolling.” It’ll also likely gain support for Apple Pencil Pro, as well as 128GB of base storage. Wrap up Apple’s upcoming product launch is sounding quite exciting. Are you planning on buying anything? Let us know in the comments.
