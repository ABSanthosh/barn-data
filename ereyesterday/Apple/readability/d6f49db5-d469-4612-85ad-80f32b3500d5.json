  "text": "The release of the specifications for Bluetooth 6.1 will result in more privacy for all users, and improved battery life in iPhone accessories for Apple users, starting sometime in 2026. While Bluetooth 6.0 gave devices high-accuracy distance tracking not unlike the iPhone feature Ultra Wideband, the new update also focuses on better privacy. Supporting Bluetooth devices will be able to change their addresses randomly, making tracking more difficult. The new technology is referred to as Randomized Resolvable Private Addresses, or Randomized RPA. Version 6.0 has set intervals when the RPA would refresh, making that aspect predictable. Bluetooth 6.1 randomizes RPA updates between eight and 15 minutes, and also allows for custom timings to be programmed in. In addition, the address-changing operation can be handled by the Bluetooth controller, rather than the device's CPU. As a byproduct, it is also expected to result in lower battery consumption on mobile devices, thanks to the reduced CPU usage. It is possible that the iPhone 17 lineup, when it is released in the fall, could support at least Bluetooth 6, and possibly the 6.1 update. Apple does frequently adopt newer standards with its product releases, though sometimes they can take a long time to arrive. That said, third-party devices supporting Bluetooth 6 and later revisions are unlikely to hit the market before 2026 at the earliest. Some devices with upgradeable Bluetooth firmware could be compatible with the new standards sooner. However, Bluetooth devices that cannot upgrade to the 6 standard will remain potentially vulnerable to attacks. Owners of older Bluetooth devices should check to see if they can be updated to newer versions of the technology. The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), in charge of maintaining and enhancing the specification, is now on a bi-annual update schedule. The next update, Bluetooth 6.2, is expected to arrive by the end of 2025.",
