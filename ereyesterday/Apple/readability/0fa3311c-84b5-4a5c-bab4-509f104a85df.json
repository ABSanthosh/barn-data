Popular StoriesiPhone 17 Pro Max Rumors Allegedly Refer to 'iPhone 17 Ultra' ModelFriday March 14, 2025 7:56 am PDT by Tim HardwickIf you've been following iPhone rumors over the last few years, you may remember reading reports that Apple flirted with the idea of introducing a super high-end \"Ultra\" model that would either replace its Pro Max device or sit above it in Apple's smartphone hirearchy. These reports appeared in the pre-launch iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 rumor cycles, but ultimately came to nothing. Now though, the...Apple Upgrades CarPlay in Two WaysWednesday March 12, 2025 6:05 am PDT by Joe RossignolThe upcoming iOS 18.4 update for the iPhone includes a smaller but meaningful improvement for Apple's in-car iPhone mirroring system CarPlay. Specifically, CarPlay now shows a third row of icons, up from two rows previously. However, this change is only visible in vehicles with a larger center display. For example, a MacRumors Forums member noticed the change in a Toyota Tundra with a...AirPods Pro 3 Launch Now Just Months Away: Here's What We KnowTuesday March 11, 2025 3:26 am PDT by Tim HardwickDespite being released over two years ago, Apple's AirPods Pro 2 continue to dominate the wireless earbud market. However, with the AirPods Pro 3 expected to launch in 2025, anyone thinking of buying Apple's premium earbuds may be wondering if the next generation is worth holding out for. Apart from their audio and noise-canceling performance, which are generally regarded as excellent for...Apple Launches 'Surveyor' App for Apple Maps Data CollectionFriday March 14, 2025 10:38 am PDT by Juli CloverApple today launched a new app called Surveyor, which is designed to allow users to collect data like images of street signs and roadside details to improve Apple Maps. The app is not public facing and appears to be for use with companies that Apple partners with to assign mapping tasks. Downloading the app and opening it up directs users to \"Open Partner App\" to choose a task. Tapping on...Ultra-Thin 'iPhone 17 Air' Rumored to Include These 12 FeaturesSaturday March 15, 2025 10:50 am PDT by Joe RossignolWhile the so-called \"iPhone 17 Air\" is not expected to launch until September, there are already plenty of rumors about the ultra-thin device. Overall, the \"iPhone 17 Air\" sounds like a mixed bag. While the device is expected to have an impressively thin and light design, rumors indicate it will have some compromises compared to iPhone 17 Pro models, including only a single rear camera, a...Kuo: Cook Should Personally Address Siri Apple Intelligence FailureThursday March 13, 2025 4:02 pm PDT by Juli CloverApple made a major misstep with the way that it handled the delay of Apple Intelligence features for Siri, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today. Announcing the delay through a press statement was a bad decision, and Apple should instead have gone through official channels. Kuo referenced the well-known \"Antennagate\" PR crisis when the iPhone 4 launched in 2010, and the way that then Apple...iOS 18.4 Adds a Highly-Requested Setting to iPhones — But Not in U.S.Wednesday March 12, 2025 1:05 pm PDT by Joe RossignoliPhones are finally getting a much-requested setting, but availability is limited. The upcoming iOS 18.4 update introduces an option to set a default navigation app, other than Apple Maps, but unfortunately this new setting is limited to users in the EU. There, you can now set an app like Google Maps or Waze as your default navigation app on the iPhone by opening the Settings app and tapping ...12 New Things Your iPhone Can Do in iOS 18.4Monday March 10, 2025 9:28 am PDT by Tim HardwickApple is set to release iOS 18.4 in early April, bringing further refinements to Apple Intelligence features, a neat new capability to iPhone 15 Pro devices, new emoji, and more. While not quite as packed with new features as Apple's preceding iOS 18 point releases, iOS 18.4 still introduces enhancements that aim to make your iPhone smarter and more intuitive.
