  "description": "Macworld We’re less than a week away from Apple’s biggest event of the year, and as the WWDC25 keynote approaches, expect the hype and the rumors to ramp up. For example, @aaronp613 on X points out that the WWDC25 hashmoji is now live. In case you’re wondering, it looks like the glossy Apple icon, but it’s interestingly labeled as “BF-14032_WWDC25_HashmojiBefore,” which seems to indicate that there will be another hashmoji after the keynote. More intriguing, however, is a tidbit posted by @aaronp613, which states that third-party retailers received an email from Apple about “resources to help you talk to customers about what’s possible when hardware and software are designed together.” This can be interpreted in a couple of ways. One way to look at it is tied to the rumored new user-interface language that Apple will be implementing throughout its operating systems, and that the company is making a concerted effort to train retailers in the messaging about the changes. @aaronp613/X Another way to look at it is that Apple is going to release a new hardware device next week and wants to make sure retailers know how to demonstrate it. Could it be the rumored HomeHub or HomePod with an iPad-like display? Reports have said that these devices were on the release schedule for this year, but the delays with Siri also pushed these products back. It’s certainly something to think about until the WWDC25 keynote on Monday at 10 a.m. Pacific, which you can watch live. Until then, enjoy the new WWDC25 promo video below that Apple released on TikTok. Learn more about WWDC25. #id683f1c8e47d3f .jw-wrapper::before { content: \"WWDC25 TikTok promo\" !important; }",
