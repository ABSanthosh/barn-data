During the outage, many iPhone users took to social media to complain, saying they couldn't complete Apple Pay transactions or use Apple Cash. Apple Cash is a popular payment service, similar to CashApp, Venmo, and Zelle, but under the Apple umbrella. Apple Card, meanwhile, is an Apple-branded credit card, whereas Apple Pay enables contactless payments on the iPhone and Apple Watch through NFC technology. The Wallet app lets users store digital IDs, driver's licenses, boarding passes, and credit cards, among other things. All of Apple's payment-related services were affected by the Friday service issue. Apple's services periodically experience issues for various reasons. Apple Wallet experienced a similar problem in December 2023, and Apple Cash users faced a service issue in May of the same year. More recently, Apple Cash experienced another outage in January 2025.",
