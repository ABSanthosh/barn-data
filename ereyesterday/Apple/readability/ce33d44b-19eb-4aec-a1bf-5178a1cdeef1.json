In September 2025, Apple is expected to introduce a radically redesigned iPhone lineup. The iPhone 17 Pro is widely believed to feature a new rear \"camera bar\" design, and rumors suggest an ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air will replace the Plus model for 2025. The standard iPhone 17, however, won't benefit from the same visual treatment. Based on alleged leaked CAD files and dummy units, the base model iPhone 17 will be virtually indistinguishable from its predecessor, the iPhone 16. Apple has already made test units of the iPhone 17, and the device is reportedly moving toward mass production. Despite its derivative design, leakers and analysts alike believe that it will deliver significant performance improvements. Here's everything they've said so far. iPhone 17 — RAM and performance upgrades. Recently, in April 2025, leaker \"Digital Chat Station\" suggested that the entire iPhone 17 lineup would feature 12GB of RAM, up from the current 8GB found on the iPhone 16 range. This latest rumor echoes another leaker's claims from August 2024, but not everyone agrees. A 12GB RAM upgrade would likely allow for more advanced Apple Intelligence features on the iPhone 17.In May 2024, analyst Jeff Pu suggested that only the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max would feature 12GB of RAM, repeating his claim in February 2025. Ming-Chi Kuo said the same thing in August 2024. While it remains unclear whether or not the 12GB RAM upgrade will extend to the base model iPhone 17, it wouldn't be impossible. There's at least one good reason for the change, and it has to do with Apple's AI software. For the iPhone 16 range, for instance, Apple upgraded the RAM of the base model iPhone. While the iPhone 15 shipped with only 6GB, the iPhone 16 received 8GB — the same amount found in the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. The company did this so that it could bring Apple Intelligence, a suite of generative AI features, to both models. Apple Intelligence was one of the main selling points for the iPhone 16 line, and although that hasn't always been a good thing for Apple, the company could offer similar specs across the board once more. 12GB of RAM would likely allow for more advanced Apple Intelligence on the iPhone 17 range, with one leaker even calling the change beneficial for Apple's AI features. Still, it remains to be seen whether only the \"Pro\" models will get the upgrade. or if it will also apply to the standard iPhone 17. The iPhone 17 will likely use Apple's A19 chip, with a 2nm process by TSMC.As for the processing power, TSMC has reportedly been working on a 2nm A19 chip for the iPhone 17 range. In 2022, the company said it was planning mass production of 2-nm chip designs by 2025, which would coincide with the A19 and the release of the iPhone 17 line. In December 2023, one report suggested it would debut in the iPhone 17 Pro. In July 2024, it was reported that TSMC had begun trial production of its 2nm chips, while another claimed the necessary process wouldn't be ready until late 2025. The use of a smaller process would allow for better power efficiency and thermal management, and a 2nm chip would likely save a small amount of space within the phone itself. Even so, no specific details have been provided concerning the base model iPhone 17, but an upgrade over the A18 in the iPhone 16 is guaranteed. The iPhone 17 will most likely be almost identical to its predecessor, the iPhone 16. While it's expected to maintain the 6.1-inch display size, there's still plenty of room for improved technology. The iPhone 17 will be available with the same 6.1-inch display size as the iPhone 16.According to a February 2025 report, the iPhone 17 range will feature Samsung's M14 OLED panel, which offers some benefits over the preceding M13 panel, including a 30% boost to brightness and a better lifespan. This was in part instigated by switching blue fluorescence with blue phosphorescence, which also reduced power consumption. The current non-Pro models often use earlier mixes, such as M12 on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, as well as on the iPhone 15. An M14 panel would be an impressive upgrade for the iPhone 17, but it might not be the only one Apple has in store. Multiple sources have said that the entire iPhone 17 range will receive ProMotion support. The claim was first made by DSCC in April 2023. It was then reiterated in February 2024, after which it was repeated by leaker \"Ice Universe in July 2024. The most recent mentions date to September 2024, November 2024, December 2024, and March 2025. ProMotion would allow for always-on display on the iPhone 17, and would allow for a better experience in StandBy mode.Though not definitive, the idea of ProMotion on the base model iPhone 17 remains an interesting prospect. The variable refresh rate would allow for an always-on display, meaning that users would be able to see their battery level, widgets, and more while the display is in its \"off\" state. StandBy mode would also offer a better experience on the base iPhone 17, as the display wouldn't shut off after only a few minutes. If implemented, it would certainly be an attractive addition. At the same time, however, the iPhone 17 Pro would lose one of its major selling points, so it remains unclear exactly what route Apple will take. As for durability, it could very well be more of the same this year. In March 2024, a well-known leaker suggested that Apple was working on an anti-reflective and scratch-proof display coating for the iPhone 17, but an April 2025 rumor said the improvement was abandoned in its entirety, Still, the base model iPhone 17 will offer improvements in other areas. The iPhone 17 could feature a custom Wi-Fi chipWith the release of the iPhone 16e, Apple unveiled its first in-house modem, dubbed the C1. It allows for better power efficiency relative to the Qualcomm modems found in most iPhones, but notably lacks mmWave support. The standard iPhone 17 could feature a custom Apple-designed Wi-Fi chip.While the iPhone 17 Air is expected to receive the C1 modem, the same can't be said for the remainder of the iPhone 17 range. Still, there's a chance the base model iPhone 17 will feature a different kind of custom-made processor — an in-house Apple Wi-Fi chip. For years, rumors have suggested that Apple was working on a Wi-Fi chip, and we could finally see its debut in 2025. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo first reported this as a possibility in October 2024, then reiterated his position in February 2025. The new chip, reportedly known under the codename \"Proxima,\" will supposedly help Apple cut costs by replacing the Broadcom Wi-FI chips found in current iPhones. Supposedly, it will also help \"enhance connectivity across Apple devices,\" according to Kuo. The same source also said that Apple's custom Wi-Fi chip would be made by TSMC using its 7-nanometer N7 process, and that it would be Wi-Fi 7 compatible. The new chip is expected to appear in the new HomePod mini and Apple TV in 2025 as well. Other iPhone 17 rumors — Camera improvements, 35W wired fast chargingAside from the custom Wi-Fi chip, Apple might also upgrade the front-facing camera with the standard iPhone 17. Two different analysts believe this will be the case. The iPhone 17 likely won't feature massive improvements for the rear camera.In January 2024, Ming-Chi Kuo first said that the iPhone 17 range would receive a 24MP front-facing camera, and that claim was later reiterated by Jeff Pu in August 2024. The current iPhone 16 only features a 12MP front camera, so the iPhone 17 could prove to be quite an improvement. The base model iPhone 17 will reportedly use a 24-megapixel camera with a six-element plastic lens. For comparison's sake, the TrueDepth camera array in the iPhone 15 uses a 12-megapixel camera, with five lens elements made of plastic. There has been no information about the rear camera on the standard iPhone 17. A July 2024 report mentioned that at least one device in the iPhone 17 range would support a variable aperture, which would allow for better bokeh, though it did not specify which device would receive the upgrade. The iPhone 17 range is expected to support 35W wired charging speeds.In February 2025, Jeff Pu claimed that the iPhone 17 range would support wired charging speeds of up to 35W. In our review of the iPhone 16 Pro, we hit 34W of power with suitable wired charging gear, and we've seen reports of some users getting 39W while charging. According to leaker ShrimpApplePro, however, the iPhone 16 range is already capable of charging at speeds of up to 45W via a cable, which is faster than the purported iPhone 17 charging speed provided by Pu, though unofficial. The standard iPhone 17 is expected to debut in September 2025, alongside the redesigned iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. Apple also plans to unveil an entirely new model, known as the iPhone 17 Slim or iPhone 17 Air.",
