  "text": "Apple has issued the fourth beta version of iOS 18.5, macOS Sequoia 15.5, and iPadOS 18.5, for users participating in the beta testing programs for apple system software. There are also new betas available for watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS, if those are applicable to you. No significant new features or changes are expected in any of these releases, suggesting they’re mostly aimed at bug fixes, security enhancements, and perhaps a few minor feature tweaks. The latest non-beta versions of system software are currently iOS 18.4.1, ipadOS 18.4.1, and MacOS Sequoia 15.4.1. How to Install iOS/iPadOS 18.5 Beta 4 If your device is enrolled in the beta testing program you’ll find the latest beta available to download: Open the “Settings” app Go to “General” and then “Software Update” Download and install iOS 18.5 beta 4 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.5 beta 4 Updating to the latest Mac beta with a Mac enrolled in the beta testing program is simple: From the  Apple menu go to “System Settings” Select “General” and then go to “Software Update” Choose to update and install MacOS Sequoia 15.5 beta 4 Just like any other system software update, installing a beta will require the device to restart. When will iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, and MacOS Sequoia 15.5 be released? Apple is currently on a weekly release cycle with these software updates, suggesting the software updates are progressing fairly quickly. It’s reasonable to expect that final versions of iOS 18.5, MacOS Sequoia 15.5, and ipadOS 18.5, will likely be out in the month of May, though nobody outside of Apple really knows the timeline. The most recently available versions of system software are currently iOS 18.4.1 for iPhone, ipadOS 18.4.1 for iPad, and MacOS Sequoia 15.4.1 for Mac.",
