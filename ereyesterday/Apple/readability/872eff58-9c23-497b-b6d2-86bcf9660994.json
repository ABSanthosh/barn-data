  "text": "Apple Intelligence has raised the bar when it comes to RAM requirements as AI-based features require a device with at least 8GB of RAM. With Apple working to expand the capabilities of Apple Intelligence even further, the company is now rumored to put 12GB of RAM in the iPhone 17 Pro models. Rumors about some of this year’s iPhone models having 12GB of RAM are not new. In fact, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted the RAM increase for the 17 Pro lineup in August last year after Apple announced Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2024. However, it’s now becoming clearer that this year’s iPhones will get another RAM upgrade. In a note to investors seen by 9to5Mac, analyst Jeff Pu of GFHK Tech Research corroborates the rumors about the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max having 12GB of RAM, compared to 8GB in the current models. According to the analyst, the increased demand for AI capabilities has pushed PC and smartphone manufacturers to upgrade the RAM in their devices. “Meanwhile iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are expected to migrate to LPDDR5 12GB, this transition alone will contribute to a 3.5% YoYincrease in smartphone DRAM content across an estimated 100 million new iPhone units,” the analist said. In 2023, only the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max were equipped with 8GB of RAM, while the non-Pro models only have 6GB of RAM. Last year, Apple put 8GB of RAM in the base iPhone 16 and 16 Plus models. As a result, Apple Intelligence is only available for iPhone 15 Pro and later. The recently announced iPhone 16e also has 8GB RAM and support for Apple Intelligence. While the RAM increase will certainly make the iPhone 17 Pro more future-proof, it also hints at new Apple Intelligence features that may require even more RAM, and consequently will only be available on these iPhone models. For instance, Apple last year updated its entire Mac lineup – including the old M2 MacBook Air – with 16GB of RAM. Latest rumors on the new iPhones Based on recent rumors, the entire iPhone 17 lineup will come with major design changes. The devices are expected to feature a new camera layout and video features that will make them more appealing for vlogging. Apple is also rumored to introduce a new ultra-slim iPhone that will sit between the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro, possibly replacing the current Plus model. The new iPhones are likely to be announced in September.
