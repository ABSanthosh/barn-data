  "text": "For a limited time, Apple is offering new Apple Card users a special sign up bonus through Nike. Now through June 15th, users can receive $150 in cash back after spending over $150 on Nike purchases in the first 30 days of account opening. This stacks on top of the limited time 6% cash back offer that started earlier this month. If you’re a big Nike shopper, you’re in luck! With this new Apple Card offer, you can essentially pick up $150 in Nike gear for free if you sign up through this link. This offer has been advertised across social media in the past week, and is not a targeted offer – unlike previous Apple Card sign up bonus offers. Apple Card typically comes with no sign up bonus (other than the $75 referral offer), so every Apple Card welcome offer is worth talking about. As mentioned prior, this combines with the 6% cash back on Nike offer, which is also running through June 15th – on up to $500 of purchases. You do have a few weeks to decide on this one, but I’d certainly say this is one of the better Apple Card offers, especially if you wanted to spend at Nike anyways.
