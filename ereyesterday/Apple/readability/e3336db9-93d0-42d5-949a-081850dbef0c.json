  "text": "A years-old lawsuit accusing Apple of burning through users’ mobile data won’t be moving forward as a class action, but it might still be pursued individually. Here’s what happened. The case involves unauthorized cellular data usage, even when Wi-Fi was available The case, originally filed by user Alasdair Turner in 2020, claims that iOS 13 sent data over cellular networks even after users had specifically disabled mobile access for certain apps. That background activity was allegedly mislabeled as coming from “Uninstalled Apps,” which would not only make it nearly impossible to trace, but also send the user down the wrong troubleshooting path. Turner claimed that the behavior caused real-world consequences (like overage charges) with no way to turn it off. However, the federal judge shut down the effort to turn the complaint into a broader case, stating that the issue was basically too user-specific. Still, the judge decided that Turner can amend his complaint and pursue the case on his own, despite Apple’s repeated attempts to convince the court to dismiss the case altogether.
