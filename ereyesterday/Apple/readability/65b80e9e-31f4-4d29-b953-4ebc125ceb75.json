  "description": "Macworld If you were waiting for the perfect time to get the new iPad Pro, well, it’s now. Apple can be fairly stingy about discounts on its high-end tablets, so seeing the powerful M4 iPad Pro down to a brand new best price right for $849 right now with an auto-applied coupon at checkout is a great reason to go buy one. That’s good for $150 under its MSRP and the best price we’ve ever seen. We gave this iPad a rare, perfect 5-star score, praising the tablet’s performance, good battery life, and first-class display and declaring it “the best tablet you can currently get.” The tablet has a gorgeous 11-inch Ultra Retina XDR display that’s super bright and vibrant. That’s Apple’s equivalent to OLEDs, so you can be sure everything will look absolutely amazing. It’s also incredibly thin and light, so it’s going to be super easy to carry around. Its 256GB of storage is more than enough space for all of your apps and media. And with Apple Intelligence on board, you’ll get access to the smarter Siri coming in iOS 18.4 too. If you add in a Magic Keyboard and an Apple Pencil Pro (on sale for $99), you’ll be very close to turning the tablet into a hybrid laptop. Considering how powerful it is, you’ll be able to work all day just like you would with your MacBook Pro. So don’t miss out on the chance to save $150 on the iPad Pro M4 over at Amazon.
