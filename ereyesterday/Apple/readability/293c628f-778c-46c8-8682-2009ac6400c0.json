  "description": "Macworld Apple has released the first beta of iOS 18.6. With all the new features and attention on iOS 26, this release is likely to be simply a bugfix and compatibility update. But while there aren’t any visible changes in iOS 18.6, it may be required to support new hardware Apple could release in the fall, such as AirPods Pro 3 or the upcoming home hub device. As such, 9to5Mac noticed the following string in the code: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ProgressUI.framework/apple-logo-1088@2x~home.png That string’s image has “~home.png” in it, a structure not used in other images, and could be in reference to the rumored upcoming home hub or “HomePad” device. iOS 18.6: How to install the public beta If you want to be among the first to test iOS 18.6, you can sign up for the public beta test. Click Sign Up on the Apple Beta page and register with your Apple ID. Log in to the Beta Software Program. Click Enroll your iOS device. Open the Settings app, tap General, then Software Update. In the Beta Updates section, select the iOS Public Beta. It may take a few moments after registering for the beta option to appear in Software Update. iOS 18.6: How to install the developer beta You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer, but a free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app: Download the Apple Developer App from the App Store. Open the app. Tap on Account. Sign in using your usual Apple ID. Registered developers can choose to get the Public Beta instead by selecting iOS Public Beta in the Software Update screen. It may take a little time after registering as a developer for the option to appear in Software Updates. We expect iOS 18.6 to arrive in July.
