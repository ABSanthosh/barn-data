  "text": "How-To I want those spatial widgets! Image: Apple/D. Griffin Jones/Cult of Mac You can download the visionOS 26 developer beta for free — right now. You can get a look at the exciting new spatial widgets coming to the Vision Pro before the update is shipped to everyone. Unlike other platforms, there is no public beta option, only the developer beta. Of course, there are a few things you should look out for. Beta software can be buggy and can lead to data loss or apps that don’t work. If you’re still sure you want to try it out, you should make sure you have a backup of your most important data with two copies of your photo library before you try installing. I’ll show you how. Table of contents: How to download the visionOS 26 developer beta Check that you have an iCloud backup Check that your photo library is backed up Switch to allow beta software updates Install the update 1. Check that you have an iCloud backup Make sure you have an iCloud backup.Screenshot: D. Griffin Jones/Cult of Mac Before you download the visionOS beta, you should make sure that your Vision Pro is backed up. If you lose important data, if the software update is unsuccessful or if you want to roll back to the stable version of visionOS after trying out the beta, this backup will save your skin. Double check in Settings \u003e [Your Name] \u003e iCloud \u003e iCloud Backup. Right under the button that says “Backup Now,” you should see small text that says, “Last successful backup”. If you have it set up properly, it’ll probably say it last backed up overnight. If not, you need to make a backup. To do so, tap Back Up Now. 2. Check that your photo library is backed up Next, open Photos \u003e Library. Scroll all the way down below the most recent photo to see if your photos are backed up. If it says “Synced with iCloud,” you’re golden. Otherwise, tap Sync Now to make sure you don’t lose anything. If you have a Mac with enough storage (or with an external drive) you should have another copy of your photo library, too. Backing up to iCloud will help if something happens to your Vision Pro, but if a bug corrupts your photo library and those changes are synced to iCloud, a separate copy will make sure you have a safe copy. On your Mac, click on the Finder and open the Home folder with your name (⇧⌘H). Open Pictures. You should see a file called Photo Library. Make a local copy by clicking File \u003e Duplicate (⌘D), or copy it to an external drive by clicking and dragging it over. Then, rename it something descriptive, like Photo Library (Backup). 3. Switch to allow beta software updates Pick “visionOS 26 Developer Beta.” (In this screenshot, visionOS 26 was not yet available.)Screenshot: D. Griffin Jones/Cult of Mac Go to Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update. After it checks for updates, you’ll see the option appear for Beta Updates. Tap that and you’ll see the options currently available: Off, visionOS 26 Developer Beta and visionOS 2 Developer Beta. There is no visionOS public beta, so if you want to be cautious, you should wait a day or two after a software update is released before installing. Tap visionOS 26 Developer Beta to get the flashy new update with all the coolest features like Spatial Photos, new Home and Control Center gestures, a customizable Home View and more. 4. Download the visionOS beta update Tap back and you’ll see the visionOS 26 update available. Tap Update Now to download the visionOS beta and Install Now when it’s ready. It may take longer than a usual software update. At the end, you’ll reboot into the shiny new beta operating system! You can expect to get a new software update about every few weeks until September. We originally published this article on how to download the visionOS beta on June 11, 2024. We updated it with the latest information on June 10, 2025.",
