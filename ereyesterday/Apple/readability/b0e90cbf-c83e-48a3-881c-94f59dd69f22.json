  "text": "Using “Type to Siri” on iPhone and iPad is better than ever thanks to Apple Intelligence, and if you have a new enough iPhone or iPad. Type to Siri with Apple Intelligence includes ChatGPT integration, making it a notably more capable AI assistant, and it’s also much easier to access with the latest devices and iOS/iPadOS versions too. While “Type to Siri” on prior iOS and iPadOS releases is available as an Accessibility option, if you have an Apple Silicon equipped iPad, or an iPhone 15 Pro or newer (sorry iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 Pro users, your device is not Pro enough!), then Type to Siri with Apple Intelligence integration is available all the time and just a tap away. How to Use Type to Siri with Apple Intelligence on iPhone or iPad You must have a iOS 18.2 or later on iPhone 15 Pro or better, or an Apple Silicon iPad, to have the new Type to Siri interface with Apple Intelligence features. Assuming you meet those requirements, here’s how to use it: From the Lock Screen or Home Screen of iPhone or iPad, tap twice on the bottom of the screen, on the little line bar that sort of functions as a virtual Home button This will bring up Type to Siri interface along with the devices virtual keyboard, where you can type out your Siri request as usual If Siri is unable to handle the request directly, it may ask to consult ChatGPT instead As you can see, using Type to Siri and Apple Intelligence this way is much easier than it was in earlier iOS and iPadOS versions, and it doesn’t even need to be enabled separately because it’s on by default. If you find yourself accidentally enabling the Type to Siri interface, you can turn it off at any time by going to Settings \u003e Apple Intelligence \u0026 Siri \u003e Talk \u0026 Type to Siri \u003e toggle “Type to Siri” to the OFF position. If you have an older model iPhone or iPad and it does not support Apple Intelligence, do not fret, you can still enable a more limited Type to Siri interface that doesn’t have Apple Intelligence support, plus you can download and use the official ChatGPT app for iOS/iPadOS to gain incredibly powerful artificial intelligence features and tools on your device. That the official ChatGPT app works on much older iPhone and iPad models compared to native Apple Intelligence support which isn’t even available on iPhone models that Apple still currently sells, is a disappointing decision on Apple’s behalf but surely they had good reasons to make that call. But fortunately the ChatGPT app is free, and is generally much faster than Siri anyway. That’s what I have to do too, even as I write this article about this great feature, because my lowly worthless ancient piece of backwards antiquated technology known as the “iPhone 14 Pro” that I got less than a year ago for $800 is not intelligent enough to be able to use Apple Intelligence (on the plus side my lowly pathetic iPhone 14 Pro still has a Lightning charger so I don’t have to replace a half-dozen chargers anytime soon). By the way, if you have an Apple Silicon Mac, you can use Type to Siri with Apple Intelligence on MacOS too with Sequoia or newer, to gain the same type of features, and the same ChatGPT integration. What do you think of Type to Siri with Apple Intelligence on iPhone and iPad? Are you thrilled with this feature and its capabilities? Are you able to use it with your iPhone or iPad or are you relegated to the Stone Age with your ancient tech that doesn’t support Apple Intelligence?
