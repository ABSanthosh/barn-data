The App Store and other Apple services are facing an outage and are currently down for some users. App Store, Apple Music and more are currently down The outage was confirmed by Apple on its System Status website. According to the company, the App Store, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple TV+, and Podcasts have been affected. The outages began around 2:33 PM PT. “Users are experiencing a problem with this service. We are investigating and will update the status as more information becomes available,” the company says. Although Apple claims that “all users are affected,” some users can still access the App Store and Apple Music. Apple doesn’t provide a timeframe for fixing the outage, so if you’ve been affected, we recommend trying to access Apple’s online services later. We’ll update this article once Apple fixes the outage. Are Apple’s online services down for you this Friday night? Let us know in the comments section below.
