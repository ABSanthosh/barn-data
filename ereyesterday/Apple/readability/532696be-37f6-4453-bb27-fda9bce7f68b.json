  "text": "If you have several iPhone’s, as many people do when they buy a new iPhone, upgrade, get a hand-me-down, develop iPhone software, or develop mobile sites or apps where you test things on multiple devices, you might be in a situation where iPhone Mirroring on the Mac is using an iPhone that you do not want to mirror. If you’re curious how to change the iPhone used by iPhone Mirroring on the Mac, we’ll show you how to do that, and if you overlooked this ability yourself you’ll be easily forgiven because the setting to switch iPhones is not where you might expect it to be. How to Change iPhone Used by iPhone Mirroring Switching which iPhone is used by iPhone Mirroring on the Mac is easy, but it’s in a strange place: From the  Apple menu choose “System Settings” Go to “Desktop \u0026 Dock” (I know, this sounds weird)* Under ‘Widgets’ look for the tiny ‘iPhone’ section, and pull down the drop menu there to select the iPhone you wish to use for iPhone Mirroring Note there is no section titled “iPhone Mirroring” or anything of that nature, it’s under “Widgets” instead, and there’s barely a mention of iPhone Mirroring in the tiny light gray font about the purpose of that particular toggle. Instead, the setting for this is located in a strange location: Desktop \u0026 Dock settings, under the “Widgets” section. * If that setting location makes sense to you, you might work at Apple and are the person who located the iPhone Mirroring settings in that location, because for the average end Mac user, that is not really where someone might expect to find iPhone Mirroring settings. Weirdly enough, “Desktop \u0026 Dock” is also where you change the default web browser on the Mac, and even adjust Mission Control and Stage Manager, making the “Desktop \u0026 Dock” settings panel a mishmash of MacOS things that have nothing to do with the Desktop, or the Dock. Changing iPhone Used by iPhone Mirroring via App You can also go to iPhone Mirroring \u003e Settings \u003e and click the “Change iPhone” button, but all that does is redirect you to the aforementioned “Desktop \u0026 Dock” system settings panel. Can I mirror multiple iPhone’s at the same time? Currently it is not possible to mirror several iPhone’s at the same time on a Mac. It’s always possible this capability will arrive later, but for now the iPhone Mirroring feature is limited to a single iPhone, though you can change which of your iPhone devices is mirrored with the instructions provided here. – What do you think of the iPhone Mirroring feature? Have you tried it out yet with your iPhone and Mac? Do you use it with multiple iPhones?",
