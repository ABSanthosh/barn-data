A new Apple Immersive concert experience, Metallica, is coming to Apple Vision Pro this Friday, March 14. Filmed in Mexico City during the sold-out second-year finale of the band’s M72 World Tour, Metallica features full performances of three longtime staples from the band’s stadium-filling live shows — “Whiplash,” “One,” and “Enter Sandman” — and was captured exclusively in Apple Immersive Video. This remarkable storytelling format is only possible on Apple Vision Pro, with ultra-high-resolution 180-degree video and Spatial Audio to give viewers unprecedented access to James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo — from vantage points as close up as the famed Snake Pit, to wide-angle views of the band’s energetic performance in the round. Customers can book an Apple Vision Pro demo at their local Apple Store to experience the magic of spatial computing, and enjoy an extended preview of Metallica beginning this Friday. Users can also enjoy the band’s performance with a new EP, M72 World Tour: Mexico City, available in Spatial Audio on Apple Music this Friday. “Game changing is putting it lightly,” said Lars Ulrich of Metallica. “Seeing our concert like that, along with the energy of the Mexico City fans — it’s very immersive, and it’s super fun. We’ve always been interested in pushing the boundaries, and Metallica on Apple Vision Pro is exactly that.” “Apple Immersive Video transforms the way people experience storytelling, and we’re thrilled to collaborate with Metallica on a concert unlike any before it,” said Tor Myhren, Apple’s vice president of Marketing Communications. “With Metallica on Apple Vision Pro, you feel like you’re right there: front row, backstage, and even on stage with one of the biggest bands of all time.” Metallica features full performances of three longtime staples from the band’s stadium-filling live shows — “Whiplash,” “One,” and “Enter Sandman” — and was captured exclusively in Apple Immersive Video. To capture the band’s full performance from multiple perspectives, and the energy of over 65,000 passionate Metallica fans, Apple built a custom stage layout featuring 14 Apple Immersive Video cameras using a mix of stabilized cameras, cable-suspended cameras, and remote-controlled camera dolly systems that moved around the stage. Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich spoke with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about the Apple Immersive concert experience, the band’s enduring commitment to their fans, and the next leg of the band’s M72 World Tour at SXSW 2025 this afternoon. “I’ve been a music fan my whole life, and I’ve never experienced anything like this,” said Lowe. “It’s not just the best seat in the house — it’s like you’re in the only seat on stage.” Their full conversation will be available on the SXSW YouTube channel.
