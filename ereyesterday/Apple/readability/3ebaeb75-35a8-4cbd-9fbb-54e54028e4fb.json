Photo: Cult of Mac Deals This SleepEez deal knocks HyperGear’s mini noise-blocking sleep earbuds down to just $25.99 (regularly $34.99). These tiny buds block out distractions and lull you into deep, uninterrupted sleep. Featured at CES 2025, these earbuds are ultra-slim, lightweight and comfortable enough for side sleepers. They shield your ears from snoring and other undesirable sounds that can keep you awake. And right now, you can grab a pair for just $25.99 (regularly $34.99). Your well-rested future self will thank you. SleepEez deal: Snooze soundly with noise-blocking sleep earbuds When we were kids, no one warned us about the struggles we might face with snoring in our adulthood. You’re exhausted, you finally crawl into bed, and then your partner starts snoring. If counting sheep isn’t cutting it, it’s time for a real sleep solution. Sleep earbuds like SleepEez (or the similar but more expensive Soundcore A20 earbuds) can really help. Unfortunately, our beloved AirPods and most other wireless earbuds aren’t made for sleep. They’re bulky, uncomfortable and jam into your ear when you roll over. This SleepEez deal fixes that with a mini, ultra-flat design that’s pressure-free and so light (just 3 grams each) that you’ll forget you’re even wearing them. They provide -20dB of passive noise blocking, which helps muffle snoring, traffic and noisy neighbors. And unlike bulky noise machines, SleepEez delivers soothing, immersive audio without disturbing your partner. The built-in sleep timer lets you choose between 30-, 60-, 90- and 120-minute shutoff options. That way your music, white noise or ASMR-inducing audio will automatically turn off once you fall asleep. And with the SleepEez sleep earbuds, there’s waking up tangled in wires. No fumbling for buttons in the middle of the night. Just pure, uninterrupted sleep. Listen to whatever helps you snooze Whether you love white noise, guided meditations, soft music, podcasts or audiobooks, SleepEez delivers a soothing, high-quality audio experience designed for relaxation. With Bluetooth 5.4, these sleep earbuds pair seamlessly with your phone, tablet or smart device, ensuring a strong, skip-free connection all night long. And if you ever need to take a quick call or use a voice assistant, the built-in microphones will do the trick. One charge provides up to 20 hours of battery life. And if you need a quick boost, just plug in the SleepEez sleep earbuds for a 60-minute fast charge before bedtime. This SleepEez deal gives you a solid night’s sleep For just $25.99 (regularly $34.99), you can snag a set of SleepEez mini noise-blocking wireless earbuds and get the rest you deserve.
