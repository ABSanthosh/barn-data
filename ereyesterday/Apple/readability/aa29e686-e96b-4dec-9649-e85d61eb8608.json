Here's a roundup of the best deals AppleInsider has found. This Black Friday roundup highlights some fantastic deals on must-have software. These deals cater to a wide range of users, including professional creatives, business users, and students by providing creative suites and essential office tools at discounted prices. Adobe Creative Cloud Unleash your creativity this holiday season with a Black Friday deal on Adobe Creative Cloud. Enjoy 50% off your first year of the All Apps plan subscription. Adobe Creative Cloud now 50% off - Image credit: Adobe Adobe Creative Cloud is the standard for many creative professionals. It includes apps like Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere, and Illustrator. All are available for Mac, with many apps having iOS and iPadOS counterparts. Microsoft Office Home 2024 The Microsoft Office Mac 2024 license is now available for a one-time purchase, offering a hassle-free experience without needing a subscription. This license gives you access to all of the classic Office apps, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Microsoft Office 2024 - Image credit: Microsoft You can score a Microsoft Office 2024 Home license for a single Mac or PC from Amazon for only $99.99. Parallels Desktop Whether you're a professional needing Windows-exclusive software, a student who requires a different operating system for specific classes, or just someone who wants the flexibility of multiple OS environments, Parallels Desktop makes it possible. Parallels Desktop is now 25% off - Image credit: Parallels Thanks to an early Black Friday sale, Parallels Desktop is now 25% off, dropping the price down to $74.99 for a one-year subscription. VPNs A Virtual Private Network (VPN) service provides plenty of perks when it comes to using the web. It safeguards your browsing habits, enables access to international marketplaces and services, and maintains security. VPN services are up to 70% off - Image credit: Surfshark and ExpressVPN Surfshark VPN You can snag Surfshark at up to 87% off with an extra 4 months when you buy a 24-month plan. That drops the price down to $1.99 per month for Surfshark Starter, $2.49 per month for Surfshark One, and $3.99 per month for Surfshark One+. ExpressVPN Of course, ExpressVPN had to get in on the Black Friday deals as well. You can get 30-month subscription to ExpressVPN for 61% off â€” just $4.99 a month. This holiday deal also adds new features not available in other ExpressVPN packages, including a monthly credit report and a new data removal tool to help you remove your personal information from data brokerages.
