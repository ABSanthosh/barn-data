  "text": "President Trump and his family are getting into the wireless business, in partnership with the three major U.S. carriers. The Trump Organization on Monday announced Trump Mobile, which will offer 5G service with an unlimited plan (the “47 Plan”) priced at $47.45 per month. The new venture joins the lineup of the company’s other businesses, which span luxury hotels, golf clubs, casinos, retail and other real estate properties. The president’s two oldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, made the announcement at a press conference at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Customers can switch to Trump Mobile’s T1 Mobile service using their current phone. In addition, in August, Trump Mobile plans to release the “T1 Phone” — described as “a sleek, gold smartphone engineered for performance and proudly designed and built in the United States for customers who expect the best from their mobile carrier.” Popular on Variety “Trump Mobile is going to change the game,” Donald Trump Jr. said in a statement. “We’re building on the movement to put America first, and we will deliver the highest levels of quality and service. Our company is based right here in the United States because we know it’s what our customers want and deserve.” Trump Mobile functions as a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, offering 5G service through the three U.S. major wireless carriers — A\u0026T, Verizon and T-Mobile USA. Other examples of MVNOs include Consumer Cellular, Ryan Reynolds’ Mint Mobile (owned by T-Mobile) and SmartLess Mobile, launched last week by the trio behind the “SmartLess” podcast (Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett) in conjunction with T-Mobile. Trump Mobile and its carrier partners are subject to regulatory oversight by the Federal Communications Commission, which is headed by Trump-appointed FCC chairman Brendan Carr. Meanwhile, the Trump Mobile “47 Plan” is pricier than the unlimited plans from prepaid services operated by Verizon’s Visible, AT\u0026T’s Cricket Wireless and T-Mobile’s Metro, which are each around $40 per month. Trump Mobile T1 Phone The Trump T1 Phone, which runs Google’s Android operating system, will cost $499. It features a 6.8-inch touch-screen with a 120 Hz refresh rate. The smartphone also has a “fingerprint sensor and AI Face Unlock,” according to the company’s website. Reps for Trump Mobile didn’t respond to an inquiry about what company is manufacturing the Android phone. The Trump Organization said Trump Mobile’s customer-service team is based in the United States and available 24 hours a day. “When customers call, they’re talking to a real person,” according to the company. The Trump Mobile “47 Plan” benefits include: “complete device protection”; 24-hour roadside assistance through Drive America; free international calling to more than 100 countries; telehealth services, including virtual medical care, mental health support and ordering of prescription medications. The plan does not require subscribers to sign any contracts, and there are no credit checks required, according to Trump Mobile. Trump Mobile’s site also includes a disclaimer stating that it is “not liable for service interruptions, delays, or damages caused by third-party providers outside of our direct control.” More details are available at trumpmobile.com. For 2024, Trump reported more than $600 million in income, including about $57.4 million from the World Liberty Financial cryptocurrency platform, according to a mandatory financial disclosure form released Friday by the Office of Government Ethics. (The disclosure form does not include income he generated from the $TRUMP meme coin, which was released in January 2025.) As of Feb. 20, 2025, Trump owned 114.75 million shares of Trump Media \u0026 Technology Group (which operates Truth Social) through a revocable trust, representing 52% of total outstanding shares; those holdings are currently worth more than $2.2 billion. Ahead of Monday’s announcement, the Trump Organization had said, “On June 16, 2025, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump will return to the iconic Trump Tower to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of their father famously coming down the escalator and announcing to the world that he was running for President of the United States. Ten years later, they will make a major announcement of a new initiative the Trump Organization is launching that will change the game once again.”",
