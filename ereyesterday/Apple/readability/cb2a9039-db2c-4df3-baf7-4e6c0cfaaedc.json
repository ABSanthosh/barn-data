  "text": "News Dystopian drama series \"Silo\" returned to Apple TV+ for its second season, and plenty of viewers tuned in. Photo: Apple TV+ The ongoing mystery in sci-fi series Silo season two keeps pulling in viewers. It appears on lists of the top 10 most popular streaming series maintained by two separate ratings companies. And the feel-good comedy Shrinking season two drew an audience last week, too. Silo remains a towering hit for Apple TV+ Over the past five years, Apple TV+ built a reputation as a source for top-quality sci-fi. It’s the home of phenomenal successes like Severance, plus popular series like Dark Matter, Foundation and For All Mankind. Silo is one of its bigger hits. Silo is based on the bestselling books by Hugh Howey, and that name recognition gave the series a boost when it launched in 2023. And the audience stayed and grew as season one went along. Now viewers came back for season two, which premiered on November 15. Movie and TV search engine JustWatch releases a weekly list of the 10 most popular series on streaming, and Silo sits at No. 6 for the week of Nov. 25 to Dec. 1. And rival service Reelgood put the show at No. 5 on its equivalent list for Nov. 28 to Dec. 4. The Apple TV+ sci-fi series Silo maintains its popularity.Photo: JustWatch Estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. Apple’s official description of the series says: Silo is the story of the last ten thousand people on Earth, their mile-deep home protecting them from the toxic and deadly world outside. However, no one knows when or why the silo was built, and those who try to find out face fatal consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette, an engineer who seeks answers about a loved one’s murder and tumbles onto a mystery that goes far deeper than she could have ever imagined, leading her to discover that if the lies don’t kill you, the truth will. The first four episodes of Silo season two can be enjoyed now, while the next is coming on Friday. Watch to catch up? Season one is ready to be binge-watched. Shrinking is a hit for Apple TV+ … again Shrinking season one found real success for Apple TV+, and when season two premiered on the streaming service, its audience from last year came back. The comedy/drama starring Jason Segel and Harrison Ford as psychotherapists holds the No. 10 on the  Reelgood list of Top 10 TV shows last week. Apple’s official description of the series says: “Shrinking follows a grieving therapist (played by Segel) who starts to break the rules and tell his clients exactly what he thinks. Ignoring his training and ethics, he makes huge, tumultuous changes to people’s lives … including his own.” That could be the description for a drama, but the show generally plays with the premise for laughs. It’s a feel-good comedy with a dose of drama. The first nine episodes of Shrinking season two can be enjoyed now, while the next is coming on Wednesday. Watch to catch up? Season one is ready to be binge-watched. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming Silo and Shrinking, plus many other series and films, comes with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. And Apple’s streaming video service also includes much more, of course. There’s a library of drama, comedies, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
