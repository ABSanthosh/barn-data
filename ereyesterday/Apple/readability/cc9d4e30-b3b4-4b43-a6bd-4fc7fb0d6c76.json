Users' previously scheduled payments will be processed as normal, unless a payment is canceled via Apple Wallet, online, or with the help of an Apple Card Specialist. The wildfires in the Los Angeles area have caused significant damage, with thousands of structures destroyed. Thousands of people have left the area, and the current death toll is unknown at the time of writing. At least six people are known to have died as a result of the wildfires. In a social media post on X, Apple's CEO Tim Cook has described the Los Angeles fires as heartbreaking. He also praised the heroic efforts of first responders, and said that Apple would make a donation to support relief efforts. The devastation caused by the fires in Los Angeles is heartbreaking. Thank you to the incredible firefighters, first responders, and all those assisting for your heroic efforts. Apple will be donating to support the victims and recovery efforts on the ground. https://t.co/9ry0olSQFh— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) January 9, 2025Apple typically provides assistance for users affected by natural disasters as a means of easing the financial burden in times of crisis. The company also frequently donates to natural disaster relief efforts, as was the case in October 2024 during the aftermath of Hurricane Milton.",
