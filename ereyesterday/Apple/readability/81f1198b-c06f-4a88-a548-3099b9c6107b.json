  "text": "Updates this week to the Gemini app on Android and iPhone introduce a new app icon that adopts the four Google colors. The new four-color logo takes after every other Google icon. It’s still predominantly blue at the right, while the other points are red, yellow, and green. There’s also a nice gradient at center-left like the current ‘G’ icon. The four points are rounded and not as sharp as before for a friendlier look. At small sizes, like on your homescreen, it means the icon doesn’t fade out into very thin lines. Finally, the new logo is slightly larger than the last one and takes up more of the white circular background, which always helps. Ultimately, Google moving to red, yellow, green, and blue brings Gemini into the fold, and can be seen as a sign of confidence. The sparkle shape is unique enough so it shouldn’t be easily confused with other first-party applications. After Android and iPhone, we’re still waiting for the new Gemini icon on gemini.google.com. Old vs. new With this update, Google has also tweaked the homescreen widget on Android. (There are no changes to the iOS version.) Besides the new icon, there are now shortcuts for Video and Screenshare that launch those Gemini Live modes directly. It’s pretty convenient, with Google emphasizing those new actions in smaller configurations. Overall, the widget is less dense than before, with one less shortcut at some sizes. At 3×3 and above, you get all eight shortcuts: open app (with keyboard activated), voice input, Camera, Gallery, Files, Video, Screenshare, and Live. Lastly, the “Ask Gemini” field is now just the “Gemini” bar with Google no longer giving it a separate Dynamic Color background. As of Friday, version 1.0.776555963 of the Gemini app is now widely available via the Play Store. On iOS, version 1.2025.2562103 rolled out on Wednesday, with Google making official the ability to search past conversations, like on the web. Tap the chat icon in the top-left corner for the new search field, with this feature not yet on Android.
