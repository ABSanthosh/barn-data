  "text": "Did you know that your internet service provider default DNS servers almost certainly track and log your online activity? Basically this means that every time you visit a website or use an internet-connected application from your Mac, iPhone or iPad, your ISP is aware of that. Many ISP’s will not only log and track your online activity gathered through DNS lookups, but some will sell that data and share it with partners and data brokers too. One way to get around this is to use a privacy focused DNS service, like Surfshark DNS, which is a free DNS offering that emphasizes privacy and does not track or log your online activity. There are other free DNS services like this out there too, including Cloudflare DNS, and Apple’s own iCloud Private Relay offering also uses a custom DNS with privacy protections, but having more options is always a good thing, so let’s review how you can setup the privacy protecting Surfshark DNS on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad Important: Custom DNS on Mac, iPhone, \u0026 iPad Will Disable iCloud Private Relay Note that by changing or using custom DNS on Mac, iPhone, or iPad you will end up disabling iCloud Private Relay, which is an iCloud feature from Apple that helps protect your privacy as well. iCloud Private Relay is achieved by routing DNS requests through the Apple service, which also hides your IP address for added privacy when using the web as well as other services. Keep this in mind if you are setting custom DNS on a Mac, iPhone, or iPad, and it’s relevant whether you use any DNS service whether from Surfshark, Cloudflare, Google DNS, or any other custom DNS option on those devices. Of course, iCloud Private Relay is only available to paid iCloud subscribers and there are some regional restrictions as well, so it’s not an option for everyone, and that’s perhaps where using privacy-centric DNS, like this offering from Surfshark, makes the most sense. How to Use Surfshark DNS on Mac Remember, setting custom DNS on a Mac will disable iCloud Private Relay. From the  Apple menu go to “System Settings” Go to “Network” and then click on “Wi-Fi” Locate your current wi-fi network connection (at the top of the settings) and click on “Details” Select the “DNS” option from the left side, and click the + plus button to add a new DNS server Enter the Surfshark DNS number as follows: 194.169.169.169 Click “OK” to set the Surfshark DNS The change should take effect immediately, though you should quit and relaunch any internet connected apps, and you might need to flush your DNS cache on the Mac as well. How to Use Surfshark DNS on iPhone \u0026 iPad Assuming you don’t care if iCloud Private Relay gets disabled or perhaps it’s not available for use in your region, using Surfshark DNS on your iPhone or iPad may be desirable. Here’s how to get that setup: Open the “Settings” app on iPhone or iPad Go to “Wi-Fi” and find your router, then tap on the (i) button next to it Scroll down to “Configure DNS” and tap on that Tap on “Manual” and then tap on “Add Server”, then enter the Surfshark DNS server IP: 194.169.169.169 Choose to “Save” and your custom DNS is now set You might need to flush DNS cache on the iPhone or iPad by toggling AirPlane mode on and off for the change to take effect. Now whether you’re using an iPhone, Mac, or iPad, you’ve got your Surfshark privacy DNS setup and configured, and as long as you’re using the wi-fi network you chose these custom DNS settings for, you’ll have that added privacy benefit. There are many different DNS services out there with varying features and benefits, but let’s give a quick shoutout to CultOfMac for pointing out the Surfshark DNS offering, which is where I first became aware of this offering. Do you use a custom privacy focused DNS service like this, do you use iCloud Private Relay, or do you use something even more protective of privacy like a VPN?
