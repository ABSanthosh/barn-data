An early Black Friday deal on the Costco Gold Star or Executive membership offers new members a free $45 Shop Card just in time for holiday shopping. Whether you're looking to pick up a new monitor for the 2024 M4 Mac mini or are eager to finally commit to an OLED TV to pair with your Apple TV 4K, this Costco membership deal has you covered. Offered through StackSocial, new members can purchase a 1-year Gold Star or Executive membership and get a free $45 Digital Shop Card. It's the best offer we've seen this year on the warehouse club membership, and there's no guarantee it will last all season long. Considering the 1-year Gold Star membership option is $65 per year, this offer on your first year of access to the warehouse club really is enticing. The main perk of the Executive membership is the ability to earn an annual 2% reward (up to $1,250) on qualifying purchases at Costco, which can really add up if you regularly shop for groceries, home tech, and household essentials. You can also get extra benefits on select Costco Travel products. This Costco deal is valid for new members only and members whose memberships have been expired for more than 18 months. The offer also applies to those that are located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Qualified members will receive the digital Costco Shop Card by email within two weeks of redeeming their purchase. The offer must be redeemed by January 31, 2025 to qualify for the promotion, but buyers are encouraged to redeem it within 30 days of purchase. With Apple's abundance of hardware releases in Late 2024, there are plenty of offers to grab in our Apple Price Guide that can be used in tandem with accessories and monitors available at Costco. Here's just a sampling of the trending discounts ahead of Black Friday: Save up to $200 on Apple's M4 14-inch \u0026 16-inch MacBook Pro Apple's new M4 iMac is up to $100 off, plus $20 off AppleCare Get a MacBook Pro M4 with AppleCare from $52/mo, with option to upgrade every 2 years Best VPN deals for November 2024",
