Launching exclusively on Apple Arcade on July 3, Angry Birds Bounce is a new take on one of the most iconic mobile game series of all time with over 5 billion lifetime downloads. The new game blends Angry Birds’ classic slingshot gameplay with arcade-style brick-breaker mechanics, creating an all-new adventure full of chaotic charm and action-packed fun. “Angry Birds Bounce reinvents the classic Angry Birds formula with a vertical twist, refreshing the gameplay while staying true to the brand’s DNA,” said Bryan Cook, Angry Birds Bounce game lead at Rovio. “We are thrilled to bring this new experience exclusively to Apple Arcade, featuring the largest roster of Angry Birds characters ever, and we can’t wait to see our players’ reactions to this new title.” Three more popular games will also be added from the App Store on July 3: Kingdom Rush 5: Alliance TD+, the most recent entry in the acclaimed tower defense franchise; Suika Game+, a delightful fruit-merging puzzle game; and Crayola Scribble Scrubbie Pets+, which transforms Crayola’s favorite kids’ pet toys into digital companions. Angry Birds Bounce by Rovio Join Red, Chuck, Bomb, and the rest of the gang on a brand-new adventure. Angry Birds Bounce combines the classic charm of Angry Birds with an innovative arcade brick-breaker twist. When the pigs take over their islands, the birds must bounce back — literally — combining into powerful flocks and launching themselves to defeat an army of piggies and reclaim their home. With strategic rogue-lite gameplay, each level is a new challenge where players will master precision shots, unlock exciting power-ups, and build unique combos during each run.

With 15 epic heroes to choose from, 17 unique towers, 32 upgradable characters, 22 detailed campaign stages, and over 40 types of enemies, Kingdom Rush 5: Alliance TD+ offers thrilling gameplay, the signature humor that fans love, and endless replay.
