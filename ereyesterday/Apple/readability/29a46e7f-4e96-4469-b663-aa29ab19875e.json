  "description": "Macworld The iPhone SE 4 is coming Wednesday, so if you’re upgrading, you need to get yourself some new USB-C charging cables. None are better than Apple’s, especially when they’re on sale: Amazon is selling Apple’s 1m USB-C cable for 20 percent off today, which means you can get one for $15 right now. And what’s more, you can also grab Apple’s 35W dual-port charger for $35, a total savings of $24 on a great charging set. These Apple cables have a woven design, which means they will survive more bends and plugs, and even your overstuffed backpack pockets. The cables support charging of up to 60W, but you can also use it to transfer data if needed. Since Apple is officially swapping over to type-C cables with all its products now that the new iPhone SE is coming out, you’ll be able to use the same one for multiple devices, including iPads and MacBooks. With a compact design and dual USB-C ports, Apple’s 35W dual-port power adapter will fit right in with the rest of your Apple gear. It’s also travel-ready with foldable prongs so it won’t snag on any fear in your backpack. It maxes out at 35W, which is more than enough power to fast charge most of your Apple devices, including a MacBook Air. So get ready for Apple’s first non-Lightning iPhone SE with great prices on Apple’s 1m USB-C cable and dual-port charger for $35",
