Week after week, there’s no show on streaming more popular than “Severance.” Image: Apple/Cult of Mac Severance hit the top of the weekly list most-watched streaming series for the fifth time during its season two, according to a company that tracks ratings. Week after week, the weird workplace drama on Apple TV+ keeps beating series on any streaming service. And the new crime drama Dope Thief became one of the popular series on streaming. Severance mysteries keep a grip on audiences Severance drew in huge audiences during its first season, and when season two returned in January, large numbers of fans tuned in. And have stayed around. Enough to push the show to the very top of the ratings charts five times since the new season started, including last week. Movie and TV search engine JustWatch publishes a weekly ratings list of the 10 most popular series on streaming, and Severance sits at No. 1 for the week of March 10 through March 16. Rival service Reelgood also put the show in the No. 1 slot on its list for top rated series for the week of March 13 to March 19. A ratings service says Severance is the popular streaming series in March 2025… again.Photo: JustWatch Ratings estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. And Apple itself chimed in recently, crowing that Severance recently passed Ted Lasso as the most popular Apple TV+ show ever. In the hit series, Mark Scout (played by Adam Scott) leads a team of employees who’ve undergone a severance procedure that surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Scout finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work … and of himself. The season finale of Severance season two debuted this week, so the entire show is ready to binge watch. Haven’t watch the finale yet? Be sure you didn’t miss anything important with Cult of Mac’s recaps of episode one, episode two, episode three, episode four, episode five, episode six, episode seven, episode eight, episode nine and episode ten. Plus, start looking forward to Severance season three, which got an official greenlight from Apple this week. Ridley Scott’s Dope Thief crime drama gets high ratings, too Plenty of viewers also checked out the recently launched Dope Thief, a drama produced and directed by the brilliant Ridley Scott. Reelgood put it in the No. 9 slot on its list of popular shows on any streaming service last week. It’s a gritty drama with some humor in which two lifelong friends have a good thing going, posing as DEA agents and ripping off small-time drug dealers — until they shake down the wrong house, The Cult of Mac review says, “For fans of sophisticated crime dramas, Dope Thief on Apple TV+ offers a compelling blend of stellar performances, intricate storytelling and high production values.” The first three episodes of the series are ready to watch now. The next premieres on Friday. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming hits like Severance, Dope Thief, plus many others comes with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. And Apple’s streaming video service also includes a library of drama, comedies, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
