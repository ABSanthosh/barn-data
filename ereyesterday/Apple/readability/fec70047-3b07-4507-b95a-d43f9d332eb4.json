The Apple TV+ workplace thriller \"Severance\" is arriving back on the service on January 17. As part of its promotion of the show, Apple is giving Roku owners an opportunity to catch up. The entire first season of the show will be available on the Roku Channel as part of an \"exclusive fan experience,\" from now until January 19. Included with the season, the channel will also preview the second season of the show and offer behind-the-scenes content, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Viewers will also be able to claim a three-month trial of Apple TV+. The effort is a highly promotional one for Apple, as it will be directly accessible from the Roku home screen. With approximately 90 million users, it's a massive opportunity for subscriber outreach for Apple. \"Partnering with Apple ahead of the highly anticipated Severance season 2 and being able to create an exclusive fan experience that is available to millions of U.S. households, including offering Apple TV+ content outside of the Apple ecosystem, on the Roku Channel for the first time ever, is incredibly exciting for us,\" according to Roku VP of growth marketing and merchandising, Sweta Patel. \"Part of the magic of the Roku platform is that we can work with our brand partners to create bespoke experiences that our viewers love and achieve our partner's goals.\" The free period and three-month trial offer follows after a free weekend for the service overall. Apple has also been expanding the reach of Apple TV, making a deal to offer content through Amazon Prime Video Channels.",
