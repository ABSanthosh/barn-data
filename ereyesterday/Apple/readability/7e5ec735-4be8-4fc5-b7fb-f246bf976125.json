Photo: Cult of Mac Deals While Apple’s AirTag is an incredible invention, helping you locate misplaced keys or luggage in seconds, the tracking tag’s circular design leaves an awkward lump if you cram one in your wallet. Luckily, the MagTag — a credit card-size wallet tracker that will slide right in — also works with Apple’s Find My network. Yes, the MagTag functions much like an AirTag, giving you an easy way to find a lost wallet. And yet its sleek design won’t leave an unwanted bulge. It’s cheaper than an AirTag, too, and it’s even more affordable with an exclusive discount from Cult of Mac Deals. For a limited time, you can get a MagTag for just $23.97. MagTag wallet tracker goes where an AirTag really won’t Rather than struggle with stuffing your AirTag into your wallet or office lanyard, the MagTag neatly fits inside, eliminating the typical lump an AirTag might leave. You might even forget it’s in your belongings. At least, until you forget where you put your wallet, your office swipe, etc. Here’s how the MagTag wallet tracker works: It shows up in Apple’s Find My tracker app on your iPhone, iPad or Mac, letting you view the MagTag’s location. Missing something? Check its location on the app’s map, which offers real-time global tracking at all times. If it’s nearby, have the Find My app play a sound on the tracking card to locate your wallet. You might find that you left it in your jacket pocket or your grocery bag. Never leave your belongings behind again Just imagine how much time (and stress) the MagTag wallet tracker will save you when you’ve misplaced something. Here’s a pro tip: You can prevent any further misplacement or loss by having the Find My app notify you if you leave your wallet or office lanyard behind. This tracking card will beep before you get in your car or on the subway. Be sure to keep your MagTag charged so you can actually track where your items are. Unlike the AirTag, which requires you to replace the batteries outright, this device only needs a top up every five months or so. Just place it on a Qi wireless charging pad to conveniently fill ‘er up. Keep tabs on your wallet with MagTag tracker card Stop panicking when you misplace your wallet. Grab a MagTag tracker card for just $23.97. Buy from: Cult of Mac Deals Prices subject to change. All sales handled by StackSocial, our partner who runs Cult of Mac Deals.
