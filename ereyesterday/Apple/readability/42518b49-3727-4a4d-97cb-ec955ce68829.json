  "text": "The third betas of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and MacOS Sequoia 15.2, are available for beta testers of Apple system software. The latest betas continue to emphasize on new Apple Intelligence features, including ChatGPT integration, Genmoji custom Emoji creation, Image Playground for AI image generation, and more. These new AI features are in addition to the existing helpful Apple Intelligence features that includes writing tools, summaries, smart replies, and similar functionality. Separately from AI features, there are also some refinements to the Settings apps, iPhone Mirroring can be used with Personal Hotspot at the same time, Find My gains an ability to share items, the Mac adds an optional menu bar weather widget, and a few other smaller features as well. How to Install iOS 18.2 beta 3 and/or iPadOS 18.2 beta 3 Installing the latest iOS/iPadOS beta is easy if you’re currently enrolled in in the beta testing programs: Open “Settings”, and then choose “General” Go to “Software Update” Choose to update to iOS 18.3 or iPadOS 18.3 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.2 beta 3 Updating to the latest Mac beta is just like any other software update: From the  Apple menu, go to “System Settings” Go to “General”, then choose “Software Update” Choose “Update Now” to install the latest beta of MacOS Sequoia 15.2 When will iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and MacOS Sequoia 15.2 be released? A report from Bloomberg suggests that Apple is aiming for a December release for iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and MacOS Sequoia 15.2. This would be in line with Apple’s typical release schedule which typically refines through several versions of betas before issuing a final version to the general public. With beta 3 just released, it’s likely there will be multiple other betas released before final versions are available by the end of the year.",
