On Monday, Apple released iOS 18.2 developer beta 2, which brings iOS 18.2 to iPhone models as old as the iPhone XR and iPhone XS. The first developer beta, released two weeks prior, was only intended for Apple Intelligence testing and was thus only compatible with the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 16 range. As a whole, iOS 18.2 introduces support for a variety of Apple Intelligence features, including Image Playground, Genmoji, and Visual Intelligence on the iPhone 16. ChatGPT integration with Siri and Writing Tools is also a part of the update, and Monday's developer beta expands upon many of these features with new settings and splash screens. Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeMore options for ChatGPT in the Settings app The second developer beta of iOS 18.2 introduces additional options for ChatGPT-powered features, building upon the previous developer beta which brought ChatGPT integration to iOS. Starting with iOS 18.2, Siri can forward questions and requests to ChatGPT. The software can help users with things such as text creation in Writing Tools, as well as image generation. New splash screens have been added to inform users of ChatGPT-enabled features and their benefits. While basic ChatGPT functionality is available at any time, and at no cost, iOS 18.2 only offers advanced ChatGPT capabilities in a limited capacity. With Monday's developer beta, users will now be able to see whether or not they've exceeded the daily limit for ChatGPT's advanced capabilities. iOS 18.2 developer beta 2 includes new settings for ChatGPT-powered features. Once the advanced capability limit has been passed, additional requests are sent to the basic version of ChatGPT for up to 24 hours. Those who want even more now have the option to upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $19.99 a month, straight from the Settings app. It's worth pointing out that ChatGPT integration is only available for devices that already support Apple Intelligence, such as the iPhone 16 range. With its latest iOS 18.2 beta, Apple has also included new settings specific to these devices. Additional Camera Control settings for iPhone 16 users Monday's iOS 18.2 developer beta introduces additional settings for the Camera Control, which was introduced with the iPhone 16 range. The Camera Control is an entirely new hardware component, a button with a capacitive surface and a force sensor. iOS 18.2 developer beta 2 includes additional settings for the Camera Control button. iOS 18.2 developer beta 2 now lets users adjust the double-click speed for Camera Control. Apart from the \"Default\" option, the double-click speed can be set to \"Slow\" or \"Slower.\" The software update also adds a new \"AE/AF Lock\" option, which locks the exposure and focus when taking a photo. The Camera Control can be configured to toggle AE/AF Lock with a light press. This means that the exposure stays consistent and that the image won't darken, even when the iPhone is moved around. FindMy has received a significant update with Monday's developer beta, as the software now lets users share the location of lost items with people they trust. The locations of lost items such as AirTags can be shared with trusted individuals. When an AirTag or other item is lost, users can opt to share the location of the item with a trusted individual or even an airline, all so that the lost item can be more easily recovered. This could be particularly useful for lost luggage, though FindMy-equipped devices have also helped authorities locate stolen vehicles in some instances. The lost item's location is shared in the form of a link. The link recipient will be able to see the AirTag's location, serial number, and the user's Apple Account email or phone number for a limited amount of time. Location sharing is automatically stopped once the item is found, or when the link to the item's location expires. Web Content filters are now automatically enabled for minors in Utah While Monday's developer beta features different enhancements for the Camera Control, ChatGPT, and FindMy, it also includes a significant change specifically affecting Utah residents aged 17 or under. iOS 18.2 developer beta 2 includes an automatically-enabled web content filter for Utah residents 17 and under. Utah requires that mobile devices such as the iPhone and iPad include an automatically-enabled web content filter, which limits websites with adult content. This serves to protect minors and prevents them from accessing harmful and inappropriate content on the web. The second developer beta of iOS 18.2 ensures compliance with this requirement, as the filter is on by default for Utah residents below the age of 18. Note that the web content filter is not automatically enabled in other states, countries, and regions where it is not required by law. Other changes and enhancements in iOS 18.2 developer beta 2 iOS 18.2 also received a minor aesthetic change with Monday's developer beta, which affects the icons in Settings. When Dark Mode is enabled, icons in the Settings app now have a distinct gray border. The new icon outlines allow for increased contrast within the application. Dark Mode icons have a new look in the Settings app. Various quality-of-life improvements for existing device features are present within the operating system as well, with the latest iOS 18.2 bringing better battery life, according to Apple's release notes. Certain system applications and features have also received minor updates: Mail — a new option for app badges, letting users choose whether they appear only for primary unread messages or all unread messages. iPhone Mirroring — allows users to mirror their iPhone screen even when a Mac is using it as a personal hotspot. Notes — an additional \"Create Image\" button that appears when text is selected. Shortcuts — three new shortcuts related to the Fitness application. None of these changes are particularly significant, given that they largely build upon existing applications and their features. Apple already added support for image generation with the first iOS 18.2 developer beta, while app badges have been available since the early days of iOS. visionOS 2.2 introduces new Wide and Ultrawide views for Mac Virtual Display The visionOS 2.2 developer beta, on the other hand, includes a major improvement to the Mac Virtual Display feature. While the Apple Vision Pro was always usable as an external display for Mac, there are now two new display modes: Ultrawide and Wide. According to Apple, the new Ultrawide setting is the equivalent of connecting two 4K monitors to a Mac and using them side-by-side. visionOS 2.2 beta adds a new Wide and Ultrawide view for Mac Virtual Display. The new Wide and Ultrawide views were already announced by Apple, so their arrival was inevitable, but a welcome change nonetheless. The Apple Vision Pro still lacks Apple Intelligence, though, meaning that its users won't be able to take advantage of the various AI features available on other Apple platforms. Although some Apple Intelligence features are already here, such as email summarization and the Clean Up tool in Photos, a good chunk of them are still only available in developer beta builds. iOS 18.2 is expected to receive its final public release in early December 2024, which is when features like Image Playground and Visual Intelligence will become available to all users.",
