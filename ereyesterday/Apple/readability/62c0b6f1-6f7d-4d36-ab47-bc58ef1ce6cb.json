  "description": "Macworld Ahead of the eagerly anticipated macOS 15.2 update, Apple on Tuesday released the macOS Sequoia 15.1.1 emergency update to patch a pair of scary vulnerabilities that have already been used in remote attacks.  The two patches fix flaws in JavaScript and WebKit, and were both discovered by Google’s Threat Analysis Group. Apple says both vulnerabilities “may have been actively exploited on Intel-based Mac systems.” Apple doesn’t specifically say whether Apple silicon Macs are affected, but the same flaws were patched in iOS 18.1.1. JavaScriptCore Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited on Intel-based Mac systems. Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks.
