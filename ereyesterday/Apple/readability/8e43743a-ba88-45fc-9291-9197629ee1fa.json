  "text": "The second beta versions of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and MacOS Sequoia 15.4 are available for users enrolled in the beta testing programs for the Apple operating system suite. The latest beta builds continue to refine Apple Intelligence features, add a new Ambient music feature from Control Center, and for iPadOS and MacOS include the controversial Mail Categories feature from iPhone that aims to sort your mail inbox for you. There are also new Emoji icons available in the latest betas, including a tired face, a fingerprint, and a shovel. How to Install iOS/iPadOS 18.4 Beta 2 If your device is enrolled to receive beta updates for iOS/iPadOS, here’s how you can install the latest version: Open “Settings” app and go to “General” Go to “Software Update” Choose to update to iOS 18.4 beta 2 or iPadOS 18.4 beta 2 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.4 beta 2 If your Mac is enrolled to receive new beta builds, here’s how you can get the latest: From the  Apple menu, go to “System Settings” Go to “General” and then go to “Software Update” Select “Update Now” to install MacOS Sequoia 15.4 beta 2 Installing any of the beta versions will require a device restart, as usual. When will iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and MacOS Sequoia 15.4 be finalized and released to everyone? Only Apple knows the precise timeline for new versions of system software, but it’s reasonable to guess that iOS 18.4, MacOS Sequoia 15.4, and iPadOS 18.4, could be released this month in March. Apple usually goes through several versions of beta system software before issuing a final release to the general public.",
