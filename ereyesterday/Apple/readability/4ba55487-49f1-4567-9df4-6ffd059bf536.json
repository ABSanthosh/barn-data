  "text": "Mistral, a French company specializing in AI tools, has just launched a native app for its chatbot “Le Chat” for iOS. While previously the tool was only available through the web, iPhone and iPad users can now download the app for a better experience. Mistral’s Le Chat now available on the iOS App Store For those unfamiliar, Mistral’s Le Chat competes with other AI chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. As noted by TechCrunch, Mistral has its own language models such as Mistral Large and Pixtral Large, which are also available for commercial use via an API. Similar to its competitors, Mistral offers free and paid tiers for Le Chat with access to different features. According to Mistral, Le Chat can answer up to 1,000 words per second, which would be faster than ChatGPT’s 4o model. It also has more advanced models for generating images. Moreover, Mistral claims to have better privacy than other AI chatbots. “Le Chat combines powerful AI with extensive information on the web to help you rediscover the world. Enjoy natural conversations, real-time internet search, comprehensive document analysis, and much more,” the app description reads. Le Chat is now available for free on the App Store, and it requires an iPhone or iPad running iOS 15.1 or later. Mistral has also launched an Android version on Google Play. Paid plans with unlimited use start at $14.99 per month. More details can be found on the Mistral website.
