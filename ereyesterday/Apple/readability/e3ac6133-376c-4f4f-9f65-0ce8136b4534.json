  "text": "Theater for visionOS premiered a year ago with a clever software launch campaign: exclusively streaming John Gruber’s The Talk Show post-WWDC event live with 3D video. The Apple Vision Pro app has continued to mature since its debut, adding extensive Plex support and a full-blown immersive planetarium that now hosts the 2025 SXSW award-winning “Resolution” music experience. Next up, Theater is returning as the exclusive home to The Talk Show Live event stream. Here’s the announcement from Sandwich Vision: Following last year’s groundbreaking first-ever immersive livestream of the event from John Gruber, host of The Talk Show podcast and author of the renowned Apple blog Daring Fireball, Theater returns with an enhanced experience that builds on a full year of platform development and partnerships. “When we launched Theater last year to showcase The Talk Show Live, we weren’t just experimenting—we were inviting people to experience a new kind of immersion. Bringing Apple executives into spatial media wasn’t just a world first; it was a glimpse of how shared experiences can transcend screens,” said Adam Lisagor, CEO and founder of Sandwich Vision. “This year, we’re not just adding features—we’re refining how people can feel connected, curious, and delighted together, again and again. Our goal is to make presence and participation the new standard for special events, where technology fades away, and what remains is the shared magic of being there.” The app will include a 2D video livestream for free. You’ll want to purchase a ticket through the app for the best remote-viewing experience. While attending in person will run you $50, you can access both live and on-demand versions of the event in stereoscopic 3D video for $11.99 if you purchase a ticket early. The price will increase to $14.99 if you wait until the day of the event. The Talk Show Live is set for Tuesday, June 10, at 7 p.m. PT. No Apple executive interviews this year, but that alone sets the stage for an interesting edition before considering everything Apple announces on Monday. Stay tuned to 9to5Mac for comprehensive WWDC 2025 coverage (and a few exclusive sneak peeks before the keynote). Theater for Apple Vision Pro is a free download from the App Store.
