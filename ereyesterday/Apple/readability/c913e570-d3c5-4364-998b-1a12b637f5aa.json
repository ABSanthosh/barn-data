  "text": "Apple last year announced an important change coming to the App Store in the EU that would force developers to share their contact information with customers in some cases. Now that the deadline has arrived, Apple is removing apps from developers who haven’t shared their ‘trader’ contact information from the EU App Store. New requirements for developers distributing apps on the EU App Store In an email sent to developers, Apple notes that those who haven’t provided their trader status to the company have had their apps removed from the App Store in the European Union. This means that these apps can no longer be downloaded by users in the EU. The requirement is part of a series of new rules for online platforms established by the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) and determines that companies must verify and display contact information for any “merchant” that distributes digital applications. And, of course, this affects the App Store. Apple says that a developer is considered a trader under EU terms when they make any revenue as a result of an app. This includes not only direct revenue from App Store sales, but also in-app purchases or advertisements. Only developers distributing free apps with no ads won’t have to provide such information. When it comes to individual developers, the EU App Store will show their address or P.O. Box, phone number, and email address. For organizations, only the phone number and email address are required. This information will be available on each app’s page in the App Store. Developers can check their trader status and send their contact information to Apple via App Store Connect.
