Apple just made a new lamp-like robot prototype that looks super similar. The iPhone giant’s machine learning research team developed an expressively social robotic prototype in desk-lamp form, according to a recent paper, blog post and video. The new robot could figure into rumored plans for a robotic home hub — and it could reshape how we interact with smart home devices. Apple’s new lamp-like robot prototype combines utility and social interaction Researchers detailed their work on an expressive lamp-like robot, which combines functional utility with social interaction, in a January paper outlined in a recent blog post. The research team, led by Yuhan Hu, Peide Huang, Mouli Sivapurapu, and Jian Zhang, said it focused on creating a robot that moves with purpose and personality rather than purely mechanical efficiency. Their prototype demonstrates sophisticated interactions that blur the line between utility and companionship. And it’s a lamp! And it seems like a next step in the rumored tabletop-iPad-on-a-robotic-arm-project. For instance, the robot can check weather conditions by physically turning to look out a window before providing a forecast, as shown in a video. And it can express emotions through movement, such as showing disappointment when not included in a user’s hiking plans. The robot’s practical applications are particularly noteworthy for Apple ecosystem users. During testing, it demonstrated the ability to adjust its position to provide optimal lighting for iPhone photography, assist with desktop organization by moving objects like coffee mugs and even project tutorial videos on a wall while observing a user working on a project. It seems like it might integrate deeply with existing Apple services and hardware, right? ‘Expressive movement primitives’ This lamp-bot does a lot more than shine a light.Photo: Apple What sets this prototype apart is its incorporation of what the researchers call “expressive movement primitives.” Their study revealed that users responded significantly more positively to these emotion-driven movements compared to purely functional ones, especially during social interactions. The robot can even engage in entertainment activities, such as playing music and dancing along, creating a more engaging user experience. In the video, the robot lamp rocks out to tunes along with the user. This development gains additional significance when considered alongside the rumored iPad-like display mounted on a robotic arm, which might come out in 2026 or 2027, according to Bloomberg. The device is expected to leverage Siri and Apple Intelligence for control, with capabilities like automatic screen positioning during FaceTime calls and multi-voice recognition. Could it take other forms? The research prototype’s focus on expressive movement and social interaction could indicate the direction Apple is taking with its rumored smart home hub. While the current research model takes the form of a lamp, the underlying principles of combining functional utility with social awareness could translate to various form factors, potentially including the reported $1,000 tabletop device in development.",
