  "text": "In a world where year over year iPhone upgrades are getting smaller and smaller, it can sometimes seem like every recent iPhone looks and feels the same. With iPhone 17 Pro launching later this year though, there’ll be a couple of worthwhile upgrades that’ll make it both look and feel notably different from any iPhone that came before it. New rear-camera design For the first time since iPhone 11 Pro, Apple will be redesigning the rear camera of the iPhone. It’ll still be in a triangular shape, but instead of being a rounded square in the corner, there’ll now be a long camera bar that stretches across the iPhone. Other components, like the LiDAR scanner, flash, and microphone, will shift to the right side of the bar. It’ll look something like this, although the camera bar is more likely to match the color of the iPhone rather than being a solid black color. New aluminum-infused back design Apple might be shifting the iPhone 17 Pro back to an aluminum body, a regression from the stainless steel and titanium frames of previous iPhone Pro models. However, this shift to aluminum will allow for a new rear design. According to leaked CADs from leaker Sonny Dickson, iPhone 17 Pro will incorporate aluminum on the back, with a glass window for wireless charging and MagSafe. This is in great contrast to the single sheet of glass that’s been used for iPhone backs for years. Vapor chamber cooling Apple is rumored to be implementing a vapor chamber cooling system in the iPhone 17 Pro, which’ll allow for longer sustained performance and cooler operation overall. This could allow for faster peak charging, better gaming performance, and a less-hot phone overall. Thermal throttling should be a thing of the past. Smaller upgrades iPhone 17 Pro will also have a bunch of smaller improvements, as per usual. These probably won’t be a make-or-break reason to upgrade for most people, but here’s everything else rumored for iPhone 17 Pro: New Wi-Fi chipset developed in-house Increase to 12GB of RAM New 24MP front facing camera New 48MP telephoto camera Dual video recording capability in Camera app and more! One last thing of note: Earlier iPhone 17 Pro rumors suggested that the phone would likely implement a smaller Dynamic Island. That probably won’t be the case. Wrap up Overall, if you’re looking for an iPhone that’ll look and feel different in a big way, iPhone 17 Pro will be the iPhone that’ll provide that for you. Apple is also launching the iPhone 17 Air later this year, its thinnest phone yet. You can learn more about the advantages and disadvantages of that design here.
