They’re a handy Apple product that is easy to setup and use, and you can grab a 4 pack for $80 on Amazon allowing you to deploy several AirTags for multiple different purposes. Just as easy to find, through Find My or even with Siri by saying “Hey Siri, find my luggage”, for example. Let’s check out some great uses of AirTags that you might find useful in your life. 1: Use AirTags on a Pet Collar If you have a dog or cat, you can use AirTags on the pet collar to keep track of your animal. If you have a pet that is prone to wandering off, or a dog that likes to get out of the fence, or maybe you’re just curious to see where your cat goes, putting an AirTag on their collar can help you track them down and see where they are. There are many different types of AirTag compatible pet collars, but if you already have a collar then these collar AirTag holders are really popular. You probably don’t want to keep it on them all of the time, but that’s up to you and your pet. 2: Put an AirTag in your bag / luggage / purse Placing an AirTag in your bag, backpack, luggage, or purse, will not only help you find it if you happen to misplace it, but if you leave a bag behind in a taxi, or your pour purse gets stolen, you’ll be able to see where it is which may help the recovery. 3: Place an AirTag in your Wallet If you carry a wallet, putting an AirTag in there can help you track it down if you ever lose it. 4: Find Your TV Remote If you constantly lose your TV remote, stick an AirTag on the back of it, and you’ll be able to find it right away, and make it play a sound to track it down too. 5: Put an AirTag on your Bike Hide an AirTag somewhere on your Bike, perhaps under the bike seat, and you’ll be able to track it down if it goes missing, or gets stolen. 6: Keep an AirTag in your Car Having an AirTag on hand in your car is useful for many reasons where you might want to deploy a tracker while you’re out and about, but also if you have the AirTag setup and your car happens to get stolen, it will be easier to find. 7: In a Package or Delivery Another good use of AirTags is to activate one and then place it in a package that is being shipped or delivered, so that you can independently track the delivery and its location. Shipping something valuable across the country? Insure and stick an AirTag in it! Dropping an expensive deliverable off at a location? Put an AirTag with it. You get the idea. – By the way if you ever get into a situation where you found an AirTag, you can figure out who the owner is to some extent with a handy tip. If you don’t have any yet, you can get 4 pack of AirTags at a discount from Amazon. Do you use AirTags? What do you use them for?",
