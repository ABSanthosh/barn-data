Weibo account Instant Digital, a leaker with a mixed track record, claims the iPhone 17 Air will use a battery rated around 2,800 mAh. That's notably smaller than every iPhone 16 model. iPhone 16: 3,561 mAh iPhone 16 Plus: 4,674 mAh iPhone 16 Pro: 3,582 mAh iPhone 16 Pro Max: 4,685 mAh The reduced size is likely due to the iPhone 17 Air's rumored ultrathin 5.5 mm frame, one of the slimmest designs Apple has ever attempted. That design limits internal space and makes it harder to fit a higher-capacity battery. Software optimizations aim to close the gapTo compensate for the smaller battery, Apple plans to rely on iOS 26's Adaptive Power Mode, a new software feature designed to stretch battery life throughout the day. Instant Digital suggests the optimization will allow the iPhone 17 Air to deliver \"full-day\" usage despite the lower capacity. That definition, however, is still vague, according to MacRumors. Apple's internal testing shows that only 60% to 70% of users will get through a full day without recharging. By comparison, current iPhone models reportedly reach 80% to 90% under the same conditions. Apple may also reintroduce a battery case as an optional accessory. The last official battery cases were released for the iPhone 11 lineup, followed by the now-discontinued MagSafe Battery Pack for the iPhone 12 and later. These cases provide extra power along with physical protection and may appeal to users who want the iPhone 17 Air's design without giving up battery longevity. September launch alongside full lineupThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to debut in September 2025 alongside the standard and Pro models. Positioned between them in pricing and features, the iPhone 17 Air is rumored to share some internals with the iPhone 17 Pro line while delivering a new aesthetic focused on thinness and portability. Battery life may be the main compromise. Users who spend long days away from a charger â€” or those who rely on their phones for photography, navigation, or gaming â€” may want to wait for real-world reviews or consider Apple's battery case accessory.",
