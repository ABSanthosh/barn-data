  "description": "Macworld There may be a new M3 iPad AIr on shelves, but since not much has changed, we’re always on the lookout for a sale on the M2 model. And today we’ve got a whopper: Amazon is selling the M2 iPad Air with 512GB of storage and 5G connectivity for just $699. That’s a savings of $350 and the best price you’re ever likely to see. When we reviewed the M2 Apple iPad Air, we gave the tablet a 4-star rating, appreciating its performance and the speedy processor. We also really liked the landscape front camera with Center Stage because it made participating in video calls or shooting vids for social media that much easier. With 512GB of storage space (four times the base model), you get tons of space for apps and games, so you’ll never have to worry about running out. The 11-inch Liquid Retina display is gorgeous and delivers vivid colors and great contrast, as well as 500 nits of brightness. This model also comes with 5G built-in, so you can connect to a wireless network on the go. It requires an extra change through your carrier, but it’s usually just $10 or $15 per month on top of your regular bill. The M3 iPad Air is pretty great, but it’s going to be a long time before it gets anywhere close to the M2 price levels. So take advantage of this $350 discount and order the M2 iPad Air while this deal is hot. Snag an iPad Air with 512GB of storage and 5G for $350 offBuy now at Amazon",
