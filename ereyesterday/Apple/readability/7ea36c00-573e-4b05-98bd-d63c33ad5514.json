  "text": "Back in October, OpenAI launched its own search engine integrated into ChatGPT. At first, the feature was made available only to ChatGPT Plus subscribers, but now OpenAI is rolling out ChatGPT Search to everyone – including free users. Anyone can now use ChatGPT Search As announced by OpenAI on Monday, ChatGPT Search will be available to any logged-in user starting today. All users need to do is open ChatGPT on the web or app and then tap the search button. ChatGPT’s knowledge is currently limited to data obtained up to June 2024, when the GPT-4o model database was last updated. However, ChatGPT Search is able to find new information on the web in real time. After making a search or asking a question, ChatGPT Search provides a detailed answer based on multiple sources, which are linked in the answer. Search results can also include images and even videos. For users, the experience is the same as using OpenAI’s chatbot, except that it is now collecting data and generating responses in real time. Here’s how OpenAI explains it: ChatGPT can now search the web in a much better way than before. You can get fast, timely answers with links to relevant web sources, which you would have previously needed to go to a search engine for. This blends the benefits of a natural language interface with the value of up-to-date sports scores, news, stock quotes, and more. ChatGPT will choose to search the web based on what you ask, or you can manually choose to search by clicking the web search icon. Earlier this month, OpenAI added video support to ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, so that users can have a natural conversation with the chatbot via a video chat – so that it can answer questions about what’s in the video. In addition, with the release of iOS 18.2 last week, iPhone and iPad users can now talk to ChatGPT right from Siri. The ChatGPT app is available for free on the App Store, and it requires a device running iOS 16.4 or later. Make sure you have the latest version installed so you can access the new features. On the web, ChatGPT Search is available at chatgpt.com/search.
