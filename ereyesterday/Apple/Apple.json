    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "title": "Best Thunderbolt and USB-C docking stations for your MacBook",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/668894/best-thunderbolt-3-4-and-usb-c-docking-stations-for-macbook-pro-and-air.html",
    "description": "Macworld Plug your MacBook in and out of a multi-port laptop docking station to swiftly add multiple devices and external displays with just one cable connection to your laptop. We tested the top contenders to find the best Thunderbolt and USB-C docks available to owners of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Thunderbolt, USB4 or USB-C The connectors all look the same (technically known as a “Type-C connector”), but there are significant differences, particularly on speed that will determine both data-transfer rate and higher external display refresh rates. USB-C: 3Gbps or 10Gbps USB4: 20Gbps or 40Gbps Thunderbolt 3 and 4: 40Gbps Thunderbolt 5: 80Gbps / 120Gbps Our list Which ports does my MacBook have will show you how many USB-C or more likely one of Thunderbolt 3, 4 or 5 that you have. A Thunderbolt 3 (TB3) dock will be enough for most casual users but if you can stretch the budget, go for a TB4 dock. High-end professionals should aim for Thunderbolt 5. The dock needs one (“upstream“) Thunderbolt or USB-C port for connecting to and charging your laptop (although all recent MacBooks can also power via the MagSafe 3 port), and likely at least another (“downstream“) to attach further devices (hard drives, external display, and others). For more detail, read our Thunderbolt 5 vs Thunderbolt 4 vs Thunderbolt 3 vs USB4 explainer. Add external displays to your MacBook If you use your laptop as your principal computer, attaching at least one larger display to create a hybrid desktop/laptop setup, with a keyboard and mouse, will boost your productivity. You can turn that 13in MacBook’s cramped screen real-estate into an iMac-sized 27in or even larger screen by adding an extra display—or connect two or even four large monitors to extend your screen across your whole desk. Take a look at our recommended best monitors and displays for Mac. Natively over USB-C, Macs can connect to only one external display in Extended mode (where the screen extends beyond what you can see on the laptop screen, as opposed to Mirrored mode that replicates exactly what you get on the laptop screen) but you’ll get two or more Extended mode screens using a Thunderbolt connection. DisplayLink is third-party software that allows some USB-C docks to extend to up to four screens on even the most basic Mac. More explained: we cover more on Mac docking stations and external displays at the end of this feature below our recommendations. Do I need a docking station? With three TB4 or TB5 and an HDMI port, a MacBook with a Max chip could connect to up to four external displays without the need for a dock, although such a power user would likely require extra Thunderbolt and other ports for more devices to make up for using all the laptop ports for multiple monitors. See below our list of recommended docking stations for more detail on the external display options with each recent MacBook. All docks come with a bunch of USB ports: some old-school USB-A and newer, more capable USB-C. MacBook Pros also have an SD card reader. Although this is rated as UHS-II (312MBps), Apple has pegged it back at 250MBps, so for the fastest speeds (and a microSD slot if you need one), a dock will likely be a better choice for memory-card use if it is rated at UHS-II rather than UHS-I (104MBps). MacBooks also lack wired Internet access via an Ethernet port, so if you want to escape flaky Wi-Fi, buy a dock with at least Gigabit Ethernet, although you could add a Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter if you have a spare TB port. Some later docks include faster 2.5Gb, 5Gb or even 10Gb Ethernet but you’ll need a supporting router or other device to get the benefit. Dock or hub? If you need just a few extra ports, a USB-C hub or Thunderbolt hub might be your best choice—see our roundup of the best USB-C and Thunderbolt hubs for Mac. However, if you require a bunch of fast ports including Gigabit (or faster) Ethernet and multiple video ports plus more powerful charging capability, then look for a full dock that fulfills your needs. USB-C and Thunderbolt speeds Simon Jary / Foundry • USB and Thunderbolt speeds explained USB PD: Power Delivery for your laptop Charging the laptop: The M1/M2/M3/M4 MacBook Air requires a Power Delivery (PD) charger with at least 30W power, but you can fast-charge an M2 and later Air with a charger rated at over 70W. You’ll need 67W for the 13-inch MacBook Pro and 70W for the 14-inch MBP (with 8-, 10-, 11-or 12-core CPU), 96W for 14-inch MBP (with 12- or 14-core CPU), and 96W (preferably 140W) for the 16-inch MBP. The older 15in MacBook Pro requires a 87W PD charger. If you own a larger MacBook Pro, buy a dock with a PD (Power Delivery) potential of at least 85W if you can. USB PD 3.0 maxes at 100W, while USB PD 3.1 can support up to 240W of power. The 16-inch MacBook Pro requires 140W to fast-charge, so owners of that laptop should look for a PD 3.1 charger. If you just need a spare charger, we’ve tested the best MacBook chargers for you. Best docks for Mac 2025 Here we list the Thunderbolt and USB-C docks that we have reviewed and tested. Read the descriptions for details on all the features and functions offered by each docking station. Sonnet Echo 13 Thunderbolt 5 SSD Dock – Best Thunderbolt 5 dock for Macs Pros Thunderbolt 5 12 ports Built-in super-fast SSD 2.5Gb Ethernet Fast card readers 140W Power Delivery Cons Premium price Price When Reviewed: From $399.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Sonnet 399.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Type: 80Gbps Thunderbolt 5 Dock Ports: 12 Power: 140W PD 3.1; 180W max External displays: 2x 4K at 60Hz or 1x 6K at 60Hz This is one of the first Thunderbolt 5 docking stations, and it looks hard to beat, with a bunch of fast USB ports joining the four 80Gbps Thunderbolt 5 certified, and with bonus integrated internal SSD storage of up to 4TB. That internal SSD is installed at purchase and is not user upgradeable, so pushes the price to the high-end of all the docks reviewed here. However, it’s well worth it if you can afford to pay the extra. This internal SSD is super-fast, and in our tests nearly matched the native storage in the Mac itself! Having extra storage that’s so fast will save you money on your next MacBook purchase as Apple’s SSD options cost nearly as much as buying one of these docks by itself. Sonnet offers port flexibility by not swapping one of the Thunderbolt 5 ports for a dedicated DisplayPort or HDMI video port. You can attach up to external 6K displays using either direct Thunderbolt connections to supporting monitors or adding video adapters for DisplayPort or HDMI screens. If you have the right router, you can take advantage of super-fast wired Internet access with the Echo 13’s 2.5GbE Gigabit Ethernet—2.5x faster than standard Gigabit Ethernet, with which it also works on standard networks. One upstream Thunderbolt 5 port (80Gbps, 140W) Three downstream Thunderbolt 5 ports (80Gbps, 1x 60W, 2x 15W) Two USB-A ports (10Gbps, 7.5W) One USB-A port (5Gbps, 7.5W) Internal M.2 NVMe SSD (1TB / 2TB / 4TB) Ethernet (2.5Gb) UHS-II SD card reader (312MBps) UHS-II microSD card reader (312MBps) 3.5mm combo audio jack (front) 180W power supply Who should buy the Sonnet Echo 13? If you want a dock with the very fastest ports, at the moment this is the one to go for. Even if your Mac doesn’t have Thunderbolt 5, it’s backwards compatible and will be ready for when you do upgrade your Mac. This is a top-end solution for owners of Thunderbolt 5 Macs who want to add a range of extra fast ports and super-charge their storage, but owners of Thunderbolt 3 or 4 Macs can future-proof their purchase (as TB5 is backwards compatible with TB4 and TB3) for the same result. Sonnet offers a similar Thunderbolt 4 docking station, the Sonnet Echo 20 Thunderbolt 4 SuperDock (see later in this list), which also offers an internal SSD, but this is optional, user-installed and not as super speedy, and so is more affordable. Read our full Sonnet Echo 13 Thunderbolt 5 SSD Dock review Wavlink Thunderbolt 4 Triple Display Docking Station – Best budget Thunderbolt 4 dock Pros Thunderbolt 4 13 fast ports 2.5Gb Ethernet Two HDMI 2.1 30W USB-C port Affordable Price When Reviewed: $199.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Wavlink $199 View Deal $199.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Type: 40Gbps Thunderbolt 4 Dock Ports: 13 Power: 96W PD 3.0; 160W max External displays: 2x 4K at 60Hz The Wavlink Thunderbolt 4 Triple Display Docking station is a bit of a misnomer for Mac users as it can handle only two external 4K displays in Extended Mode on Macs at 60Hz. The third display would just mirror one of the others. That’s a Mac limitation, not one by Wavlink. That aside, the dock is a well-priced and loaded Thunderbolt 4 dock. It sacrifices two of the potential three downstream TB4 ports in favor of two HDMI 2.1 ports. Use one of these for one external display and the downstream TB4 port for the other. The spare HDMI port would host the mirrored display, or a third extended display on Windows PCs. The USB ports are fast, as are the two card readers and the backwards-compatible 2.5Gb Ethernet. Thunderbolt 4 allows for 40Gbps data transfer to the laptop. Power delivery to the laptop is 96W, enough for the 16-inch MacBook Pro. There’s a handy 30W USB-C charging port at the front, which also supports 10Gbps data transfer. One upstream Thunderbolt 4 port (40Gbps, 96W) One downstream Thunderbolt 4 port (40Gbps, 15W) Two HDMI 2.1 video ports (4K at 60Hz) One USB-C port (10Gbps, 30W) Two USB-A ports (10Gbps, 4.5W) Two USB-A ports (5Gbps, 4.5W) 2.5Gb Ethernet UHS-II SD Card reader (312MBps) UHS-II MicroSD Card reader (312MBps) 3.5mm audio jack 160W power supply Who should buy the Wavlink Triple Display Dock? If you want a generous set of extra ports and to connect a couple of 4K displays, this affordable yet able Thunderbolt 4 dock is a great solution even for budget-conscious TB5 Mac users. Read our full Wavlink Thunderbolt 4 Triple Display Docking Station review Satechi Dual Dock Stand – Best USB-C dock for Macs Pros 9 ports Built-in SSD enclosure 100W PD laptop charging Zero-footprint docking station Cons USB-C not Thunderbolt USB ports can’t charge devices No card reader Requires USB-C charger Price When Reviewed: $149.95 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $129.99 View Deal Satechi $149.95 View Deal $149.99 View Deal $149.99 View Deal $149.99 View Deal $149.99 View Deal $190.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Type: 10Gbps USB-C Dock Ports: 19 Power: 100W PD 3.0; 150W max External displays: 2x 4K at 60Hz or 1x 6K at 60Hz Another dock with an SSD enclosure is the Satechi Dual Dock Stand that doubles up as an open-MacBook stand that raises the keyboard to a more comfortable angle. Unlike the Thunderbolt Sonnet Echo 13 or Echo 20, this is a USB-C dock with a 10Gbps rather than 40Gbps or 80Gbps bandwidth, but it’s significantly cheaper as a result, and is a very reasonably priced for a dual 4K 60Hz USB-C docking station. With one DisplayPort 1.4 and two HDMI 2.0 ports, you can connect up to two 4K displays in Extended mode at a decent 60Hz refresh rate. The Echo 20 has just one video port. Although that port is the superior HDMI 2.1, you have to add a second external screen via one of the Thunderbolt ports, which will require an adapter with that dock. The SSD enclosure is the star of the show. Placed on the underside of the dock, this is easily accessed and supports both NVMe and SATA SSDs. You need to buy the SSD separately. Amazon is selling NVME SSDs for around $50 (1TB), $80 (2TB) or $300 (4TB). One USB-C port is for passthrough PD power at up to 75W to the laptop, which is enough for all but the 16-inch MacBook Pro at full pelt. Even that model will charge fine—just slower than smaller MacBooks. Note that you will need to connect your own USB-C charger to the dock: check out our recommended MacBook chargers.

If you use your MacBook’s own keyboard and desire up to two quality external displays, plus need to increase your base storage with fast SSD drives, the Satechi Dual Dock Stand is a neat, zero-footprint docking station that matches your MacBook for style and adds nine useful ports. It’s not as speedy as the Thunderbolt docks we have tested but this is an affordable and discreet dock that still offers a lot of ports and dual-display functionality.

It might not offer the very fastest Thunderbolt 5 hosted by its Echo 13 sibling, but it’s cheaper and in some ways more flexible. It has the most ports and equals the fastest ports seen in the market. Its nearest competitor is the excellent CalDigit TS4, reviewed below. Sonnet clearly targeted the TS4 and the specs are remarkably similar—but the cheaper Echo 20 has a useful SSD enclosure that means you can add up to 8TB of internal storage via the dock. If you don’t need this feature and prefer DisplayPort to HDMI, or you need the most powerful ports on offer, the TS4 is still a great contender, although it costs a fair amount more. The Satechi Dual Dock Stand, reviewed below, is an even cheaper non-Thunderbolt option if the idea of an integrated SSD enclosure is appealing. Even if your MacBook is Thunderbolt 3, as a Thunderbolt 4 dock the Echo 20 is backwards compatible and will work with your next laptop when it’s time to upgrade. Even if your Mac does boast Thunderbolt 5, this good-value dock will work with it, just at Thunderbolt 4 speeds. While you can use Thunderbolt ports to add external displays, Sonnet has swapped one of the downstream TB4 ports for a dedicated HDMI port. You can add up to two 4K displays at 60Hz or a single 6K screen at 60Hz. Unless your second display can connect directly with its USB-C port, you’ll need a USB-C-to-DisplayPort or HDMI adapter cable to connect to one of the downstream TB4 ports.

It can supply two external 4K displays at 60Hz or one 6K monitor but at 30Hz rather than 60Hz like the CalDigit TS4, so single-screen gamers should probably look elsewhere. At 180W, the power supply is higher than most docks tested here but not as great as found on the CalDigit TS4. It’s essential if you are powering multiple devices connected to the dock. And the On/Off power button (rare on docks) means you can give the laptop battery’s rest when you’re away. There are useful lights telling you when the dock is powered and when it’s connected.

There are four TB4 ports and four fast 10Gbps USB-A ports. The newer Element 5 has one extra USB port, with two USB-C and three USB-A. With video adapters, it can handle an impressive two 6K displays at 60Hz. As a hub rather than a dock, its 60W laptop charger is a little underpowered for larger laptops, but the overall 150W power supply will help with all the hub’s ports. Owners of the larger MacBook Pro models will probably still reply on the laptop’s own charger via MagSafe. It’s the same size as the Element 5, and so is small enough to be portable, but its chunkier external power supply will weigh down your travel bag. • One upstream Thunderbolt 4 port (40Gbps, 60W PD)• Three downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports (40Gbps, 15W)• Four USB-A ports (10Gbps, 7.5W)• 150W power supply Who should buy the CalDigit Element Hub?

But it boasts so many top-end Thunderbolt and USB ports that you can customize it to your every desire. It has one more than its Thunderbolt 4 predecessor, the 8-port Element 4 Hub, reviewed below. There are four TB5 ports (one upstream to your computer placed handily on the side, and three downstream to other devices), two fast 10Gbps USB-C and three 10Gbps USB-A ports. You can use two of the three downstream TB5 ports to connect directly to USB-C- or Thunderbolt-equipped monitors or HDMI or DisplayPort screens using inexpensive adapters. It can connect to dual 6K/60Hz or dual 4K/240Hz extended displays on Macs. That still leaves you a spare TB5 port and the five USB ports to add further devices, such as an adapter for Gigabit Ethernet and/or SD card reader, SSDs, memory sticks and so on as your requirements demand, so there is no port wastage. Its 90W laptop charger is powerful enough for most MacBook charging needs, and beats the Element 4’s rather underpowered 60W PD. Its 180W power supply is also generous for what calls itself just a hub. It’s small enough to be portable, and its external power supply is also pretty dinky.

Using DisplayLink software, it enables M1/M2/M3/M4 Pro MacBook Pro and M3 MacBook Air users to connect up to four 4K displays, and even plain M1/M2/M3 MacBooks will support three external displays. Aside from the mighty iVanky dock reviewed below, it’s the only dock available with three downstream speedy 40Gbps Thunderbolt 4 ports and two HDMI 2.0 ports—all of which can connect to an external display, although four is the maximum. Freely downloadable DisplayLink software is required to make the HDMI ports work. While the $500 iVanky supports four 6K displays, the $299 Satechi can still support four 4K screens at 60Hz at a considerably cheaper price. For three displays, you can get one 6K at 60Hz and the other two 4K/60Hz. It lacks spare USB-C ports but the three TB4 ports are backwards compatible, and can each offer 15W power output (although only two at one time). The two USB-A ports are fast but offer little device charging power. The SD card reader is fast, and will accept MicroSD cards with an adapter.

No other dock can match it for number of Thunderbolt ports and its ability to host multiple monitors. Packing two Thunderbolt chips gives the FusionDock Max 1 the ability to double up on video-capable ports. Connected to a MacBook Pro with an M1 Max, M2 Max or M3 Max processor it can handle up to four 6K displays at 60Hz using both its Thunderbolt 4 chipsets. It costs more than any other docking station but it’s a unique dual-Thunderbolt 4 system that answers the dreams of multi-screen Mac professionals. It doesn’t work with Intel Macs or even any Windows computer. This is a dock built for the top-end MacBook Pro Max. Macs with Pro rather than Max processors can connect to two 4K displays at 60Hz. While that would lose the display benefit this is still is good choice as you could have up to four 40Gbps downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports at your disposal. Its other ports are plenty and top-end, too. We’re not sure who needs six USB-A ports these days, but they are there and all are rated at 10Gbps. We would have preferred more USB-C than USB-A, but one of the Type C ports included boasts 30W device charging power. On top of all that you get 2.5Gb Ethernet and two fast UHS-II SD card readers.

Yes, it’s expensive, but it’s an ultra-impressive dock. It compares well to the Sonnet Echo 20 with just one fewer port—the Echo 20’s integrated SSD enclosure. For port speeds the TS4 matches the Echo 20, and it boasts the highest power supply that we’ve seen on any dock that we’ve tested—a whopping 230W to be spread among the ports, including a front-mounted 20W USB-C that can fast-charge an iPhone and 98W laptop PD charging. We also love this dock’s flexible vertical or horizontal format. As with the Echo 20, while you can use Thunderbolt ports to add external displays. Caldigit swaps one of the downstream TB4 ports for a dedicated video port—in this case, DisplayPort. You’ll need an adapter if your monitor requires HDMI.

If HDMI is all you need, consider the Satechi Triple 4K dock. It also packs a bunch of non-display ports, such as three USB-A and a spare downstream USB-C port, plus fast SD and MicroSD card readers and Gigabit Ethernet.

The Satechi Pro Hub Max, available in either Silver or Space Gray, features USB4 ports that are both compatible with Thunderbolt and can reach the same 40Gbps maximum throughput. Connecting directly to two of the MacBook’s Thunderbolt ports, it boasts a bunch of ports that should be enough for most of us. The hub receives 40Gbps from each of the Thunderbolt ports on the Mac (so a total of 80Gbps). 40Gbps is used for the USB4 pass-through port, while the second Thunderbolt port distributes 40Gbps of bandwidth to the rest of the ports on the hub. The USB4 port supports up to 96W charging—easily fine for a 14-inch MacBook Pro and punchy enough to keep a 16-inch Pro going and charged pretty quickly. This same USB4 port can be used to connect to an external display—up to 6K at 60Hz display output, transferring data at 40Gbps. The HDMI 2.0 port can also be used to connect a 4K 60Hz display, so you can achieve a dual 4K monitor setup on any Pro or Max MacBook. Also onboard are a 5Gbps USB-A port and a 5Gbps USB-C port—although neither can charge connected devices. There are both SD and MicroSD card readers (UHS-I), a Gigabit Ethernet port, and 3.5mm combo audio jack port.

The Pro Hub Max calls itself just an adapter but this super-portable gizmo is as functional as most desktop-based docks, although it can handle just one external display. In the same family, Satechi also offers the Pro Hub Mini (the same as the Max but without the HDMI port) and the Pro Hub Slim (which swaps the Ethernet port for an extra USB-A port, and boasts 10GBps USB-A and USB-C ports compared to the Mac and Mini’s 5Gbps). If you don’t need wired Internet access, the Pro Hub Slim edges out the Pro Hub Max. If you don’t need more than one external screen or you want to save the USB4 for passthrough charging only, consider the Pro Hub Mini or the Plugable 5-in-1 USB-C Hub reviewed below. Note that all three requires a MacBook with two adjacent Thunderbolt ports on one side, so some older MacBook Air models might not be compatible. A single Thunderbolt to Mac connection is available with the CalDigit Thunderbolt 3 mini Dock that offers full Thunderbolt 40Gbps bandwidth and dual-4K HDMI display support at 60Hz in a lightweight portable form. It connects to the laptop via an integrated TB3 cable, and features two HDMI ports, plus Gigabit Ethernet and two USB-A: one at 5Gbps (4.5W); one at the much slower 480Mbps (2.5W). Its downside is a lack of power supply (which it draws from the host laptop), so you’ll need to power your laptop via another port, and the USB ports certainly aren’t for fast-charging purposes. No power supply means it’s super portable but a passthrough power port would have been preferred.

Its compact shape and 15 ports made it our favorite top-end Thunderbolt 3 docking station for its sheer functional flexibility and power at a great price. Other docks boast faster USB ports, but few have seven like the TS3 Plus—except its successor, the TS4, which makes even the TS3 Plus look underpowered. If you can afford the extra, we recommend the TS4, or wait for the TS5 and TS5 Plus. The TS3 Plus isn’t unsuitable for non-Thunderbolt laptops—but as most MacBooks have at least TB3, that shouldn’t matter unless you work in a mixed Mac/Windows environment. And while Thunderbolt 5 is the latest connection standard, its top-end benefits won’t be noticed by most MacBook owners as TB3 matches TB4 on 40Gbps data-transfer speed and TB5’s 80Gbps is probably too fast for many needs. To add the second external display you will require an HDMI or DisplayPort USB-C video adapter to run from the USB-C port unless you have a USB-C monitor. To avoid this need for an adapter, look for a dock with two video ports. Both connected displays can run 4K displays at 60Hz. You could also run one 5K display at the same frame rate. The TS3 Plus’s digital audio ports set it apart from most other Thunderbolt docks. It charges your laptop at 87W so makes it a great companion to even Apple’s larger MacBook Pro models. This dock is dinky so won’t take up too much space on your desk. Available in Silver and Space Gray, it matches the colors of Apple’s laptops.  One Thunderbolt 3 upstream port (40Gbps, 87W PD) One Thunderbolt 3 downstream port (40Gbps, 15W) DisplayPort 1.2 port  Five USB-A ports (5Gbps, 7.5W) One USB-C (10Gbps) port One USB-C (5Gbps) port SD Card Reader (SD 4.0 UHS-II, 312MBps) Gigabit Ethernet port Front-facing 3.5mm Audio In \u0026 Out ports One Digital Optical Audio (S/PDIF) port 180W power supply Who should buy the CalDigit TS3?

This is an able USB-C dock and good-looking monitor stand that you can place your external display on top of and desk-based gear underneath in a boost to create an ergonomic and decluttered workplace. Your MacBook will probably best sit nearby in a closed laptop stand—see our roundup of the best MacBook stands—and connect via USB-C to the dock/stand. The roster of ports is impressive, with four fast (10Gbps) downstream USB ports on the side (two of which can share 45W of device charging power), plus storage card readers and audio jack, as well as the upstream 100W PD USB-C port positioned underneath. Also on the cable-management underside are the HDMI and Gigabit Ethernet ports as well as a low-powered USB-A port (most likely for a wired keyboard or mouse) and the meaty 180W power supply port. On the top there’s a (non-magnetic) Qi wireless charger that you can rest your iPhone or AirPods case on for 7.5W charging.

Its compact form is neat (just like the CalDigit TS4 and TS3 Plus), and it can lie either upright or horizontal depending on your needs and preference. There are six USB-A ports in total: four USB-A ports at 5Gbps and a further two at 10Gbps, plus one fast-charging QC 3.0 USB-A port. While the Quick Charge port’s 36W is impressive, iPhone fast-charging requires a USB-C port rather than USB-A as found here. That said, it’s still going to charge a device faster than the 4.5W or 7.5W ports found on many other docks. On top of this is one 10Gbps USB-C port that you’ll need if you want to supplement the DisplayPort for a second external display. You’ll also get more professional-level digital audio ports, as well as the analogue 3.5mm headphone/mic jack at the front.

It’s a little bigger than the TS4, reviewed above, but has fewer USB ports. Both support two 4K displays at 60Hz, but the TS4 can handle a single 6K display, while the Revodok Max is limited to 4K even with just one display connected.

It’s fairly expensive, at $399/£399.99, but it’s designed to provide an all-in-one desktop system for people who do a lot of video-conferencing when working at home or in the office. The compact USB-C dock (3.3-x-6.3-x-5.2 inches) will fit neatly on your desk alongside your Mac’s display. The Logi Dock’s chunky power adaptor means that this is very much a dock that’s designed to stay on your desk the whole time. There’s one USB-C upstream port that is used to connect the Logi Dock to your Mac, and both HDMI and DisplayPort interfaces for external display. Significantly, you can connect only one 4K display if you’re using Extended mode, although you can connect two 4K displays in Mirrored mode. The Logi Dock can work as a speaker for voice and video calls, or you can just listen to some music while you’re working using either the USB-C connection with your Mac, or using Bluetooth to connect to your mobile devices. It sounds pretty good too, with a set of 55mm stereo speakers that deliver a nice firm bass. You can also use Logitech’s Tune app to link the Logi Dock with conferencing apps such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom, and there’s a set of buttons on the top of the Logi Dock that allow you to quickly mute the mic and turn off the camera. 1x USB-C upstream port (5Gbps, 100W) 2x USB-C downstream ports (5Gbps, 4.5W) 1 x USB-C downstream ports (5Gbps, 7.5W) 1x USB-A (5Gbps, 4.5W) 1x USB-A (5Gbps, 7.5W) 1x HDMI 2.0 1x DisplayPort 1.4 2x 55mm speakers (stereo) 6x noise-cancelling microphones 230W power supply Certified for Zoom, MS Teams, Google Meet Who should buy the Logi Dock?

Principally, it features super-fast 10Gb Ethernet rather than the standard 1Gb (Gigabit) connection found on the other docking stations reviewed here. The Caldigit TS4 features 2.5Gb Ethernet. To get the most from this level of Ethernet you need to have compatible network devices. It also features a CFast 2.0 card reader for people still using CompactFlash in its latest version.  There are Thunderbolt docking stations with more ports and beefier chargers, but none have 10Gb Ethernet or CFast 2.0. You can add these to other docks via dedicated adapters, but the Pro Dock has it all built-in, plus a really secure power-supply connection in case it’s used on a pro DIT cart.

The five USB-A ports are all 5Gbps, and there’s a 10Gbps Gen 2 USB-C port on the front of the latest 14-port model, which not many Thunderbolt docks have. The curiously old-fashioned choice of Mini DisplayPort over DisplayPort isn’t a technical hurdle but you will require adapters for adding external displays. Other docks have more than one port for external displays, but this one needs adapters to connect to displays—which adds to the overall cost. That aside, the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock has everything a dock should have in a slick-looking slim case that will look good in any laptop setup.

Ignore the older TB3 rating, this 40Gbps dock is still an able performer that’s available at affordable prices. Which ports are on each MacBook? Of Apple’s recent laptop ranges, the M1/M2/M3 MacBook Air and 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro feature two ports that Apple specifies as “Thunderbolt / USB 4” ports, while more recent the 13in and 15in M4 MacBook Air and Pro models feature two Thunderbolt 4 ports. The 14in and 16in M1/M2/M3 Pro, plain M4 MacBook Pro, and M1/M2/M3 Max MacBook Pro models come with three Thunderbolt 4 (TB4) ports. Ignore Apple’s dual designation of non-4 Thunderbolt and USB4—it just means that the ports don’t certify as pure Thunderbolt 4, and that shouldn’t worry most users except for the number of external displays each supports. Apple’s latest M4 Pro and Max MacBook Pro models feature three of the latest Thunderbolt 5 ports, which are backwards compatible with TB4, TB3 and USB-C. Thunderbolt 5 devices and docks are rare right now but we are reviewing them as fast as we get them in to our labs. They promise 80Gbps data transfer and 120Gbps video rates. Until the technology finds its way into more devices and the Thunderbolt 5 dock market matures, you are still going to do very well with a 40Gbps Thunderbolt 4 dock. Apple’s older 12in MacBook features one 5Gbps Gen 1 USB-C port, while the later Intel MacBook Air (2018 and later) and MacBook Pro (from 2016) boast either two or four 40Gbps Thunderbolt 3 ports. Apple MacBook Air and Pro built-in ports listed 13-inch and 15-inch M1/M2/M3 MacBook Air: Two Thunderbolt/USB4 ports and one MagSafe 3 charging port, plus headphone jack 13-inch and 15-inch M4 MacBook Air: Two Thunderbolt 4 ports and one MagSafe 3 charging port, plus headphone jack 13-inch M1/M2 MacBook Pro: Two Thunderbolt/USB4 ports and one MagSafe 3 charging port, plus headphone jack 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro: Two Thunderbolt/USB4 ports, one HDMI port, one SDXC card slot, plus headphone jack 14-inch M1/M2/M3 Pro, M1/M2/M3 Max and plain M4 MacBook Pro: Three Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) ports, one HDMI port, one SDXC card slot, plus headphone jack 14-inch M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pro: Three Thunderbolt 5 (USB-C) ports, one HDMI port, one SDXC card slot, plus headphone jack 16-inch M1/M2/M3 Pro or M1/M2/M3 Max MacBook Pro: Three Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) ports, one HDMI port, one SDXC card slot, plus headphone jack 16-inch M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pro: Three Thunderbolt 5 (USB-C) ports, one HDMI port, one SDXC card slot, plus headphone jack How many external displays can each MacBook support without a dock? M1/M2: One external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz. M3: Two external displays, one with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz and one at 5K/60Hz when the MacBook lid is closed. M4: Two external displays, one with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz and one at 5K/60Hz. M1/M2/M3/M4 Pro: Up to two external displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt, or one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 4K resolution at 144Hz over HDMI. Or one external display supported at 8K resolution at 60Hz or one external display at 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI. M1/M2/M3/M4 Max: Up to four external displays: Up to three external displays with 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 4K resolution at 144Hz over HDMI. Up to three external displays: Up to two external displays with 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz or one external display with 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI. Mac docking stations and external displays Baseus While Apple’s MacBooks featuring the company’s own M-series Silicon chips are super speedy compared to the models sporting Intel processors, models with plain (non-Pro or -Max) M1 and M2 chips come with an incredible limitation: they don’t support more than one external display in Extended Mode even via their Thunderbolt ports. Plain M3 MacBooks can support two displays but only with their lids closed. This limitation means that when using any docking station, M1 and M2 MacBook users cannot extend their desktop over two or more displays, and will be limited to either dual Mirrored displays or one external display—although adding third-party DisplayLink or InstantView software to the Mac and connecting to a dedicated USB-C dock will allow you to add more than one external monitor to an M1, M2 or M3 MacBook. Follow that link for our roundup of the best USB-C DisplayLink docks, and we’ve included our favorite in our roundup below. Thankfully, the superior M1/M2/M3 “Pro” and M1/M2/M3 “Max” MacBook Pro models—plus the plain M4—can support multiple displays. Below our list of the best MacBook docking stations, we’ve listed the native external display options for each MacBook. One dock supports up to four 6K displays if you own a Max MacBook Pro. While some docking stations promise support for 8K displays, Macs are limited to 6K support via the dock. Macs with an M2/M3/M4 Pro or Max chip can support an 8K display at 60Hz but only when it is connected via the Mac’s own HDMI port and not any port on the dock. Dock, hub or dongle: Whole lotta ports You need one (“upstream”) Thunderbolt or USB-C port for connecting to and charging your laptop (although the 14/16in MacBooks can also power via the MagSafe port), and likely at least another (“downstream”) to attach further devices (hard drives, external display, and others). There are many inexpensive USB-C dongles/hubs that let you add more devices to a MacBook (see our roundup of the best USB-C adapters for Macs) or a Thunderbolt hub offering a few extra ports might be all your need, but for maximum flexibility check out a docking station that takes care of all your extra port requirements, and allows you to simply attach it to your laptop with just one cable when you get to the office or come home. Docks aren’t just for MacBooks. Mac mini (2018 and later) and iMac (2017 and later) owners may also consider expanding their ports with a Thunderbolt docking station. The inclusion of an SD or microSD card reader isn’t just for camera buffs. It’s a convenient and affordable way to add storage to your laptop setup. We found a 512GB Samsung Evo microSD card on Amazon for around $100 in the US and under £100 in the UK. That’s a very cheap way of adding half a terabyte of portable storage. For more details read up on our best microSD cards. Some of the docks reviewed below include an integrated SSD enclosure that lets you add up to 8TB of fast storage to your connected MacBook. Other dock options Here we concentrate on Thunderbolt docks, but also include cheaper USB-C docks—which Thunderbolt MacBooks can use, but at the cost of reduced bandwidth and display limitations. We’ve also included our favorite Thunderbolt hubs for smaller and cheaper alternatives. For more non-Thunderbolt USB-C-only docks check out Tech Advisor’s roundup of the best USB-C docking stations for laptops. Tech Advisor also reviews all the available Thunderbolt 4 docks. Now think about a stand to go alongside the dock These MacBook docking stations look and work great with a laptop stand, and we’ve also tested some MacBook-friendly stands that lack all the extra ports but keep your MacBook/Air/Pro upright and out of the way: further saving valuable desk space, reducing clutter, keeping your laptop cool, and saving it from spills.",

    "description": "Macworld At a glanceExpert's Rating Pros Top-notch sound Flawless ANC Convenient controls Practical charging box with touch display App is easy to operate AUX and USB connection Cons Sound with weakness in the mids Hi-Res certified audio with LDAC is Android-only Our Verdict The JBL Tour Pro 3 is more than just a competitor to the Apple AirPods Pro. They are a counter design that scores with a comparably great sound, but with other features such as the touch display on the charging box and the USB audio connection. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Price When Reviewed$299.95 Best Prices Today: JBL Tour Pro 3 Retailer Price $299.95 View Deal $299.95 View Deal JBL $300 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket The JBL Tour Pro 3 earphones are equipped with two drivers per earphone. The balanced armature driver ensures clear reproduction of high frequencies, while the 10.2 millimeter speaker driver is responsible for dynamics and bass. The Tour Pro 3 supports the wireless Hi-Res certified audio with LDAC, but that’s an Android-only feature that’s unavailable to Apple device users. The Tour Pro 3 has a total of six microphones, which are controlled by the JBL Crystal AI algorithm. Two external microphones on each earbud capture and transmit the voice, while an internal microphone isolates noise. The windproof design prevents distortion in windy conditions. The call equalizer allows you to adjust your sound precisely, and the sound level optimizer reduces loud sounds and amplifies quiet ones. The JBL Tour Pro 3 is also Zoom-certified. The result is good intelligibility, but the naturalness suffers from the circuitry. The True Adaptive Noise Cancelling 2.0 of the JBL Tour Pro 3 earphones analyzes the environment and adjusts the sound in real time. The JBL Headphones app can be used to regulate how much or how little ambient noise should be let in. An additional set of foam ear pads improves passive isolation. In practice, the ANC impresses with effective noise cancellation that has a minimal impact on the sound. JBL’s extensive experience is evident here. The algorithms can do more than just ANC and ensure a clean sound. If desired, the Tour Pro 3 can recognize that the wearer is speaking and switch the music to pause and activate transparency mode. This allows you to hold a conversation without removing the earphones. This is unusual at first, but the more you use it, the better you get at using this function. The app also allows you to customize the sound and offers various settings. For example, the adaptive noise cancelling can be adjusted to the shape of your ears. Or the settings for ambient noise control can be optimised. You can also perform a best fit and find the earphones using a loud tone. The gesture control settings for the touch surface are of course also included. All in all, the setting options are among the most extensive on the market. The JBL Spatial 360 Sound feature transforms stereo sound into a 360-degree experience with head tracking, whereby the sound changes depending on the movement of the head. This is also impressive, although I prefer to switch it off because I find it unusual. Up to 44 hours of music playback are possible. With ANC deactivated, 11 hours of playback plus three additional full charges with the charging case are realized, while with ANC activated, 8 hours plus three additional full charges with the charging case are available. A 10-minute quick charge also enables three additional hours of music playback. The charging case can also be charged wirelessly, which will please users of 3-in-1 charging stations in particular. Smart charging case The Smart Charging Case has a large touch display that displays the status and controls for Tour Pro 3. The case has an audio adapter, and sound from any AUX or USB-C source can be transmitted wirelessly to the earphones via the supplied jack and USB cables. We have successfully tested this on a Mac. The only impractical thing is that you have to leave the lid of the charging box open. Alternatively, the Auracast button on the display of the charging box can be activated to share content with other Auracast devices in the vicinity. This is done by connecting the device to the Tour Pro 3 Smart Charging Case. Why a display on the charging box? The screen makes sense in several ways. On the one hand, it is practical to be able to check the charge status of the Tour Pro 3 and the charging box, control the music or set ANC. And all this without having to pick up the iPhone. A lot of these controls could be accessed directly via the large touch surfaces on the earbuds, but visual confirmation makes it easier to use. Smart sound Listening to the Live Spirits album by Depeche Mode, the live atmosphere comes across very well. Dave’s voice is powerful and clear to hear, the bass literally cheers the audience on. This fits perfectly with the rocking album, even if the tuning is not neutral, but very powerful despite the equaliser being deactivated. I switch to the album Songs for a Nervous Planet by Tears for Fears. If you’re used to the sound of cheaper earphones, you’re in for a revelation. The music is so much more open and fresh with the JBL Tour Pro 3, which suits pop, rock and electronic music where a clean and powerful bass is required. Acoustic jazz by Norah Jones brings the Tour Pro 3 back down to earth for small true wireless in-ear headphones. Instruments are nicely separated, but a weakness in detail resolution cannot be ignored when using Bluetooth with AAC. For jazz and classical music, the diaphragm area for a full sound is missing, and Apple lacks a high-res codec such as LDAC. In the end, the Tour Pro 3 impress in their class with a very good sound and the potential to tune the sound to your own preferences using a good equaliser. That’s not enough to knock the Apple AirPods Pro off their throne, but they are a real alternative. Should you buy the JBL Tour Pro 3? The JBL Tour Pro 3 is more than just a competitor to the Apple AirPods Pro. The audio dongle feature is quite useful, as is the accompanying app. Best of all, the sound is powerful and a lot of fun, depending on the music genre.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
