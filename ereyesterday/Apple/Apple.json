    "description": "I’m always on the hunt for new MagSafe gear that solves a problem for me. Cases are especially something I am never satisfied with. Some cases are slim but have weak magnets. Others are rugged, but feel like bricks. The somehow pulls off both. It’s lightweight, works perfectly with MagSafe, and adds real protection without killing the feel of the iPhone. I also tried BENKS MagSafe ring holder that does more than just add grip. It can function as a kickstand, rotates easily, and pops off cleanly when it’s time to charge. more…",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.

    "description": "Macworld At a glance Pros Creepy setting and storyline Enjoyable and varied combat system Runs on M1 or later Cons Shooter action might require a game controller No support for Intel Macs Annoying auto-save system Our Verdict The auto-save system can be irksome, but Control is a great action game with an atmospheric inter-dimensional setting and an enjoyable combination of shoot-‘em-up action and psychic super powers. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Price When Reviewed$39.99 Best Prices Today: Control: Ultimate Edition Retailer Price Mac App Store $39.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket We all know that most A-List games are never released on the Mac at all, and even if there is a Mac version then it will often take many months to arrive, long after the release of the PC version. However, there aren’t many games that take quite as long to reach the Mac as Control, which was first released back in 2019. It’s definitely better late than never, though, especially as Control really is one of a kind – a super-powered shoot-‘em-up action game with some seriously weird X-Files vibes. And, hopefully, the developers at Remedy Games will now think about bringing some of their other weirdly wonderful games to the Mac as well, such as the acclaimed Alan Wake series. The X-Files comparisons are inevitable, as the game opens with Jesse Faden arriving at the headquarters of the Federal Bureau Of Control, a government agency that investigates paranormal Altered World Events – known as AWEs. Jesse’s younger brother vanished during an AWE, and since then she has been guided by a mysterious voice in her head that leads her to the headquarters of the FBC. Known as the Oldest House, the FBC office is strangely silent when Jesse arrives, with only a mysterious – and rather creepy – janitor to give her directions to the office of the FBC’s Director. This opening section acts as a tutorial that gives you some time to get the hang of the main controls, but also provides background to the story as Jesse conducts a helpful dialogue with her inner voice as she wanders the halls of the FBC. When she finds the Director’s office it turns out that he is already dead, having apparently killed himself, with his hand gun lying on the floor beside him. This is no ordinary gun though. Known as the Service Weapon, it proceeds to whisper instructions to Jesse, effectively recruiting her into the FBC and assigning missions that she must complete. Jesse’s first mission reveals that the Oldest House is somehow linked to another dimension, where she encounters some shambling alien figures and gets her first taste of combat. It turns out that the Service Weapon has some other tricks up its sleeve too, as it can magically reload whenever Jesse gets low on ammo. That comes in handy as I’ve never been very good at shoot-‘em-up games, and most of my shots miss by miles. However, Jesse also discovers that she has some magic powers of her own, beginning with a kind of psychokinetic punch that allows her to knock back enemies that get too close. This helps to make up for my lousy shooting skills, as I find that I can let the creepy creatures get quite close and then knock them down before pumping bullets into them at close range. Foundry Jesse can further enhance her psychokinetic powers as the game progresses, learning how to hurl objects at enemies, and also upgrading the Service Weapon and other weapons that she finds along the way. The game does have some rough edges – most notably an irritating auto-save feature that only saves the game at specific points. This means that getting killed by a particularly tough enemy often forces you to go back and replay the previous section a few times, retracing your steps through the Oldest House repeatedly as you try yet again to defeat that enemy. That’s one of the few annoying features, though, and the game’s combination of shooter action and psychic powers ensures that the combat is fun and varied, even for someone with my limited shooting skills. The way that the action keeps switching locations between the FBC and the astral plane also keeps things interesting as you try to unravel the mysteries of the Oldest House. Foundry The age of the game also means that you don’t need a powerful Mac to run it properly. The notes on the App Store say that Control requires an M1 processor or later running Sonoma (although there’s no support for Intel Macs, unfortunately). I played the game on a MacBook Pro with an M2 Pro and was able to get a playable 34 frames per second when running at 2560×1440 resolution with Medium graphics settings, so you should be able to get decent performance even with an M1 if you don’t mind lowering the resolution and graphics settings a little. It’s a shame, though, that there’s no demo version available so that you can check it out first. And, yet again, the Mac version of Control is only available on the Mac App Store, so people who already own the PC version on Epic or Steam will have to buy the Mac version separately. Remedy did tell us that they were hoping to make the Mac version available on Steam at some point, but weren’t able to provide a definite release date at the time of this review. Control is a little more expensive than we expected for a game that is a few years old, costing $39.99/£34.99 on the Mac App Store. But that is similar to the price of the PC version, and this Ultimate Edition includes two expansion packs with additional missions and stories for you to uncover. Should you buy Control? The emphasis on shoot-‘em-up action may not appeal to everyone, but the additional psychic powers that Jesse can learn during the game does help to keep things varied and interesting. And, of course, the conspiracies and mysteries of the Federal Bureau Of Control will appeal to fans of the X-Files as well, making it a good option for anyone who enjoys challenging and atmospheric action games.

    "description": "Macworld At a glanceExpert's Rating Pros Impressive connectivity 100W power for charging laptop Competitive price Gaming port for wireless keyboard/mouse Cons Just one USB 4 port No Thunderbolt support Modest data transfer speeds Unclear info relating to dual-display support Our Verdict The use of USB rather than Thunderbolt means that the USB 4 Dock isn’t aimed at professional users who need high-speed data transfer. However, it does provide dual-display support (60Hz) along with an impressive selection of ports and connectors for general use in an office, and a competitive price. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Price When Reviewed$229 Best Prices Today: Razer USB 4 Dock Retailer Price $229.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Type: USB-C/USB-A dock Ports: 14 (13 available for peripherals) Power: 100W for laptop; 180W max External Displays: 1x 4K at 120Hz, or 2x 4K at 60Hz Razer is best known for its range of high-end gaming gear, which is mostly designed for Windows PCs, but it also makes a number of more down-to-earth accessories that are suitable for general use at home or in an office. It makes several docks and hubs that can be used with Macs and PCs, including a fairly expensive Thunderbolt 4 dock that weighs in at around $300/£300. Now it has launched the less expensive ‘USB 4 Dock’, which manages to provide dual-monitor support along with an impressive selection of ports and connectors for the considerably lower price of $229.99/£229.99 (and Razer prefers USB 4 rather than the official USB4). Available in black or Mercury White – which is really just silver, and very similar in tone to the M4 Mac mini – the USB 4 Dock is neatly designed and very sturdily built. The body of the dock is made out of anodized aluminium, which feels very solid and also has a smooth, scratch-resistant finish that looks very smart. It’s quite compact too, given that Razer has managed to squeeze in no less than 14 separate ports and connectors – although it’s worth noting that the main USB4 port is used to connect the dock to your Mac, leaving 13 ports that are available for connecting a monitor and other accessories. The USB 4 Dock measures just 22mm high, 190mm wide and 80mm deep, and is fairly light too, weighing 1.1kg, and Razer’s web site does make a point of referring to its “portable design”. However, it neglects to mention the additional mains power supply that is also included in the box. The power supply is almost as large as the dock itself, and slightly heavier, so the USB 4 Dock really isn’t going to stray very far from your desk at home or in the office. It is, however, very versatile, as that chunky power supply provides 100W of power for charging a MacBook or a PC laptop, along with additional power for all the other ports and connectors on the dock. On the back of the dock you’ll find the main USB4 port – with USB-C connector – which is used to connect your MacBook or other computer to the dock (with USB4 cable included in the box). Alongside this are both HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 connectors for connecting external monitors – but, again, Razer’s web site proves to be a little unclear here. The website refers to the dock’s support for dual displays and seems to imply that the first display can run at 4K resolution with 120Hz refresh rate, with a second 4K display running at 60Hz. However, our discussions with Razer confirmed that the USB 4 Dock can run a single 4K display at 120Hz, or two 4K displays at 60Hz, so that’s something to remember if you’re planning to use the USB 4 Dock as part of a multi-monitor set-up. The rest of the dock’s features are more straightforward. Also located on the back panel is a Gigabit Ethernet port for a wired network connection, and three USB-A (3.2) ports, two of which provide data transfer of 10Gbps while the third runs at 5Gbps. There are even more USB ports on the front as well – two USB-C and one USB-A, with all three running at 10Gbps. And, to keep Razer’s gaming audience happy, there’s one last USB-A port located all on its own on the left-hand edge of the dock, which is specifically designed to hold a 2.4GHz wireless dongle that can provide a low-latency connection for a wireless keyboard and mouse. The dock provides good audio support too, as the front panel houses a 3.5mm audio connector, which can work with either a microphone or a set of wired headphones. There are also two slots on the front for SD and MicroSD memory cards, for transferring photos or video from a camera. It’s worth noting though, that there’s just that one USB4 port on the back, which is used to connect your MacBook to the dock, with all the other USB ports supporting USB 3.2. If you need higher performance – perhaps for backing up large video or graphics files onto an SSD – then you may need to look at a more expensive Thunderbolt dock instead. However, the strength of the USB 4 Dock is its sheer versatility, with 13 ports and connectors available for attaching peripherals and accessories, and the ability to power and charge multiple devices all at the same time. Should you buy the Razer USB 4 Dock? Professional users who need the full speed of Thunderbolt 4 – or even Thunderbolt 5 on the latest Macs with M4 Pro chips – might prefer a more expensive Thunderbolt dock for working with large video or graphics files. The USB 4 Dock isn’t in that league for sheer performance, but its versatile selection of ports and connectors will be a real boon for people – like me – who have a selection of SSDs, webcam, keyboard and other accessories in their office that they need to use with their Mac every day.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
