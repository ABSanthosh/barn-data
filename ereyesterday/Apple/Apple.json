In an era of bulky towers and a G4 Cube just years before that impressed but didn't deliver, the little box brought Apple power to a small desktop package, and I was enthused.And since then, I've had one in service 24/7 constantly. Even now with a Mac Studio on my desk, there's one upstairs in use with a family member, one in the other room silently humming away acting as my network attached storage and test platform, and a few more on my shelf that I've hoarded over the years, just waiting for an application.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2519853/m4-mac-mini-teardown-shows-future-upgradability-in-a-seriously-packed-package.html",
    "description": "Macworld iFixit has posted its video teardown of the new M4 Mac mini, and as usual, it‚Äôs a fascinating study of how design, engineering, and technology come together‚Äìor in this case, taken apart While a lot of people are interested in the inner workings of Apple‚Äôs products, the Mac mini might draw more interest than any other product. There‚Äôs a widespread belief that users should be able to perform a certain amount of customization and upgrades with desktop computers, even with Macs. And the Mac mini has been used in unique situations and projects. Teardowns like iFixit‚Äôs don‚Äôt just satisfy curiosity, they provide useful information. Watch iFixit‚Äôs video, and after that, here are a few takeaways from the teardown. It‚Äôs packed to the gills The M1 and M2 Mac minis used an old design and left a lot of space inside. With the new design, the Mac mini is immensely packed. It‚Äôs an incredible feat of design and engineering, but it also provides a serious hurdle to do-it-yourselfers. Which leads us to‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs user upgradeable‚Ä¶but is it, really? Apple clearly has an idea of what components should be accessible, and it‚Äôs obvious in the Mac mini. For example, the CMOS battery is designed for access without diving deeper into the machine. In fact, it‚Äôs the only component that‚Äôs readily accessible. We heard early reports about the Mac mini‚Äôs SSD being upgradeable and the iFixit video provides more info. The M4 and M4 Pro Mac minis use modules of different sizes and iFixit couldn‚Äôt get its Mac mini to work when they tried swapping the SSDs. iFixit often refers to the Mac mini as being upgradeable, but being ‚Äúupgradeable‚Äù involves the ability to remove a part and replace it with an available part. At this point, there‚Äôs no available part for the Mac mini. Apple uses a proprietary SSD module that is nothing like the NVMe SSDs used in Windows PCs and is made by third parties such as Crucial. You can‚Äôt buy a NVMe and pop it into the Mac mini. Could a company make a Mac mini-compatible SSD module? Maybe, but would it be worth the investment for them? It‚Äôs hard to say. The Mac mini‚Äôs SSD is similar to that of the Mac Studio, and a Kickstarter project to make a third-party Mac Studio SSD upgrade has exceeded its funding goal, but it has only 142 backers. Granted, the Mac Studio is more of a niche than the Mac mini, but it still seems like a low-volume endeavor. In case you‚Äôre wondering, the RAM is incorporated in the M4 chip, as it has since the M1. There is no way to upgrade RAM after purchase. The fan is big The ring of vents at the bottom of the Mac mini leads to a fan that takes up a considerable amount of space (and even more space in the M4 Pro model). I can‚Äôt help but wonder if smaller cooling units can be used, which could make the Mac mini even more tiny. For example, Frore System makes ‚Äúsolid-state active cooling chips‚Äù that are super thin and effective. Last year, I covered how they modified a MacBook Air with its cooling chips, which allowed it to stop throttling to maintain a proper operating temperature. I don‚Äôt know what a system like Frore‚Äôs would cost to implement, but I imagine it‚Äôs not as cheap as a fan, so it may be too pricey for consideration.",

    "description": "Macworld Apple‚Äôs brand-new MacBook Pro only just went on sale last week and it already has its first discount: Amazon has dropped the price to $1,474, a savings of $125 off its $1,599 MSRP and a surprising price cut for such a new model. Running on a powerful M4 chip, the MacBook Pro will easily tackle any task you throw its way with extreme ease. And don‚Äôt forget, it now comes with 16GB of RAM standard, double the previous model, and essentially a $200 price cut. The MacBook Pro already had a good battery, but they‚Äôve improved on that too. In our test, the laptop ran for about 20 hours before finally shutting down. That‚Äôs more than enough for you to leave home without a charger. In our review of the MacBook Pro M4, we gave it a near-perfect score, praising its performance, the powerful Center Stage camera, and the nano-texture glass display. The 14.2‚Ä≥ Liquid Retina XDR display offers stunning colors, high brightness, and sharp details: ‚ÄúThe changes that Apple made to the $1,599/¬£1,599 M4 MacBook Pro not only made it a clear pro laptop (finally), but it also created a package bursting with value.‚Äù So there you have it‚Äîskip Black Friday and get yourself the MacBook Pro M4 because we don‚Äôt know how long this sale will last.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
