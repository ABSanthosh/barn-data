    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Macworld iPhones are built to last a long time, which means that there are a lot of Lightning-equipped iPhones still in use, even though Apple replaced the Lightning port on its iPhones with USB-C in 2023 with the iPhone 15. And with USB-C connectors and cables becoming more and more ubiquitous, Lightning iPhones can leave you unable to connect if you don‚Äôt have an adapter handy. Ken Pillonel‚Äôs new invention makes life easier for Lightning iPhone users. His company, Obsoless, is offering the iPh0n3 USB-C Protection Case, which has a built-in Lightning-to-USB-C adapter, so you never have to worry about carrying one around with you. The case has a Lightning connector inside that works with the USB-C port on the corner of the case. It supports fast charging, data transfers, and CarPlay, but devices that draw power from the iPhone through the port (like some USB-C speakers or headphones) will not work. The cases is available only in ‚Äústrong dark gray,‚Äù but it does work with MagSafe. Obsoless states the the case is available for iPhones as old as the iPhone XS, but many of the cases made during the first production run are sold out. A second run is in the works, with availability by the end of August. Of the inventory remaining, prices range from CHF 43.90 (Swiss francs‚ÄîOboless is in Switerzerland) for an iPhone 13 mini case to CHF 49.90 for an iPhone 14 Pro Max case. That‚Äôs about $55 and $63, respectively. The prices do not include shipping. Learn more about the iPh0n3 USB-C Protection Case by watching the YouTube video below. Pillonel made headlines four years ago when he modified an iPhone X (or Xs) and replaced the Lightning port with USB-C. He eventually sold that iPhone and started a business making accessories that are sold through Obsoless.

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple‚Äôs Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber‚Äôs The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. [‚Ä¶] Phil‚Äôs appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers ‚Äî remember, developer relations is all under Phil ‚Äî might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn‚Äôt have (they‚Äôre pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple‚Äôs enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†* For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community ‚Äî and I can‚Äôt help but suspect that it won‚Äôt come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We‚Äôll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it‚Äôs easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that‚Äôs either not the case, or it doesn‚Äôt stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I‚Äôm not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I‚Äôve decided that it‚Äôs best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple‚Äôs leaders are doing that, too.",

I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",
