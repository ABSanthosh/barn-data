    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2385455/rcs-iphone-ios-18-faq.html",
    "description": "Macworld Ever since Apple shocked the tech community with its announcement that it would support RCS, we‚Äôve been waiting for the day when it would be available. Now that day has arrived, you can finally use it on your iPhone, here‚Äôs how it works. Updated March 5, 2025: The latest iOS 18.4 beta adds RCS support for more carriers, including most of those in the U.S. that haven‚Äôt supported it until now. What is RCS? RCS stands for Rich Communications Services, and it‚Äôs meant to be a replacement for the decades-old SMS/MMS texting standard. You can kind of think of it as iMessage lite for everyone. It‚Äôs a platform-neutral standard adopted by the GSM Association to do messaging over your internet data connection rather than strictly your carrier network. It provides many of the same benefits, including typing indicators, full-resolution images and videos, proper group chats, delivery and read receipts, and better security. The standard has been pushed heavily by Google and is commonplace on Android phones. The Google Messages app provides RCS support on almost any Android phone using Google‚Äôs own RCS servers and even includes some extensions to add new features (most notably better encryption) that are not part of the core GSM standard. All you need to know as an iPhone user is that RCS will make your conversations with Android users much more pleasant. What RCS features will iOS 18 support? In iOS 18, RCS brings numerous features that were previously only available to iMessage users: Read receipts Typing indicators Tapbacks/reactions High-resolution photos and videos Voice memos Text effects (slam, loud, gentle, invisible ink, etc.) do not appear on the conversation‚Äôs Android side. The recipient will get a message saying ‚Äú(sent with the Slam effect)‚Äù or the like. Inline replies also don‚Äôt work. RCS messages are not encrypted, either. When using the Google Messages app on an Android phone and Google‚Äôs own RCS servers, encryption is supported thanks to a proprietary extension to the standard that Google came up with. Apple is relying on carrier support for the RCS standard as adopted by the GSM Association, which doesn‚Äôt have encryption support. However, Apple says they want to work with the GSM to include it in a future version of the standard. Will my messages with Android users still be green? Yes! Blue bubbles are for iMessages only and are there to help you know that your messages have extremely strong encryption, among other exclusive features. So, the green bubble conversations aren‚Äôt going anywhere. But they‚Äôll be less frustrating. How do I know if I have RCS on my iPhone? The simplest way is to open a message with someone and look at the text entry area: It will say iMessage if you‚Äôre sending an iMessage (but the blue bubbles will be an obvious indication). It will say Text Message ‚Ä¢ SMS if it‚Äôs sending a text message. It will say Text Message ‚Ä¢ RCS if it‚Äôs an RCS message. You can also check in Settings to see if RCS is enabled, which we‚Äôll describe below. If you don‚Äôt see the iOS 18 update, check to make sure your iPhone supports iOS 18. Does my carrier need to support RCS? How do I know if mine does? Your carrier needs to provide RCS services in accordance with the GSM Association‚Äôs standard for it to work on your iPhone, and you of course need to run iOS 18. In the United States, the major carriers Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT\u0026T have all enabled RCS on iPhones running iOS 18, though if you just installed iOS 18 you may have to wait a day or so for the provisioning codes to be sent to your phone. The situation is a bit more nebulous for MVNO carriers that piggyback off those major carriers, like Visible, Xfinity, Mint Mobile, Metro, or Cricket. With the iOS 18.4 update, support for RCS is being added for the last holdout carriers‚ÄîGoogle Fi, Metro, Mint Mobile, and others. Once your iPhone is updated to iOS 18.4 or later, it should support RCS on nearly any U.S. carrier. There is no known way to ‚Äúforce‚Äù RCS onto your iPhone. But if your carrier supports it and you have iOS 18 and do not see the option, it may help to power off your iPhone and power it on again. Apple has a very useful Carrier Support page that lists all the carrier features for various carriers around the world, big and small. You can see if your carrier supports RCS there (along with other features). How do I enable or disable RCS in Settings? Open Settings, scroll down to the bottom and tap Apps, then scroll down to find and select Messages. Under the ‚ÄúText Messaging‚Äù heading, you‚Äôll see an RCS Messaging menu if it is supported by your carrier and iPhone. Select it and then toggle on RCS to enable it in the Messages app. You can check if your carrier supports RCS by opening Settings, selecting General, and then About. Scroll down to the ‚ÄúeSIM/Network‚Äù section. You‚Äôll see a line for ‚ÄúCarrier.‚Äù Tap on it to switch that line to ‚ÄúIMS Status.‚Äù If your carrier supports RCS, the option will show Voice, SMS \u0026 RCS. If not, it will only show Voice \u0026 SMS.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2628147/the-macs-space-gray-era-is-officially-over.html",
    "description": "Macworld As part of the M4 MacBook Air announcement on Wednesday, Apple also revealed a brand new MacBook color: Sky Blue. But it comes with a price: Gone is the MacBook Air‚Äôs longstanding Space Gray option, which means that Apple no longer offers any new Mac in Space Gray. Space Gray made its debut on the iPhone 5s in 2013 (which we referred to as ‚Äúsomething called ‚Äòspace gray'‚Äù when it was introduced). The first Mac in Space Gray was the 12-inch MacBook in 2015, which we described as a ‚Äúserious and sophisticated finish‚Äù‚Äìwe also erroneously wrote it as ‚Äúgrey‚Äù and not ‚Äúgray‚Äù as Apple puts it. While Space Gray had only one name during its tenure, it took on different shades over the years. Sometimes it was lighter and nearly silver, other times it was darker and closer to black. Which was an odd thing for Apple, a company that prides itself in its design consistency. Apple has not commented on the end of Space Gray, and just because it‚Äôs no longer offered on a Mac right now doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs one forever. Apple could decide to revive it in the future. Apple‚Äôs Mac color choices are bright and colorful (with one darker Midnight option) on the consumer side, metallic shades on the pro side, and silver for the tween-ish Mac mini. If you really want a Space Gray Mac, you have to settle for older models at third-party retailers or in the Apple Certified Refurbished Store. However, Space Gray still lives on the iPad Air and the iPad mini. If you feel like grieving for the loss of Space Gray on the Mac, please enjoy the Space Gray memorial slideshow below. You can even play this song while you‚Äôre looking at the pictures.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00.

All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today.
