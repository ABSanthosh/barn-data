    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

However, while seemingly getting within reach of a release to the public, consumers will have to wait longer for the fabled hardware to arrive.According to Mark Gurman in Sunday's \"Power On\" newsletter for Bloomberg, the Home Hub was postponed due to it relying on a number of updates to Siri. Originally planned for iOS 18.4, those updates have yet to arrive, which also means features of the hub wouldn't have worked either.

    "description": "Macworld Learning a new language is a great way to build a mental practice, get ahead at work, and get ready for your next vacation. MosaLingua offers training in 11 different languages on iOS and other platforms to get you fluent, fast. Act fast and get a lifetime subscription for its lowest price ever at $85.97 until July 15. The MosaLingua app is built around three core tenets, the first being accessibility. MosaLingua’s unique AI and language tools like MosaDiscovery can be incorporated into your Netflix streams, your web browsing and more to help you learn languages from the content you’re most familiar with. There’s also a virtual tutor available so you can practice whenever you’re ready to learn. The second is science-based training design. Working closely with top linguists and staying up on trends, MosaLingua structures its lessons around approaches such as vocabulary training with visuals, text, and audio, and uses techniques like spaced repetition and the 80/20 rule to help you learn. Spoken dialogues, flash cards, grammar lessons, audio stories, and more are all used to keep learning fun and help you stay focused. The third is practicality. If you’ve used language software that demands you set aside a half hour every day, you know how hard it can be to stick with it. MosaLingua is built for busy people, and trains you on common words and phrases shared between cultures before building from there. Lessons are concise, just 10 minutes long per session, and MosaLingua has both offline modes for your device as well as cross-platform progression between the apps and their website. Currently MosaLingua offers English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Arabic, with new languages under development. Get started on language learning with a lifetime subscription to the MosaLingua app for iOS and Android for $85.97 until July 15 at 11:59pm Pacific.

    "description": "Macworld The craziness of Prime Day is over, but when your deliveries finally start to roll in, you might realize that you prioritized things you wanted instead of things you need. If you blew your budget on fun things like new golf clubs and a flatscreen, but soon realized your old Mac sounds like a jet plane taking off, this deal is for you. This near-mint 13″ MacBook Pro is now just $324.97 — that’s 78% off retail. With a new macOS predicted to come in September, older models of MacBooks will become obsolete and no longer be able to be serviced or have their software upgraded. If your Mac was purchased between 2015 and 2016, it’s likely to be included in that list. This 2017 MacBook Pro features the powerful Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB of memory and up to 512GB of flash storage to handle all your streaming, scrolling, and side hustles with ease. It also features the beloved second generation Touch Bar for controlling brightness, volume, Touch ID, and Apple Pay. As a Grade A refurb, this device comes in a near-mint condition without any major flaws, but it comes at just a fraction of the price. Pick up this incredible deal on the MacBook Pro through July 15th.

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",
