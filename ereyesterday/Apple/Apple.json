And while much of the spotlight will probably shine on the visual overhaul, 9to5Mac has learned that Apple has also been quietly preparing a handful of enhancements to everyday apps like Messages, Music, Notes, and even CarPlay.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2802120/apple-might-release-new-hardware-at-wwdc25-after-all.html",
    "description": "Macworld We’re less than a week away from Apple’s biggest event of the year, and as the WWDC25 keynote approaches, expect the hype and the rumors to ramp up. For example, @aaronp613 on X points out that the WWDC25 hashmoji is now live. In case you’re wondering, it looks like the glossy Apple icon, but it’s interestingly labeled as “BF-14032_WWDC25_HashmojiBefore,” which seems to indicate that there will be another hashmoji after the keynote. More intriguing, however, is a tidbit posted by @aaronp613, which states that third-party retailers received an email from Apple about “resources to help you talk to customers about what’s possible when hardware and software are designed together.” This can be interpreted in a couple of ways. One way to look at it is tied to the rumored new user-interface language that Apple will be implementing throughout its operating systems, and that the company is making a concerted effort to train retailers in the messaging about the changes. @aaronp613/X Another way to look at it is that Apple is going to release a new hardware device next week and wants to make sure retailers know how to demonstrate it. Could it be the rumored HomeHub or HomePod with an iPad-like display? Reports have said that these devices were on the release schedule for this year, but the delays with Siri also pushed these products back. It’s certainly something to think about until the WWDC25 keynote on Monday at 10 a.m. Pacific, which you can watch live. Until then, enjoy the new WWDC25 promo video below that Apple released on TikTok. Learn more about WWDC25. #id683f1c8e47d3f .jw-wrapper::before { content: \"WWDC25 TikTok promo\" !important; }",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2801089/the-5-most-exciting-ipados-19-upgrades-we-cant-wait-to-see-at-wwdc.html",
    "description": "Macworld WWDC25 kicks off in less than a week, and we’re going to get our first look at the new iOS, macOS, and watchOS features that’ll land on our devices later this year. Rumors suggest there are tons of changes in store, including a universal user interface across all Apple operating systems and a new naming scheme. But the biggest changes could be for the iPad. Ever since Apple rebranded iOS on the iPad as iPadOS, there have been a handful of exclusive tablet features each year, but this year might bring some real sweeping interface changes that bring it closer to the Mac. Here are the five most exciting features expected to arrive in iPadOS 19. A futuristic vision iPadOS 19 will reportedly pack a significant UI overhaul, offering your tablet a new look at least partially inspired by visionOS. The design refresh will likely feature translucent, glass-like elements and retire the solid buttons that have been prevalent since iPadOS arrived in 2019. We expect said redesign to spread across iOS, macOS, watchOS, and even tvOS, which will streamline Apple’s devices with a familiar, matching appearance. So, if you’re working on your Mac and iPad simultaneously, locating the same icons and menus on both devices should become simpler. And to tie it all together, Apple is also rumored to be jumping all monikers to 26 to make sure everyone knows which version they should be running. Imminent Mac-ification When power users requested proper multitasking support on the iPad, Apple pacified them with Stage Manager back in iPadOS 16. In theory, it’s a neat feature, letting you resize apps, stack windows, or place apps side by side. In practice, Stage Manager isn’t very intuitive, and most users have stuck with the more predictable Split View and Slide Over tools. For iPadOS 19, Apple is said to be working on Mac-like productivity features that elevate the existing multitasking experience on the tablet. These could include Stage Manager 2.0, a more flexible window management system that unshackles some of the current restrictions. Those with a connected Magic Keyboard may also receive a menubar on their iPad for the first time. It all sounds very exciting for iPad users and could finally move the tablet out of its iPhone shadow. iPadOS 19 will reportedly bring some important Stage Manager updates.Foundry More AI? Aye! Last year, Apple kickstarted its serious AI efforts when it released iOS and iPadOS 18.1. Those builds packed the very first batch of Apple Intelligence features, letting users generate text, summarize content, reduce interruptions with a new Focus mode, etc. Apple followed that up with subsequent AI updates, including image generation capabilities and the ChatGPT integration. While iPadOS 18.4 was initially set to introduce Siri 2.0, Apple pushed the feature to a future update, and some reports suggest Apple may have to rebuild the entire project from scratch. So, at some point during the iPadOS 19 cycle, we should expect Siri on the iPad to gain on-screen content awareness and support for advanced in-app actions. The virtual assistant should also be able to pull personal data from your calendar, notes, messages, and emails when you inquire about past events. iPadOS 19 will reportedly bake Google Gemini into the system as an alternative to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The OS will also reportedly have a feature that uses artificial intelligence to reduce energy consumption and predict how long a full battery charge will take. Elsewhere, iPadOS 19 may provide AirPods users with a live translation feature, similar to that on Google’s Pixel Buds, as well as an AI-powered health coach to guide interested users by offering lifestyle tips. And we expect a lot more AI goodies to be baked in, even if the big Siri overhaul is delayed yet another year. Thinking outside the Xbox Every couple of years, Apple promotes some AAA games on stage in an attempt to establish its devices as proper gaming platforms. While the game libraries on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV are rapidly expanding, they’re nowhere as abundant as those on PCs and consoles—and they’re definitely not taken as seriously (by gamers and developers alike). To further appeal to gamers, Apple will reportedly reveal a new gaming app for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS. The preinstalled app on iPadOS 19 could house users’ installed games, Game Center leaderboards, the Arcade storefront, and more. Whether this new strategy actually plays out remains to be seen. But if it does, the iPad could become a killer gaming device to rival Steam Deck.  Arabic calligraphy will reportedly be one of the Apple Pencil’s new tricks in iPadOS 19.Foundry Pencil it in According to rumors, iPadOS 19 and the Apple Pencil will support calligraphy designed for the Arabic script as well as cater to MENA users with a new bidirectional software keyboard. This would make it easier for certain multilingual folks to quickly switch between the Arabic and English languages and write in their native language. What about hardware? Other iPadOS 19 perks could include revamped Health, Home, and Translate apps, in addition to cross-device sync for captive Wi-Fi network login credentials. There’ll also be a slew of new accessibility tools designed for those with alternative needs. But apart from the new software, you may be wondering if WWD25 will feature any iPad-related hardware announcements. Well, the iPad, iPad mini, and iPad Air were all recently refreshed, so new iterations for these particular models are off the table. Conversely, the iPad Pro’s last upgrade occurred more than a year ago—in May 2024. While the iPad Pro M5 is reportedly in the works, it’ll likely launch towards the end of this year. It wouldn’t completely shock us if the M5 and the iPad Pro debuted at WWDC, but we’re not betting on it. But there will definitely be enough iPadOS changes to make your tablet feel like it’s new. You’ll be able to download the first iPadOS developer beta after the main WWDC25 keynote concludes on Monday, or if you’d rather wait till the stable launch, Apple will ship the finished version in mid-September. Make sure to check Macworld during and after the event and subscribe to our daily newsletter to keep up with all the latest announcements.",

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.
