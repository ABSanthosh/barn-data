    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/231363/the-best-cloud-storage-services-for-apple-users-2.html",
    "description": "Macworld These days cloud storage is all the rage, offering the convenience of access to your digital files without having to clog up your mobile devices‚Äô storage. It‚Äôs also particularly useful now that so may of us work from home and need to be able to access our data outside the office. Provided you‚Äôve got internet access, everything is hunky-dory. A good cloud storage solution backs up your important documents, photos, and videos, but it also helps keep all your devices in sync. It‚Äôs a great way to make sure your desktop, laptop, phone, and tablet all have instant access to all your digital content. It should also allow you to access and edit documents from a web browser and easily share files and folders with others. Another reason to use a cloud service ‚Äì or any service that offers offsite back up for your Mac ‚Äì is that it protects your data if something happens at the location where your Mac and backup are located. PROMOTIONSecure Cloud Storage for Growing Businesses Get ample space for all your files with Google Workspace. Enjoy up to 5 TB of secure cloud storage, plus business versions of Gmail, Calendar, Meet, and more. Now with Gemini for Workspace to boost productivity with AI. Try free for 14 days Owners of Macs, iPads and iPhones will naturally tend to favour iCloud, Apple‚Äôs own cloud service, because it‚Äôs so well integrated with those devices‚Äô operating systems. Here‚Äôs our full guide to using iCloud and here is iCloud‚Äôs current pricing structure. However, iCloud only really syncs your data and it isn‚Äôt a way to back up your Mac. If you want to back up your Mac to the cloud you need to look at options like Backblaze, Carbonite and Acronis included below and in our guide to the Best Mac backup software. You may only be looking for a way to store a few items so you can access them anywhere, or so you can share them with others, in which case iCloud and other options like Google Drive and Microsoft One Drive could meet your needs. In this article, we round up all the best iCloud alternatives: the cloud storage services for Mac, iPhone and iPad that offer the most appealing combination of price, features, security and reliability. If you use Apple products, we think these are the best cloud storage solutions to which you should subscribe. We are starting with iCloud because Apple‚Äôs service is simple to use and mostly intuitive. It‚Äôs available on all Apple products and syncs all your data ‚Äì as long as you have enough iCloud storage. It doesn‚Äôt act as a backup for your Mac, but you can access a backup of your iPhone or iPad via iCloud. Read: Time Machine vs iCloud: Do you need to use both and can one back up to the other? Read on to find out what the alternatives offer. Apple iCloud Drive ‚Äì Best for Apple fans Price When Reviewed: Free (5GB), 99c (50GB), $2.99 (200GB), $9.99 (2TB), $29.99 (6TB), $59.99 (12TB) a month Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Apple (Monthly) $0.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $0.99 at Apple (Monthly) View Apple iCloud here As an Apple user, you‚Äôll have heard of iCloud, but we don‚Äôt blame you if you find it confusing. It‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs own cloud-based storage system, and if you own an iPhone or iPad and have an Apple ID, you‚Äôll already have 5GB free storage. It‚Äôs the easiest way for those bought into the Apple ecosystem (users of iPhone, iPad and Mac) to sync contacts, notes, files, photos and more across devices and access them on all their devices. For example, you can use the Files folder on an iPhone or iPad to view all your files stored in the cloud. Because it integrates so seamlessly with all of Apple‚Äôs products and services, iCloud really is the best cloud storage solution for someone who is all-in with Apple. And I do mean all-in: All your computers are Macs, your mobile devices are iPhone or iPads, you work in Apple‚Äôs productivity software (Pages, Numbers, Notes), and so on. Frustratingly, Apple only provides a paltry 5GB of free iCloud storage, which isn‚Äôt so bad if all you want to do is store some Pages and Numbers documents, but is grossly inadequate for photos and videos. Apple is years overdue for increasing this limit (Google offers 15GB free), but at the very least, it should stop counting iOS backups against it. Since the fall of 2021, Apple has offered to ‚Äúloan‚Äù you as much iCloud storage space as you need to backup and restore your data onto a new device, for up to two weeks. It‚Äôs a good feature for those buying a new Apple device, but it won‚Äôt help you protect your data if your iPhone gets lost/stolen/damaged. From there, it‚Äôs $0.99/¬£0.99 per month for 50GB, $2.99/¬£2.99 for 200GB, $9.99/¬£8.99 for 2TB, $29.99/¬£26.99 for 6TB and $59.99/¬£54.99 for 20GB. See: iCloud storage plans. You can enable family sharing on the 200GB and above plans‚Äîif you do, it doesn‚Äôt mean your family members can see all your cloud stuff. It just means your whole family‚Äôs iCloud usage will count against the same storage limit. These paid tiers are branded ‚ÄúiCloud+‚Äù and include several benefits. There‚Äôs iCloud Private Relay, free storage for HomeKit enabled security cameras, a Hide My Email feature, custom domain names for iCloud email accounts, and additional contact options for recovering your account. These are all excellent features that help solidify our view that iCloud is by far the best choice for those who are all-in on Apple devices. The main benefit of paying for more iCloud storage is that nearly all of Apple‚Äôs apps can seamlessly sync through it. Photos, productivity apps, Mail, Calendar, and anything you drop into your iCloud Drive folder in Finder on a Mac are immediately available across all your Apple devices. A significant number of iOS apps optionally back up and sync through iCloud, too. If you use non-Mac computers or non-iOS mobile devices from time to time, Apple provides a full suite of web apps at iCloud.com, but they‚Äôre sort of mediocre. Apple also provides an iCloud Windows app that syncs data and integrates your iCloud mail with common Windows apps like Outlook, but there are no native productivity apps for Windows or Android: If you want to edit a Pages document, you have to use the web interface. We like using iCloud, but we also pay for it. Most decent cloud services require you to pay a small fee. If you‚Äôre a heavy Apple user, you might consider the¬†Apple One service bundle. It‚Äôs much more than a cloud storage solution, and thus beyond the scope of this article, but the value offered may tip the scales in iCloud‚Äôs favor for you. Read our full Apple iCloud review Google Drive ‚Äì King of Cloud Price When Reviewed: Free (15GB), $1.99 (100GB), $2.99 (200GB), $9.99 (2TB) a month. If you don't see the 200GB deal select 100GB and upgrade from that. Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Google (monthly) $1.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $1.99 at Google (monthly) View Google Drive here While the idea of using Google‚Äôs tools on Apple hardware may make some squirm, it‚Äôs deep integration with Google Docs, Sheets, and other popular Google tools means it‚Äôs never been easier to share a document with a colleague, collect feedback, and make amendments.¬† Google‚Äôs system, alongside Dropbox and OneDrive, is arguably one of the most common file-sharing options. It‚Äôs much more prevalent than, say, iCloud Drive, making it much more useful across multiple platforms. If your workflows and job require any degree of rapid sharing of files back and forth, it‚Äôs a perfect fit. Outside of work, Google Photos may also appeal as a nice backup option to have, but it‚Äôll start to eat into your storage pretty quickly. That said, Google Drive does comes with a whopping 15GB of free storage ‚Äì that‚Äôs triple what Apple offers for free on¬†iCloud Drive. 15GB is plenty generous, but you can enjoy 100GB for just $1.99/¬£1.59 a month, 200GB for $2.99/¬£2.49, and 2TB for $9.99/¬£7.99 per month. There‚Äôs even a massive 30TB for $150 a month. You can use Google Drive on Mac through a dedicated app, or via the web interface. Whether you‚Äôre on Mac, iPhone, iPad, or just about any other platform, Google Drive remains the best option around.

It‚Äôs essentially a menu bar app that can pop out into a handy search bar to trawl through anything inside your Box folder, which will also appear in your Finder sidebar. A keyboard shortcut brings up the search bar, so Box is always just a keypress away.¬† There‚Äôs a note section that syncs across devices and a document signing tool that‚Äôs very handy if you‚Äôre exchanging a lot of contracts. It‚Äôs secure, too, with encryption standard across all plans and end-to-end encryption offered via Box KeySafe so users can issue their own encryption keys. The web app is fast and stable (unlike some rivals) making shifting files between folders when away from the Mac much simpler. Box offers a very generous free plan offering 10GB of storage and a 250MB file upload limit, but the next tier up is $14/¬£11 monthly for individuals ($10/¬£8 per month if you pay annually), which is a steep increase compared to the likes of Google Drive.¬† Box nails just about anything you could want from a cloud storage service in 2025. It‚Äôs fast, secure, and gets out of the way when you need it to, making it an easy pick for businesses.

You‚Äôll get access to 4GB of free storage, which is less than we‚Äôre used to, but can be raised to can be raised to 10GB if you invite friends. There are varied annual prices, ranging from $49.99 a year for 500GB, and lifetime options from $299. pCloud‚Äôs web app is clean and easy-to-navigate. You can store and share all types of files, and set a directory or a local folder on your Mac to keep backed up. Media plays well within pCloud. Saved a video? You‚Äôll be able to watch it via the in-window player, and the same can be said for audio and images, too.¬† pCloud is pretty fantastic as an alternative to some of the usual suspects.

Firstly, it has a free tier ‚Äì you can back up 5GB without paying anything. After that, though, it‚Äôs more expensive than either its competitors. Currently, the annual charge for the Personal tier is $59.62 (approx ¬£46) for the first year and $79.50/year (approx ¬£61) after that, but that only allows you to backup 5TB of data, while Backblaze and Carbonite allow unlimited data. However, that 5TB can be spread across multiple computers, whereas Backblaze and Carbonite limit you to one computer. Also, if you prefer to restore by having data physically shipped to you, lDrive provides that for free for the first restore each year ‚Äì though if you‚Äôre outside the US you‚Äôll have to pay for the shipping. Like Backblaze, lDrive also allows you to back up external hard drives. Even with external drives backing up, it‚Äôs unlikely most people will breach the 5TB limit ‚Äì bearing in mind that you‚Äôre not backing up applications or system files. Features like Rewind and Snapshots allow you to restore from earlier versions of files or snapshots of the complete data set. And all data is encrypted, with the option to set your own private encryption key. lDrive‚Äôs user interface makes using it very straightforward. Your Desktop, Documents, Music and Pictures folders are automatically selected for backup, along with the contents of ~/Library/Mail. To add other folders, click ‚ÄòChange‚Äô at the bottom of the window ‚Äì that‚Äôs not exactly intuitive. You can add videos to the backup, but locating them in lDrive‚Äôs interface takes a great deal of doing. Both scheduling and restoring are straightforward, however. As is choosing a local drive as the destination for a backup in place of lDrive‚Äôs servers. lDrive‚Äôs free tier and the ability to spread your data allocation in the paid tiers across multiple computers makes it attractive. Overall, though, it‚Äôs expensive for a single machine. Read our full IDrive review Backblaze ‚Äì A good solution for offsite backup Price When Reviewed: $99 a year, $9 a month Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Backblaze (yearly) $99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $99 at Backblaze (yearly) View Backblaze here. Offerings like OneDrive, Google Drive, and even Apple‚Äôs own iCloud Drive offer a cloud-based storage area that can also be used to share files between users, usually with a link to a specific spot. Others, like Backblaze (and IDrive and Carbonite) are storage services in the strictest term. Backblaze takes your data, ferries it off-site, and backs up your Mac to its servers. It‚Äôs not for quickly sharing a document or collaborating on a piece of work, it‚Äôs for recovering data you may lose if something happens to your local machine. While you could share a file with Backblaze, doing so requires using Backblaze‚Äôs separate B2 Cloud Storage service which, admittedly, comes with flexible, pay-as-you-go options. Backblaze backs up the contents of your Documents, Pictures, Movies and Music folders, but excludes your Applications folder. You can view and share backed up files on an iPhone or iPad with the Backblaze mobile app. Backups are incremental so only files that have changed since it last ran are copied. Backups are encrypted and kept for 30 days. When it comes to restoring your data you can restore via Backblaze‚Äôs web interface or you can have files sent to you on a USB stick or hard drive for an additional (refundable) fee. A Find My-like Locate your Computer service tracks your Mac‚Äôs location to help you find it if it‚Äôs stolen. The Mac can tell you its current IP address and show you recently backed-up data. If you need an offsite back up of your Mac, Backblaze‚Äôs simplicity and price give it the edge over Carbonite and IDrive.

With access to Microsoft mainstays like Word, Excel, and with those apps using OneDrive to sync across platforms, it‚Äôs got potential for the workplace ‚Äì or for families with kids working on school projects. If you‚Äôre not keen on Google Docs or Sheets, or Apple‚Äôs Pages and Numbers, having Word and Excel documents spread across your devices could be a huge boon. The 5GB base storage is painfully low for free users (although still better than¬†Dropbox‚Äôs¬†2GB). Microsoft clearly wants to nudge you to one of its paid plans. You can spend¬†$99.99/¬£79.99¬†per year to get access to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and more, with 1TB storage per person for up to six people (6TB total). Alternatively, the Microsoft 365 Personal version with 1TB storage costs $69.99/¬£59.99 a year, and Microsoft 365 Basic is $19.99/¬£19.99 a year for 100GB cloud storage. Whichever option you go for, OneDrive is a model citizen when it comes to macOS. The app is lightweight and sits in Finder for you to drag and drop as you see fit. While it‚Äôs not as intuitive as Google Drive, if you‚Äôre using Microsoft Office to any degree you‚Äôll find a lot to like. Read our full OneDrive review Dropbox ‚Äì the original cloud syncing service Price When Reviewed: Free (2GB), $9.99 a month for a year (2TB, $119.88 paid up front), $11.99 a month (2TB, paid monthly) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Dropbox (monthly) $9.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $9.99 at Dropbox (monthly) View Dropbox here No discussion of cloud storage solutions would be complete without discussing the company that popularized consumer cloud syncing: Dropbox. Dropbox is the app that kickstarted the cloud storage arms race , but in recent years it has been usurped somewhat.¬† A stalwart for many modern workflows, Dropbox remains a reliable way to sync data and files to the cloud, but it gets harder to recommend if you are looking to share files with others, as a backup solution, or as a means to access your content from wherever you are. It just doesn‚Äôt offer any must-have features and rivals have much more generous free tiers. The paltry 2GB starting offering is way behind Google‚Äôs 15GB. The next their up is 2TB for ¬†$11.99/¬£9.99 per month (billed monthly), or $9.99/¬£7.99 a month if you pay for a year upfront. It‚Äôs a big leap with no options in between.¬† There is some good. Dropbox offer a sizeable drop-down window so you can see more information about recently uploaded and updated files, compared to the basic menu bar apps of the competition. Features like PDF signing are useful additions. Unfortunately, Dropbox just doesn‚Äôt feel as straightforward to use as many other cloud storage services.

Acronis True Image for Mac, functions as both a customizable backup utility as well as an antiviral/anti-malware app. It starts at $49.99/¬£42.99 per year for one computer with local backup and anti-ransomware. The software installed easily and was configured for full disk access without hassle.¬† It is centered around Backup, Protection, Disk Cloning, and Archive modules. the Backup module allows you to designate source and destination volumes as well as choose which files are backed up and to where. It‚Äôs easy to create exclusion lists as to which files can by bypassed when it comes to backing up, and the scheduling feature worked well. The Backup module also leads to True Image‚Äôs Acronis Survival Kit, which allows for a bootable backup drive to be created that your Mac can boot and install a new operating system from. Disk Cloning module works well, and makes quick copies of volumes as needed. the Archive module allows you to offload local data to Acronis‚Äô cloud structure, which is handy for freeing up local space The Protection module offered a good degree of antiviral protection, catching no less than 23 potential threats from a sample archive off the bat. During our testing there were bugs that couldn‚Äôt be avoided and user interface elements that were either inconvenient or needed a complete overall. Carbonite Safe Price When Reviewed: $71.99 per year (Basic) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Carbonite $71.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $71.99 at Carbonite View Carbonite here. Carbonite is very similar to Backblaze in that it allows you to back up your Mac to remote servers and recover files when you need to. Like Backblaze, you sign up for an account and download a Mac application, and it automatically selects files to download. Also like Backblaze, Carbonite doesn‚Äôt back up applications or system files. One key difference is that Carbonite‚Äôs basic plan doesn‚Äôt automatically back up the contents of your Movies folder either ‚Äì although you can select videos manually to be backed up. Neither does Carbonite back up the contents of external drives. Files are protected with 128-bit encryption, but there‚Äôs no option to add your own password. Restoring data is done online, using the Carbonite application ‚Äì the option to ship media containing your data is only available within the US. And you can restore from any backup run within the last 30 days, allowing you to roll back to earlier versions of files. The Carbonite mobile app allows you to view and download files to an iPhone or iPad. Carbonite is very simple to use. In fact, it almost feels too simple. Download the app, install it and launch it, and Carbonite starts backing up your Documents and Pictures folders straight away. In the left-hand sidebar, there‚Äôs a list of volumes and the main user folders (Desktop, Documents, Pictures, Movies and Music). By clicking on those you can select files to be backed up or excluded. Restoring files is just as easy. If you want to restore a complete backup, click the Restore option in the sidebar and choose whether to download files to a folder or put them back where they were originally. To restore individual files and folders, navigate to them using the folders in the sidebar and choose the download option. Carbonite, at the time of writing starts at $71.99 (approx ¬£55) per year for a single computer. If you want to back up external drives and back up videos automatically, that jumps to $111.99 (approx ¬£86). That makes it expensive compared to its nearest competitors. Cloud storage for Mac: Prices compared The cloud storage option you should choose depends largely on how much you‚Äôre willing to pay. If you want free space, Google crushes the competition with 15GB‚ÄîMicrosoft and Apple both need to up their game. The 100GB for $1.99 level is a good deal for most people and equals the capacity Microsoft gives you with OneDrive. Apple‚Äôs iCloud gives you 200GB for $2.99, which is the minimum you‚Äôre going to have to spend if you plan to back up iOS devices to the cloud along with photos and videos. Google matches Apple‚Äôs price and storage at this level. There‚Äôs a $0.99 tier below that, but even 50GB will fill up fast when you‚Äôre backing up your iPhone and all its photos and videos.¬† If you want to spend ten bucks a month, you‚Äôll get 2TB from either Google or Apple, but Microsoft will give you¬†six accounts¬†with 1TB each,¬†plus¬†Office apps. That‚Äôs a sweet deal. Dropbox‚Äôs 2GB is the worst free tier, and its cheapest paid tier is $11.99 a month and doesn‚Äôt even include all of Dropbox‚Äôs features.

    "description": "Macworld At a glanceExpert's Rating Pros Looks great Folder backup Media playback Cons Unlock process Our Verdict Up against the likes of OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox and more, pCloud stands out for its ease of use, colorful interface and flexible payment options. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Price When ReviewedAnnual: $59.88 (currently $49.99) for 500GB for a year; $119.88 (currently $99.99) for 2TB; Lifetime: $299 (currently $199) for 500GB; or $599 (currently $399) for 2TB; $1,890 (currently $1,190) 10TB Best Prices Today: Retailer Price pCloud (annually) $59.88 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket We‚Äôve been testing a huge number of cloud-based storage services for your Mac, and while the usual mainstays are still easy to recommend, pCloud might just be worth a look for you. The Mac app is relatively barebones, but it essentially works in the same way as its rivals, albeit with a delightful web interface (who knew a splash of color could make such a difference?), and the option to buy a lifetime subscription outright. It also acts as a great media player, even in the web app. Are those features enough to catapult it into first place? Not quite. A bizarre ‚Äòunlock‚Äô process to open up additional free storage is neat but a little irritating, while some of its features like file history are tucked behind an additional paywall. Still, if you‚Äôve not tried pCloud it‚Äôs well worth a look, particularly if you‚Äôre a little fed up of the usual heavy-hitters. First Impressions File Backup: You can point pCloud at a folder or drive on your Mac and it‚Äôll keep it in the cloud for you.Foundry Once you‚Äôre signed up for an account and download the pCloud Drive app, pCloud will let you upload and sync files on your Mac, so you can point it at a specific location and know it‚Äôll keep things up to date. It‚Äôs a nice, hands-free backup option to have switched on just in case you need it. As with many apps of its ilk, though, it‚Äôs essentially a wrapped for the web app. Thankfully, pCloud‚Äôs web app is clean, easy-to-navigate, and has a touch of color (you‚Äôd be surprised at how rare that is). Unlocking Process: The way users ‚Äòunlock‚Äô more storage could be seen as an inconvenienceFoundry Right off the bat, you‚Äôll get access to 4GB of free storage, less than we‚Äôre used to but, through the option to ‚Äòunlock‚Äô that can be raised to 10GB. On the one hand, that‚Äôs nice, and double what some offer, but on the other, needing to invite a friend for an extra 1GB of storage feels pointless ‚Äî just give us the 10GB upfront! pCloud features Encryption: Encryption will cost extra, even if you‚Äôre on a lifetime planFoundry The secret sauce of OneDrive and Google Drive is that they‚Äôre great for creating files as well as storing them, but as with Sync and DropBox, pCloud is much closer to a place to edit documents shared between users, or backed up in the cloud for safe-keeping. That‚Äôs a key distinction because you won‚Äôt be creating documents in pCloud, but that means it‚Äôs a very lightweight and breezy interface as a result. You can store and share all types of files, as well as setting a directory for a local folder on your Mac to keep backed up. You can also use a File Requests option to ask for files without sharing your pCloud account information. Perhaps my favorite feature is that media plays so well within pCloud. Saved a video? You‚Äôll be able to watch it via the in-window player, and the same can be said for audio and images, too. You can even backup social media profiles, which could be ideal for anyone working in community management. Additional costs are incurred for file history for 360 days (that‚Äôs $80 per year), but you do get 15 days to recover files for free, or 30 days with premium. There‚Äôs also a ‚ÄòVault‚Äô for storing items with client-side encryption, but that‚Äôll set for back $4.99 per month. That brings us nicely to cost. You can pay $59.88/¬£59.88 (currently $49.99/¬£49.99) for 500GB for a year, or $119.88/¬£119.88 (currently $99.99/¬£99.99) for 2TB, which is a solid deal. You can also go for lifetime versions, with 500GB for $299/¬£299 (currently $199/¬£199) or $599/¬£599 (currently $399/¬£399) for 2TB, or splash $1,890/¬£1,890 (currently $1190/¬£1190) for lifetime access to a whopping 10TB of storage. Sadly, those additional features (the extra file history and vault) aren‚Äôt included in those lifetime plans. Considering a user may spend well over $1,000, that‚Äôs something worth considering. pCloud annoyances Web App: pCloud is pretty welcoming to look at, which is surprisingly rare.Foundry Aside from those pricing gripes, pCloud is pretty fantastic as an alternative to some of the usual suspects. That initial unlocking process to get you to the 10GB of free storage feels a minor issue, and you won‚Äôt be able to edit documents within pCloud, but short of that, it‚Äôs a fantastic option. Should you buy pCloud? If you‚Äôre looking for lifetime cloud storage, pCloud is well worth a look. It‚Äôs also easy to use and has some great extra features that could make it a dream for big libraries of home movies and pictures.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
