Analysts estimated that Apple paid over $2.5 billion in 2024 alone for Qualcomm's patent licenses, while the company's annual modem revenue from Apple is said to be between $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion.Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, in an appearance on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast, spotted by 9to5mac, revealed that the modem company is prepared to look well beyond the iPhone. Qualcomm's plans are based on the assumption that Apple will continue to use in-house modems going forward, meaning that the chipmaker will have to explore alternative avenues.

All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.

The Eufy P2 Pro scale syncs with Apple Health on your iPhone and is available for $40 at Amazon right now, $40 off its MSRP. The P2 Pro scale isn’t just smart, but also beautiful, featuring a sleek design in a deep gorgeous shade of dark blue. You may even leave this one in plain sight, instead of shoving it under the bathroom sink. Other than it’s good looks, this scale takes things a lot farther than a regular model, monitoring 16 body measurements, including weight (obviously), body fat, BMI, muscle mass, bone mass, and even your heart rate. The accompanying map creates a 3D model of your body, matching your proportions and measurements given whatever measurements you input. As your fitness journey progresses, you’ll get detailed visuals of the changes. The Eufy P2 Pro scale connects to the EufyLife app which then syncs with Apple Health, alongside Google Fit or Fitbit, making for a versatile addition to your home. so go grab one while it’s at its cheapest price before the price jumps back up.

    "description": "Macworld While you’re trying to figure out if you’re going to invest in a new iPhone 17 this fall, we always like to remind YOU that something better is always coming soon. The latest report from the future comes from analyst Jeff Pu of GF Securities, who provides insight on the A20 chip that will be used in the iPhone 18 next year. TSMC, Apple’s chip manufacturer, is using an enhanced 3nm process for the A19 chip in this year’s iPhone 17, according to several reports. Reports say this will be the last chip to use the 3nm process, as TSMC will move to 2nm for the A20 in the iPhone 18 Pro and the rumored folding iPhone. According to Pu, TSMC will make the A20 using Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module (WMCM) packaging, where the components of the chip are integrated into the chip at the wafer level. This would allow for, say, the A20’s RAM to be integrated with the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, and other wafer-level components. This is different from the current method of using a silicon interposer to connect the RAM. With the RAM closer to the CPU and other chip components, this could result in improved power efficiency and a decrease in running temperature, which could provide benefits for battery life. It could also make the physical size of the A20 smaller, which again, would help with power efficiency, and could also benefit the overall design of the iPhone 18–especially the folding iPhone, which will consist of two thin sides that fold into a thicker one. Pu reports said that the 2nm process involves switching from fin field-effect transistors (FinFET) to gate-all-around field-effect transistors (GAAFET). The switch should allow for an improvement in performance with better power efficiency, but it’s unclear if the effect on power efficiency would be even greater because of the WMCM packaging. The nanometer process refers to the production of the chip, and 2nm allows for increased transistor density over the previous 3nm and 5nm processes. The higher the transistor density, the better the performance, and the process can also result in better power efficiency. Apple’s first 3nm was the A17 Pro, which debuted in the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.",

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",
