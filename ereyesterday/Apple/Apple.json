    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Macworld At a glanceExpert's Rating Pros High-quality materials Great workmanship Elegant design Cons Only superficial protection Low structure Our Verdict The Leather MacBook Sleeve from Harber London impresses with its simple design, high-quality workmanship and beautiful materials. However, the protective aspect is superficial at best and prevents your MacBook from being scratched by other objects in your bag. The sleeve is more suitable as a very fashionable accessory in nicely-furnished offices. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Price When Reviewed$98 Best Prices Today: Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve Retailer Price $84.13 View Deal Harber London $98 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Harber London is a relatively young family business from London (as the name implies) and specializes in high-quality accessories made from equally high-quality materials: full-grain leather, wool felt, and, more recently, a plastic textile made from recycled plastic bottles. Most of the laptop sleeves, such as the Leather MacBook Sleeve are completely plastic-free. Eugen Wegmann Even though it is made of high-quality leather and wool felt, the Leather MacBook Sleeve is quite simple overall. The back half consists of a thin piece of leather, the front of a thicker piece of felt, onto which another piece of thin leather is sewn, which acts as two small pockets. And that’s it. The sleeve comes in four color options: light grey (Classic) or dark grey felt (Black Edition) combined with black or brown leather. It is also available in different sizes for all possible MacBooks since the MacBook Air from 2010. Stability: zero. The Leather Macbook Sleeve can simply be rolled up, but at least it springs back into shape.Eugen Wegmann The sleeve has practically no structure of its own–you can easily roll it up if you want without breaking it. If you have the correct size, the sleeve fits very snugly around the laptop. No fastener on the sleeve, one edge is always open. Eugen Wegmann If you choose the wrong size (for example, the 16-inch version for a MacBook Air) then the sleeve will not only be baggy, but your MacBook may simply fall out, similar to buying trousers that are two sizes too big. Conversely, you should of course not choose the MacBook Air version for your 16-inch MacBook Pro. It simply won’t fit. The Leather MacBook Sleeve does not have a fastener either. As one long side is permanently open, there is of course practically no (splash) water protection. The two small pockets on the front are practical for storing cables, notes, and other small items, and even one of the smaller MacBook power adapters fits in quite well. Then it gets pretty cramped. The large 96-watt power supply unit from Apple, which is included with the more powerful MacBook Pro, just about fits, but the plug either hangs out of the bag or presses against the inside of the leather –not ideal in either case. Smaller, but thicker power supply units stretch the pocket quite a bit and wear out the leather in the long run. The two pockets cannot be closed either. Should you buy the Harber London Leather MacBook Sleeve? The Harber London Leather MacBook Sleeve is a high-quality, beautifully finished accessory that offers some protection for your MacBook from scratches and dents. You can carry your MacBook in style from meeting room to meeting room. But if you’re traveling you need something more robust and you’re probably better off with a different sleeve or bag.",

    "title": "Where is Apple Intelligence on my iPhone?",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2561596/where-is-apple-intelligence-on-my-iphone.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple Intelligence is just about all Apple can talk about this year. The latest products released int he second half of 2024 are all “Built for Apple Intelligence” and every one of the ads for the new iPhones focuses entirely on it. But if you got an iPhone 16 in September, you had to wait for an iOS update to get the first Apple Intelligence features. And even if you got one in December after the iOS 18.1 and 18.2 updates, if you weren’t paying attention to the new feature cards that pop up after the update, Apple Intelligence isn’t running on your iPhones. So if you’re wondering why Apple Intelligence is missing from your iPhone, here’s how you turn it on. Apple Intelligence: What you need For starters, you’ll need a compatible iPhone. Apple Intelligence only works on an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, or any iPhone 16 model. You’ll also need iOS 18.1 or later–Apple Intelligence features are being released in stages, with even more features coming in later iOS updates throughout 2025. Here’s a broad schedule of Apple Intelligence features and when you’ll get them. Apple Intelligence is also available on any Apple silicon-based Mac or iPad as well as the A17 Pro iPad mini with macOS 15.1 or iPadOS 18.1 or later. Finally, you also need both your system settings and Siri language to be set to a supported language. Right now those are: English (Australia), English (Canada), English (Ireland), English (New Zealand), English (South Africa), English (UK), and English (US). More languages will be added in 2025. Apple Intelligence: Turn it on Apple Intelligence isn’t turned on by default, You need to enable it to get started and can turn it off at any time. To get going, open Settings (System Settings on Mac), then select Apple Intelligence \u0026 Siri. On the next screen, tap Get Apple Intelligence. Apple Your iPhone (or Mac or iPad) will start downloading the Apple Intelligence models for your language. It’s several gigabytes and might take a while on a slower connection. Apple Intelligence: Enable ChatGPT With iOS 18.2, Apple added integrated support for ChatGPT in Apple Intelligence. It can be used with Siri, Writing Tools, and Visual Intelligence. Open Settings \u003e Apple Intelligence \u0026 Siri and look for the ChatGPT menu under the “Extensions” heading. For more on ChatGPT integration, including examples of how you can use it and how to log in to your OpenAI account if you’re a ChatGPT subscriber, read our guide. Apple Intelligence: Find the new features Once the models are downloaded and installed you can start using nearly all of the Apple Intelligence features. Some things are automatic, such as notification summaries, which will scan related notifications and summarize them into a quick blurb, and Mail summaries, which distills longer messages in your Primary inbox into a blurb that calls out the important bits. Other features you can play with are: Writing Tools: Click the arrow to the right of the text tray above the keyboard to open the menu and then select the Writing Tools button (the one that looks like an Apple Intelligence logo with a pencil inside it). This will bring up numerous options, including proofreading and rewriting text, summarizing and organizing text, and composing text, which requires Chat GPT (see above). Image Playground: This is a separate app that you’ll see on your iPhone when you install iOS 18.2. (It’s the one with a picture of a white kitten inside a bubble.) Launch it and you’ll be able to type a prompt to get a photo in either illustration or animation style. You can also drag a photo of a person to turn them into an illustration. Genmoji: On the emoji keyboard, you’ll find a new button to the right of the search bar. Tap it and you’ll enter Apple’s Genmoji creator, which allows you to make any emoji you want (with some obvious restrictions) and use it just as you would a regular emoji. Once created, it’ll appear in the emoji list on all of your devices. Image Wand: When in Notes, there’s a new tool called Image Wand. When sketching a picture, click the new wand tool next to the ruler and you’ll be able to turn it into a professional sketch by describing what you want it to be. Visual Intelligence: This one’s solely for the new iPhone 16 models. When you click and hold the Camera Control button for a second, you’ll enter Visual Intelligence, which will let you interact with what the camera sees, whether it’s a street sign in a foreign language, a restaurant, or a pair of sneakers you want to buy.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
