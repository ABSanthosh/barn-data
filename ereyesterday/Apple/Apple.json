If true, it would be the debut of the technology in the iPhone lineup.The iPhone 17 line is expected to use new ways to dissipate internal heat.Currently, iPhones use passive cooling by leveraging the metal and glass of the iPhone body. However, during intense usage, this can result in warnings that the iPhone must cool down, preventing further use of the device for a short time.The new report from Majin Bu — who has a mixed track record for accuracy — confirms that the vapor chamber cooling technique will debut in the iPhone 17, expected to debut this fall.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00.

All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2815273/apple-sherlock-apps-watson-flight-route-truecaller-bartender.html",
    "description": "Macworld It wouldn’t be WWDC if Apple didn’t do a little stealing. Apple has such a long-standing habit of introducing new software features that overlap and eventually overtake third-party apps, there’s even a term for it. Sherlocking comes from Apple’s Sherlock app, one of the first to usurp a popular third-party alternative called Watson back in the 1990s. This practice was on display again at WWDC 2025, where Apple introduced several new features in iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe that looked awfully similar to those offered by independent apps and developers. Of course, we’re not going to complain about new capabilities in macOS, and Apple is far from the only company to add features that have been done elsewhere before. But if you’re a fan of one of these apps, they might not be around for much longer. Alfred Alfred is a popular productivity app that adds a suite of controls that level up your Mac. That includes an app and file launcher that is accessed through a floating text-entry bar, in-app controls that can be activated using your keyboard, extensive clipboard history, and text snippets that act as shortcuts for various tasks. Starting to sound familiar? It should, because this closely mirrors the radical overhaul that Apple brought to Spotlight in macOS Tahoe. Instead of a simple search box, Spotlight has now been empowered with a range of new abilities. It can work within apps to launch menu bar controls, comes with parameters for filling out emails and text messages, has deep integration with Shortcuts, and even utilizes text snippets to kickstart actions with just a few taps. Apple previewed a much more powerful Spotlight search at WWDC.Apple Alfred still has a few tricks up its sleeve that haven’t yet made it into Spotlight, such as 1Password integration and visual theming, but the gulf between it and Spotlight has been closed significantly. And Apple is likely only just getting started. Route If you’re someone who frequently has parcels delivered to your door, you know how important it is to keep track of everything that’s on the way. Most package junkies likely already use the feature-rich third-party app Route to stay on top of their packages, but with iOS 26, that can be done natively on your iPhone. It’s achieved by using Apple Intelligence to scan your emails and messages and pull out relevant delivery information, such as tracking numbers and carrier companies. This is then collated in the Wallet app, giving you a centralized place to keep an eye on your parcels without needing to download any other apps. Best of all, it’s all done automatically, so all you need to do is buy something. @macworld.com Sherlocked! 5 apps made obsolete by Apple #apple #ios #fyp ♬ original sound – Macworld – Macworld Flighty The iOS 26 update has seen a major upgrade for virtual boarding passes stored in the Wallet app, with directions to your terminal gate and help finding lost luggage equipped with an AirTag or other FindMy tracker. So far, no Sherlocking there. But that all changes when you consider the Live Activities functionality that has been added to boarding passes. There will now be a widget that shows current flight status (such as how long until it’s due to land), the plane’s arrival terminal and baggage claim desk number, airline info, and flight number, and more. That closely matches the Live Activities offered by the popular flight-tracking app Flighty. Flighty still has the edge in some ways, such as its rapid delay alerts that can reach you before even the airline’s own notifications. But there’s no doubt that Apple has swooped in and launched its own solution that covers a lot of the same ground as Flighty. The flight tracking live activity built into iOS 26 is extremely similar to Flighty.Apple Bartender At WWDC, Apple lifted the lid on its Liquid Glass visual redesign. Inspired by visionOS, this brings transparency and glass-like effects to almost every Apple device and operating system. One aspect of that in macOS is that the menu bar can now be totally transparent. But there’s another menu bar tweak that might not have pleased the developers of the popular Bartender app. That’s because in macOS Tahoe, you can quickly and easily hide third-party icons from your menu bar. This is a feature that you’ll also find in Bartender, and easily one of the main reasons why people love the longtime utility. There’s no telling how much time Bartender has saved users by eliminating the need to bounce between app settings.  For power users, Bartender probably isn’t under existential threat from Apple just yet, as it offers a lot more functionality that isn’t natively matched by macOS, with far more customization options and a handy tool palette that pops out below your menu bar. But for casual users, Bartender just got Sherlocked. Bartender still has some near tricks, but Apple has made one of its best features irrelevant in macOS 26.bartender Truecaller We’ve all been faced with unwanted spam calls that interrupt our day, ranging from the mildly annoying to the downright malicious. For years, the Truecaller app has helped iPhone users steer clear of scammers and telemarketers by identifying unknown callers, blocking spammers, rooting out fraudulent text messages, and requiring callers to identify themselves before they’re let through. It got even better in iOS 18.2 when Apple added a Live Caller ID Lookup API with real-time spam blocking. Unfortunately for Truecaller, iOS 26 can now do some of these things by itself. The Call Screening feature, for instance, asks callers to explain why they’re contacting you, then shows the results in text on your screen, letting you ignore the call or pick it up when you’re ready. For most people, that might be better than identifying spammers.",

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",
