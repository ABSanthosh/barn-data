Here's how they compare to the older versions.visionOS 26 makes Personas look much more naturalWhen Apple first revealed Personas for Apple Vision Pro, they took on a somewhat blurred, stiff structure that struggled with detail. Beards and hair became flat, eyelashes disappeared, and expressions were limited.Personas got an upgrade in visionOS 2 that provided more detail and expressions, which also included the Spatial Persona update, but it was an improvement of the same rather than a rethink. What Apple has created in visionOS 26 is a completely rebuilt experience that looks and feels more natural. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums",

    "description": "Chinese commerce giant Alibaba has unveiled a new version of its flagship Qwen3 AI model, now compatible with Apple's MLX architecture, signaling that the debut of Apple Intelligence in China is on the horizon.Apple Intelligence could soon make its way to users in China.While Apple Intelligence gained support for the simplified version of Chinese with iOS 18.4, Apple's generative AI features still have yet to debut in China itself. The country's unique regulatory requirements meant that Apple had to partner with a local company to release any AI features. Although the iPhone maker considered working with ByteDance and Baidu, Apple eventually went with Alibaba.Now, a new statement by Alibaba on Monday suggests that Apple Intelligence is closer than ever to its China release. As noted by Reuters, Alibaba has launched an upgraded variant of its Qwen3 AI model, with compatibility for Apple's platforms, meaning it will run on the Neural Engine on Apple Silicon Macs, and Apple Intelligence-compatible iPhones and iPads.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

(More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "description": "Macworld Apple has started a service program to specifically address a problem that owners of the M2 Mac mini may be having. According to Apple, “a very small percentage” of these Mac minis have an issue where they will no longer power on. Eligible devices can have service done to fix the issue by Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider. The affected Mac minis were manufactured between June 16, 2024 and November 23, 2024. To see if your Mac mini qualifies, Apple has a website where you provide your Mac mini’s serial number: check if your Mac mini is qualified for service. Qualified devices can be brought in for service at an Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, though owners will have to bring the Mac mini into the shop, since mail-in service is not available for desktop Macs. The service for this specific problem is free, but the customer may have to pay for any additional repairs that are necessary to implement the fix. The M2 Mac mini first hit the market in January 2023 and was replaced by the M4 Mac mini in October 2024, so the affected models were manufactured towards the end of the M2 Mac mini’s cycle. Apple also offered an M2 Pro Mac mini at the same time as the standard M2; while Apple’s website refers only to the M2, it’s likely that this is a general reference to the M2 chip series and that the M2 Pro model is also involved in the service program.

    "description": "Macworld Amid the chaos and excitement of an Apple event, one or two interesting announcements will generally fall through the cracks and go unreported. Sure enough, one WWDC25 news item affecting the AirPods has only just been noticed, and it could make a big difference to the user experience. As spotted by MacRumors, Apple’s press release for new features coming to the AirPods this fall contains a quiet surprise at the bottom of the page: “All of these features are available for testing starting today through the Apple Developer Program… and a public beta will be available through the Apple Beta Software Program next month.” That’s new. For updates to most of Apple’s operating systems—iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS—the company rolls out pre-release beta testing versions for developers only, followed a little later by betas for the general public to try if they are interested. But AirPods firmware updates have never previously been available to the public until they officially launch. That’s changing this year, as is confirmed by the inclusion of AirPods in the front-page verbiage on Apple’s beta test site. The average AirPods software update isn’t likely to generate a great deal of interest from the public. They tend, somehow, to be simultaneously dull (generally containing few if any new features and focusing more on bug fixes) and mysterious (Apple’s release notes are spectacularly uninformative). But the annual new releases are different. For example, this year’s version contains studio-quality audio recording and camera remote, two distinct new features that Apple is keen to promote. It’s possible that this is why the company has decided to finally allow public beta testing. While the developer beta of the update is available already, the public beta is currently slated to appear sometime in July. Readers who aren’t experienced with betas should be warned that such software can be buggy and may not work as advertised: spotting bugs is what the beta testing program is all about. But it also means you get a chance to try the new features ahead of launch, see if they make a significant difference to you, and generally brag about being ahead of the curve. If that sounds like something you’d enjoy, sign up to Apple’s beta testing program.",
