    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.

    "title": "The next iPhone SE will be a study in sacrifice",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2535956/the-iphone-se-4-will-disappoint-many.html",
    "description": "Macworld I’m in the market for a new iPhone right now. But which one should I pick? The iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 are both appealing options, and there are currently some pretty good deals. Still… it’s not going to be cheap. If money’s the issue, what about Apple’s budget-focused iPhone SE? The current model is two and a half years old and got poor reviews when it was new. But a new 4th-gen model is expected to hit the market next spring, with updated components and design, and a price tag under $500. In view of the flagship models’ high price, this is a tempting offer. Surely a new iPhone SE can only be a good buy? This prompts a new question. Should I postpone buying the iPhone 16, and wait for the 4th-gen iPhone SE instead? You know what? I don’t think so. Because the more I hear about the upcoming SE, the more I think we’re in for a whole lot of disappointment. What we know so far The rumors tell us, fairly consistently, that the next SE will have the dimensions of an iPhone 14. The SE has historically been a compact handset, but the era of such phones appears to be over. They had their fans, but Apple was never satisfied with the sales figures for the iPhone 12 mini and 13 mini. For most buyers, a screen measuring at least six inches is a dealbreaker. This is understandable, as many apps and websites are simply no fun to use with anything smaller. Many web applications have been optimized for larger screens and are barely usable with something the size of the 2022 iPhone SE. So we can expect the 2025 SE to feature a 6.1-inch OLED screen, albeit a slightly cheaper panel than the one featured on the iPhone 14. And of course, it will have a notch, which will make it feel outdated and old. And Apple will compromise in other areas too. The Action button on the lefthand edge, which Apple introduced on the iPhone 15 Pro, will be missing. The new Camera Control on the righthand edge will also remain exclusive to the iPhone 16. Camera Control: Not for iPhone SE buyers.Foundry As leaked cases seem to prove, the economy model will also only have one camera, just like the iPhone XR, one of the few 2025 phones to have just one camera. And while the iPhone 16 comes in a variety of colors, the new SE will likely stick with the same three options: black, white, and red. Finally, the current iPhone SE is pretty affordable at $429, but a price jump is to be expected for the new model. My guess is $499 for the entry-level version with 128GB. That’s cheaper than the $799 iPhone 16 of course, but not nearly as attractive as the original $399 iPhone SE. What’s old is new With its small screen and old-fashioned Touch ID button, the current iPhone SE serves as a warning that Apple is not afraid to rely on very old technology for this line of phones. The 2nd-gen SE from 2020, for example, was heavily based on the iPhone 8, which came out three years earlier. The reason for this? Apple wants these phones to feel older. The iPhone SE is intended to dissuade Apple’s most frugal customers from switching to a cheap Android handset without cannibalizing purchases of the other iPhones. The more expensive an iPhone, the more profitable it is for Apple, so the company does not want to sell too many SEs. It’s meant to be an economy iPhone that looks like an economy iPhone, not a status symbol. A Home button. How quaint.IDG There’s still a market for the SE, of course. It’s ideal not only for price-conscious private customers. Many buyers on a budget don’t want a used device, put off by problems with batteries and the fact that the device has already had one previous owner. For those who want a new iPhone even if it’s missing the latest features and design, and for them the SE is the right choice. But what they are not going to get is excitement. They’re more likely to feel a sense of déjà vu with a notch, single camera, and thick bezels. The curious case of Apple Intelligence The 4th-gen iPhone SE does have one real killer feature up its sleeve, something that could make it a hit after all: support for Apple Intelligence. If Apple’s new AI platform is something you’re desperate to try, the next SE could be a genuine option. Several reports have predicted that the next SE will support Apple Intelligence, but this hardly needed to be said; this is a feature that the affordable iPhone simply has to offer. Even Apple at its stingiest wouldn’t launch a new iPhone in 2025 without building in support for its own AI. And this, in turn, means the new SE will have 8GB of RAM, and will probably be equipped with the A18 processor, the same as the iPhone 16. The iPhone SE will surely support Apple Intelligence—but where does that leave the iPhone 14 and 15?Apple Even if you’re not interested in AI, the fact that the 4th-gen SE is built for AI means it will deliver the exceptional all-round performance of an iPhone 16, and outperform the iPhone 15, which costs $699. But that phone has a better camera and better features despite missing out on Apple’s flagship AI. It’s all very confusing for buyers—so perhaps Apple will stop selling the iPhone 14 and 15 before things get back to normal when the iPhone 17 arrives later in the year. Loving the good, living with the bad The next iPhone SE will not be a real alternative to the iPhone 16; after all, that is not in Apple’s best interests. It will have its merits and a lower price, but if the new SE truly excites anyone Apple will not have done their job properly. The 4th-gen SE will certainly have its fans, but the vast majority of iPhone buyers will opt for a “better” model. And that’s just the way Apple likes it. Michael Simon contributed to this article.",

    "description": "Macworld There may be a “new” AirPods Max at the Apple Store, but the only thing different is the USB-C port. So why bother—especially when you can get a Lightning pair for their best price ever: Amazon’s Black Friday Apple sales incude the fantastic Lightning-based AirPods Max headphones for $399, a healthy $150 discount from their $549 MSRP, and the best price we’ve ever seen. Other than the port, these AirPods Max are identical to the USB-C model despite some new colors. They have the same design that’s gorgeous and comfortable and come with the same specs and features, including top-notch noise cancelation and super useful transparency mode. In our review of the AirPods Max, we gave them a four-star rating, loving the pleasant sound quality and just how well-built they are. “Are the AirPod Max the best wireless noise-cancelling headphones you can buy? For those who rely on the Apple ecosystem, yes. They offer sound quality on par or even slightly better than their competitors and superior noise-cancelling,” we noted in his review. While the headphones don’t have a physical button to stop them, they have some super smart sensors that pause audio when you take them off and shut off on their own after a while. They also provide some 20 hours of listening time, and plugging them in for some 5 minutes adds another 90 minutes of listening time. And they have a feature the USB-C model doesn’t have: you can plug in a Lightning-to-3.5mm cable and listen with a wired connection. So don’t miss out on getting the AirPods Max at their best price ahead of Black Friday for $399. Get the AirPods Max for 27% offBuy now at Amazon",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
