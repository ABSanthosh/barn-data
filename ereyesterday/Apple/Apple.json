    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00.

    "title": "Best external SSD for Mac: expand your Mac storage",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/668458/best-external-ssd-for-mac.html",
    "description": "Macworld Solid-state drives – aka SSD – used to be really expensive, but prices have really fallen in the past few years, and you can now pick up fast, reliable SSDs that cost only slightly more than their hard drive counterparts. Even the slowest SSDs are generally faster than mechanical hard drives. As well as being faster than conventional hard drives, SSDs are lighter and sturdier too, making them ideal for use with a laptop when you’re traveling. That’s reflected in the drives that we review here, most of which are small and light enough to slip into your pocket. However, the latest SSDs can also offer up to 8TB of storage, which makes them a good option for use with a desktop Mac in an office as well. And they can help to reduce cable clutter too, as they generally take their power from a USB port on your Mac, rather than requiring a separate external power supply. In this article we’ve included the best external SSDs for everything from blazing-fast performance, to budget options, to portability, and more.  Best SSD for Mac 2025 LaCie Rugged SSD Pro5 – Fast and rugged Pros Supports Thunderbolt 5  Impressive performance Rugged design with IP68 Five-year warranty Cons Expensive Requires M4 Pro or Max Price When Reviewed: 2TB: $399.99; 4TB: $599.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $279.99 View Deal $279.99 View Deal $279.99 View Deal Seagate (Lacie) $399.99 View Deal Check Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket The Pro5 looks almost identical to the previous-generation Rugged SSD Pro, which uses Thunderbolt 3. The only visible difference between the two drives is the fact that the Pro5 is wrapped in a dark-blue rubber sleeve, rather than the somber black of its predecessor. That rubber sleeve is designed to provide extra protection for the drive, and the Pro5 is even sturdier than before, with an IP68 rating for water and dust-resistance. LaCie claims the Pro5 can survive immersion in 1.5 meters of water for 30 minutes, survive being dropped from a height of 3m (10ft), and survive being run over by vehicles weighing up to two tonnes. There’s a five-year warranty too. It measures 17mm thick, 98mm wide and 65mm deep and weighs 150g, which is a little more than its 100g Rugged Pro predecessor. It comes in 2TB or 4TB capacities. It’s not cheap, starting at $399.99/£359.99 for 2TB or $599.99/£579.99 for 4TB. The Pro5 does use a standard USB-C connector, so it’s still backward-compatible with older Macs, but if you want to get the full performance of the Thunderbolt 5 interface you’ll need a MacBook Pro or Mac mini with M4 Pro or M4 Max processor as these are the only chips to support the standard. The older Rugged Pro is still on sale, so make sure you look for the Pro5 model if you want Thunderbolt 5 performance. We found that the standard USB-C cable we use for our Time Machine back-up drive didn’t provide enough power for the Pro5, so it might be worth investing in a spare Thunderbolt 5 cable. The Rugged SSD Pro5 is the fastest Thunderbolt drive we’ve tested so far, and along with its rugged, portable design it’s an excellent option for creative users who want to exploit the full speed of their new Thunderbolt 5 Macs. Read our full LaCie Rugged SSD Pro5 review SanDisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 – Impressive, affordable performance Pros USB4 provides good performance Competitive price Rugged design Cons Lacks full Thunderbolt support Large Price When Reviewed: $280 for 2TB, $430 for 4TB Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Sandisk $279.99 View Deal $429.99 View Deal $429.99 View Deal $429.99 View Deal Check Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Since parting ways with Western Digital SanDisk has launched a collection of new products. Among these were SanDisk’s Extreme Portable SSD, an affordable entry-level drive included below, and the Extreme Pro With USB4. The Extreme Pro With USB4 is available with 2TB or 4TB of storage. It resembles its predecessors, featuring rounded corners, orange trim, and a cut-out for attaching a lanyard. A USB-C cable is included.  It’s a little larger than previously: 11.9mm thick, 58.7mm wide, and 140mm long. Making it almost as large as the iPhone 16e and heavier than it. The drive’s main body is made of forged aluminium, wrapped in a silicon sleeve for added protection. SanDisk claims it can survive a 2m drop and is IP65 water and dust resistant. They also provide a five-year warranty. The Extreme Pro With USB4 is larger than other SanDisk drives, measuring 11.9mm thick, 58.7mm wide, and 140mm long. It’s almost as large as the iPhone 16e and heavier than it, but still small enough to fit in a pocket or bag. Its sturdy design makes it suitable for travel and outdoor work.  The main attraction is USB4 performance. SanDisk quotes a maximum write performance of up to 3700MB/s and read performance of up to 3800MB/s. We tested the drive with a MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt 4, achieving strong performance of 3400MB/s for both read and write.  We also tested the drive with a new Mac mini with Thunderbolt 5 and were surprised to see a significant jump in write performance to 4400MB/s, which remained consistent despite repeated tests. Read performance remained unchanged at 3400MB/s. Professional users requiring top performance with large video or graphics files may prefer a solid-state drive with full Thunderbolt support, but the Extreme Pro With USB4 offers impressive performance at an affordable price, making it suitable for most users who need a fast, sturdy portable drive for Time Machine backups. Read our full SanDisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 review OWC Envoy Ultra – Thunderbolt 5 fast Pros Fast 6GBps reading \u0026 5GBps writing via Thunderbolt 5 Rugged and weatherproof Cons Expensive Requires M4 Pro/Max Mac for full 80Gbps performance Limited compatibility Price When Reviewed: 2TB: $399.99; 4TB: $599.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $349.99 View Deal OWC $400 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket You can take full advantage of the Thunderbolt 5 ports on your M4 Pro Mac mini or M4 Pro/Max MacBook Pro and possibly circumvent Apple’s avaricious storage upgrade pricing with OWC’s Envoy Ultra Thunderbolt 5 external SSD. Thunderbolt 5 itself is backwards compatible with older Thunderbolt specs, but it’s not nearly as backwards compatible as we’d like. For example, to utilize a Thunderbolt 5 drive your M-series Mac need to be running macOS Sonoma or later. Thunderbolt 3 Macs with Intel chips must run Sequoia or later. But only the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips will give you the full Thunderbolt 5 experience. You may have seen 120GBps quoted in some articles as Thunderbolt 5’s top speed, but that’s only unidirectional for displays. Bi-directional, as with storage, is limited to 80Gbps. Benchmarks showed anywhere from 5.2GBps (Blackmagicdesign’s Disk Speed Test), to 6.5GBps reading (AmorphousDiskMark), to near 7GBps reading and 5.57GBps writing (ATTO). It’s fast. The OWC Envoy Ultra is a larger chunk of black metal, measuring about 0.75 inches thick, 2.8 inches wide, and 5 inches long. The Envoy Ultra weighs in at 10.5 ounces or so. It has a captive cable, which is for weatherproofing (it’s not IP-rated). This does make it a bit harder to put away. Alas, writing was considerably slower, only around 1.5GBps. The Envoy Ultra costs $400/£356 in its 2TB form and $600/£598.49 at 4TB. It carries a three-year warranty. If you want, and can afford the absolute fastest storage for your new Thunderbolt 5 Mac, then this is a heck of a lot cheaper than Apple’s rapaciously priced internal storage and nearly as fast. Read our full OWC Envoy Ultra Thunderbolt 5 SSD review SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD – Compact and portable design Pros Rugged design Competitive price Good performance USB-C interface, with USB-A adaptor included Cons No Thunderbolt support Not completely water-resistant Price When Reviewed: 1TB: $99.99; 2TB: $149.99; 4TB: $249.99; 8TB: $549.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $99.9 View Deal Western Digital (1TB) $99.99 View Deal $102.99 View Deal $104.99 View Deal $104.99 View Deal $104.99 View Deal $137.99 View Deal $203.34 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket This SanDisk model offers a sturdy design and up to 8TB of storage. The external design hasn’t changed over the years, it still comes in a perforated black case made out of silicon that provides plenty of protection, and there’s the same hook for a lanyard. The 8TB version is slightly larger than the previous model, but it’s still slim and light. There aren’t many rival drives that provide that much storage in such a compact and portable design. This model uses the same USB-C connector as its predecessor, with support for USB 3.2 (Gen 2). There’s a USB-C cable included in the box, and even a USB-A adaptor! Speeds are 1000MB/s and 1050MB/s for write and read performance respectively, as previously. And our tests found that the two drives produce very similar results when running the Black Magic Disk speed test, with the Extreme Portable reaching 946MB/s for write performance and 910MB/s for read performance. The main difference is that this update for 2025 is even tougher than before, boasting an IP65 rating for resistance to water and dust. This model provides more storage capacity too, starting at 1GB and going up to 8TB. SanDisk has several portable solid-state drives that look similar and have similar names. The Extreme Pro Portable looks identical and has a faster USB4 interface, but only offers up to 4TB storage. The less expensive Portable SSD, isn’t particularly fast. Check the name before you buy. It’s a good option for anyone that needs to store large, high-res photo or video files on their MacBook when they’re working outdo. Read our full Sandisk Extreme Portable SSD (2025) review Kingston XS1000 – Affordable and lightweight Pros Very competitive price Pocket-size design Weighs only 28.7g Cons No Thunderbolt interface No bundled software Cable is USB-A-to-USB-C Price When Reviewed: 1TB – $84.99; 2TB – $139.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Kingston $64.90 View Deal $79.99 View Deal $79.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket We liked the sturdy little XS2000 drive that Kingston launched back in 2022, but it was pretty expensive and used a version of USB known as USB 3.2 Gen 2×2, which isn’t fully supported on the Mac at the moment. Drives that use ‘Gen 2×2’ will still work with a Mac, but the Mac won’t get the full speed that the drive is capable of. However, the XS1000 is a more conventional USB-C drive, using standard USB 3.2 Gen 2, so it’s a good, affordable option for Mac users who just want a compact, lightweight backup drive. The XS1000 is one of the smallest and lightest SSDs that we’ve seen so far – in fact, it looks more like a little USB thumb drive, rather than a high-capacity backup drive. It measures just 13.5mm thick, 32.5mm wide and 69.5mm long, and weighs only 28.7g, so you can easily slip it into your shirt or trouser pocket when you’re traveling. It’s not quite as rugged as the more expensive XS2000 – which had an IP55 rating for water and dust resistance – but the plastic and metal casing feels sturdy enough to cope with a few knocks when you’re traveling, and Kingston provides a five-year warranty as well. It’s very competitively priced too, costing $84.99/£74.99 with 1TB of storage, or $109.99/£99.99 with 2TB. The drive’s USB interface provides a quoted write speed of 1000MBs, while the read speed is slightly higher at 1050MB/s. It didn’t quite match those speeds in our tests, but its write speed of 875MB/s and read speed of 950MB/s will still be fine for routine back-ups with Time Machine. Our only complaint is that Kingston only includes a USB-A-to-USB-C cable with the XS1000, so you’ll need to buy an adaptor or a new cable if your Mac only has USB-C. Professional users might prefer a faster drive, or a more rugged design, but if you just want an affordable backup drive that can go traveling with you then the XS1000 is great value for money. Adata SE920 USB4 SSD – High performance Pros High data transfer rates Good fan Cons No transport bag No rubber feet Price When Reviewed: 1TB: $140 I 2TB: $200 I 4TB: $380 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Adata $159.99 View Deal $159.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket The Adata SE920 External SSD is a high-performance USB4 SSD for those who need rapid data transfer speeds.  It combines passive and active cooling with a compact metal housing for passive cooling, and a micro-fan with openings for active cooling. The user can actually activate the fan by pressing on the housing.  If you are working on a project such as a video or image edit, or another task that could require a lot of drive access over a period of time, then switch on the fan. The rest of the time you can probably leave it.  The SE920 is primarily designed for Windows users, evident from the formatting in the NTFS file system and the backup software for Windows, but this shouldn’t be a problem for experienced Mac users. The SE920 is quickly reformatted in APFS using the macOS Disk Utility. Data transfer rates measured with Aja System Test Lite were impressive. The SE920 achieved 2992MBps for writes and 3161 MBps for reads. Data rates are stable over a longer period and the thermal design works perfectly. All this comes at a good price. We recommend the SE920 to any content creator. Read our full SE920 External SSD review SanDisk Pro Blade System – For professional and creative users Pros Thunderbolt 3 interface (compatible with USB-C) Ultra-rugged design Professional-level performance Cons Very expensive Doesn’t support Thunderbolt 4 Price When Reviewed: $49.99 for dock I $159.99 w/1TB Mag I $219.99 w/2TB I $339.99 w/4TB Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Western Digital $49.99 View Deal $164.99 View Deal $164.99 View Deal $213.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket We normally organize reviews of portable drives and desktop drives separately, but the new SanDisk Pro Blade is a modular SSD storage system that is very much designed for professional and creative users, and allows you to switch between portable and desktop modes as required. You can start by buying the Pro Blade SSD Mag, which is a solid-state storage module that is available in 1TB, 2TB or 4TB sizes (the 1TB was discounted from $179.99 to $119.99 at the time of our review). The SSD Mag is pre-formatted in APFS format for Mac users, and is tough enough to withstand being dropped from a height of 3 meters or 9.8 foot, and withstand 4000lb (1814kg) crush pressure, making it ideal for outdoor use. However, the SSD Mag modules can’t connect to a computer on their own, so SanDisk provides two options for portable and desktop use. For portable use you can buy the Pro Blade Transport, which is a compact case for the SSD Mag, and is equipped with a USB-C port for connecting to your Mac. The Transport measures just 130.4mm long, 71.5mm wide and 16mm thick, so you can easily slip it into your pocket or a carrying case just like any other portable drive. It’s also possible to connect the Transport to a camera that has a USB-C interface so that you can record high-res video rather than having to carry lots of smaller SD memory cards. When you get back to the office you also have the option of inserting the SSD Mag modules into the Pro Blade Station ($499.99/£490.99). This desktop storage system doesn’t include any built-in storage of its own, but it has four slots that allow you to insert SSD Mag modules (not included) providing up to 16TB of high-speed solid-state storage. The Pro Blade Station has two Thunderbolt 3 ports, with one used to connect your Mac, while the other port can be used to daisy-chain additional storage devices if required. The Pro Blade Station is fairly expensive – given that it doesn’t include any storage of its own – but it gives you the option of creating a high-speed, high-capacity SSD storage system for use in your office, whilst also being able to remove the individual SSD Mag modules and use them as portable drives whenever you need to. Western Digital – which owns SanDisk these days – claims that the Pro Blade Station can provide read and write speeds of 3000MB/s and 2600MB/s respectively. Our tests actually recorded a read speed of 2600MB/s and write speed of 2300MB/s, but that’s still one of the fastest SSD drives we’ve ever seen, making it a good option for creative users who need a fast storage system that they can use both in the office and on the road.

However, the Rugged range has mostly used conventional hard drives in the past, which are slower than the latest solid-state drives, as well as being bigger and heavier. Welcome the Rugged Pro SSD, which is primarily aimed at creative users. (We look at the LaCie Rugged SSD Pro5 above, which is a newer model that supports Thunderbolt 5). The Rugged SSD range starts at around $180/£180 for a model with 500GB storage, but we were able to review the SSD Pro, which stands out from the rest of the range with its matte-black sleeve. It’s pretty expensive, costing $419/£249.99 with 1TB of storage, and a hefty $739.99/£379.99 for the 2TB model and $1,049.99/£999.99 for 4TB, but it justifies that price with an even tougher design and the latest, super-fast solid-state drives designed for professional video work. (U.K. prices dropped in 2024 but US prices don’t seem to have followed suit. Luckily you can get good deals at various resellers). Switching to a solid-state drive means that the SSD Pro is now the smallest model in the Rugged range, measuring just 3.8in/98mm long, 2.5in/65mm wide and 0.6in/17mm thick. It only weighs 100g/3.5oz, so you can easily slip it into your pocket or bag when you’re traveling and barely even notice that it’s there. Despite its compact design, that new black sleeve is seriously tough and rated IP67 for resistance to water and dust, allowing it to survive in 3.2 foot/1m of water for up to 30 minutes. It can cope with being dropped from a height of 9.8 foot/3m, and can even resist the weight of a two-tonne car driving over it. It includes a five-year warranty in case anything does go wrong, which includes one visit to LaCie’s data-recovery labs if you need to retrieve important data. The Rugged SSD Pro includes just a single Thunderbolt 3/USB-C interface, but most of its high price is down to the use of the latest NVMe solid-state drives, which provide top performance for high-end video applications, such as editing 8K or super-slow-motion video files (which can be enormous, as they shoot at up to 240 frames per second on the latest iPhones). The drive didn’t disappoint, recording consistent write speeds of 1780MB/s, and an even faster 2480MB/s for read speeds – with both figures leaving just about every other SSD drive we’ve ever tested trailing in its wake. And, when backing up our iTunes music library, the Rugged SSD Pro blew us away by backing up 5GB of music files in just five seconds – look away for a couple of seconds and you’ll miss it! Of course, not everyone will need that sort of performance – especially at this price – but if you work with high-res video and need a fast, tough drive for outdoor work then the Rugged SSD Pro is in a class of its own.

Available with 500GB, 1TB or 2TB of storage, the Portable SSD has a new design compared to its predecessor. Rather than sharply angular corners and edges of the now discontinued LaCie Mobile SSD, the compact Portable SSD has smoothly round corners – perhaps following Apple’s recent fetish for rounded corners on icons in Big Sur and Monterey. It’s smaller and lighter than previous drives from LaCie too, measuring just 0.4in/10.6mm thick, 1.9in/50mm wide, and 3in/80mm long, and it weighs a mere 1.5oz/45g, so it’s ideal for carrying around with your MacBook or iPad when you’re traveling. The drive has a single USB-C interface, and includes a USB-C cable, but the low cost means that there are no added extras, such as an adaptor for older Macs that have USB-A (3.2) connectors. LaCie hasn’t cut any other corners, though. The Portable SSD has a solid, sturdy design that should be able to cope with a few bumps in a backpack or briefcase, and it performs very well too. LaCie quotes read and write speeds of 1000MB/s, but repeated tests with the BlackMagic speed test app showed the Portable SSD comfortably cruising along at around 1,300MB/s with no trouble at all. That combination of speed, compact design and competitive pricing makes the Portable SSD a great option for anyone that needs a portable backup drive for their Mac or iPad. Read our full review.

Unlike many solid-state drives, it provides up to 8TB of storage, making it a good option for people who need a lot of storage space for their work files, photos and videos. It’s competitively priced, starting at $189.99/£146 for 2TB of storage. The drive is compact, just 17mm thick, 40mm wide and 95mm long, and weighing 102g. There’s a chunky metal ring on one end that can be used to attach the drive to a backpack or belt. It doesn’t have the armor-plated protection of Samsung’s T7 Shield, but the T5 EVO doesn’t cut corners on build quality. The drive is metal and then wrapped in a rubber sleeve to provide extra protection. It doesn’t quote an IP rating for resistance to water and dust though. It’s not the fastest back-up drive you can buy, and while there’s a USB-C port for connecting to a Mac or PC, it only supports the relatively old USB 3.2 (Gen 1) standard, and Samsung quotes fairly modest speeds of 460MB/s for both read and write performance. Our tests showed that the drive’s write performance was right on the nose with a speed of 460MB/s when running the Black Magic disk speed test, although read performance was slower at 370MB/s. T5 EVO will be a great option for laptop users who want to ditch an old hard drive and replace it with a more portable solid-state drive that provides plenty of storage.

As the name suggests, the Armor 700 is sturdily built, boasting an IP66 rating for water and dust protection. This means that the drive can withstand powerful jets of water (but not complete immersion under water), and is tightly sealed to prevent dust or other particles from penetrating the drive. It’s also wrapped in a shock-resistant rubber sleeve that can cope with being dropped from a height of three metres. The drive is available with 1TB, 2TB or 4TB of storage, so it provides plenty of storage for your Time Machine backups when you’re on the road. Lexar also includes an app called DataShield that allows you to create an encrypted folder on the drive for storing sensitive files and data. The Amor 700 is equipped with a USB-C interface, with a USB-C cable and USB-A adaptor included in the box. Lexar states that the drive provides read and write speeds of up to 2000MB/s, but it does require a device that supports USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 in order to achieve those speeds (yes, USB standards are a complete mess these days). Apple doesn’t support that specific version of USB, which means that Macs, iPhones and iPads with USB-C will only get a maximum speed of 1000MB/s. Our tests actually recorded scores of 910MB/s for write performance and 925MB/s for read performance, but that’s more than adequate for routine backups when you’re out and about. Lexar also states that this is fast enough to record 4K ProRes video from an iPhone 15 or 16, and the Armor 700 is still competitively priced when compared to rugged drives such as LaCie’s Rugged SSD. Professional users who really need top performance may prefer a drive that supports Thunderbolt – such as LaCie’s high-end Rugged Pro – but Thunderbolt drives are still very expensive, making the Armor 700 a good option for people on a tighter budget. You can’t buy direct from Lexar, though, so it’s worth shopping around online to find the best price. Verbatim TurboMetal SSD Pros Good data transfer rate Quiet fan Cons Data rate drops during long data transfers No operation without fan Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $154.10 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket The Verbatim TurboMetal SSD is a classic NVMe drive with a length of around 106mm, a 55mm wide and 18mm thin metal housing, and weighs 150g. Like many USB4 enclosures, it uses an active fan and cooling slots for cooling. The fan is temperature-controlled and starts automatically when the temperature rises. Verbatim specifies a USB4 data transfer rate of 3600MBps for writing and 3700MBps for reading. However, we achieved 2664MBps for writing and 3123MBps for reading on an M3 MacBook Air in a 4K test with Aja System Test Lite. These are not bad values, but the best USB4 drives we’ve measured achieve slightly higher writing speeds but not higher reading speeds. The M4 Max Mac Studio showed much better values, with 2869MBps for writing and 3499MBps for reading. In a 30-minute endurance test with the Backmagicdesign Disk Speed Test, the fan started after 10 minutes. The TurboMetal got too warm after around 9 minutes in the data transfer rate, which dropped significantly to below 1000MBps. Shortly after starting the fan, the temperature of the SSD levelled off again, and the data transfer rate rose to its original value. The runs only when it has to. During the endurance test, the data transfer rate dropped briefly but stabilised immediately. DriveDX measured the temperature at around 46 degrees Celsius after using the fan, which remained on. The TurboMetal Portable SSD is available in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities with a 20cm USB4 cable. It’s formatted as FAT32, so Mac users should reformat it to APFS. The included software is only for Windows. The TurboMetal SSD is a discreet USB4 drive. The data transfer rates are suitable for everyday use, but some SSDs offer better speed. The regular dips indicate thermal protection, but they shouldn’t affect most applications.

The Pro-G40 was first released in 2022, and was already on our list of the best SSD drives for Mac, but this current model provides both improved performance and higher capacity for your work files. The design hasn’t changed though, with a compact, portable drive that measures just 12mm thick, 58mm wide and 111mm long. It weighs just over 120g – depending on the capacity you choose – so you can slip it into a jacket pocket or into a carrying case alongside your MacBook with no trouble at all. The drive is also extremely tough, with a sturdy metal case that is rated IP68 – one of the highest ratings possible – for resistance to water, dust and other particles. Western Digital, which now owns the SanDisk brand, also claims that the drive can survive drops from a height of 3m, and can withstand crushing pressure of up to 4000lbs. The drive even includes a five-year warranty as well. The 2022 version of the Pro-G40 provided read and write speeds of 2700MB/s and 1900MB/s respectively when using the Thunderbolt cable included in the box, but the current model is rated at 3000MB/s for read and 2500MB/s for write speeds. Our tests showed it to be absolutely spot-on for write performance, consistently hitting 2500MB/s. The read performance didn’t quite hit the quoted 3000MB/s, settling at just over 27000MB/s, but that’s still far faster than most USB-C drives, and provides the sort of performance that professional users need for backing up their work files. That combination of high performance and ultra-rugged design does mean that the Pro-G40 is quite a bit more expensive than many USB-C drives, so it’s probably overkill if you just need an affordable portable drive for backing up personal files. However, professional users will be pleased to find that the price of the Pro-G40 has been reduced recently, with the 1TB model now costing $299.99/£294.99, while the 2TB version is $449.99/£441.99. And, as mentioned, there’s a new 4TB version to provide extra capacity, priced at $699.99/£687.99.

However, portable SSDs do tend to have limited storage capacity, often with a maximum of just 1TB or 2TB. In contrast, the SanDisk Desk Drive provides both high-speed SSD performance and high capacity too, starting with a minimum of 4TB for $379.99/£359.99. If that’s not enough then you can also step up to 8TB, for $699.99/£663.99. As the name suggests, the Desk Drive is very much designed for desktop use in an office, and it’s larger than most conventional SSDs, standing 40.2mm high and 99.2mm on each side, and weighing 268g. The drive itself is still small and light enough to slip into a backpack or traveling bag along with your MacBook, but it does require a mains power supply as well, so this isn’t a drive that is going to leave the office very often (we did try to power it through a USB-C port on our MacBook Pro, but that didn’t work). It’s also a little disappointing that the Desk Drive just has a single USB-C port for data transfer. At this price, a couple of extra ports would have been a useful bonus, especially for MacBook models that only have a couple of USB-C ports of their own. We didn’t have any complaints about the Desk Drive’s performance, though. SanDisk quotes a speed of 1GB/s, although the results we got were closer to 925MB/s and 910MB/s for write and read speeds respectively. That’s not as fast as some high-end SSDs that are designed for professional users – such as SanDisk’s own Pro Blade system – but it’s still a lot faster than a conventional hard drive, and the Desk Drive will be a very good option for people who simply need a fast backup drive that provides plenty of storage for photos, videos and work files.

When sitting flat on the desk it measures just 2in/50mm wide, 2.7in/70mm deep and a mere 0.4in/10.6mm thick. And it weighs only 2.6oz/74g, so you can easily slip it into your pocket and carry it around with your laptop or iPad when you’re traveling. It’s sturdily built too, with Seagate claiming that it can withstand being dropped from a height of 6.5 foot/2m. The OneTouch drive has a USB-C interface, but Seagate includes both USB-C and USB-A cables so that you can use it with most Macs and PCs straight out of the box. It works with Apple’s Time Machine for automatic backups, but Seagate also includes its own ToolKit app, which has a ‘sync’ option for backing up specific folders. The drive also includes a one-year free subscription to the Mylio photo-organizer app, and four months with Adobe’s CC Photography plan, normally $9.99/£9.98 a month on an annual plan (read our guide to getting the best deal on Adobe Creative Cloud). The drive is available with 500GB, 1TB or 2TB of storage, so it provides plenty of room for backing up large libraries of photos, videos or music. It doesn’t quite match Seagate’s quoted speed of 1GB/s, but it recorded read and write speeds of 835MB/s and 915MB/s respectively in our tests, which still put it among the fastest solid-state drives that we’ve tested recently. And, with its ridiculously light and compact design, the OneTouch will be ideal for backing up all your important files when you’re on the move.

These have long been popular with people who need a sturdy back-up drive that can cope with rough weather and conditions when working outdoors, but the Rugged drives have always tended to be rather large and bulky – like the Rugged SSD Pro (above) – so LaCie has produced a more compact option in the form of the new Rugged Mini SSD. As you might expect, the Rugged Mini looks very much like its rugged relatives, with LaCie’s distinctive bright orange rubber sleeve helping to keep the drive safe. But, of course, it’s a lot smaller than previous models, measuring just 17.3mm thick, 66.9mm wide, 105mm long. It only weighs 114g as well, so you can easily slip it into a jacket pocket or backpack when you’re traveling. Despite that compact design, the Rugged Mini is still tough enough to cope with some rough treatment. It’s rated IP54 for water and dust resistance, so it should be able to cope with life outdoors if you’re working on location for a photo- or video shoot. And, thanks to that rubber sleeve, it can handle drops of up to 3m and even survive being driven over by a 1-tonne truck. And if that’s not tough enough, the drive comes with a three-year warranty that includes LaCie’s Rescue Data Recovery Service, to help restore any lost data. The drive’s USB-C port will work with any Mac or PC that also has USB-C or Thunderbolt. But, like a number of drives that we’ve seen recently, it uses a version of USB known as USB 3.2 Gen 2×2, which isn’t fully supported by Macs at the moment. This means that Macs won’t be able to get the full 2000MB/s speeds supported by that interface, and our tests confirmed this, recording write and read speeds of 900MB/s and 970MB/s respectively. We’ve seen stronger performance from some rival drives, but those speeds should be perfectly adequate for routine backups when you’re on the road, and the sturdy design of the Rugged Mini makes it a good option for people who need a drive that they can use outdoors on a regular basis. Pricing is a little confusing, though. In the US, the Rugged Mini costs $84.99/£74.99 (1TB), $109.99/£99.99 (2TB), and $159.99/£149.99 (4TB). We’ve seen much lower prices from Amazon and other online retailers, so it’s definitely worth shopping around before buying.

The drive measures just 0.35in/9mm thick, and weighs 1.6oz/46g, so it’s small enough to slip into a jacket pocket when you’re on the move. However, it’s also tough enough to survive being dropped from a height of two metres. The drive is equipped with a USB-C interface, but WD includes a USB-C cable and a USB-A adaptor with the drive, so you can still use it with older Macs that don’t have USB-C. The solid-state drive provides good performance too, recording a write speed of 935MB/s and read speed of 908MB/s, making it a great option for backing up your important files on the move. It’s secure too, as WD’s Discovery app allows you to set a password for the drive in order keep your files safe. There’s a second app as well, called WD Unlocker, which is built into the drive itself, and allows you to enter the password so that you can use the drive with another Mac or PC if you need to. When the drive was first introduced there were complaints that the WD apps hadn’t been properly updated to 64-bit code for the latest versions of the macOS, but we tested the drive with our office Macs and didn’t encounter any problems.

We tested the T7 Shield, which is a more rugged model, wrapped in a sturdy rubber sleeve designed for outdoor use. Both of those models can use Samsung’s Portable SSD app to add password protection for your files, but there’s also a third model called the T7 Touch that has a built-in fingerprint sensor for extra security and convenience. Available in black, blue or silver, the T7 Shield costs $129/£110 with 1TB of storage, but we are seeing great discounts now it’s been out a while. It has a USB-C interface for connecting to your Mac, but Samsung includes a USB-C cable and a USB-A adaptor so that you can use it with older Macs that have USB-A. The rugged protective sleeve means that it’s a little larger than the other T7 models, measuring 0.5in/13mm thick, 2.3in/59mm wide and 3.4in/88mm long, and weighing 3.4oz/98g. Even so, it’s still small enough to slip into a jacket pocket or backpack with no trouble at all, and many people will appreciate the extra protection that it offers. The T7 Shield is rated IP65 for water- and dust-resistance, and Samsung claims that the shock-resistant rubber sleeve can survive drops from a height of three meters. It’s a good performer too. Samsung quotes read and write speeds of 1,000MB/s, but our tests with the Blackmagic disk tool actually recorded a read speed of 1,780MB/s, and a write speed of 1,300MB/s, which makes the T7 Shield a great backup option for people who need to work outdoors with their laptop.

We format the drive before we begin and then we run benchmarks and perform real-world operations to determine its speed relative to other similar drives. We also look at longevity and durability – we want to make sure that a drive won’t die after a few months of use, so the build and construction matters. Portability is also considered, assuming the drive is designed to be portable. Why you should trust Macworld At Macworld been putting Mac hardware through its paces for decades. We know how to root out the strengths and weaknesses of a SSD drive using a combination of rigorous benchmark testing and real-world hands-on use. How to choose an SSD: Buying advice You’ve read our recommendations of the best SSDs for Mac owners on the market right now. But how did we reach these decisions, and what general advice should you follow when selecting the best SSD for your needs? SSDs vs hard drives Cost per gigabyte is the main stumbling block. You might pay $200 for a 1TB portable SSD, whereas a 1TB external hard drive costs around $25. This is because hard drives use relatively cheap spinning platters to store data. SSDs employ NAND memory chips. They are pricier, but also faster and allow for much smaller enclosures. If you decide in favor of hard drives, see our roundup of the best Mac hard drives. Which connectors to choose Another thing to take note of is whether the SSD connects via Thunderbolt 5, 4 or 3, and USB 4 or USB-C, USB 3 or USB 3.2×2. The latter is one to avoid if you are a Mac user because Apple supports only 10Gbps with USB 3.2, meaning 3.2×2 20Gbps SSDS are constrained to half their potential. There are some SSD drives that support the new Thunderbolt 5 standard, which brings speeds of up to 80Gbps if you have a Mac with M4 Pro or M4 Max. We’ve looked at some Thunderbolt 5 equipped SSDs below. How fast can you expect SSD file transfers to be? The top external SSDs can read and write at up to around 550MB/s. However, to get these speeds you need a port on your Mac or MacBook that can handle this bandwidth. If you’ve got a Mac model with a Thunderbolt/USB-C port, you’re set. While external SSDs use USB 3.1 standards rather than Thunderbolt, the port also supports USB 3.1 Gen 1 and Gen 2, which is what we’re after. Most modern Macs have a Thunderbolt 4 port, but some MacBook Pro models already have Thunderbolt 5 (Pro and Max versions) as does the Mac mini with the Pro chip, and the Mac Studio. Thunderbolt 4 is almost exactly the same as Thunderbolt 3 was, but it has stricter implementation requirements and some changes for PC users which just bring it into line with what Mac users already had. Thunderbolt 5 is the highest-performing interfaces for external storage. We explain everything you need to know about Thunderbolt 5 vs Thunderbolt 4 and 3 vs USB4 separately. Thunderbolt 5 is a big step up from Thunderbolt 4. Bandwidth doubles from 40Gbps to 80Gbps, display connections go as fast as 120Gbps. That’s up to three times more bandwidth than previous existing connectivity solutions. How much storage do I need? Recent external SSDs tend to come in three or four capacities: 250GB, 500GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB and you might even find 8TB. You’ll want to think carefully about the capacity you need, as the cost difference between 500GB and 1TB models is usually stark. There aren’t the same relatively minor price leaps seen in 1-4TB hard drives. We can’t answer this one for you, but it’s a good idea to do a quick mental calculation. For example, 4K footage from a Panasonic Lumix GH4 camera eats up 4GB every five minutes. Video editors who work in 4K need a lot of storage. However, if you just need to back up or carry around some movies and photos, a smaller-capacity model may well do the trick. Check out your Mac’s own storage capacity and use that as a guide. We recommend about twice that number because it allows you to make a full back up and store some incremental backups too. Just don’t assume that the lowest-cost drives provide the best value. It’s usually the case that the higher the capacity the better the price per gigabyte is. The best value is usually the highest capacity, but that also means a higher price, so you probably want something in the middle of that, depending on your needs. 2.5in or ultra-portable? SSD performance varies from around 300-500MB/s read speeds all the way up to 3000MB/s, but there are three basic physical forms of SSD. And two can be considered portable. ‘Naked’ SSD boards plug directly into PCIe or SATA interfaces. These are the kind you might use to replace the SSD in a laptop, or add to a desktop. They are not really portable. 2.5in SSDs offer a mix of portability and internal use, and are the cheapest way to get a portable drive. They have a plastic casing, avoiding damage to the components, but use SATA connectors rather than USB. You can buy an enclosure to get more protection and that all-important USB or Thunderbolt interface, or even just use a SATA-to-USB cable. We use one of these cables in the office to ferry around test files on a 2.5in SSD. For the ultimate portable experience you need a ‘pocket’ SSD, though, not one based on 2.5in drive dimensions. These are designed to be used with USB or Thunderbolt connectors, not those found inside a Mac or MacBook. You’ll mostly find this kind below. They are incredibly small and convenient. However, they are more expensive than 2.5in-style drives, so you may want to consider the larger type if lower spend is a top concern. Shock-proof and rugged? Other features to look out for include IP-ratings for weather protection and password protection for your important files. SSDs are more durable than hard drives. They have no moving parts, and won’t be damaged if they are moved or knocked while writing data. While modern hard drives have some level of shock protection, it’s still a big issue. You can treat an SSD pretty mean before it starts complaining. Some portable SSDs even offer water resistance. You can also get ruggedization in a specialized drive enclosure, if you choose to go down the 2.5in drive route. This is a huge portability benefit. But if they are sat still all day, are SSDs more reliable than HDDs? Hard drives tend to fail mechanically. For example, the motor that spins the platters might burn out. SSDs’ memory cells age, which can lead to failure. Both kinds require specialist recovery. As ever, back up important data. However, for our purposes, as people who occasionally have to fling drives in rucksacks and plug them in while sat in an airplane seat, SSDs are the clear winner. Software Just remember to check that any apps provided by the manufacturer work with Macs and well as Windows PCs.",

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like.

    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",
