    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2578008/get-three-of-these-27-inch-dell-4k-monitors-for-the-price-of-a-studio-display.html",
    "description": "Macworld More often than not, a single monitor is not enough to get your work done, especially when you need to keep multiple apps up on the screen. Apple’s Studio Display is gorgeous, but it’s also absolutely expensive. A great alternative is the 27-inch 4K Dell UltraSharp which is only $435 right now, a 25 percent discount from its $580 MSRP and more than $1,100 less than Apple’s option. Rather than paying $1,599 for the Studio Display, you can get one of these gorgeous Dell monitors. If you have the budget, you can get multiples, especially since the newer MacBook models allow you to add quite a few monitors. Granted you’re not getting a camera, spatial audio, Thunderbolt, or 5K, but for the price, you won’t miss them. With 4K UHD resolution and high brightness, you’ll enjoy crystal-clear images, vibrant colors, and deep contrast. Whether you’re working, playing, or streaming content, you’ll have a fun time. Keep in mind that this monitor is better suited for everyday activities than any serious gaming because there’s a 60Hz refresh rate and 5ms GTG response time. But the Studio Display is only 60Hz as well, so you’re not missing anything there. However, you are gaining some flexibility, as Dell’s monitor comes with a stand that allows you to adjust its height, tilt, or swivel it. Apple only lets you tilt unless you pay even more. So go ahead and get yourself one (or two) of these $435 Dell UltraSharp 27-monitor monitors while they’re still 25 percent off at Amazon. Buy now at Amazon",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/616018/how-to-custom-ringtone-iphone.html",
    "description": "Macworld The iPhone comes with a number of ringtones you can use for calls and text notifications, and even added a lot of new ones in iOS 17. But it’s your iPhone, why not use a custom ringtone that only you have? You can even set certain ringtones for specific contacts, so you immediately know who it is when they call. For example, you can set a song that’s special to you and your spouse, so when your spouse calls, you’ll hear the song and know immediately who it is. You can make a custom ringtone right on your iPhone with GarageBand or use your Mac, as long as you know the steps. Here’s how it works. How make and install ringtones from songs on your Mac If your music library is on your Mac, you can create ringtones using Apple Music. However, you must own the physical song file—streamed songs cannot be made into ringtones. Also, the files must not be copy-protected. How to make a ringtone from a song in Apple Music 1. Launch the Music app. 2. Go to your music library and find the song you want to make into a ringtone. Play the song and keep an eye on the elapsed time at the top of the app. Note the time stamp where you want the ringtone to start, then note where you want it to end. (Note: Ringtones cannot be longer than 30 seconds.) 2. Right-click on the song and in the pop-up menu, select Get Info. 3. A window with the details of the song file will appear. Click Options. 4. In Options, there are timecodes for Start and Stop. Check the Start checkbox and enter the starting time from step 2. Then check the Stop box and enter the end time. Click OK. IDG 5. Select the file, and then click on the File menu and select Convert \u003e Create AAC version. (If the only option you see is Create MP3 version, select that.) 6. A new copy of your song file will appear under the original. Right-click on it and select Show in Finder. IDG 7. A Finder window with the song file should appear on your desktop. Look at the file’s extension (the extension appears after the file name and a period “.”). If you don’t see the extension, right-click on the file, select Get Info, and then look for the Name \u0026 Extension section. Then do one of the following: If the extension is .m4a change it to .m4r. If the extension is .mp3, the file needs to be converted to .m4a. Open the file in QuickTime Player, which is in your Applications folder. Then in QuickTime Player, click on the File menu and select Export As \u003e Audio Only. Name the file, choose a place to save it, then click Save. Then change the extension of the newly exported file to .m4r. Now you have a suitable ringtone file, and you just need to install it on your iPhone. How to load the ringtone from the Mac to your iPhone 1. Connect your iPhone to your Mac via USB. 2. Open a Finder window (press ⌘-N on the desktop). 3. In the sidebar under Locations, you should find your iPhone. Select it. 4. Find your ringtone file (the one with the .m4r extension), and drag it over to the Finder window that has your iPhone selected. 5. A green “+” icon should appear on your cursor and the file that you are dragging. That means you will be adding it to your iPhone. Drop the file to install it. IDG And that’s it! To see the ringtone, open the Setting app on your iPhone, then tap Sound \u0026 Haptics \u003e Ringtone, and it will appear at the top of the list with other custom ringtones (if you have others). How to make a ringtone with GarageBand for iPhone Note that you don’t have to use Apple Music for this. Almost any audio file in AAC format, with the file extension changed to .m4r, and a maximum length of 30 seconds will work. You can use other audio editing software to produce one. Fortunately, Apple gives you GarageBand for free, and it’s available on both Mac and iPhone. Here’s how to use the iPhone version of GarageBand to make a ringtone. You can start from scratch (we’re not going to show you how to make a song in this tutorial) or you can edit an existing sound file, which we’ll demonstrate here. The ringtone must be no longer than 30 seconds.  Before you edit in GarageBand, here’s how to prep for the file you want to edit. If you have an existing sound file, copy it to iCloud Drive. If you want to edit a song, you must have the song file, either by buying it online or ripping it from a CD. If you have the actual song file already on your iPhone, you will be able to access it through GarageBand. Copy-protected song files cannot be edited. Streamed Apple Music songs or songs from another streaming service cannot be used as ringtones. Here’s how to edit a sound file in GarageBand for iPhone and then save it as a ringtone. How to make custom ringtones on your iPhone If you don’t have or want to use your Mac, you can create a custom ringtone right on your phone with a little work. You can import a pre-recorded song—again, it needs to be an unprotected track that you own—or create something original using GarageBand’s instruments. Here’s how to get it done: 1. Launch GarageBand. If you don’t have it, it’s free in the App Store. It’s a big application, so give it some time to download. 2. Tap Tracks at the top of the screen. 3. Swipe through the screen left or right until you find the Audio Recorder section. Tap it. 4. At the top left of the screen tap the Tracks button. It’s the third button from the left. Left: the Tracks button.Right: the Loop Browser button.IDG 5. Tap the Loop Browser on the upper right. It’s the button with a loop icon. 6. A file browser window opens and you can navigate to the file you want to edit. If your file is on iCloud Drive, tap Files and then tap the Browse items from the Files app link at the bottom. If you want to edit a song file, tap Music, then navigate to your song file. Songs can be imported into GarageBand, but they must be on your iPhone and not copy protectedIDG 7. Press and hold the file, then drag it from the browser window to the GarageBand workspace. 8. Now it’s time to edit the track down to 30 seconds. If you want a visual cue to help you with the time, tap the Settings button and turn on Time Ruler. This will display the time in seconds at the top of the workspace. Tap the Play button at the top to hear the song. Tap it again or tap the Stop button next to it to stop playing. To trim a song, tap the track and trim bars will appear at the ends. Tap and drag a bar to the stop where you want to trim the song. While we’re not going into greater detail here, you can perform other edits if you want. You can cut sections out, add effects, etc. 8. Once you’ve edited the song, you can save it as a ringtone. Tap the Navigation button in the upper left. It’s the arrowhead pointing downward. Tap and hold, then drag the bar at the end of the song to trim it.IDG 9. In the pop-up menu, select My Songs. A window called “GarageBand Recents” will open, and your saved GarageBand Project will display as “My Song.” If you want to rename it, tap and hold on the project, and in the pop-up menu, select Rename. Give it a new name. To export the song as a ringtone, tap and hold on the project, then in the pop-up menu, select Share. The “Share Song” window will appear; select Ringtone. You’ll need to give the ringtone a name (the default is the name of the project). The tap Export to save the ringtone. Apple 10. After the export is done, a window will appear that will ask you how you want to use the ringtone. You can set it now, or do so later in the iPhone Settings \u003e Sounds \u0026 Haptics \u003e Ringtone. To set a ringtone for a specific contact, you need to do that in the contact’s entry in the Contacts app ([your contact] \u003e Edit \u003e Ringtone). How to buy ringtones from Apple Apple sells ringtones that you can buy directly on your iPhone. Here’s how to shop for ringtones. 1. Launch the iTunes Store app—not the Apple Music app or App Store. If you can’t find the iTunes Store, do a search on your iPhone or tell Siri, “Open the iTunes Store.” You can also get to the iTunes Store through the Settings app by tapping Sound \u0026 Haptics \u003e Ringtone \u003e Tone Store. 2. Tap the More button at the bottom of the screen. It’s the button with three dots. 3. On the next screen, tap Tones. 4. Now you’re in the section with ringtones. Most ringtones are $1.29, while others are $0.99. Tap the icon to hear the tone, and tap the price button to buy it. When you buy a ringtone, you’ll be given options to set it. The ringtone will be available in the iPhone settings and you can always adjust it to your liking. IDG",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
