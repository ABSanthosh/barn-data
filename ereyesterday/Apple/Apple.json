    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2567181/ios-18-enhanced-visual-search-privacy-setting-how-to.html",
    "description": "Macworld The Photos app overhaul in iOS 18 has been met with mixed approval. We have a set of tips for how to improve iOS 18 Photos by customizing the interface and layout, but the internet seems to have caught on to a new Enhanced Visual Search feature and is worried about the privacy implications. Starting in iOS 16, a feature called Visual Look Up will identify common objects, landmarks, plants, animals, and even icons and labels in your photos. When you look at an image in your Photos library, the info button (i) will get a little sparkle on it if Visual Lookup can provide further info. It might even change from the letter (i) to an icon of an animal or leaf. The feature got better in iOS 17, and is improved even more in iOS 18. But there’s only so much your iPhone can do on-device. There just no way to match any of your infinite photo variety to the thousands of popular landmarks and points of interest in the world—the database would fill up all your iPhone storage and then some. So to make Visual Look Up better at identifying common landmarks and points of interest, Apple will use the cloud to match places in your photos to a big points-of-interest database it maintains. This, of course, requires your photo (or at least, specific markers and data from them) leaving your iPhone. Here’s what the privacy implications are and how to disable this feature if you want to. Enhanced Visual Search privacy In Apple’s legal disclaimers about Photos \u0026 Privacy, it says: Enhanced Visual Search in Photos allows you to search for photos using landmarks or points of interest. Your device privately matches places in your photos to a global index Apple maintains on our servers. We apply homomorphic encryption and differential privacy, and use an OHTTP relay that hides IP address. This prevents Apple from learning about the information in your photos. Note that this is just about matching places, not faces of people or pets (or other animals and plants), which all still happens on-device. Just what does all that technical jargon mean? Well, “homomorphic encryption” means encryption that allows operations to be done on the data while it’s still in its encrypted state. In other words, your image is encrypted and then Apple matches the data to its database of landmarks and points of interest without ever decrypting it into a visually recognizable image. Nobody at Apple can just access some server and look at your photos. Differential Privacy is a means of protecting individual data when it’s used in group analysis. You might have your anonymized data as part of a bunch of data sets, and nobody can identify you when looking at just one of them, but if you combine data from multiple sets together you can pinpoint an individual person. Differential Privacy is a way to use several mathematical methods to protect users from this. And an OHTTP relay is an “Oblivious HTTP Relay.” It’s a trusted internet relay that takes encrypted requests and forwards them along to a specific location (in this case, to Apple’s photo analyzing servers) without sending along any identifying information like IP addresses, device IDs, and so on. In other words, it separates the “what” of a request from the “who” of the request. So Apple has no way of knowing from which one of its users any individual photo has come, nor would any hacker who got access to Apple’s Enhanced Visual Lookup server. In other words, Apple is going to great lengths to have no ability to know what your photos are or where they came from. This protects your privacy, but it also protects Apple from liability or surveillance requests from government entities. How to disable Enhanced Visual Search If you’re still worried about privacy in Photos, even with all that encryption and obscuring identifiable information, you can disable Enhanced Visual Search easily enough. Visual Look Up will still work, it just won’t be as good at identifying things like landmarks or points of interest in your photos. On iPhone or iPad: Open Settings Scroll to the bottom and tap on Apps. Select Photos. You’ll find the toggle for Enhanced Visual Search at the bottom of the Photos settings. Tap once to turn it off. Foundry On Mac, you’ll find it in the settings of the Photos app itself: Open Photos In the Photos menu, select Settings (or type Command-comma) Select the General tab You’ll find a checkbox for Enhanced Visual Search at the bottom of the General tab. Click once to turn it off. Foundry",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2567062/could-the-iphone-17-finally-be-getting-a-major-screen-upgrade.html",
    "description": "Macworld When Apple unveiled the four new iPhone models last fall, it quickly became apparent that there were fewer differences between the standard and Pro models than had been the case in previous years. Some Pro fans, indeed, were so impressed by the basic iPhone 16 and 16 Plus that they decided to save money and pick the cheaper option. There are benefits to going Pro, of course, and one of these concerns the display. The 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have slightly larger screens than their non-Pro equivalents with slightly narrower bezels around the edge, but more importantly, they are better specced: As has been the case since the iPhone 13, they are equipped with ProMotion and can dynamically increase their refresh rate up to 120Hz, whereas the standard screens are capped at 60Hz. (The Pro handsets also come with always-on displays, which is a related benefit: ProMotion enables the phone to conserve battery life by dramatically lowering the refresh rate when performing operations that don’t require a high refresh rate.) If the latest report is accurate, however, the Pro phones may soon lose this perk–not in the sense of having it taken away, but in it being given to the cheaper handsets as well. A new rumor claims all four iPhone 17 models will get screens with higher refresh rates, which almost certainly refers to a ProMotion upgrade. The leak (via MacRumors) comes originally from Digital Chat Station on the Chinese social media site Weibo, and while Weibo can sometimes be a dubious source of intel this particular user has a track record; as MacRumors notes, they made accurate predictions about a few features and design elements of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 15 ahead of those launches. What’s more, the claim both makes sense and fits what we’ve heard so far about the late-2025 iPhones. As early as February 2024 we were hearing tips that the entire iPhone 17 range would be fitted with LTPO displays; that’s the screen tech, in contrast to LTPS on the non-Pro iPhones, which enables ProMotion, and likely means we can also expect always-on displays across the board next fall. But this does leave Apple in a tricky position. How will it differentiate the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max from their more affordable siblings? Early signs hint at a new part-aluminum, part-glass design (the top half will be aluminum and the bottom glass, apparently) and a redesigned camera bump, but customers will need to see more than that if they’re to spring for those models’ premium price tags. For all the latest news and rumors, check our regularly updated iPhone 17 superguide. But if you can’t wait that long for a new handset, pick up a bargain on the current range with our roundup of the best iPhone deals.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
