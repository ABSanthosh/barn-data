    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "title": "iOS 26 beta 4 is released to developers, public beta coming soon",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2815108/ios-26-beta-updated.html",
    "description": "Macworld As is tradition, Apple released beta versions of its new operating systems to developers on the first day of WWDC on June 9. The first beta release of iOS 26 had everything Apple demonstrated in its WWDC keynote: Liquid Glass, the new Phone app and features, the new Camera and Photos experience, and more. Subsequent releases have made refinements to the interface and fixed bugs. There are still plenty of bugs and unrefined areas, as you would expect with a major iOS update still weeks from release. Not everything is working as it should, and it is not advised to run this version of the OS unless you‚Äôre a developer or have a high tolerance for buggy or unoptimized software. You can read all about all the new features in our iOS 26 superguide and find out the latest information about the iOS beta including when it will launch and how to install it in a separate story. Update July 22: Apple has released iOS 26 beta 4. This is still a developers-only release, but we expect the Public Beta to be released as early as tomorrow, likely with the same build number. What‚Äôs new in the latest beta release Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new in the fourth beta of iOS 26: The ‚Äúliquid glass‚Äù interface effects have been further tweaked, now a little more glass-like than beta 3 but still more legible than earlier betas. On first launch, you are asked which notifications you want summaries for. You can individually select from: News \u0026 Entertainment, Communication \u0026 Social, and All Other Apps. There is a new Dynamic option for the iOS 26 wallpapers that cycles through them based on time of day. Silence Unknown Callers has three options: Never, Ask Reason for Calling, and Silence. Silence functions as it did in previous versions of iOS, and Ask Reason for Calling is the new Call Screening feature. The Camera app has a new splash screen to prepare you for the new simplified design. iOS 26: How to install the public beta The iOS 26 public beta test is expected to begin in July, but you can sign up now so you‚Äôre ready for it. Click Sign Up on the Apple Beta page and register with your Apple ID. Log in to the Beta Software Program. Click Enroll your iOS device. Open the Settings app, tap General, then Software Update. In the Beta Updates section, select the iOS Public Beta. It may take a few moments after registering for the beta option to appear in Software Update. iOS 26: How to install the developer beta You‚Äôll need to be registered as an Apple developer, but a free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here‚Äôs how to do it via the Apple Developer app: Download the Apple Developer App from the App Store. Open the app. Tap on Account. Sign in using your usual Apple ID. Find out everything you need to know about iOS 18 in our iOS 26 superguide.",

    "description": "Macworld The MacBook Pro is a fantastic laptop at a great price, but it starts to get really expensive once you start to add RAM and storage. Today‚Äôs sale helps a lot: Amazon is selling the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro with 1TB of storage and 24GB of RAM for $1,79, an impressive discount of $250 and the best price we‚Äôve ever seen for this configuration. The laptop comes with a gorgeous 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, which looks great in any lighting situation. The M4 chip is accompanied by 24GB of memory, a speedy combo that will easily handle any tasks you need to complete, including video and photo editing. The 1TB SSD is the max you can get, too, so enjoy all that space. When we reviewed the M4 MacBook Pro, we gave it a near-perfect 4.5-star rating. We loved the laptop‚Äôs overall performance, as well as the 12MP Center Stage camera upgrade, and appreciated the extra Thunderbolt 4 ports. Our biggest gripe with Apple‚Äôs laptops has always been the expensive upgrade costs and this sale certainly helps with that. So stop wasting time and get your order in for the $1,749 M4 MacBook Pro with 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage before this discount vanishes into thin air.

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple‚Äôs Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber‚Äôs The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. [‚Ä¶] Phil‚Äôs appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers ‚Äî remember, developer relations is all under Phil ‚Äî might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn‚Äôt have (they‚Äôre pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple‚Äôs enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†* For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community ‚Äî and I can‚Äôt help but suspect that it won‚Äôt come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We‚Äôll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it‚Äôs easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that‚Äôs either not the case, or it doesn‚Äôt stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I‚Äôm not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I‚Äôve decided that it‚Äôs best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple‚Äôs leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",
