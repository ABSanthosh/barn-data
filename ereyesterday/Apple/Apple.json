    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/1377158/airpods-black-friday-deals-2024.html",
    "description": "Macworld It‚Äôs nearly that time of year again‚ÄîBlack Friday, the yearly shopping event where everyone hunts for the biggest deals. Apple‚Äôs AirPods are famously popular gifts and travel companions, and various models are often on sale throughout the year. So keep your eyes peeled for great deals on AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max as the Black Friday sales take off. With the AirPods 4 released this year, older models are being phased out, and we‚Äôre not seeing as many deals there. Even if you find what looks like a good price on 2nd-gen AirPods or AirPods 3, it‚Äôs probably worth getting the AirPods 4 instead‚Äîthey sound and fit much better. Similarly, Apple recently updated the AirPods Max with USB-C replacing the Lightning port. But they have no new features, so if you find a better deal on the Lightning version, you should probably go for that. This page will be updated frequently with the latest deals, so return here throughout the Black Friday period as we highlight the best deals leading up to and through Black Friday (November 29, 2024) and Cyber Monday (December 2, 2024). Soon Apple will announce it own Black Friday 2024 sale, but in the meantime you should also check out of our round-up of the best Black Friday deals for this year and our always up-to-date advice on the best AirPods deals. The best AirPods deals right now Deals in the U.S.: AirPods Pro (2nd-gen, USB-C case): $189 at Amazon or Best Buy ($59 off) AirPods 4: $119 at Amazon ($10 off) AirPods 4 with ANC: $149 at Amazon ($10 off) AirPods Max (Lightning): $469 at B\u0026H Photo¬†($100 off) Deals in the U.K.: Amazon,¬†AirPods (4th gen, 2024, with ANC): ¬£169 (¬£10 off, RRP ¬£179) Argos,¬†AirPods (3rd gen, Magsafe): ¬£139 (¬£40 off, RRP was ¬£179 ‚Äì¬†Clearance) Amazon,¬†AirPods (3rd gen, Lightning): ¬£129 (¬£40 off, RRP was ¬£169 ‚Äì¬†Clearance) Argos,¬†AirPods 2nd gen: ¬£109 (¬£10 off, RRP was ¬£129 ‚Äì¬†Clearance) Argos,¬†AirPod Max, Lightning, 2020: ¬£429 (¬£70 off, RRP was ¬£499 ‚Äì¬†Clearance) Black Friday: Apple‚Äôs shopping event Every year Apple holds shopping event from Black Friday (November 29, 2024) to Cyber Monday (December 2, 2024). Apple rarely discounts its products, so the event typically consists of gift card offers rather than actual savings. In 2023 you could get gift cards for the following voucher amounts with AirPods purchased on Apple‚Äôs U.S. site or Apple‚Äôs U.K. site. This year, with AirPods 4 out and Apple no longer selling AirPods 2 or 3, it‚Äôs not clear what deals will be available. AirPods (2nd¬†generation)$25¬£20AirPods (3rd¬†generation)$25¬£20AirPods Pro (2nd¬†generation)$50¬£40AirPods Max$75¬£60 Best AirPods deals in the US and U\u003eK Heading into Black Friday, these were the best AirPods deals we found in November 2024. Latest AirPods Pro 2 deals The 2nd-generation AirPods Pro look just like the first-gen model, but they sound better, have longer battery life, and offer a few other welcome improvements. You should look for the then just-updated version with a USB-C charging case, which retailed at $249 / ¬£229 but was often on sale for at least $50 off. Retailer Price $219 View Deal $249 View Deal $297.50 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Latest AirPods 4 deals When Apple released the AirPods 4, it priced them to replace both the 2nd-gen AirPods and AirPods 3. It comes in two models, a basic AirPods 4 that retails for $129 and an upgraded version with Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) that is normally priced at $169. They look at feel the same and have the same great sound quality and features, other than ANC. Apple has stopped selling AirPods 2 or 3, and even if you find a deal on them, we think you‚Äôll be a lot happier with AirPods 4. Here are the best deals for the basic version: Retailer Price $119 View Deal $125 View Deal $129 View Deal $129.99 View Deal $129.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket And these are the deals on the AirPods 4 with ANC: Retailer Price $168.99 View Deal $174.95 View Deal $179 View Deal $179 View Deal $179 View Deal $179.99 View Deal $179.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Latest AirPods Max deals Frankly, AirPods Max are overpriced (even on sale). Compared to other consumer-oriented over-the-ear noise-cancelling headphones, you might pay hundreds more. Apple‚Äôs price is $549 / ¬£499, and they‚Äôre easy enough to find for up to $100 less, but a good price would have been under $400. Apple recently updated the AirPods Max to include a USB-C charging port, but they are otherwise unchanged. You can probably find better deals on the older model with the Lightning charging port, and if so you should probably go for that.

    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
