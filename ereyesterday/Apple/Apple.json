    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2682967/tariff-panic-buying-an-iphone-right-now-is-a-terrible-idea.html",
    "description": "Macworld Because it’s so big and its supply chain is so dependent on Chinese factories, Apple is almost uniquely vulnerable to the effects of President Trump’s 125 percent tariff on goods coming out of that nation. For all of Tim Cook’s attempts to conciliate the new regime, this development is very bad news indeed for Apple Park, which will be braced for tough times ahead. Thanks to those levies (here’s a detailed breakdown of how they affect Apple), pundits have speculated that the price of an iPhone could rise by as much as 43 percent, taking the entry-level model from $799 to $1,142 and a top-end iPhone 16 Pro Max to a whopping $2,300. that’s enough to induce a panic and many regular customers are either rushing or considering rushing out to buy a new iPhone before the price hikes kick in… but we think this is a terrible idea. Here’s why. 1. Buying too early is a waste (of money and electronics) There’s a reason why most of us don’t buy a new iPhone on an annual basis: parting with upwards of $1,000 every year (before you factor in a case, a data plan, subscriptions, new apps and IAPs, and repairs if you’re unlucky), is simply too expensive. Most people upgrade their smartphone every two or three years, and plenty hold on to a handset longer than that. For all the talk of planned obsolescence, Apple builds phones that happily last three years or more without a hitch. So let’s think about how panic-buying an iPhone now will affect that cycle. The question is this: When were you planning to upgrade? Soon? In September? Next year? If it’s just a couple of weeks, then definitely make the decision ASAP. (Though it is an odd time of year to get an iPhone, as I’ll discuss below.) But if you were planning on waiting until the new models come out in September then a panic purchase now may save you a few bucks but you’ve just thrown away five months of perfectly good iPhone performance in order to buy a handset that will be a generation less advanced than if you had waited. It’ll last a year less before you notice performance difficulties, so this single act of panic-buying means all future upgrades will need to happen a year earlier. Given the cost of an iPhone, you’ve probably wasted just as much money as you’re likely to save. Besides, regular smartphone upgrades aren’t just bad for your pocket. They’re terrible for the environment, too. So you’ll add some unneeded e-waste into the mix. The iPhone 16 Pro is a great phone—but there’s no reason to rush to buy one now.Anyron Copeman / Foundry 2. The situation could and probably will change I’m no political commentator and absolutely do not want to get into the rights and wrongs of President Trump’s plan. But if there’s one adjective we can apply to the way things have played out so far, it’s unpredictable. At first, Trump threatened to apply tariffs to more than 180 countries, at least one of which has no human inhabitants. Then nearly all of those countries had the tariffs paused (except China), even though the president had previously insisted that wouldn’t happen. At one stage he claimed the idea of individual exemptions was not under consideration, but later he indicated that it is. The point I’m making is that a lot of this appears to be brinkmanship: bluffs and grand gestures intended to secure a negotiational advantage. These moves seemingly aren’t measured long-term plans with a detailed schedule. Things are liable to change with zero notice. Things may get worse, or Apple may get an exemption. Either way, it would be foolhardy to make a high-cost purchase because it seems like a good idea today. 3. The iPhone 17 isn’t far off We’re more than halfway through the lifecycle of the iPhone 16; the iPhone 17 will be here in September. Fewer people tend to buy new iPhones between late spring and summer as it becomes increasingly worth waiting until the new models are announced, at which point you’ll get access to newer hardware with better features, and the then-new models you were considering will get a price cut. Also, there are plenty of unknowns. We don’t know if prices will increase. We don’t know how the iPhone 17 Air will fit in the lineup. We don’t even know whether the iPhone 17 will be an especially exciting update. A panic purchase would take all the fun out of waiting. The iPhone 16e might be a great bargain next year.Eugen Wegmann 4. There are cheaper phones you can choose from Time for some hard truths: Apple isn’t the only smartphone maker in the world. Here at Macworld, we think the iPhone is the best option, but it would be absurd to claim that the Android market has nothing to offer, whether that’s lower prices, more adventurous features and design choices, or a more customizable operating system. Check out this cross-platform rundown of the best smartphones from our colleagues at Tech Advisor for a glimpse of what’s out there. Many of those Android manufacturers will be facing the same issues as Apple right now, but not all. If things get really bad and the iPhone’s price balloons to insane levels (which I think is unlikely), there will certainly be alternatives out there that are more affordable without suffering too much on the quality front. There’s also the iPhone 16e. We don’t know yet how Apple plans to update its newest “budget” handset in 2026. If tariffs affect the price of the iPhone 17 flagship lineup and impact sales, Apple could use its “e” line as a way to tempt buyers back into the fold. So again, wait. 5. You might need that money for other things I don’t want to get all pessimistic or anything. But you might want to save your cash for essentials in the new economy. We all want a shiny new iPhone, but your current model is probably fine. So you can spend the money on something else, such as a leather jacket, a shotgun, and a car with spikes all over it.",

    "description": "Macworld If you’re looking for a larger tablet with a great screen and a speedy chip, you don’t need to spend a thousand-plus on an iPad Pro. The 13-inch M3 iPad Air is a fantastic mid-range option, and today it’s officially available for its very best price: Amazon is selling the 13-inch iPad Air for $730, a savings of $69 and the deepest we’ve yet to see for Apple’s newest iPad Air. This tablet has a gorgeous 12.9-inch Liquid Retina display with slim bezels and a fantastic design. Despite it’s size, it’s also super light, so slipping this one into your bag and carrying it around won’t be as difficult. And the new M3 chip ensures you’re going to be able to quickly launch apps and movies and swap between it all without a hitch. Speaking of apps, this tablet comes with 128GB of storage, so you’ll be able to install a lot of them. And of course, it’s ready for Apple Intelligence for maaking your own emoji, editing photos, and getting help with your writing. While the M3 iPad Air isn’t much of an upgrade over the M2 model, it’s a fantastic pick for anyone getting their first tablet or upgrading from an older model. So snag the M3 iPad Air for its very best price of $730 at Amazon while this deal still stands. View Deal at Amazon",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
