    "description": "Macworld On January 17, “Severance,” Apple’s most popular show not named “Ted Lasso,” will begin its long-awaited second season. And Apple is so excited to mark the occasion, it wants to make sure everyone is caught up on the first season. This weekend, Apple is making Apple TV+ free for everyone. That means you can watch as many shows and movies as you can handle in a 48-hour period, beginning at midnight on Saturday and continuing until 11:59 pm on Sunday. You can access Apple TV+ through the Apple TV app on all Apple devices, Roku, Google TV Streamer, and most smart TVs, including Samsung and LG. Apple has already received several Golden Globe nominations, including Best Drama for “Slow Horses” and Best Limited Series for “Disclaimer.” Other critically acclaimed shows airing in 2024 are “Shrinking” starring Harrison Ford and “Presumed Innocent” led by Jake Gyllenhaal. But of course, you can’t watch everything. Here are our picks for what to check out in the allotted time: Severence: Apple’s delightfully strange and gripping drama is one of the best shows you’ll find on any platform. There are a total of nine episodes inthe first season, about an hour each. Total time: About 9 hours Shrinking: Shorter and lighter than “Severence” but just as entertaining, “Shrinking” centers on a therapist (Jason Segel) who becomes very involved in his patients’ lives. Hilarity and emotion ensue in this fast watch with just 10 half-hour episodes in the first season. Total time: About 5 hours The Morning Show: The show that started it all. Starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, the show is about, you guessed it, the trials and tribulations of a morning news show. There are three seasons, but check out the first, with 10 episodes at about an hour each, and you’ll be hooked. Total time: About 10 hours Fly Me to the Moon: Even if you’re not a moon landing conspiracist, this brisk comedy starring Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum will make you a believer. Total time: About 2 hours, 11 minutes Ted Lasso: If you haven’t seen the show everyone was talking about in 2021, it’s still worth a watch. A heartwarming and hilarious fish-out-of-water tale, “Ted Lasso” is as good as everyone says it is. Season 1 is 10 half-hour episodes. Total time: About 6 hours Apple TV+ normally costs $9.99 a month with a seven-day free trial for new subscribers. Additionally, customers who purchase and activate a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, or Mac get three months of Apple TV+ for free. For more information about all the trials on offer, read about how to get Apple TV+ for free.",

    "description": "Macworld As we head into a new year, Apple has outlined some of its plans for its Fitness+ service. The new content will kick off on Monday, January 6, and includes the following new and updated workouts: Progressive strength training: A three-week program that starts with Progressive Overload (Week One), Time Under Tension (Week Two), and finally Dynamic Power (Week Three). It’s designed to be repeated with higher weights as you build strength. Strength, Endurance, and Agility for Pickleball: For some reason, pickleball is the country’s fastest-growing sport. And this program, featuring professional pickleball champion Catherine Parenteau, is designed to up your game. Yoga Peak Poses: Similar to a one-on-one instructional session, with each highlighting a single peak pose. Introduction to Breath Meditation: Five different 10-minute meditations guiding you through different breath meditation techniques. New Time to Walk episodes: The Apple Watch Time to Walk feature gets eight new episodes, kicking off with Adam Scott on January 13 as a tie-in to the second season of Severance. Apple Fitness+ will also continue its rotating lineup of Artist Spotlight music tie-ins and special guest instructors, including choreographer Alex Wong’s dance workout. Additionally, Apple has announced a collaboration with running, cycling, and hiking app Strava. Enhanced integration means that when you share a Fitness+ workout with Strava, you’ll see rich details about it in Strava and can share it with the Strava community. Existing Strava subscribers will be able to get three months of Fitness+ for free, and Strava athletes will appear as guest trainers on Fitness+ throughout the year.",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
