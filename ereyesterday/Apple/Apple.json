    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html",
    "description": "Macworld It doesn‚Äôt take long for iPhone rumors to circulate. It‚Äôs one of the most iconic and influential tech gadgets of all time, and everyone wants to know what‚Äôs coming next. That Apple is so secretive only heightens the appeal of iPhone rumors and leaks. So it should come as little surprise that iPhone 17 rumors, leaks, and info started to circulate months before the iPhone 16 was even formally announced. Here‚Äôs everything we know so far, but don‚Äôt take any of it as solid info: even when early rumors are accurate, plans can change, and nothing is ever certain until Apple announces it. Updated October 18: More reports on rumored features and specs for the iPhone 17 line. The iPhone 17 Pro is rumored to have a 48MP telephoto camera and 24MP front camera. iPhone 17: Release date Here‚Äôs something we do know: The new iPhone lineup is almost always announced in September‚Äîusually on a Tuesday in the second week of September, to be specific. So we would expect the iPhone 17 line to be announced on or around September 9, 2025. Here‚Äôs when the most recent models were released: iPhone 15: September 12, 2023 iPhone 14: Sepember 7, 2022 iPhone 13: Sepember 14, 2021 iPhone 12: October 13, 2020 (delayed due to Covid) Historically, preorders for the iPhone begin on the Friday after the announcement, and the phones ship a week later. On occasion, some specific models may ship a couple of weeks later than the others due to production issues. iPhone 17: Price We haven‚Äôt yet heard if the iPhone 17 line will cost the same as the iPhone 16 line, which at this time hasn‚Äôt even been announced yet. One rumor from a popular leaker on Weibo contends that the ‚ÄúPlus‚Äù model will be replaced by the new ‚ÄúSlim‚Äù model that costs more than the Pro Max, though it won‚Äôt have the same processor and RAM and the Pro models. The supposed pricing would be: iPhone 17: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB ($799) iPhone 17 Pro: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB ($1,099) iPhone 17 Pro Max: 6.86-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB ($1,199) iPhone 17 Slim: 6.65-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB ($1,299) This would mean a significant upward shift in overall iPhone pricing, with the Pro model jumping up $100 and a new model replacing the Plus with a price of $100 more than the Pro Max. iPhone 17: Colors We haven‚Äôt yet heard anything about what colors to expect from the iPhone 17 line. The iPhone 16 is expected to launch in seven colors, with white and purple joining blue, pink, yellow, green, and black.¬†Additionally, desert yellow and cement gray are expected which are reportedly reminiscent of the classic gold and space gray options. We haven‚Äôt heard any rumors about the iPhone 17‚Äôs colors and probably won‚Äôt until after the iPhone 16 launches. The iPhone 17 is expected to have an ultra-thin model like the M4 iPad Pro. The iPhone 17 is expected to have an ultra-thin model like the M4 iPad Pro.Petter Ahrnstedt The iPhone 17 is expected to have an ultra-thin model like the M4 iPad Pro.Petter Ahrnstedt Petter Ahrnstedt iPhone 17: New slimmer ‚ÄòAir‚Äô model It‚Äôs been rumored for years that Apple is planning to launch a new model with higher-end features above the Pro Max. It looks like it may finally arrive in 2025. Several analysts have reported that the existing Plus model will be replaced by a new ‚ÄúSlim‚Äù model with a larger screen size and a much thinner body. Analyst Jeff Pu was the first to report this change, and The Information later reported on the Slim model, stating that it would be a new even-higher-end model that sits above ‚ÄúPro Max‚Äù in the lineup and would have a centered rear camera and a smaller Dynamic Island. Pu later said he expects the phone to have an A19 chip (not A19 Pro), 8GB of RAM, around a 6.6-inch display, an aluminum body, and a single 48MP rear camera. A more recent video by Jon Prosser surmises that the slim iPhone will be called the iPhone Air (we agree that makes sense) and will not be the most expensive in the lineup, but rather be a mid-priced model that prioritizes form and design over specs, much like the MacBook Air. Additionally, a report by Mark Gurman of Bloomberg in August 2024 claimed the new model will fit between the standard iPhone and the Pro: ‚Äù¬†If you want something snazzier than a standard iPhone‚Äìbut don‚Äôt really need the performance, screen size, or cameras of a Pro model‚Äìyou can get something that looks much cooler while still having the specifications of a regular iPhone.‚Äù A recent report suggested that Apple won‚Äôt use resin-coated copper components on the mainboard due to quality issues with the supplier. This was one of the ways Apple planned to reduce internal space requirements, so it‚Äôs unclear if it will have an impact on the iPhone 17 slim model‚Äôs overall thickness or not. Apple jumped back on the thin train with the launch of the M4 iPad Pro in May. It‚Äôs also rumored that Apple will launch a thinner Apple Watch and MacBook Pro over the coming months. iPhone 17: Rumored new features All iPhone 17 models have been rumored to feature a 24MP front-facing camera and the always-on display is supposed to finally be available on the non-Pro models. Some believe that ProMotion will come to the non-Pro models too, since the same LPTO technology that enables the always-on display is what makes ProMotion possible, in Apple‚Äôs iPhone implementation. If true, it would be the first time Apple has offered ProMotion on a non-Pro device. Apple is also said to be working with Corning on a new anti-glare and scratch-resistant glass for the iPhone 17 lineup. A report from The Information claims that ‚Äúat least one‚Äù model will feature a mechanical aperture, which would be new for iPhones but has been seen in a handful of Android phones so far. We don‚Äôt know much about what chips will power the iPhone 17 line, but we expect the high-end models (Pro and possibly Slim) will get an A19 Pro, while the non-Pro models will get either some variant of the A18 or a somewhat cut-back version of the A19. Since Apple is expected to bump every iPhone 16 model to 8GB of RAM due to the demands of Apple Intelligence, rumors have suggested Apple will increase the memory in the iPhone 17 Pro models to 12GB. A more recent research note from analyst Jeff Pu corroborated these claims, and added that the iPhone 17 Pro would feature a 48MP telephoto camera along with a new 24MP front camera. When it comes to wireless, the cellular modem is likely to still be supplied by Qualcomm; Apple‚Äôs own efforts to produce a top-tier 5G modem seem to be stalled and likely won‚Äôt be ready in time for next year‚Äôs iPhone 17 line. Wi-Fi 7 support seems likely, too. iPhone history The iPhone 16 range and the iPhone SE 3 are the current-generation models available from Apple. In addition to this SE 4 model we‚Äôre also expecting iPhone 17 to launch in 2025. Below you can find links below to our reviews of all iPhone models, including the latest generation.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created.
