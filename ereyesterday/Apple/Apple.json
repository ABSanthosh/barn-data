    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "title": "Why iOS 18.2 is a must-have update even if you don’t run Apple Intelligence",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2524355/ios-18-2-features-camera-control-mail-volume-messages-sudoku-airtag.html",
    "description": "Macworld When iOS 18.2 rolls out to all iPhones this week, it’s going to bring a ton of great new features. Most of the focus is on the new Apple Intelligence capabilities, and for good reason: AI is Apple’s big marketing hook but the features are rolling out gradually over several months. The iOS 18.2 (and macOS 15.2) adds long-awaited image tools and ChatGPT integration that make Apple Intelligence a lot more useful. But if you don’t have an iPhone 16 or iPhone 15 Pro (or just don’t care about AI), none of that matters to you. Fortunately, iOS 18.2 isn’t just an Apple Intelligence drop, it adds a host of other quality-of-life features and changes, too. Here are all the new things in iOS 18.2 coming to your iPhone that have nothing to do with Apple Intelligence. Update December 9: Apple has pushed out a second iOS 18.2 Release Candidate build which could delay the launch of iOS 18.2 by a day or two. Camera Control improvements After months of criticism, Apple is making several tweaks to the Camera Control button in iOS 18.2, for those with an iPhone 16. First, pressing and holding the button will launch the new Visual Intelligence feature. But there are some other quality-of-life improvements, too. In Settings \u003e Accessibility \u003e Camera Control you’ll be able to adjust the double-click speed. You can also enable an autofocus/exposure lock in Settings \u003e Camera \u003e Camera Control, so a light press on the button locks exposure and focus much as it usually does on the shutter button of a DLSR. Finally, there’s a new toggle that requires the screen to be on for the Camera Control button to launch a camera app. You’ll find that in Settings \u003e Display \u0026 Brightness, which is sort of a confusing place for it. Foundry New Mail app with smart categories The Mail app will analyze the content of your emails and automatically categorize them into four categories: Primary: Your personal mail or mail that needs to be acted on right away. Transactions: Receipts, order confirmations, shipping notices, etc. Updates: News and newsletters, social media notifications, and the like. Promotions: Coupons, marketing offers, and so on. The four categories will exist as buttons at the top of the Mail app, and you can swipe left on them to show All Mail. And no, Apple isn’t reading your emails. All of this happens on the device. Volume limit and lock screen slider In the Settings \u003e Sound \u0026 Haptics menu, there’s a new Volume Limit feature for your iPhone’s built-in speaker (volume limits for headphones have been around for a long time). It only affects media playback, not calls/FaceTime, alerts, or system sounds. There’s also a new option in Settings \u003e Accessibility \u003e Audio \u0026 Visual called “Always Show Volume Control.” This will put the volume control slider back on the bottom of the media playback controls on your Lock screen. That volume slider was removed back in iOS 16 (unless you were using AirPlay), and if you miss it, you can have it back now. Default messaging and calling apps In iOS 18.2’s Settings \u003e Apps you’ll find a new selection at the top, before your list of installed apps, called Default Apps. In this menu, you’ll choose default applications for things like email, browser, passwords \u0026 codes, and more. Most are options you had before (albeit scattered throughout Settings), but Messaging and Calling are new. There are no applications that qualify to populate those areas right now, but that’s probably just a matter of existing apps needing new versions that use new frameworks. Foundry Sudoku puzzles in News+ If you’re a News+ subscriber, you have access to several puzzles in the News app. Apple publishes daily crosswords, crosswords mini, and a word game called Quartiles. Now, daily Sudoku puzzles join the list. There is an easy, moderate, and challenging puzzle available each day. Foundry AirTag item location sharing You’ve been able to share an AirTag with another iPhone user, but that’s only really helpful for family members or trusted friends. With iOS 18.2, Apple is going to let you create a secure link you can share with someone else to let them see the location of an AirTag. They’ll be able to open it on any device, even just a web browser on any computer, and see the location of that AirTag. The link automatically expires after 7 days or when the AirTag is reunited with its owner, and of course the owner can turn off the sharing at any time. What’s more, Apple is working with a bunch of major airlines to make this sharing process a part of their customer service flow for lost luggage. Apple Charge time estimates? This isn’t yet available in the IOS 18.2 beta, but 9to5Mac discovered code that suggests Apple will soon show you how much longer your iPhone has until it reaches a full charge. It’s a feature that’s been present on Android phones for a while and would be a welcome overdue addition to the iPhone. However, while the feature first popped up in one of the early iOS 18.2 beta codes, it’s not live yet. There’s a chance it will be switched on when iOS 18.2 is available for all on Monday. If not expect it in iOS 18.3 sometime in February.",

    "description": "Macworld We got our first taste of Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.1, but there were many missing features. With iOS 18.2, we get a lot of them, including Visual Intelligence, image generation, ChatGPT integration, and more. There are quite a few welcome improvements in the iOS/iPadOS 18.2 release that are not related to AI, too. However, while Siri’s interface changed in iOS 18.1, the new smarter Siri still isn’t a part of this release. That will likely be coming in iOS 18.3 or 18.4, due for release around March 2025. We have a list of the Apple Intelligence features coming to iOS 18 along with their expected release timeframes. Updated December 9: A second release candidate for iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2 is out now for beta testers. iOS 18.2: All the new features The iOS 18.2 beta release is only available for iPhones that can run Apple Intelligence: iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, or any iPhone 16. There is also a secondary waiting list to access certain features. If you were on the original waiting list for Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18.1 you will get access to ChatGPT integration, Visual Intelligence, and the new Writing Tools features. But you’ll have to hop onto a second waiting list for the image generation features—Genmoji, Image Playground, and the Image Wand tool. Here’s what’s available in the iOS 18.2 beta as of the latest version: Writing Tools updates: Instead of just choosing to make a selection of text more professional, causal, or concise, you will have a freeform field to describe how you want to transform text. Examples: make this a poem, include a lot of dad jokes, or use a lot of sarcasm. Genmoji: Create a new emoji right on the system keyboard. Image Playground: Generate new images based on text prompts. Apple will suggest new costumes, items, or locations, and will make suggestions based on the context of a Messages thread or note in the Notes app. Images can be based on people you know by using identified images in Photos. Images are limited to cartoon or illustrative styles rather than realistic. Visual Intelligence: For iPhone 16 owners with the Camera Control button. Press and hold Camera Control to get additional information about a location, translate a sign or poster, detect phone numbers and addresses to quickly add to Contacts, and more. You can also tap a button to ask ChatGPT about what’s on screen, or another to perform a Google image search. Image Wand: An offshoot of Image Playground, this uses Apple’s image generation tools to create an image in an open area on a note in the Notes app, using the context from the surrounding area and the rest of the note. Start with a blank area or a rough sketch you make yourself. ChatGPT integration: If Siri can’t answer a question, it now has the option to ask ChatGPT. You need to give permission for each request and only limited data is shared. You don’t need to log into ChatGPT, but you are able to if you want to, or have a premium ChatGPT account you wish to use. You can ask Siri to have ChatGPT generate images., and use ChatGPT in the Writing Tools to generate text, too. In addition to the new user-facing features, there are new developer tools for integrating image generation and writing tools into third-party apps. Apple Intelligence is localized into English for Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK in this release. Default Apps: Users worldwide have a new “Default Apps” section at the top Settings \u003e Apps, where you can choose your default email, messaging, calling, call filtering, browser, password app, and keyboard. The messaging and calling options are new, and the other options have all been brought under a single menu. EU-specific features: In the EU, third-party browser that use their own custom web engines can now add web apps. EU users will also be able to delete the App Store. AE/AF Lock: In Settings \u003e Camera, you’ll find a new toggle for a light press on the Camera Control button to lock exposure and focus. Find My share item location: Find My will let you share the location of an AirTag (or other Find My compatible item) with a trusted person.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
