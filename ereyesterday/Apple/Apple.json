Specifically, the images we received feature an entirely new interface for the Snooze feature already present on iPhone — something that pops up whenever users have active alarms.Though the imagery contains a unique interpretation and a novel design for the alarm system on iOS, there are numerous questions about its authenticity, stemming from visual shortcomings, grammatical errors, and even inconsistencies with Apple's existing designs. Though the leak is most likely not real, it's important to understand exactly why we arrived at this rumor score.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Macworld Fresh off the fix of a zero-day vulnerability in iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other devices, security researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have revealed a pair of vulnerabilities that affect all of Apple’s modern devices. First reported at BleepingComputer, these are side-channel attacks that can use special code on websites to allow websites to execute “side-channel” attacks that steal data from other web sessions. A malicious site could, for example, see your location data from a Google Maps tab, or unencrypted email from an open browser tab that is logged in to your secure email account. Banking info, login info, purchase history—there are lots of potential targets. Most modern browsers “sandbox” web sessions, so that one browser tab or window can’t access the data from other tabs/windows. The SLAP and FLOP vulnerabilities exploit features of the latest Apple processors to get around this sandboxing. What is SLAP? The M2 and A15 generation of processors (and later) have a feature called Load Address Prediction (LAP), which it tries to predict the memory address of the next memory request in order to prefetch it and speed things up. SLAP (Speculation Attacks via Load Address Prediction) first falsely “trains” that predictive algorithm and then uses that the pull targeted data from other browser processes. SLAP seems to work only in Safari. What is FLOP? Starting with the M3/A17 generation of processors, Apple goes a step further than loading data from predicted memory addresses. They have a feature called Load Value Predictor (LVP), which guesses what the value will be from a memory request. It’s all to help the processor run faster by not having to wait around for data to come from memory. FLOP (False Load Output Predictions) issues instructions that return the same values all the time to “trick” the predictor into expecting a certain value even when the data has changed, and that lets them execute code on “incorrect” data values. FLOP works in Safari and Chrome. Which Apple devices are affected? The researchers say the following Apple devices have the hardware necessary to execute these flaws. All Mac laptops from 2022-present (MacBook Air, MacBook Pro) All Mac desktops from 2023-present (Mac Mini, iMac, Mac Studio, Mac Pro) All iPad Pro, Air, and Mini models from September 2021-present (6th- and 7th-gen iPad Pro, 6th-gen iPad Air, 6th-gen iPad Mini) All iPhones from September 2021-present (iPhone 13, 14, 15, and 16 models, 3rd-gen iPhone SE) Should I be worried? The Georgia Institute of Technology researchers say there is no evidence that either SLAP or FLOP has been used in the wild. Similarly, Apple told BleepingComputer, “Based on our analysis, we do not believe this issue poses an immediate risk to our users.” Is Apple fixing these flaws? Yes, but it appears to be taking some time. The researchers disclosed SLAP to Apple on May 24, 2024, and FLOP on September 3, 2024. Apple has released numerous updates since that time without fixing the issue here. You can read more about these exploits and see test demonstrations of them in action at the SLAP and FLOP site set up by the Georgia Institute of Technology researchers.",

    "title": "How to view your body temperature on Apple Watch",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2228152/how-to-view-body-temperature-apple-watch.html",
    "description": "Macworld Recent models of Apple Watch–the Series 8 and later, to be precise–are equipped with a temperature sensor. That might sound useful for a variety of health purposes, but in practice, there are limitations. One of which is that you can’t simply ask your Apple Watch to measure your body temperature right now. Let’s see what’s going on. If you open the Health app on your iPhone and tap Browse \u003e Body Measurements you’ll notice that wrist temperature trends are given in terms of variance “from baseline.” In the screenshot below, for example, it’s “-0.3°C from baseline.” Very interesting, but what if you want to know the absolute temperature rather than how much higher or lower it is than a standard/average reading? David Price / Foundry Fortunately, that information is available, and it’s relatively easy to find—you just need to slog through a few menus. Scroll down on the Wrist Temperature screen shown above to find a section headed Options. Tap on the option labelled Show All Data, and you’ll see a long list of the dates and times when the watch measured your temperature. Tap one of these and you’ll see an absolute temperature reading: in this case, for January 11, 2025, the reading is 36.37°C (97.47°F). David Price / Foundry Alternatively, you can look on the Apple Watch itself. Open Settings and scroll down until you start to see an alphabetically ordered list of apps (probably starting with Activity and App Store). Find Health in this list and tap it. Now tap Health Data \u003e Body Measurements \u003e Wrist Temperature. You’ll see a list of recorded temperatures, beginning with the most recent. In the screenshot below you can see that the absolute temperature the last time I took a reading was, once again, 36.37°C. David Price / Foundry Why can’t I just take my temperature right now? There are some more limitations that it might be worth mentioning. The Apple Watch’s temperature sensor isn’t the equivalent of a digital thermometer, something you can use to take a spot check at any moment. Instead, it takes your temperature at a time of its choosing while you’re asleep. So when we look up the data using the method above, it still isn’t possible to determine your temperature right now. Whatever information you find is likely to be at least a few hours out of date. What’s more, the Apple Watch is quite particular about having a big enough sample size. It won’t be sufficient to put the watch on for tonight’s sleep and then eagerly demand the data tomorrow morning; instead, you need to be wearing the Apple Watch for a few weeks in a row before the results start to appear. If you were wondering why the first screenshot in this article shows trends across the first half of 2024, when my Apple Watch has a reading from January 2025, it’s because that one-off reading isn’t enough for the Apple Watch’s satisfaction. If I try to scroll the graph to the right, it says Needs More Data. David Price / Foundry The Apple Watch’s wrist temperature sensor is designed to monitor long-term trends rather than single moments in time. But it’s possible that Apple may allow the watch to show temperature readings in the future. Fingers crossed.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
