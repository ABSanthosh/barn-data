    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

In this guide, we will help you decide which Apple Watch is best for you. We’ll compare the features, specs and price as well as offer advice on choosing cases, colors, and straps in our Apple Watch comparison chart so you can be confident you are choosing the right Apple Watch.  Here’s what you need to know before buying an Apple Watch.  What can an Apple Watch do? Practically every Apple Watch ever made has offered the same set of basic functions. Apple Watch can be used in conjunction with an iPhone (or separately if the user has a cellular contract) to:  Make or take phone calls  Read and send text messages Read and send emails Listen to music or podcasts Receive notifications relating to iPhone and Apple Watch apps  Use apps, such as Maps for navigation, a calculator or a compass Track fitness, including steps and calories burned Monitor your health, including heart rate Detect a fall or car crash Tell the time – especially if your watch has an always-on display (they don’t all offer that) Act as a flashlight (or torch)  Pay via Apple Pay  Track your sleep  The Apple Watch doesn’t need an iPhone to work, but it helps, and it is needed for initial setup. See: Does an Apple Watch work without an iPhone? There’s another choice to be made. Do you need an Apple Watch with cellular connectivity or not?  We examine GPS versus cellular in a separate article, read: Should I buy a cellular Apple Watch. Also read: You probably don’t need an LTE Apple Watch. If you choose a cellular version of the Apple Watch you’ll be able to leave your iPhone at home and use your Watch for making calls, receiving texts, and streaming music. Apple Watch can also support Family Setup if you are looking for a Watch for someone who doesn’t have an iPhone.

Generally, each Apple Watch offers a few more features than the one that came before it. Below we will run through the features available on each Apple Watch so you can see what you are getting for your money.   Apple isn’t the only place where you can buy an Apple Watch, and if you shop around you can still buy older models that Apple doesn’t sell. To get the best deal on an Apple Watch take note of the best prices shown below, you might also like to look at our roundup of the Best Apple Watch Deals.

In 2024 there was a minor update to the color options on offer. The Apple Watch Ultra is the ultimate Apple Watch. It’s designed for athletes and adventure, so it isn’t a watch for everyone, but it goes beyond the standard Apple Watch with features for divers (depth gauge, water temperature sensor, water resistance to 100 meters) and features for hikers such as precision dual-frequency GPS. The Apple Watch Ultra is constructed from tougher materials: a titanium case and a sapphire crystal cover for the screen. However, the Apple Watch Series 10 shares now offers a Titanium option, depth gauge and water temperature sensor, so the difference isn’t as great as it was between the Series 9 and the Ultra. But there are still a lot of superior features offered by the Ultra. The Ultra’s battery life is better than the standard Apple Watch series at 36 hours for the Ultra and 18 hours for the Series 10 (and the Series 9 and 8 before it). You can eke out even more battery life in the Ultra too, up to 72 hours in Low Power Mode (Low Power Mode on the Apple Watch 8 to 10 models results in 36 hours of battery life).  The second-gen Apple Watch Ultra features the S9 chip. The S9 is superior to the S8 in the original Apple Watch Ultra, with 60% more transistors, a four-core Neural Engine that is twice as fast than the S8, and 30 percent faster graphics. The newer Apple Watch Series 10 has the S10 chip, but there is very little difference between the S10 and S9. The original Ultra has the Action Button, to make controlling the Watch a bit easier, but the second-gen model goes a step further. Thanks to the Double-Tap gesture (also in the Apple Watch 9 and 10) you won’t have to touch the screen to control the Watch, useful if your other hand isn’t free. Just tap your thumb and index finger together and the gesture is recognized by the watch (via sensors and algorithms) so that the primary action of whatever app is showing will be triggered. You will also be able to use on-device Siri to do – like ask Siri to open Watch apps or check or input data.  Read our full Apple Watch Ultra 2 review Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm) Pros Bigger, easier-to-read display Faster charging Refined design Cons Still only 18 hours battery life Blood Oxygen unavailable in the U.S. Price When Reviewed: $399 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $299 View Deal $299 View Deal $399 View Deal $399 View Deal $399 View Deal $399 View Deal $399.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket The Series 10 is a modest set of improvements over the Apple Watch Series 9. Notably, the watch is now a tiny bit thinner and larger, just enough to make the display fractionally bigger (42mm up from 41mm or 46mm up from 45mm) and slightly easier to read (it’s got wider viewing angles, too). Performance hasn’t changed and neither has battery life, still rated at 18 hours, but there’s a new water temperature sensor and the ability to sense depth up to 6 meters. The premium model is now encased in titanium instead of Stainless Steel, which results in a big weight reduction. The titanium Series 10 is barely heavier than the aluminium model, while the stainless steel Series 9 was a lot heavier. The Series 10 charges faster, too. It will go from 0-80% in 30 minutes instead of 45 minutes, which is enough of a change to make a real difference. If you have a Series 8 or Series 9 this isn’t an upgrade you need, but it’s probably the best Apple Watch to get if it’s your first one or you’re coming from a much older model, unless you live the sort of life of adventure that necessitates the Apple Watch Ultra 2.

The 2022 Apple Watch SE introduced new features and component improvements compared to the original. Like the Series 8 and subsequent Watches, it offers Crash Detection and an improved Compass app. The heart sensor in the SE (old and new) is second-generation, while the Series 7 and above offer a third-generation heart sensor. The SE also lacks the body temperature sensor for cycle monitoring. You also don’t get Blood Oxygen monitoring or the ability to perform an ECG. The SE comes in two sizes, but the screen is slightly smaller than the screen on the Series 10 and older at 44mm and 40mm, rather than 46mm and 42mm. This means the screen is a little bit more cramped, especially when compared to the Ultra’s 49mm screen. Speaking of the screen, the SE doesn’t offer an always-on display like the other watches, so if that is likely to be a point of frustration for you it’s a good reason to upgrade. Battery life is the same 18 hours as the Series 10. Read our full Apple Watch SE (2nd generation, 40mm) review How the new Apple watches compare  That’s an overview, but in a little more detail here’s how the features of each Apple Watch compare.  Dimensions The Apple Watch Ultra is the biggest Apple Watch sold by Apple. To accommodate the 49mm screen the watch measures 49mm by 44mm by 14.4mm. It weighs from 61.4 grams depending on the color chosen. The Apple Watch Ultra is big and heavy. If you have slim wrists you might prefer a smaller case, in which case Apple offers the option of a large and smaller variant of each watch with the Apple Watch Series 10 and SE. With the Ultra only one size is available. The Apple Watch Series 10 offers either a 46mm or 42mm screen. To accommodate the 46mm screen the watch measures 46mm by 39mm by 9.7mm. It weighs from 36.4 grams for the aluminium option, 41.7 grams for titanium. For the 42mm screen the watch measures 42mm by 36mm by 9.7mm. It weighs from 30 grams for the aluminium option, 34.4 grams for titanium. The Apple Watch SE (2) offers either a 44mm or 40 screen. To accommodate the 44mm screen the watch measures 44mm by 38mm by 10.7mm. It weighs from 32.9 grams. For the 40mm screen the watch measures 40mm by 34mm by 10.7mm. It weighs from 26.4 grams. Display The bigger the watch the bigger the screen, of course. Or at least that’s what you might think. In fact, the display area of the 46mm Apple Watch Series 10 is fractionally bigger than the 49mm Apple Watch Ultra 2. Here’s how those two compare: Apple Watch Ultra 2: 410×502 pixels, 1,185 sq mm display area, 3,000 nits brightness Apple Watch Series 10 (46mm): 416×496 pixels, 1,220 sq mm display area, 2,000 nits brightness Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm): 374×446 pixels, 989 sq mm display area, 2,000 nits brightness Apple Watch SE (44mm): 368×448 pixels, 977 sq mm display area, 1,000 nits brightness Apple Watch SE (40mm): 324×394 pixels, 759 sq mm display area, 1,000 nits brightness It’s not just size that matters with the screens though. The 3,000 nits brightness on the Ultra means it should be easier to read in particularly bright light, for example, when skiing. This beats the Series 10, which offers 2,000 nits, as did the Series 9, but the Series 10 also offers wide-angled OLED screen which helps when viewing the screen at an angle. The SE offers 1,000 nits brightness. A bigger screen means you can see more text.Apple Both the Apple Watch Ultra and the Apple Watch Series 10 offer an Always-On display – so you can always see the time without having to wake it. This is a feature that was also shared by the Apple Watch Series 5 and later. The Apple Watch SE doesn’t offer an Always-On display.  Design  There may be three variants of the Apple Watch, but there are a number of combinations that mean that there are more design differences than you might expect.  As we explained above, there are five sizes to choose from if you consider all models: 49mm, 46mm, 44mm, 42mm and 40mm.  In addition to the sizes, Apple uses two different materials for the cases: aluminum for the Watch SE; aluminum or titanium for the Series 10; and titanium for the Ultra 2. For each case there is a choice of colors:  Aluminium comes in midnight, starlight, rose gold, and silver. Titanium is available in gold or natural on the Series 10, or natural and black on Ultra 2. As well as a choice of case color, you also have a vast choice of straps or bands to go with the Apple Watch, some are only compatible with certain Watch sizes. See: Do Apple Watch straps fit all models? Some add a considerable expense to the cost of the Apple Watch.  The Apple Watch Ultra has a choice of three straps designed to be rugged and suitable for extreme sports enthusiasts, these new straps can be used with the larger Apple Watches as well. Take a look at all the watch straps on offer on Apple’s site. We discuss the best Apple Watch straps and Apple Watch straps: how to find the perfect size separately. Durability  Various elements of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 design help it withstand altitudes, high temperatures, low temperatures, immersion, freeze/thaw, shock, and vibration. So if you want a watch that can be worn at a depth of 40 meters (it’s certified for scuba diving) the Ultra 2 will be the one for you. Also making the Ultra a little better able to withstand knocks is a sapphire front crystal display, around which raised edges of the case provide protection. The Apple Watch Series 10 also features strong sapphire glass with the TItanium models (and the 9 and 8 did on the Stainless Steel models). There’s Ion-X screen glass on the aluminium models.  The Apple Watch Ultra can be used by divers Apple All three watches are “Swimproof” according to Apple, but they are not equal in this respect. The Apple Watch 10 and SE have a water resistance rating of 100 meters and Apple suggests that they can be used for shallow-water activities like swimming in a pool or ocean. The Apple Watch Ultra has a water resistance rating of 50 meters and includes a Depth gauge and water temperature sensor. With these feature it’s no surprise that Apple states that the Ultra can be used for recreational scuba diving, however Apple adds that “Apple Watch Ultra should not be used for diving below 40 meters” and also points out that “water resistance can diminish over time”. The Ultra offers the same IP6X dust resistance as the Series 10. The SE does’t offer this certification. Health and Safety features  All the Apple Watches offer Car Crash detection, a feature that arrived in 2022. Apple Cycle Tracking: Just like the Series 10, the Ultra offers temperature sensing for Cycle Tracking, which was a new feature introduced with the 2022 Watches that should help women trying to get pregnant identify when they have ovulated. Blood Oxygen: You’ll also find the Blood Oxygen app (which arrived with the Series 6) in the Ultra and Series 10 Watches. Measuring blood oxygen can alert the wearer to any reduction of oxygen in their bloodstream and can help with management of conditions like asthma. This isn’t available in the SE. Due to a patent battle, this feature is disabled in Apple Watches sold and used in the United States, though it may return via a software update in the future. ECG: The Apple Watch 10 and Ultra offer the ECG app (introduced with the Series 4). The 2022 SE can’t perform an ECG (electrocardiogram), but it can notify you of high and low heart rate and irregular heart rhythm, as can the other Watches.  Crash Detection: In 2022 Apple Watches gained the ability to detect a car crash. This feature means that if you are in a severe car crash while wearing any Apple Watch from 2022 or above, the Watch will detect the impact and dial emergency services if you are unresponsive (you’ll get a 10-second warning).  Fall Detection: Another safety features that is shared by all the Apple Watches is Fall Detection (the feature arrived with the Apple Watch Series 4). If the watch identifies that you have fallen it will sound an alarm and display an alert so you can confirm if you are ok. If you aren’t ok the watch can call the emergency services. If you don’t have a cellular plan for your Apple Watch you will need your connected iPhone to be nearby for the call to be placed.  Siren: This safety feature is unique to the Ultra (1 and 2). That model can play a 86-decibel siren that is audible up to 600 feet (182 meters), handy if you get lost on a mountain. Compass \u0026 Backtrack: Speaking of mountaineering, the new 2022 Watches gained an improved Compass app with and Backtrack feature that should help you avoid getting lost. The Apple Watch Ultra 9 and 2) could be better at this job though because it features a new dual-frequency GPS that should make it better at positioning you because it won’t be affected by tall trees and buildings. If you are frustrated that your Watch can’t pinpoint your exact location when you are trying to use it for directions amid tall buildings this is a feature for you.  Sleep Tracking: The Apple Watches can also track your sleep and wake you up. Since watchOS 8 the Apple Watch has been able to track your breathing rate, notifying you of possible health issues. The Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 2 offer Sleep apnoea notifications. Specs  Chip: The 2023 Apple Watch Ultra 2 has the S9 chip and the Series 10 has the S10 chip, but they appear to be identical in performance. The S8 chip in the SE (as well as in 2022’s Series 8 Apple Watch and the original Ultra) didn’t offer a significant power boost over the S7, which itself wasn’t a lot better than the S6. While the S6 delivered just a 20 percent boost in performance over the Series 5, which launched in 2019. GPS: Both the Apple Watch Series 10 and SE have L1 GPS, while the Apple Watch Ultra (1 and 2) offer Precision dual-frequency (L1 and L5) GPS. L1 GPS is the standard GPS, but it can be blocked by tall buildings and other obstacles. L5 GPS is more advanced and should cope better with buildings blocking the satellite signal.  U2: The Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 2 both offer an upgraded ultra-wideband chip that will improve their ability to track the location of an object, such as the iPhone 15. This improves on the U1 chip in the Series 8 and Ultra 1. Note the Apple Watch SE is the only Apple Watch that doesn’t even include the U1 chip. Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi connectivity is better in the Series 10 and Ultra: the SE offers only 2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n. I Cellular: If you have a cellular contract, the Apple Watch 8, 9, 10 and Ultra models offer 5GHz Wi-Fi, but the SE only 4G LTE. Double Tap on Apple Watch Ultra 2, Apple Watch 9 and 10 makes engaging with the Watch easier.Apple Battery life  The Apple Watch Ultra 2 offers 36 hour battery life (as did the original Ultra). This is much more than the other Watches’ 18 hours. The Series 10 offers faster charging (0-80% in 30 minutes), an improvement over prior models’ fast charging (0-80% in 45 minutes). That 36-hour figure for the Ultra can be even higher though if you use the Low Power Mode you should be able to get up to 72 hours, according to Apple. This same Low Power Mode brings the Watch 10 battery life to 36 hours. That’s battery life measured in typical use, but athletes and other users might not be quite so typical. Apple says that there’ll be enough battery power to get users through a triathlon (that’s a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and a marathon of 26.2 miles). The problem for other Apple Watch users is that the battery would probably run down if you were tracking such extensive exercise.  Check out our roundup of the best Apple Watch chargers and docks. Which Apple Watch to buy  As you can see from the above, it’s not a simple case of being able to say a particular Apple Watch is the winner. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 clearly has the best features and if you are off up a mountain, diving in the ocean, or heading out for a marathon, then the Ultra is the way to go. But it’s big, perhaps too big, and it has a big price attached to it.  The Apple Watch Series 10 offers some enticing new features, and is probably the best choice for most users that don’t have specific need of the rugged outdoor qualities of the Ultra. The Apple Watch SE is Apple’s cheapest Apple Watch, starting at $249/£219, which will be a big point in its favor, but it’s not the cheapest Apple Watch ever sold. Apple used to sell the Apple Watch Series 3 for just $199/£179 for the 38mm version. The 2022 SE is cheaper than the 2020 generation though, which started at $279/£269. Along with a lower price, the SE also offers features such as Car Crash detection, but it lacks some of the health-related features that people are looking for.  It’s the health-related features that will probably stand out as the main differentiator between the SE and the Series 10, and this hasn’t changed from the previous generation. If the ability to check blood oxygen, take an ECG, and temperature monitoring, are important to you then it has to be the Series 10. If those aren’t something that you think you need then the SE will be quite sufficient.  If you are after a bargain though, we recommend that you look for a deal on an older Apple Watch. We often see the Apple Watch Series 9 on sale and we think it’s just as good as the 10, unless you really wanted a slightly bigger display.

The update makes it a little easier than before to decide whether you get the standard AirPods or step up to the AirPods Pro 2.

The AirPods 4 do not use ear tips and sit at the opening of the ear canal.Foundry The AirPods 4 do not have ear tips. They sit at the opening of the ear canal. This design leave a little bit of space between the earbuds and the ear canal. Apple says the AirPods 4 “provide a natural and secure fit for more people than ever.” The AirPods 4 and the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation have the exact same design; the differences are with internal features. The AirPods Pro do have ear tips, which are extensions of the earbud that fit into the opening of the ear canal. This design creates a seal for the ear canal that muffles outside sound. Both the AirPods 4 and the AirPods Pro feature a shorter stem length than the original AirPods. Also, both are available only in white. The AirPods 4 has a narrower case than the AirPods Pro 2. The AirPods Pro 2 uses ear tips that fit in the outer part of the ear canal.Hadrian / Shutterstock.com AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 noise cancelling This is the main audio feature between the three models.

The AirPods Pro 2’s ear tips and how they reduce outside sound, however, does affect the quality–the AirPods Pro 2 sounds “purer” than the AirPods 4. AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 controls and features Both AirPods 4 models have stems with force touch sensors, which allow you to use a pinch to control audio playback and phone calls. The AirPods Pro 2 has the same force touch sensors, but the stems also allow for swipe motions to control volume, and you can hold the stems to switch listening modes.

This will be coming as a free firmware update by the end of 2024; if you already own AirPods 2, you don’t need to buy anything. The Hearing Air is not available for the AirPods 4. AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 battery life The AirPods 4 earbuds last five hours on a full charge. The case stores 30 hours of charge. The AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation’s battery life is affected by the ANC feature: With ANC on all the time, Apple states a four-hour battery life for the earbuds, and 20 hours of available charge in the case.  With ANC off all the time, Apple states a five-hour battery life for the earbuds, and 30 hours of available charge in the case. If you switch between ANC on and off, battery life is adversely affected when it’s on and your get an earbud battery life between four and five hours. AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 wireless charging The AirPods 4 does not have wireless charging. It charges through USB-C. The AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation supports wireless and USB-C charging. It works with the Apple Watch and Qi chargers. It doesn’t support MagSafe, but a MagSafe charger will work if you place the case in the dead center of the charger and balance it. It doesn’t make a magnetic connection to stay in place. The AirPods Pro 2 supports wireless and USB-C charging. It works with the Apple Watch and Qi chargers, and it does support MagSafe. The AirPods Pro 2 case has a loop for attaching a lanyard.Lewis Painter / Foundry Which one should you buy? While there are a lot of similarities between the AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and AirPods Pro 2, there are a few factors to consider. The obvious decision to make is whether you want Active Noise Cancellation. If not, your only choice is the AirPods 4. If you do want it, then you need to choose between the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation and the AirPods Pro 2. (You can always turn off ANC if you don’t want to use it.) If you do want Active Noise Cancellation, decide whether you want ear tips or not. If you think ear tips are uncomfortable or don’t like the effect they have on sound, then the AirPods 4 with ANC are for you. If you’re fine with ear tips or want to maximize the effect of ANC, then the AirPods Pro 2 are your pick. Maybe, instead you’re most concerned with fit and you’re fine with either ear tips or no ear tips. The AirPods Pro 2’s ear tips help secure the ear buds in your ear. Apple says the AirPods 4 fit better than ever, but they still sit at the opening of your ear canal and are not as secure as the AirPods Pro 2. The only way to insure a proper fit is to try them on before a purchase. If you absolutely want ear tips, your only choice is the AirPods Pro 2. (We highly recommend the aftermarket Comply Foam Tips for AirPods Pro users, which improve fit and comfort over the tips Apple includes.) If you have ruled out the AirPods Pro 2 and are deciding between the two AirPods 4 models, the major difference (beside ANC, which you don’t have to use) is the charging case. The AirPods 4 with ANC’s case supports wireless charging and has a Find My speaker for alerts. Ask yourself, is the extra $50/£50 worth ANC, wireless charging, and Find My alerts? If you want to use the AirPods as a hearing aid, the AirPods Pro 2 is your choice. One last consideration is price. The prices in this article are Apple’s list prices; you can often find price reductions at third-party retailers such as Amazon. In fact, the AirPods Pro 2 are often on sale for $190/£190, just $10/£10 more than the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation. If you are okay with ear tips, then the AirPods Pro 2 can be had at a good price.",

This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00.
