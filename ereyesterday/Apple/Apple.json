    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2835386/iphone-17-skip-design-camera-folding-processor-dynamic-island.html",
    "description": "Macworld Once upon a time, Apple used to make significant changes to the iPhone every two years. A new model (iPhone 4, 5, 6, etc) would launch with an overhauled look, followed by an S variant that boosted performance and smoothed out any imperfections.  That’s no longer the case. Primarily due to the iPhone’s maturity, iterative annual upgrades have become the norm. After all, there’s only so much it can improve year over year. And despite what you may have read about this year’s phones, the new lineup is looking to be more of the same, even with the introduction of a new Air model.  That’s why if you’re planning to get a new iPhone, you may want to wait for next year’s iPhone 18 series. Unlike the iPhone 17, 2026’s lineup is set to bring some of the biggest design and functionality upgrades in years, which could make the iPhone 17 feel decidedly ho-hum. Something in the Air In September, Apple will reportedly launch the iPhone 17 Air—an ultra-slim handset with a whole new form factor. Exciting, right? Maybe not. First-generation devices are often riddled with flaws, and a year later, the iPhone 18 Air will almost certainly address any issues with a refined and polished design. Beyond that, there seem to be few compelling reasons to opt for an iPhone 17 Air. The sleek device will likely have a mediocre battery life, a single rear camera, fewer speakers, and other compromises for a premium price tag. With most people popping their phone into a case anyway, will a super-slim iPhone really be worth it? Now that the EU has confirmed that Apple is permitted to release portless smartphones, the iPhone 18 Air could potentially take advantage of that. The end result would be a lighter, incredibly thin iPhone that, unlike the 17 Air, may justify the shortcomings and expense.  The iPhone 17 Air might be super-thin, but that’s nothing compared to a folding model.Foundry Above the fold We’ve been hearing about a folding iPhone for years, but it finally seems like it’s coming. But not this year. In 2026, Apple is expected to debut its first foldable smartphone (enter the iPhone 6 Plus joke here), rivaling Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold and changing the iPhone as we know it. The 5.5-inch device is rumored to pack a 7.8-inch inner display, mimicking an iPad mini when opened. It would easily be the most dramatic and exciting iPhone change since the iPhone X in 2017, and many Apple fans are going to want to jump on board as early adopters. Lens flair Even if you’re skipping the iPhone 17 Air and its single camera, the iPhone 17 Pro isn’t looking to deliver much in the way of meaningful camera upgrades, other than a 24MP front-facing sensor and a 48MP telephoto lens. However, a more substantial camera boost could arrive next year. At least one iPhone 18 model (presumably the Pro Max) will boast a variable aperture lens—a perk long limited to high-end professional cameras. If true, iPhone users will get to mechanically control how much light reaches the sensor for the first time. This could elevate portrait shots by improving the applied depth of field effect, as well as minimizing overexposure. Most smartphone users don’t rely on a dedicated DSLR or mirrorless camera for capturing their everyday moments. Porting a variable aperture lens to the iPhone could dramatically enhance the photo-taking experience. The iPhone 17 Pro’s camera will be very good, but the real big changes are rumored to be coming next year.Foundry A cut above Apple introduced the Dynamic Island with the iPhone 14 Pro, and it’s quickly become one of the handset’s best features, with quick access to timers, scores, background tasks, and so on. But when it’s not in use, it’s still somewhat unsightly—and that’s not expected to change this year.  Next year, however, Apple will reportedly switch to under-display Face ID sensors, which will likely shrink the Dynamic Island noticeably. The conflicting reports make it hard to predict whether the iPhone 18 Pro will feature a smaller Dynamic Island or a hole-punch design, but it’s safe to assume it’ll look more futuristic and bring the iPhone a step closer to the flawless, glass slab vision coming in 2030. Chip shift For many casual users, Apple’s annual chip upgrades aren’t all that important. iPhones from years ago still run fluidly and perform in a lag-free manner, and a slightly faster processor won’t really impact the daily experience meaningfully. However, there may be a bigger boost with the iPhone 18 models. In 2026, Apple is expected to unveil the A20, switching from a 3nm to a 2nm manufacturing process. As a result, the iPhone 18 Pro models could be significantly more capable and power-efficient. But that’s not all—the iPhone 18 lineup is also expected to adopt the second generation of Apple’s in-house 5G modem. Unlike the C1 predecessor included with the iPhone 16e, the C2 chip could support mmWave connectivity and bring other enhancements to the table.  With the iPhone 17 line likely sticking to Qualcomm’s hungrier modem and 3nm A19 processor, it’s safe to assume the iPhone 18 will have a superior battery life. Next year’s iPhone lineup will likely have Apple’s second-generation modem.Foundry Iteration now, innovation later In just 12 months, Apple’s iPhone 18 series will likely offer some of the most distinct changes in ages. We’re rumored to be getting an all-new folding form factor that caters to multitaskers, along with a potentially improved Air model as well as other significant enhancements. Meanwhile, what will the iPhone 17 bring? A thin body? A tweaked rear camera bump and a price hike? We think you’ll be better off buying a discounted iPhone 16 and waiting till 2026 to get something really new.",
