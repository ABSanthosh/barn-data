    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Macworld Hey, it’s Friday! If you have plans to, I dunno, maybe hang out at the bar (or pub, for the UKers) or something like that with a bunch of PC-loving friends, well, ya’ll will have something to talk about tonight. Microsoft fired a salvo at Apple in the form of a video short that claims that “top Copilot+ PCs” are faster than the beloved MacBook Air. You can waste 12 seconds of your life watching it below. (I’ll give you a moment to wipe the spit take from your screen. Sorry about that, I should’ve warned you.) Cheesy production aside (“Was this comically low budget ad made with Windows Movie Maker 2 and a 5 MP camera from 2003?” commented @ItsRichieT), the major sticking point about this ad is that it makes comparisons to the M3 MacBook Air–you know, the laptop that was released in 2024 and replaced earlier this year by the M4 MacBook Air. So the M3 Air isn’t in Apple’s active product lineup. Granted, you can buy the M3 MacBook Air from third-party retailers and at Apple’s Certified Refurbished store. But it doesn’t look good when a company compares “top” products to competitors that aren’t being made anymore and have been replaced by something better. The thing is, Microsoft also claims the “top Copilot+ PCs” are faster than the M4 MacBook Air–it’s right on their website. But the results are nothing like the “up to 58 percent” touted in the ad. Microsoft says it recorded a Cinebench 2024 Multi-Core score of 866 for the M4 Air, and that eight Copilot+ PCs “all scored higher.” So, let me take the opportunity to do what Microsoft didn’t want to show you: how much faster those eight Copilot+ PCs are than the M4 MacBook Air (the Cinebench 2024 Multi-Core score is in parentheses). ASUS Vivobook S 14 with AMD Ryzen AI 9 365: 5.3 percent (912) Dell XPS 13 9345 with Snapdragon X Elite: 8.9 percent (943.3) HP OmniBook Ultra 14 with AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 375: 11.4 percent (965) Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x 14″ with Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite: 18.9 percent (1029.6) Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x 14″ with Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite 19.4 percent (1033.6) Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 with AMD Ryzen AI 9 365: 17.9 percent (1021.3) Microsoft Surface Laptop 15″ with Snapdragon X Elite: 9.7 percent (950) Microsoft Surface Laptop 13.8″ with Snapdragon X Elite: 2.7 percent (889.6) The Lenovo devices are the fastest of the bunch (I don’t know why the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x 14″ is tested twice; drop me a line if you can fill me in), but those improvements aren’t big enough to make an impression. Imagine that video, but instead it says, “Top Copilot+ PCs are up to 19.4 percent faster than a MacBook Air with M4.” That will just get you stupid looks from the Microsoft marketing department. Heck, we here at Macworld see 15 to 25 percent improvement from one M-series chip to another, and our reaction to that is lukewarm. You can imagine what we think about a Copilot+ PCs offering a less than 20 percent boost over the M4 MacBook Air: Pfft. As for all the other PCs? You won’t notice the difference at all. We ran the same Cinebench 2024 test and got a score of 797 for the M4 MacBook Air, so clearly, results may vary. To sum up, for your PC-lovin’ buddies who want to bring up this ad over a few pints: Your “top Copilot+ PCs” are “up to 58 percent” faster than a discontinued MacBook Air? Cool! The “top Copilot+ PCs” faster than the M4 MacBook Air? That may be true, but no one can notice the difference in real-world usage. But hey, nice of you to catch up! The 12-second ad? Just another example of a corporation trying to relate to the young folks. And if they still won’t listen, just remember that they have to use Windows.",

    "description": "Macworld Sure, we love Apple’s Magic Mouse, but despite its alluring design, it’s probably not the one we’d recommend buying. However, this Corsair M75 Air mouse is far more suitable for most users, and it’s only $40 right now, a savings of $90 off what Apple charges for the same mouse (although that model has RGB lighting and is slightly heavier). This wireless mouse brings clean lines and a classic design that’s comfortable to use for long hours. Equipped with a 26K DPI optical sensor, this Corsair mouse is highly sensitive, so the smallest of movements you make will translate well on the screen. The mouse also boasts 650 IPS tracking and up to 50G acceleration. The mouse is also super light, so you won’t feel like you’re lifting weights just moving this thing around. Your wrist will thank you because this mouse only weighs 60 grams. Our friends over at PCWorld reviewed the Corsair M75 Air, giving it a 4-star rating, their Editors’ Choice award, and said the model is “like the peregrine falcon of the gaming mouse world; streamlined, and with just the right amount of weight, it moves across your mouse mat with a smoothness and glide that you’d be hard pressed finding in any competitors.” At this point, the fact that you can get it for $40 seems like the cherry on top, so order your very own Corsair M75 Air sooner rather than later because you can never know how long the deal will last. Buy now at Amazon",

That’s because Apple charges an insane $800 for the upgrade, turning the budget $600 computer into a $1400 one. In other words, you can purchase two base model Mac minis for less than the price of a single Mac mini with a 2TB upgrade. But fret not, because Expand Mac mini offers a 2TB upgrade for the M4 Mac mini for just $320 – less than half of what Apple charges.

    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
