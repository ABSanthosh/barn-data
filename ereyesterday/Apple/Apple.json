    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",

These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order.

All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.

Amazon U.S. is currently offering a few deals on the Apple Studio Display. You can save $150 or $300 dollars, which is significant when you consider that these displays almost never go on sale. Here are links to the deals: U.S.: Amazon, Apple Studio Display (Tilt-Adjustable): $1,299 ($300 off, MSRP $1,599) ​​​​​​​In the U.K. Currys, Apple Studio Display 27-inch 5K Standard Glass: £1,469 (£30 off) Retailer Price $1,299.99 View Deal $1499 View Deal $1599 View Deal $1599 View Deal $1599 View Deal $1599.99 View Deal $1649 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket What else will I need to buy? Potentially, nothing. The Studio Display has three USB-C ports in the back and one Thunderbolt, so it can easily be connected to your existing accessories. While you will find Apple’s A13 Bionic chip under the hood of the Studio Display, this is mainly used for the audio and video features. There’s also no RAM, storage or operating system built-in, even if it’s designed to work with macOS. You can technically use the display with any PC or laptop. What are the glass options? The front of the Studio Display is covered in glass, and Apple offers two kinds: Standard and Nano-texture. The Nano-texture glass is a lot less reflective than the Standard glass. If you’re sensitive to glare, or you do production work where lighting is critical, opt for the Nano-texture–but this option adds to the price of the display. What are the stand options? Apple offers three types of stands for the Studio Display: Tilt-adjustable stand: Allows for only the adjustment of the display’s tilt. This comes standard with the Studio Display. Tilt- and height-adjustable stand: Can adjust the tilt and height. This stand costs extra. VESA mount adapter: Used to attach to a VESA-compatible arm, wall mount, or stand. Comes at no additional cost. Deals for the best monitors and displays for Mac These displays and monitors are featured in our test of the best monitors for Mac.

    "description": "Macworld Apple last updated the Mac Studio in June 2023. The Mac Studio comes with either a M2 Max or M2 Ultra chip. In our review of the M2 Max Mac Studio we were impressed by its processing power, port flexibility, and design. There are some deals on the M2-generation Mac Studio in the U.K., but in the U.S. the only place to save money on a Mac Studio is at Apple’s Refurbished Store. If you want to buy a Mac Studio, and get the best deal possible, you’ve come to the right place. We’re looking at where you can buy the Mac Studio at the best price. Best Mac Studio deals There are no deals on new Mac Studio models in the U.S. right now, but there are discounts in the U.K.: AO, Mac Studio M2 Max: £1,903 (£196 off, MSRP £2,099) The best way to save money on a Mac Studio is to buy one from the Apple Refurbished Store. Save up to $600 on a refurbished Mac Studio at Apple Refurbished Store in the U.S. Save up to £630 on a refurbished Mac Studio at Apple Refurbished Store in the U.K. What you need to know In March 2022 Apple introduced its most powerful Mac yet, and then, in June 2023 it updated it with M2 Max and M2 Ultra chips. At the same time, Apple also introduced an Mac Pro with the same specs (the M2 Max and M2 Ultra), but that model has some other features the Mac Studio lacks and a higher price. The Mac Studio can be configured with a M2 Max chip, as seen in the 14in and 16in MacBook Pro, or you can choose an M2 Ultra, which is essentially two M2 Max chips. Read about how the M2 Pro Mac mini compares to the Mac Studio. The Mac Studio starts at $1,999/£2,099 for the M2 Max model. The Mac Studio with M2 Ultra starts at $3,999/£4,199. There are also various build-to-order options. Note that the prices for the previous generation were lower, as you can see below. The most obvious thing missing from the Mac Studio is a display, but if you want to buy Apple’s Studio Display we have a separate article explaining where you can get the best deal on an Apple Studio Display.
