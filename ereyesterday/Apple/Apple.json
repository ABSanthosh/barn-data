    "description": "Macworld In a new white paper on Apple’s developer site (PDF link), Apple has outlined several big changes coming this year designed to help parents and developers produce a safer environment for kids when using Apple products. No timeline is given for when these features will arrive—some already appear to be in the iOS 18.4 beta (or the building blocks are there), while others may come with iOS 19 later this year. There are three major areas Apple is focusing on: changes to child accounts, age assurance for apps, and changes to the App Store. Easier Child Account setup Most of Apple’s features to protect kids require parents to set up and manage a Child Account, but many parents don’t know about it and don’t bother to set it up. So Apple is going to do two things. First, it will streamline the Child Account setup process so it’s less of a burden. Second, if a parent wants to finish setting up a Child Account at a later time, the device will use more child-appropriate defaults in the meantime. Correcting a child’s age on an account has been a real problem, so Apple is fixing that as well. Parents will be able to easily change the age on their child’s account, and if it’s under 13 it will be converted to a “Child Account” with a prompt for that account to join the family group. Too many parents have set up accounts for their kids quickly and with inaccurate ages, and they haven’t been able to change them into Child Accounts where all the real protections are. Age ranges for apps Parents will be able to allow their kids to share their age range with apps (just a range, not the actual age or birthdate). A new “Declared Age Range” API will let app developers request this age range, and then tailor their content to the appropriate age. This appears to be voluntary on both sides: Parents will have the option to allow their kids to share their age range or not, and can turn it off at any time. Developers can use the API to request this age range, but are not required to. The child’s actual exact age or birthdate is never shared, regardless. Recently, some regulators have suggested that “gatekeepers” like Apple and Google should be responsible for verifying ages of their users, so that only adults see adult-oriented content. Apple has opposed this, claiming that it creates privacy issues and requires the company to collect sensitive information from both users and developers even where it’s not necessary. This age range assurance feature seems to be, at least in part, Apple’s preferred solution. App Store changes Apple will also update its current age ratings for apps on the App Store. Currently, the ages are 4+ years old, 9+, 12+, and 17+. The new age ratings will be 4+, 9+, 13+, 16+, and 18+, a better spread that doesn’t leave a five-year gap among adolescents. The current “App Nutrition Labels” don’t go far enough in helping parents know what content an app might have. So Apple will add highlights of whether the app contains user-generated content or advertising that might cause users of the app to see content that lies outside of the app’s official age and content guidelines. This seems aimed primarily at social media apps. Developers will also be able to say whether the app has its own content controls or requires proof of age. And later this year, the App Store will only show apps whose stated age rating does not exceed the rating set by their parents. But this seems limited to areas where Apple curates apps, like the front of the Today, Games, and Apps tabs—it is unclear if a Child Account would see a higher-age-rated app if they searched for it.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2622358/psa-your-mac-will-eventually-install-that-macos-update-whether-you-want-it-or-not.html",
    "description": "Macworld We here at Macworld encourage users to install OS updates sooner rather than later, less because of the new features (if there are any) and mostly because of the important security and bug fixes. However, there are plenty of good reasons to turn off automatic update installs in System Settings and skip the occasional OS update. But, as it turns out, that update may install even if you don’t want it to. Developer Howard Oakley has documented on his blog how macOS installs updates even when you have the setting to install updates turned off. In Oakley’s instance, he decided to stop updating his iMac Pro after a “slightly traumatic” experience with Sequoia 15.1.1. Oakley continued to get notifications for Sequoia 15.2, 15.3, and 15.3.1 which he subsequently declined. But he eventually received a notification to install the 15.3.1 update now or later, without any option to decline. A background activity was added to his Mac that scheduled the update to install in the middle of the night. Oakley posted the logs of the activity to show the process at work. The logs even show how some processes that typically appear to the user during an installation are not shown and local authentication (a.k.a. asking for user input) is disabled. However, if the user sets macOS to do an update in the middle of the night, macOS skips those items (such as the license agreement) because the system asks the user to click a button to proceed. There’s a presumption that the user isn’t available to click those buttons. Oakley didn’t offer a solution because he doesn’t know of one. If you get one of those notifications without a decline option, you could presumably select Install later, turn off Wi-Fi, and shut down your Mac, but the notification will eventually re-appear until the update installs. This behavior doesn’t sound like a bug, as Apple has a history of “encouraging” users to install the latest versions of its OSes and it appears that Apple is forcing the updates after a set period of time between updates. Be sure to check out Oakley’s blog, which is a terrific mix of Mac technical articles and posts about painting. Oakley is a longtime Mac developer who has written several great Mac utilities.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
