    "description": "Macworld Apple is adding more and better ports to its latest MacBooks but for true flexibility and the very best extra functionality you should consider a docking station to expand your laptop into a full top-end desktop solution. We have tested and recommended the best Thunderbolt docks for Mac and best USB-C hubs for Mac, but now is a great time to look for deals in Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks. Below we list the best Black Friday deals on some of these docks and hubs that we have recommended as the best of the best in our reviews. Examples of great deals include the iVanky FusionDock Max 1 (uniquely boasting two Thunderbolt 4 chips), the Wavlink Thunderbolt 4 Triple Display Docking Station (our favorite budget Thunderbolt 4 dock), the Satechi Dual Dock Stand (our best choice for Mac USB-C dock) and the CalDigit TS4 (the most powerful Thunderbolt 4 dock in our tests), as well as super hubs such as the Baseus 10Gbps USB-C Hub with 50% off its retail price. The Anker 675 is a combination monitor stand and fast USB-C dock, and has a third slashed from its MSRP. While the official Black Friday is on November 29 and Cyber Monday on December 2, we’re already seeing fantastic deals, so you might not want to wait. We’ll be updating this page regularly as more discounts come in. Some Amazon deals are for Prime subscribers only, so, you need to have a subscription to the service ($14.99 / £8.99 / CA$9.99 / AU$9.99 per month or $139 / £95 / CA$99 / AU$79 per year).

    "title": "How to enhance your network security with private Wi-Fi network addresses",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/1940467/enhance-network-security-private-wi-fi-address.html",
    "description": "Macworld You might think that connecting anonymously to a public Wi-Fi network doesn’t reveal much about you. You might be using a VPN (virtual private network) to protect everything you do. Even if you aren’t, the vast majority of websites and email servers (and pretty much all those run by companies) use client-to-server encryption. But what if you could be tracked anyway? Apple has a solution for this as it does for many tracking systems. The company’s trick lies in how Wi-Fi (and ethernet) adapters identify themselves over a local network. How MAC addresses work Every network adapter has a unique, factory-assigned address baked in or programmed in at its manufacture. It’s called a Media (or Medium) Access Control address; the abbreviation is MAC, confusingly enough, but it has nothing to do with Macintoshes. Where an IP (Internet Protocol) address defines your machine’s location on the internet, a MAC address defines it on your local area network (LAN). The MAC is in part how devices on a LAN all communicate with one another, whether over Wi-Fi or ethernet. Apple recognized that any fixed identifier could be used to track someone if the ID could be tied to records shared beyond a local network. When you connect to a wireless hotspot, your Wi-Fi MAC address gets transmitted because it’s an inherent part of that connection. If that MAC address doesn’t change over time, the backend of a hotspot portal or a business location’s point-of-sale system could build up a profile of you (or your device) using a variety of clues that includes any Bluetooth broadcasts, logging into a portal to gain free access, using a discount card while paying, and emitting other broadcast identifiers. They could sell this information to third-party information brokers who could track you widely across locations that also share and sell information and target you with ads even if all your web, email, and file-transfer connections were secure, as is the case in most scenarios today. Worse, it’s clear that law enforcement and government agencies routinely purchase access to location information without use of subpoenas or legal mechanisms that a provider or you would be informed of and could fight. While a MAC address is factory assigned, it can be changed. For instance, you may have had the experience of connecting to a Wi-Fi gateway to configure it and seeing an option buried in advanced settings to modify the MAC address. (This can sometimes be helpful when you’re replacing a router, and your ISP’s broadband modem or adapter is registered to that older device’s MAC address.) The ability for a MAC to change and the potential for a MAC to be tracked is why Apple introduced a Private Wi-Fi address as a feature in iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and watchOS 7. It later added it to macOS. The feature is enabled by default for all Wi-Fi connections on all platforms. Apple made this feature more granular—offering ways to tune it further—in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15 Sequoia, and watchOS 11. Apple uses the term “Private Wi-Fi address” to refer to the MAC address for a Wi-Fi adapter. It’s identical to a MAC address, but the company doesn’t offer private MAC addresses for Ethernet connections. Change your private address settings You can view the settings only for individual networks because Apple lets you have different settings for each network to which you connect. On an iPhone or iPad, go to Settings \u003e Wi-Fi and tap the connected network name. You can also change Private Wi-Fi options by tapping the i (info) icon next to a nearby network, or tapping Edit at the top of Wi-Fi settings and tapping the i icon. On a Mac, go to System Settings \u003e Wi-Fi and click Details next to the connected network. You can also tap the … (More) button next to a network shown as nearby to make changes to the Private Wi-Fi address settings. (You can’t change stored MAC settings in macOS.) On a Watch, go to Settings \u003e Wi-Fi, tap the name of the network, and the Private Address setting appears. The Private Wi-Fi address setting lets you control how much long-term information you leak about your device to nearby networks.Foundry The latest releases of operating systems added a menu that offers Off, Fixed, and Rotating choices. By default when you connect to an open network (one with no encryption) or one using outdated encryption methods (WEP or the original WAP flavor), your operating system automatically sets the option to Rotating. In this case, your device invents a MAC address for every network you join and uses that address for two weeks. The address also changes if you choose Forget This Network and then connect again after 24 hours, or if you use the device’s settings to reset your network settings (Settings \u003e General \u003e Transfer or Reset iPhone/iPad \u003e Reset \u003e Reset Network Settings). You might ask: what if Apple generates a MAC address already in use? The number of possible addresses is vast—over 280 trillion possibilities—and unlike a global IP address, it only needs to be unique on the local network. If you connect to a network with WPA2 or later encryption, your device uses Fixed by default. You might also choose this on a personal or office local network even if Apple’s default isn’t set to Fixed in order to ensure your address stays consistent. If you pick Off, you’re warned about tracking and have to confirm before Private Wi-Fi address is disabled. You might change from Rotating to Off or Fixed if you think you’re experiencing problems with a hotspot network that keeps losing your login. I’ve seen this with airplane Wi-Fi and haven’t diagnosed whether it’s an issue with the airplane’s authentication system or private MAC addressing.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
