    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/668892/when-to-buy-a-mac-should-you-buy-a-mac-or-macbook-now.html",
    "description": "Macworld Whether you are updating your old MacBook laptop or planning to buy your first Mac part of the decision of which model to buy should be based on timing. Before you part with your money you should check that the model you are buying isn’t about to be upgraded by Apple. There is nothing worse than buying a new MacBook Air only to see Apple update the models a month later. Luckily you are here reading this article so the chance of you making a mistake like that is slim (although you should check the date this article was last updated!) In this article, we’ll tell you the best time to buy a MacBook, when to buy a Mac, at what time of year Apple usually updates its Macs, and whether an update is expected soon. We’ll also mention if there are any particular configurations to avoid. We will run through each Mac and MacBook Apple currently sells and assess whether now is a good time to buy one based on educated guesses as to when the next one will launch. Sometimes if you wait a month or two you can get more for your money – provided Apple keeps its prices the same. Before you make the decision of which Mac to buy you should also check out our Mac buying guide and our MacBook buying guide. We also offer advice about how much storage, RAM and cores in How much MacBook RAM, SSD, GPU and CPU do you really need? If you are reading this around Black Friday, read our advice in our guide to the best Black Friday MacBook deals and the best Mac mini and iMac deals. And if you want to know what other Apple products are discounted read Best Black Friday Apple deals. When will Apple launch new Macs? There are a couple of things that can help when predicting when a new model might land. One is to be aware of when Apple last updated the range. The other is to note when Apple has previously announced updates to that range. Apple updated the MacBook Pro, Mac mini and iMac at an event in October 2024. We don’t anticipate any more Mac updates until spring 2025. take a look at our article about Apple Events and the new products expected from Apple to check that the outlook hasn’t changed. Most recent/current launches: 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max – October 2024 24-inch iMac, M4 – October 2024 Mac mini, M4 and M4 Pro – October 2024 15-inch MacBook Air, M3 – March 2024 (RAM update in October 2024) Mac Studio, M2 Max and M2 Ultra – June 2023 Mac Pro, M2 Ultra – June 2023 13-inch MacBook Air, M2 – July 2022 (RAM update in October 2024) As for the times when a Mac launch is most likely. In the past, the most likely times to see Mac updates were: WWDC in June for professional Mac models (e.g. Mac Studio and Mac Pro) and October for consumer-focused Macs (e.g. MacBook Air and Mac mini). However, as you will see when you read on, this is not a rule that Apple abides by particularly, nor does Apple always launch new Macs at special events: it often just takes the Apple Store offline for a few hours and then when it returns new Mac models are available as it did in October 2024. It used to be easier to predict when Apple would launch new Macs because updates were often tied to the launch of the next generation of Intel processors. Now that Apple has transitioned from Intel to its own series of processors, it is no longer tied to Intel’s upgrade cycle. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the updates happen more frequently though. We do, however, think that updates for the following Macs are likely to arrive in the next few months. 13- \u0026 15-inch MacBook Air, M4: Now that the MacBook Pro has an M4 chip we expect that the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air will get an update soon. See: MacBook Air rumors. Expected launch: Spring 2025. Mac Studio, M4: The Mac Studio go the M2 Max and M2 Ultra in June 2023. We expect that the whole of 2024 will pass without an update so expect an M4-Max/Ultra in 2025, perhaps at WWDC. See: M4 Mac Studio. Mac Pro, M4: Like the Mac Studio, we expect a update in June 2024. iMac Pro: Apple discontinued the larger-screened 27-inch iMac when the Mac Studio was introduced, but there are rumors that it could make a comeback. Read about the new iMac Pro. Expected launch: 2025. Should I wait for Black Friday deals? If you are thinking of buying a new Mac and the last few months of the year are approaching, you should hold on to take advantage of deals season. From October onwards is when we tend to see the most deals, with everyone saving their best discounts for the weeks around Black Friday at the end of November. If you are wondering whether to wait until Black Friday itself or take advantage of an early deal that’s marked as being ‘early Black Friday’ or similar, our advice is to just go for it! In the past lots of retailers have started their Black Fridays sales a long time before the day itself and promised that prices won’t go any lower on Black Friday itself. It’s unlikely that Apple will offer any discounts for Black Friday though. The company tends to offer vouchers with qualifying sales around Black Friday, and we don’t expect that to change: here’s what Apple is likely to be doing for Black Friday. So don’t expect Apple to offer discounts on Black Friday, but you might be able to get money off Apple products from another reseller. We see many resellers offering Black Friday deals on Apple products, so come back around Black Friday and check out our best But we don’t only see prices cut for Black Friday, we see deals on Apple products all year round – so don’t assume you can’t get money off a new Apple product when you need to buy one.

Is it a good time to buy a Mac or MacBook? Let’s take a look at each Mac and MacBook on the market and assess if you should consider buying it now. Check the date at the top of the article to see when we last updated this information. Should I buy a 13-inch MacBook Air now or wait? Price When Reviewed: $1,099 Best Prices Today: $899 at Amazon$899 at Best Buy$1024 at Walmart Electronics Last update: March 2024 Next update: Spring 2025 There are three versions of the MacBook Air available to buy right now. There are two 13-inch models: one with an M2 chip that launched in July 2022 and one with an M3 chip that went on sale in March 2024. There is also a 15-inch MacBook Air with M3 that was updated in March 2024, which we discuss below. The M2 MacBook Air, with its brand-new design, arrived in the summer of 2022. It gained a MagSafe charging port, meaning that two USB-C ports are available. In our 13-inch M2 MacBook Air review we described it as “just right for nearly every user” thanks to its improved display with thinner bezels, full-size function row, killer battery life and outstanding performance in its class. There are still some areas that let it down though, for example, the fact that you can’t plug in more than one other monitor, unless you close the MacBook lid or follow this workaround: How to connect two or more external displays to Apple Silicon Macs. When the M3 version of the MacBook Air arrived in spring 2024 we were impressed, finding that the M3 chip gave a nice performance boost. In October 2024, with the arrival of the M4 in the MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air does look a little less impressive, but Apple increased the unified memory (RAM) in the M3 and M2 MacBook Air, from 8GB to 16GB, paving the way for Apple Intelligence. Is now a good time to buy a 13-inch MacBook Air? No The M2 MacBook Air is an excellent machine and it is the cheapest Mac laptop right now. However, the 13-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip only costs $100/£100 more, so our advice would be to pay a little extra for better specs. In October 2024 the M3 MacBook Air had a RAM boost, which is certainly a point in favor of buying one right now, but, with the MacBook Pro gaining an M4 chip at the same time, it’s likely that the MacBook Air will get a similar update soon. Our recommendation is that if you find a good discount on the price of the M3 MacBook Air check that the model being sold includes the now standard 16GB RAM, rather than 8GB RAM. If you find a 16GB equipped M3 MacBook Air at a good price then it will be a good buy, as long as you are prepared for disappointment in early 2025 when the MacBook Air is upgraded. If you want to buy a MacBook Air now check out our round-up of the Best MacBook Air deals. Should I buy a 15-inch MacBook Air now or wait? Price When Reviewed: $1,299 Best Prices Today: $1,099 at Amazon$1099 at Best Buy$1199 at B\u0026H Last update: June 2023 Next update: Spring 2025 There is another MacBook Air to consider. In our review of the 15-inch MacBook Air we said that the 15-inch MacBook Air is “exactly like the 13-inch MacBook Air only with a bigger display (and thus chassis) and better speakers”. But if you prefer larger laptops then the 15-inch MacBook Air will save you thousands compared to the 16-inch MacBook Pro. It offers better battery life than the smaller model and offers a larger screen, and while it costs a bit more than the 13-inch model, it is much less than the other Mac laptops with larger screens. The 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,599/£1,599, while the 15-inch MacBook Air starts at $1,299/£1,399. Is now a good time to buy a 15-inch MacBook Air? No Apple launched the 15-inch MacBook Air in March 2024, but while it’s still less than a year old, we do expect that Apple will update it in early 2025 with the M4 chip that arrived in the MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac mini in October 2024. One point in favor of the 15-inch MacBook Air is that Apple doubled the unified memory (RAM) in October 2024, so there is at least 16GB RAM as standard in the 15-inch MacBook Air, which should mean that if you find a good deal on a 16GB RAM-equipped model you won’t regret spending your money. Should I buy a 14-inch MacBook Pro now or wait? Price When Reviewed: $1,599 | $1,799 | $1,999 Best Prices Today: $1,474 at Amazon$1484 at Walmart Electronics$1549 at B\u0026H Last update: October 2024 Next update: October 2025 Apple upgraded the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max in October 2024. We don’t expect to see another update until at least the fall of 2025. When we reviewed the MacBook Pro M4 model we found it offered a good performance boost over the MacBook Pro M3. The boost from 8GB to 16GB unified memory is one benefit, another gain comes in the form of an extra Thunderbolt/USB 4 port. In our review we described the M4 MacBook Pro as: “a package bursting with value. It no longer feels like a compromised laptop, and you get a lot of performance and features for the price”. If you are a pro user who needs a little more oomph then the M4 Pro or M4 Max models offer more ports (including Thunderbolt 5) and superior power. In our review of the M4 Pro models we said they “have what it takes to conquer your processing demands”. Read our review here: 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 review. Is now a good time to buy a 14-inch MacBook Pro? Yes At $1,599/£1,599 the price of the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 is a high compared to the 15-inch MacBook Air, which you can get for $1,299/£1,299, but the latter still only offers the M3 chip and the M4 in the MacBook Pro is leaps ahead. So or recommendation right now is to buy the MacBook Pro if you see a good deal. If you find a deal on the older M3 MacBook Pro we would advise against it because that model has less RAM. If it’s the M4 Pro or M4 Max edition you are after, our recommendation is buy one, you won’t be disappointed.

Read our full Apple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4) review Should I buy a 16-inch MacBook Pro now or wait? Price When Reviewed: $2,499 | $2,899 Best Prices Today: $2,299 at Amazon$2314 at Walmart Electronics$2499 at Apple Last update: October 2024 Next update: October 2025 Alongside the 14-inch MacBook Pro, in October 2024, Apple introduced a 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro or M4 Max. When we reviewed the M4 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro model we described it as “a powerful workstation and Apple makes the package even better with Thunderbolt 5, the 12MP Center Stage camera, and the Nano-texture glass display option”. If you need the ultimate in processing muscle, you really want an M4 Max chip, but if a $3,499/£3,499 laptop is out of your budget, the M4 Pro models have what it takes to conquer your processing demands. The larger 16-inch model costs more than it’s smaller sibling, but if you need more battery life and a bigger screen then this is the model for you. If you’re still using an Intel-based MacBook Pro, it’s time to upgrade. For more advice read our comparison of all the MacBook Pro models. Is now a good time to buy a 16-inch MacBook Pro? Yes The 16-inch MacBook Pro was updated in October 2024, so we don’t expect another update for some time. If you can find a good deal then definitely buy one. If it’s power you need and portability isn’t a factor, you may also want to consider the M4 Pro in the Mac mini and a display as a much cheaper option than the 16-inch MacBook Pro.

Price When Reviewed: $1,299 | $1,499 | $1,699 | $1,899 Best Prices Today: $1,199 at Amazon$1214 at Walmart Electronics$1299 at Apple Last update: October 2024 Next update: Late 2025/2026 The 24-inch iMac is eye-catching, both in terms of the quality of the 4.5K display and the colorful case. The M4 model arrived in October 2024 with each model available in blue, green, orange, pink, purple, yellow, and silver, with all but silver offering a bold tone on the back that is complemented by a paler version on the front. On the inside the differences are impressive. As we said in our review, “the new 16GB RAM standard, the implementation of Thunderbolt across the board, the improved FaceTime camera, and the Nano-texture glass option are all winning moves by Apple.” The M4 chip inside is the same as you can find in the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro and Mac mini. The iMac is less expensive than the MacBook Pro, starting at $1,299/£1,299 compared to $1,599/£1,599 for the MacBook Pro, but the MacBook Pro is better equipped, with a 10-core GPU, rather than the 8-core GPU found in that entry-level iMac. There’s also double the storage in the MacBook (512GB compared to 256GB). If you are looking for the best value though, the Mac mini is much cheaper than the iMac, starting at $599/£599 for the same spec. Is now a good time to buy a 24-inch iMac? Yes While we feel that it is overpriced, we accept that there are places for which the iMac is ideal–reception desks, living rooms, and so on. If If you’re looking for a new, complete Mac setup– a computer, display, and input devices–the M4 iMac is a great choice. If you do want to buy one then do not pay full price, check our round-up of the best iMac deals. If you need an iMac that is designed with creative pros in mind you should look at the Mac mini with M4 Pro. Read our full Apple iMac (M4) review Should I buy a Mac mini now or wait?

The Mac mini with M4 or M4 Pro is the long awaited successor to the M2 Mac mini and M2 Pro version. The Mac mini is now even smaller, but it’s just as powerful as any other M4 equipped Mac. The performance and value on offer for just $599/£599 is excellent, if you are trying to spec up a machine to meet higher demands we found that can be expensive, but that is the case with all of Apple’s build-to-order options. The pro version of the Mac mini does much to fill the gap left by the removal of the 27-inch iMac, as long as you have a decent monitor you can use. Is now a good time to buy a Mac mini? Yes We recommend the M4 Mac mini. It offers the same specs as the other M4 Macs for much less money, the only difference being the absence of a screen. But since you can buy a decent 4K display for less than £300/$300 we don’t think that is a big problem. See our round-up of the best monitors for Mac. The M4 Pro Mac mini is a great option for anyone who needs affordable power. The only reason to hold off buying is if you want to wait for Apple to update the Mac Studio with M2 Max and M2 Ultra. However, the Mac Studio starts at $1,999/£2,099, while the M2 Pro Mac mini offers much better value at $1,299/£1,299.

Price When Reviewed: £1,999 Best Prices Today: $1799 at B\u0026H$1889 at Adorama$1949 at Walmart Electronics Last update: June 2023Next update: 2025 The Mac Studio arrived in March 2022 and we were impressed by its processing power, port flexibility and price. In our review we said “The Mac Studio offers exciting processing prowess,” and added: “It may even be a suitable replacement for an Intel Mac Pro in certain situations.” That model was replaced by a Mac Studio with M2 Max or M2 Ultra back in June 2023, but there hasn’t been an update in 2024. In our review of the model that arrived in June 2023, we said that: “The Mac Studio is the ideal Mac–it’s powerful, priced appropriately, has lots of ports for connecting devices, and it won’t take up a lot of desk space,” and described it as a “complete package of processing power, features, and design”. An HDMI upgrade fixes one of our biggest problems with the original Mac Studio, bringing 8K display support and support for more displays overall. Is now a good time to buy a Mac Studio? No Nearly a year and a half after the Mac Studio with M2 Max and M2 Ultra arrived in June 2023, the M4 Max has arrived in the MacBook Pro. That chip which will eventually be destined for the Mac Studio, along with the M4 Ultra (unless Apple jumps straight to the M5). With an update log overdue it certainly looks likely that the Mac Studio will see an update in 2025. We expect Apple to update the model either at, or before, WWDC in June. If you need a powerful machine in the meantime then you are better off considering the M4 Pro Mac mini or M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pro. Alternatively, take advantage of the Best Mac Studio deals, because we do see some big discounts on these models. Read our full Apple Mac Studio (M2 Max, 2023) review Should I buy a Mac Pro now or wait? Price When Reviewed: From $6,999 Best Prices Today: $6999 at Apple Last update: June 2023 Next update: 2025 Apple launched the current Mac Pro in June 2023, three and a half years after the range was last updated in December 2019. That was the first update since December 2013 (which was a wait of six years!) The main benefit of the 2019 Mac Pro design is shared by the design of the 2023 Mac Pro: it offers PCIe expansion slots (seven in total) and its modular design should mean that there is the potential for SSD upgrades down the line (although RAM won’t be upgradable and nor will the GPU or CPU). The Mac Pro has a lot of competition in the form of the Mac Studio, which offers the exact same spec as the Mac Studio and is cheaper. The Mac Pro brings an extra fan, more ports and there is a rack-mounted option. Is now a good time to buy a Mac Pro? No The disadvantage is that Apple hasn’t updated the Mac Pro (or Mac Studio) since mid 2023. While Apple often waits a long time between Mac Pro updates, the M4 Pro has more than caught up with the M2 Max and the M4 Max has edged ahead of the M2 Ultra, so if you need the power then the Mac Pro isn’t looking as attractive next to its siblings When the Mac Pro is finally updated we expect it to leap ahead, so our recommendation it to wait. We expect an update at, or before, WWDC.",

    "description": "Macworld At a GlanceExpert's Rating Pros Extensive range of video-editing tools Quick mode and Guided Edits for beginners Powerful colour correction tools Good tools for creating text and titles Cons Even Quick mode is pretty complex Now sold with only three-year license Dense, unhelpful documentation Our Verdict It’s certainly a powerful video-editing tool, with advanced features for creating titles and artistic effects. However, Premiere Elements isn’t easy to master, and may be too complex for people who just want to post on Instagram. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Retailer Price Adobe (three year license) $99.99 View Deal $99.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Price When Reviewed$99.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Adobe (three year license) $99.99 View Deal $99.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Premiere Elements is the companion product to Photoshop Elements (see our review), and is designed to provide powerful video-editing tools at a competitive price. There are less expensive video-editing apps available for the Mac, but many of these simply focus on relatively simple tools for trimming video clips and applying filters and effects for use on social media. In contrast, Premiere Elements provides powerful and precise editing tools that allow you to create complex video projects using multiple video and audio clips. It also includes a variety of text tools for creating titles, and a very wide range of creative filters and effects that can create just the right look and mood for your videos. However, that extra power means that Premiere Elements is more complex than some of its rivals – and also more complex than Photoshop Elements too, despite the similarities between the two programs. Photoshop Elements – How much does it cost? Both Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements have traditionally been sold for a one-time fee of $99.99/£86.99, which allowed you to use the programs for as long as you wanted (although you did have to pay an extra fee if you wanted to purchase their annual upgrades as well). The 2025 editions of both programs still cost the same amount, but the purchase price now only grants you a three-year term license, which means that you’ll have to purchase another license in three years’ time. That’s the bad news – but the good news is that you’ll get future upgrades, such as the 2026 and 2027 editions, for free as they are likely to be released within that three-year license period. It’s also possible to buy both Elements programs together for $149.99/£130.49 (which again is for a three-year license). There’s also a seven-day free trial available, so that you can see if Premiere Elements is suitable for your own level of experience. Purchasing Premiere Elements for the Mac also gives you access to the mobile version of the app – although this has been in beta for quite a few years now, so you should probably make sure you back-up any video files that you record on your mobile devices to keep them safe. Premiere Elements – Editing Tools Like Photoshop Elements, Premiere Elements provides three different editing modes, with three tabs at the top of the main editing window – Quick, Guided and Advanced – which are designed to cater to users with different levels of experience. The Quick mode is designed for beginners, and provides a simple workspace with a horizontal sceneline running across the bottom of the screen where you can drag and drop video clips and quickly arrange them in the required sequence. Above the sceneline is the Program Monitor window, which provides a larger view of individual video clips so that you can view each clip with frame-by-frame precision and decide where to make cuts or other changes. There’s also a palette on the right of the window that provides several additional tools, including a series of artistic effects, such as oil paintings, lens flare and black-and-white effects. However, even in Quick mode some of these tools are quite complex, with multiple slider controls for adjusting settings and timings that may confuse less experienced users. Fortunately, like Photoshop Elements, Premiere Elements also has a Guided mode that provides step-by-step help with some of these more complex tools. There are Guided Edits that show you how to create time-lapse effects, lighting adjustments, titles and other effects. And, for real beginners, there are two options that can do all the work for you and automatically create a Highlight Reel, or a Video Collage. All you have to do here is import a few video clips and Premiere Elements will edit the clips together, add transitions, and even offer a selection of music clips for the soundtrack. Premiere Elements – What’s New? Screenshot Foundry More experienced users can jump straight into Advanced Mode, which provides full access to the program’s extensive range of editing tools, audio features, filters and effects. Many of the new features introduced for the 2025 edition are found here as well. At first glance, Advanced Mode looks similar to Quick Mode – although the sceneline of Quick Mode is now called the timeline, indicating that more advanced features are available in this mode. The timeline has been modified for this 2025 version, with audio and video tracks grouped together for greater clarity, and the ability to lock tracks to prevent any accidental changes. There’s a new Quick Tools palette to the left of the timeline, which provides instant access to features such as the Scissor tool for splitting clips, and the Text tool for adding titles. The program’s text tools have been improved as well, with controls for quickly adjusting text size, alignment, and direction of movement. You can also download some new templates to help you create slick animated titles as well. There are improved tools for colour correction and adjusting white balance, which controls the brightness of white areas within an image, such as clouds or snow. However, some of these colour tools will challenge even more advanced users, and we found ourselves wading through the not-very-helpful Help files on Adobe’s web site to learn the differences between colour grading and colour correction. There are also changes to the program’s options for importing and exporting files, which should be useful for all users regardless of their level of experience. When you start a new project you’ll see the redesigned Media panel that opens on the left of the screen and makes it quicker and easier to import files into your projects. There are also new export options that help you to prepare your video files for social media and other platforms, starting with the Quick Export button that provides preset options covering a variety of different quality settings and resolutions. The updated Export tool now opens up a large window that provides more detailed settings for audio and video files. And one big time-saver here is the ability to simultaneously export multiple versions of the same file that can be tailored for use on different social media sites, such as Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Screenshot Foundry Should you buy Premiere Elements? There’s no doubt that Premiere Elements is an impressively powerful program for video-editing work, and it’s great value for more advanced amateurs and semi-professional users such as podcasters and vloggers. Even so, it’s still a pretty complex piece of software, even when using Quick mode, so newcomers will have to be prepared to roll up their sleeves and do a bit of work in order to really get to grips with the program’s undeniably powerful editing tools.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
