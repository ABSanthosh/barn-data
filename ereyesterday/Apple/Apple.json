    "description": "Macworld iOS 18.4 is destined to be a big release. The headline feature of iOS 18 is Apple Intelligence, and the various AI features have been rolling out piece by piece. After getting no major new AI features in iOS 18.3, Apple is bringing Apple Intelligence to many more countries in iOS 18.4 as well as a new device—Vision Pro. However, the anticipated Siri update has to wait. There are several big Siri updates coming, including personal context, app intents, and screen reading, but they’re missing from the first iOS 18.4 beta. Instead, Apple says Apple Intelligence “will receive additional features in the coming months, including expanded capabilities for Siri.” That likely means the whole update has been pushed to iOS 18.5. The iOS 18.4 beta began on February 21 with a developer beta, and the first public beta on February 24. We expect the final release in early April. Updated March 3: The second beta of iOS 18.4 is available for developers today. It includes support for iPhone 16e. What’s new in iOS 18.4 We’ll update this section with the features and changes found in the latest iOS 18.4 beta, as they are found. Apple Intelligence languages: Including Simplified Chinese, German, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish—along with localized English for Singapore and India. Apple Intelligence regions: With iOS 18.4, iPhone and iPad users in the EU will gain access to Apple Intelligence features for the first time. Siri in Control Center: There are new Control Center options for Type to Siri and Talk to Siri. Visual Intelligence: You can now invoke Visual Intelligence on the Action button or from Control Center, and Visual Intelligence is available on iPhone 15 Pro. Prioritize Notifications: Apple Intelligence will attempt to show notifications that may be important in a separate section on the lock screen. Go to Settings \u003e Notifications \u003e Prioritize Notifications to enable. New Emoji: There are seven new emoji in this release—Face with bags under eyes, Fingerprint, Harp, Leafless tree, Root vegetable, Shovel, Splatter. Image Playground sketch style: The third image style for Image Playground, sketch, is finally here. It was demonstrated back at WWDC last summer but never made it into a prior iOS 18 release. Food in News+: A new section in Apple News+ for curated recipes, restaurant reviews, and curated stories about food and dining. Ambient Music: You can add four different ambient music categories to Control Center: Sleep, Chill, Productivity, and Wellbeing. CarPlay third icon row: The two-row limit for app icons on CarPlay displays has been expanded to three rows. Apple Vision Pro app: iOS 18.4 brings a new iPhone app that offers users a new way to download Vision Pro apps and games from the App Store on your iPhone, as well as browse Apple TV content and access your library of spatial photos and videos. It only shows up if you have a Vision Pro associated with the same Apple ID. Mail categories in iPadOS: With the iPadOS 18.4 release, the iPad version of the Mail app finally gets the categories that have been on the iPhone since iOS 18.2. Default translation app: In the Default Apps section of Settings, there is now an option to set a default translation app. iOS 18.4: How to install the developer beta You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer. Beginning with iOS 18.4, you don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta. A free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app: Download the Apple Developer App from the App Store. Open the app. Tap on Account. Sign in using your usual Apple ID. Registered developers can choose to get the Public Beta instead by selecting iOS Public Beta in the Software Update screen. It may take a little time after registering as a developer for the option to appear in Software Updates. iOS 18.4: How to install the public beta If you want to be among the first to test iOS 18.4, you can sign up for the public beta test, which should arrive in late February. The process for installing a beta has changed in iOS 16.4. Here’s how the new process works now: Click Sign Up on the Apple Beta page and register with your Apple ID. Log in to the Beta Software Program. Click Enroll your iOS device. Open the Settings app, tap General, then Software Update. In the Beta Updates section, select the iOS Public Beta. It may take a few moments after registering for the beta option to appear in Software Update. Find out everything you need to know about iOS 18 in our iOS 18 superguide.",

    "description": "Macworld macOS Sequoia arrived on Macs in September 2024, but the beta development continues and if you are a registered developer or registered as a public beta tester, you can continue to get the latest updates and try out new features still not available to the general public. In this article, we’ll explain what’s in the latest version of the Sequoia beta, what you need to do to get your hands on a copy, how to install it, and what you should bear in mind if you don’t want to end up in a pickle. If you would prefer to use the latest official release of macOS Sequoia here’s how to update macOS on your Mac. In the past, the developer beta was only available to developers who had paid to join Apple’s Developer Program (which costs $99/£79). However, for a couple of years now, Apple has opened up the developer beta to registered developers with free developer accounts. We explain how to get a free developer account below. Not that we recommend that you should get the beta if you aren’t a developer. Beta software tends to be buggy and a more stable public beta version is also available. If you no longer want to run the beta version of macOS read this: How to remove the macOS beta. macOS developer beta: Latest version macOS Sequoia 15.4 beta 2: March 3, 2025 Sequoia 15.4 features the Mail sorting features that were introduced in iOS 18.2. When you open an Inbox, four icons appear at the top representing the sorting methods: Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions. If you swipe from the right end of the icons to the left, you can activate an option for All Mail to be listed. In Mail on the Mac, these options will appear at the top of the Inbox message listing. If you have Apple Intelligence enabled on your Mac, you’ll also see a new Priority Notifications section at the top of your Inbox to show any important messages you may have missed. Another new feature is Proximity Pairing that works with iPhones running iOS 18.4, according to 9to5Mac. When setting up a new Mac, you’ll be able to pair it with an iPhone to transfer over information such as your Apple Account data. Apple Intelligence will be available in several non-English countries, including countries in the European Union, Brazil, India, and Japan. macOS public beta: Latest version macOS Sequoia 15.4 beta 1: February 24, 2025. Foundry Apple usually releases the Public beta a day or so after the developer beta arrives. macOS Sequoia beta timeline The first version of the Sequoia developer beta of macOS 15 arrived after the WWDC keynote on June 10, 2024. Beta 2 arrived on June 24. The first public beta of Sequoia arrived on July 15, 2024. Developer beta 4 was released on July 23. The second public beta also arrived on July 23, 2024. Developer beta 5 arrived on August 5 followed by the third public beta. Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15 developer beta 6 on August 12. The fourth public beta of Sequoia arrived on August 13, 2024. Developer beta 7 and the fifth public beta of Sequoia were released on August 20. On August 28, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15 beta 8 and the sixth public beta of Sequoia. The release candidate of Sequoia arrived on September 9. The full version of Sequoia arrived on compatible Macs on September 16. macOS Sequoia 15.1 There were actually two versions of the developer beta. A second beta was running consecutively with the macOS 15.0 beta development. The macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta included Apple Intelligence features that are only available on M-series Macs (a iOS 18.1 beta was also in development separately with Apple Intelligence features for compatible iPhones). Apple started work on the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta on July 29. Beta 2 arrived on August 12, beta 3 was released to developers on August 28. Initially this beta was only for developers, but Apple released a macOS Sequoia 15.1 pubic beta on September 19, 2024, following the release of Sequoia to the general public. Eventually, the macOS Sequoia 15.1 release candidate was released on October 21 and a second release candidate 2 was released on October 24. The final version of macOS Sequoia 15.1 arrived on compatible Macs on October 28. macOS Sequoia 15.2 On October 23, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.2 beta 1 to developers. Version 15.2 introduced the second set of Apple Intelligence features. On November 20, Apple released the macOS Sequoia beta 4 to developers. On December 5, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.2 Release Candidate. On December 9, Apple released the Released Candidate 2. The official release of 15.2 was on December 11. macOS Sequoia 15.3 On December 16, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.3 beta 1 to developers. This beta includes the ability to create Gemoji. On January 7, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.3 beta 2 to developers. Beta 3 of 15.3 came on January 16. Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.3 release candidate (RC) to developers on January 21. macOS Sequoia 15.4 On February 19m, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.4 beta to developers. It included Mail updates and Proximity Pairing with the iPhone. macOS public beta vs developer beta Since 2023 the Developer Beta has been available to anyone who registers as a developer, even if they aren’t a paid-up member of Apple’s Developer Program. As a result, people with a basic free developer account are able to download the new macOS developer beta (we show you how to register below). Whether you should download the developer beta if you aren’t a developer is another question. We don’t recommend you install the developer beta if you aren’t a developer. Instead, our recommendation is to use the public beta (the first verison of which usually arrives in July). There are a few differences between the public and developer betas. The public beta is not the same as the beta that is released through the developer program. Developers get updates to their beta first, and possibly more frequently. But you should keep in mind that betas are by nature not stable, and because the public beta comes after the developer beta it could be a little safer to install. The most significant difference is probably the motive of the testers: Developers usually have the aim of ensuring their apps work when the updated macOS is released to the general public, while public beta testers are essentially helping Apple detect bugs and offering feedback on the features. Because of this developers may get to test new features not available in the public beta.  If you want to get the public beta the first thing you need to do, if you haven’t already, is join Apple’s beta programs read this for more information: How to become an Apple beta tester. Apple How to get a free developer account If you just want a free Apple Developer account so you can access the beta you can get this via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app on an iPhone: Get the Apple Developer App from the App Store.  Open the app on your iPhone.  Tap on Account.  Tap on Sign In.  Sign in using your usual Apple ID.  If you wish to actually publish applications to the App Store or receive support, you’ll need to pay $99/£79 per year for a paid account. You can compare the free and paid accounts here. How to get the macOS beta The Sequoia developer beta should show up on your Mac if you are running macOS Sonoma or macOS Sequoia, have paid $99/£79 to enroll in Apple’s Developer program (here) or if you have a free developer account (follow the instructions above). When the Public Beta becomes available it will also show up on your Mac, as long as you have signed up for the Public Beta program on Apple’s beta webpage, signed the NDA, and enrolled your Mac. Before you download a few warnings: We strongly advise that if you aren’t a developer you don’t download the developer beta. We also strongly recommend that you back up your Mac before you upgrade to the Sequoia beta. We recommend that you do not run Sequoia beta on your primary Mac; ideally, you run it in a separate volume. This should minimize any risks to you. How to download macOS beta Open Software Updates on your Mac. (System Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Updates.) You should see two options: Automatic Updates and Beta Updates. Click on the (i) beside Beta Updates. You can now turn on Beta Updates (if they weren’t already on). Choose the beta you want to download. If your developer account is tied to a different Apple ID to your usual one you can change that here. Click Done. Now your Mac will Check for updates and eventually show the Sequoia Developer Beta as an upgrade. Click on Upgrade Now. Foundry If you are running macOS Ventura 13.3 or earlier: Apple changed the way it delivers betas in Ventura 13.4. If you aren’t yet running that version of macOS you will need to download the macOS Developer Beta Access Utility or macOS Public Beta Access Utility. If you were already running an earlier macOS Public Beta you’ll find the new macOS beta as an upgrade via Software Update. Just click on Upgrade Now. You may have to update to the latest version of your current beta before you can do so, if not follow the steps below to get the beta access utility. If you are enrolled in the Developer Program, go to Apple’s beta download page. Click on Install Profile to download the new macOS Developer Beta Access Utility to your Mac. If you are enrolled as a public beta tester, download the macOS Public Beta Access Utility. Go to Downloads on your Mac and click on the macOS Beta Access Utility to open it. Double-click on the dmg file and the installer will run. Once the new macOS beta is installed Software Update will check to see if there are any updates. Click Update and the latest version will download. You’ll see a prompt to install the latest macOS beta, click on Continue. Agree to the Ts\u0026Cs (more on them below). Click Install. How to update macOS beta versions Once you are running the beta the updates will come through to your Mac automatically, you just need to click to install. You will receive a notification when the next update to the beta is available. Updates will be available via Software Update (in System Settings/System Preferences) Everything else you need to know about beta testing That covers how to get the betas, but once you have them what can you do, and what should you do? We’ll cover that below. Is the macOS beta stable? By its nature, a beta has the potential to be unstable. Therefore it’s not advised that you install it on a Mac that you rely on. If you have a second Mac that isn’t mission-critical then install it there. We strongly recommend that you don’t risk all by putting the macOS beta on your primary macOS, especially not in the early days of the beta development.  If you don’t have a second Mac there are a couple of ways you could run macOS beta on your Mac without running the risk of losing data or finding your Mac stops working: We recommend installing it on a partition – which these days is really a volume (and is much easier to create than a partition was). Read about how to do that here: How to dual-boot Mac: Run two versions of macOS on a Mac. Alternatively, you could install the macOS beta on an external drive and run it on that. We discuss the safety of the macOS beta and the risks you might be taking in more detail in a separate article. If the stability of the beta worries you then you are probably better off waiting until the final version is out, or at least waiting until testing has been happening for a few months before getting the beta. How to prepare your Mac for the beta Update your software: We recommend you have the latest full version of macOS installed, although Apple says that the macOS Developer Beta Access Utility requires macOS 10.8 or later. Make space: We’d recommend at least 15GB of available space because the macOS betas tend to be very large. If you end up requiring more space read: How to free up space on Mac. Note that we always recommend that you have at least 10% space free on your Mac at any time, so if you don’t have that expect problems! Back up: Before you install a beta on your Mac you should make a backup of your data and files. You can find out how to use Time Machine to back up your Mac. We also have a round-up of suitable backup solutions. How to send feedback to Apple Should you come across an error or a bug you should use the Feedback Assistant app to provide feedback to Apple. Launch the app and follow the appropriate steps, selecting the area about which you’re providing feedback and then any specific sub-area. Then describe your issue in a single sentence, before providing a more detailed description, including any specific steps that reproduce the issue. You’ll also be able to attach other files. You’ll also have to give permission for the Feedback Assistant app to collect diagnostic information from your Mac. It won’t always be obvious whether something is a bug or just not as easy to use as you might have hoped. Either way, if your feedback is that something appears to work in an illogical way, Apple will want to know that. If you are having trouble with a third-party app you can let Apple know by reporting it through the 3rd-party Application Compatibility category in the Feedback Assistant. However, we’d suggest that you also provide feedback to the app’s developer who will no doubt be grateful. Will I be able to update from macOS beta to the final version? Beta users will be able to install the final build of the OS on release day without needing to reformat or reinstall. Can I talk about the beta publicly? According to Apple and the license agreement all beta testers must agree to, the beta is “Apple confidential information”. By accepting those terms, you agree not to discuss your use of the software with anyone who isn’t also in the Beta Software Program. That means you can’t “blog, post screenshots, tweet, or publicly post information about the public beta software.” However, you can discuss any information that Apple has publicly disclosed; the company says that information is no longer considered confidential. How to downgrade from the macOS beta You can always revert to an earlier version of macOS, though depending on how you back up, it’s not necessarily a painless process. Start by making sure the data on your drive is backed up, then erase the drive and install the latest public version of macOS. When you first startup your Mac you can use the Migration Assistant to import your data from the backup. Here’s a more detailed tutorial on downgrading from the macOS beta we also have a tutorial on downgrading to an older version of the Mac OS.",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
