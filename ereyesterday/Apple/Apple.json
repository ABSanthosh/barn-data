    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2516019/mac-mini-removable-ssd-diy-storage-upgrades.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple gets a lot of flack for its non-friendly approach to user repairs and upgrades‚Äìyou can‚Äôt really do them. But there‚Äôs a ray of hope with the new Mac mini that started shipping on Friday. In a teardown posted on X, ohgkg shows that the Mac mini‚Äôs SSD is on a separate board instead of integrated with the M4 chip. Partial teardown of M4 Mac Mini /w 16GB RAM \u0026 256GB SSD. Interesting revealation [stet]: Wifi chip \u0026 antenna on the back of bottom air intake. SSD on a daughter board. And even the base 256GB version comes in two chips. No compromise in speed. Theoretically also end user upgradable. ohgkg via X, November 8, 2024 On X, L0vertodream also posted on X a Mac mini teardown. L0vetodream states that ‚Äúit is indeed a 1-slot dual-slot with a maximum particle size of 1TB. It uses a BGA315 hard disk and the maximum upgrade capacity can be up to 2T‚Äù (translated). This SSD setup is similar to that of the Mac Studio, which also has separate SSD modules. Ars Technica points out that Apple‚Äôs implementation isn‚Äôt like that of Windows PCs where the SSD controller is contained with the SSD hardware. Apple‚Äôs SSD controller is built into the M-series chip. Because of that, you can‚Äôt simply swap out the Mac Studio‚Äôs or Mac mini‚Äôs SSD with a part bought from Amazon or some computer store. There are other reasons why off-the-shelf parts won‚Äôt work, like the possibility that the Mac‚Äôs SSD slots have restrictions on the types of modules that can be used. But the simple fact that Apple separated the SSD leaves the possibility of someone figuring out how to perform a DIY SSD upgrade. It would involve figuring out what modules can be used and being able to modify the controller‚Äìnot easy tasks to do. There‚Äôs a Kickstarter for a Mac Studio SSD upgrade but it still requires a bit of work. It‚Äôs unclear if these modules will work with the M4 Mac mini. The other big revelation about the Mac mini SSD is that Apple uses two 128GB NAND chips in the 256GB SSD configuration. In the M2 Mac mini, Apple used one 256GB NAND chip, and that hinders performance because there‚Äôs no parallel processing as there is with two 128GB chips. With the M3, Apple switched to using two 128GB chips, but the company did not release an M3 Mac mini. Read our in-depth review of the M3 Pro Mac mini.",

    "description": "Macworld There are lots of battery-powered devices that can give you an estimate of how much longer they‚Äôll need to stay plugged in until they‚Äôre fully charged. It‚Äôs not exactly a new feature. MacBooks gives you this info in the Battery menu of Settings or the menu bar, for example. With all the battery management and analysis built into our modern iPhones, it‚Äôs kind of remarkable that they don‚Äôt do this. Fortunately, a ‚Äútime to charge‚Äù feature may be on the way. 9to5Mac discovered some code in the latest iOS 18.2 beta that points to a new BatteryIntelligence framework. The framework will take into account the amount of charge your battery can hold, its state of charge, and the amount of power it‚Äôs receiving from the charger (USB-C or wireless, we assume) and produce an estimate of how much longer it will take for the battery to charge. According to 9to5Mac, users will be able to do things like get a notification stating how long it will take to charge to the current limit (80% or whatever you set it to). I could see Apple incorporating the info into the Dynamic Island, or perhaps on the lock screen. The feature is not yet enabled, so it‚Äôs unclear if it will come in iOS 18.2 or a later release. It may also be restricted to specific iPhone models, much like the custom charge limits or other battery features.",

What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
