    "description": "Macworld Normally when you plug in an external hard drive to your Mac’s USB port you will see it appear on the desktop. You can also see it in a Finder window in the left column under Locations (or Devices in older versions of macOS). If the drive is not showing up on your Mac chances are it has not been formatted correctly, has been corrupted, or is faulty. Alternatively, you may have set a password for the drive that you need to enter before it will connect. We show you how to work out whether the reason the external drive is not mounting on your Mac up is due to a problem with the drive itself, the cable or the port, and how to resolve the problem and access data on your drive. PROMOTIONEaseUS | Check and manage hard drives on Mac Why the hard drive is not showing up on your Mac? How to get it fixed quickly? No worries. EaseUS Partition Master for Mac comes in.

If you have a NAS drive that connects over the network then you should read our article about connecting to a NAS drive. Why is your hard drive not showing up on Mac? We’ll start by trying to identify the reason why your hard drive isn’t showing up on the Mac before explaining what you need to do to find the hard drive on your Mac. If you can identify the cause your should be able to fix the problem that is stopping your external drive from opening on your Mac. Damaged cable, port or insufficient power The first port of call is always to check that it’s plugged in, but we are sure you have done that. The problem might be with the cable. One of the main reasons why drives fail to mount is if the drive isn’t receiving enough power. If the drive is powered via a USB-A cable you need to check that adequate power is being delivered to the drive. Very old Macs may require a USB power cable, a cable that splits into two USB connectors that need to both be plugged into your Mac, in order to deliver enough power to the drive. Similarly, make sure that the drive doesn’t have an external power supply it should be using. On the subject of cables, make sure that it’s not at fault. Try using a different cable with the drive to see if that fixes the problem. Similarly, if you are using a USB port on a hub check that’s not what’s causing the problem. Also check that the port on your Mac isn’t the problem. Try using a different port. Or if you only have one port, plug another device in and see if that works. The next step is to try plugging the drive into another Mac. If it also fails to mount there you will know that there is a problem with the drive while if it does mount then the problem is with your Mac. Problem preferences Hopefully, there is a really easy fix to get the hard drive to mount on your desktop. Try the following to make sure your Mac is set to show mounted drives on the desktop.  Open the Finder. Click on Finder in the menu at the top of your screen.  Click on Settings (Preferences in older macOS versions). Click on General. Make sure that there is a tick beside External disks.  If it was already set up so that the external drive would appear on the desktop then continue to follow the steps below. Password protections You can protect a drive with a password when you initially start using it, so check to see if the reason your drive isn’t mounting is that a password request box has popped up and you didn’t notice it. Sometimes the password popup takes a few minutes to appear as well, so it helps to be patient. Foundry The drive is formatted for a PC It is possible that the drive has been formatted using a file system that your Mac cannot read. Windows PCs use NTFS or ExFAT file formats. Mac computers before Sierra used the HFS+ file format. In High Sierra, Apple introduced a new file system called Apple File System (APFS). There is an old FAT32 format can be read by Window and Mac computers, but has limitation on what files can be stored. An easy way to find out if this is the problem would be to check on a PC. If the drive mounts on the PC it’s likely that you have discovered what the problem is: the drive is formatted for PCs and can’t be read by your Mac. To make sure your drive can be read by Macs and PCs you need to format it using exFAT or the older FAT32. We’ll explain how to do that below. It’s a corrupted or faulty drive If none of the above were the reason why you couldn’t see the external drive on your Mac, perhaps the drive is faulty. If it is, you can use Apple’s Disk Utility program to access the disk and potentially fix whatever is causing the issue. We’ll discuss how to do that below. We’ll also look at ways you can stop a drive failing in the future. How fix an external drive that won’t show up on a Mac If none of the above solved your problem, it is likely the drive is either formatted incorrectly or damaged. Depending on the reason why you can’t see the drive, here is what you need to do to get it working. How to reformat a drive so you can see it on a Mac Hopefully, the drive is fine, but the format is wrong. It is possible that the hard drive has been formatted using a different file system (i.e. on a Windows PC). In that case, if you need to access the data on the drive you’ll need to connect the drive to a Windows PC that does recognize it and copy the data before moving on to the next step because the process will involve reformatting the drive and deleting everything on i). To make sure your drive can be read by Macs and PCs you need to format it using exFAT or the older FAT32. If you want to format the drive to just be used on a Mac you can use the HFS+ or Apple File System (APFS) file formats. Having got the data of the drive via a PC you can reformat the drive so that you can add the data again. Here’s how to reformat your drive so it can be read by a Mac or a PC. Open Disk Utility (as per the steps above). If you don’t require the data on the hard drive, select the disk and click Erase. Before Disk Utility starts to erase the disk it will pick a format for you. You can change this if you click on the Formatting options. Choose your format, ExFAT if you want to make sure it’s compatible with PC and Mac, otherwise, Mac OS Extended (Journaled) is probably the best option.  Click on Erase and wait for your Mac to erase and then reformat the drive. Give the drive a name.  Screenshot Foundry Read more: How to format a drive on a Mac. How to fix the faulty drive with Disk Utility If the various checks above suggest that the disk is faulty then you can use Apple’s Disk Utility program to access the disk and potentially fix whatever is causing the issue. Here’s what to do: Find Disk Utility by opening Spotlight (cmd+Space-bar) and start typing Disk Utility, press enter to open the program. Look in the column on the left to see if the hard drive appears there. If you can see the hard drive in Disk Utility check underneath it for a volume. If it is there click on it and select Mount. If your Mac has already mounted the drive the option Unmount will be displayed instead. (If there is no volume listed your Mac is not able to access the drive. The Mount option will be greyed out.) Your options are First Aid, Erase, and Restore. First Aid will check the disk for errors and then repair the disk if necessary and this is the option to choose. Restore allows you to erase the contents of the drive and replace that with data from somewhere else. Erase deletes all the data stored on the drive. If you need the data on the drive do not choose Erase or Restore! Click the First Aid tab and select Run.  If after running First Aid the Mac finds errors you could fix you may see the option to Repair Disk. If you do, go ahead and run the repairs. Best apps to recover data on a lost drive If your Mac is unable to repair the disk if is likely that the drive is either formatted using a file system that the Mac cannot read, or it is well and truly broken. If it’s the latter we suggest you follow this tutorial about recovering data from a damaged disk.

    "description": "Despite the fact that you can still use the service, TikTok is still very much so banned in the United States. President Trump promised to not fine TikTok and its service providers for continuing to run the services, but that’s just a promise. He also signed an executive order officially suspending the ban, but there’s great odds that that executive order doesn’t actually hold up legally. For one reason or another, Apple (and Google) have both decided that they don’t want to take the risk. If a court later decides that Trumps promises don’t hold up legally, Apple could be on the hook for up to $850 billion in fines. It just isn’t worth it for them. more…",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
