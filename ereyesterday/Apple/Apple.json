The idea that users would converse with Siri in the same way they did with ChatGPT was seemingly off the table for the launch.Since then, a lot has changed, and according to a report from Bloomberg, Apple has begun work on an LLM-based Siri that might debut in iOS 19 in early 2026.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.

    "description": "Macworld Apple is really driving hard in its race to be a top player in AI. The Apple Intelligence features are coming in so hot that they‚Äôre being released in stages, taking months after the release of iOS 18. And now a new report says the company is full steam ahead on a new version of Siri that goes well beyond the enhanced, more personal Siri coming this spring. According to a report from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, Apple is building a new version of Siri that makes use of more advanced large language models (LLMs), and employees on the project are calling it ‚ÄúLLM Siri.‚Äù The new Siri will be able to hold natural back-and-forth conversations, not unlike the new Advanced Voice Mode of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. It will also handle more sophisticated requests more quickly. According to the report, Apple is already testing the new Siri as a separate app on iPhones, iPads, and Macs, but it will be released as a replacement for the built-in OS feature we know today. The new Siri is expected to be unveiled in 2025 as part of iOS 19 and macOS 16, but won‚Äôt be available at launch‚Äîinstead, they‚Äôll come in an update early in 2026 (i.e. iOS 19.3 or the like). Siri is expected to get a big upgrade early in 2025 as part of iOS 18.3 or 18.4. Though the fundamental AI model isn‚Äôt changing, that version of Siri will be able to build a personal profile of you based on your on-device data (contacts, Messages, location history, and so on) in order to ‚Äúknow‚Äù you better. It will also be able to make use of hundreds of new App Intents, which are hooks that third-party app developers can use to allow Siri to perform functions or access data from within apps on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Next month, Siri will get ChatGPT integration and some new visual intelligence features, but still remains largely the Siri we‚Äôve known for years. The report doesn‚Äôt clarify exactly how the new Siri will work; Apple emphasizes on-device processing for better privacy, speed, and reliability. But advanced LLM models are huge, requiring large amounts of processing and significant RAM. The AI models of Apple Intelligence in iOS 18 already require around 2GB of RAM, which is why they need an iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPhone 16 to run (those are Apple‚Äôs only phones with 8GB of total RAM). If Apple is already testing the system on current devices, there‚Äôs a good chance your current phone will run it, but it may need a live internet connection to do so.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/233188/apple-id-how-to-change-your-email-address.html",
    "description": "Macworld When you first register for an Apple Account (formerly Apple ID), you can use either a new email address provided by Apple (with an @icloud.com address) or one you already have. You can have multiple email addresses associated with your Apple ID, but only one primary address‚Äîthe core address you‚Äôll use to log in and to which important Apple Account-related emails would be delivered. It used to be a pain to change this, involving a multi-step process that you can only do on the web. With iOS 18.1, Apple has made it a lot easier to change your primary Apple ID address, and you can do it right from your iPhone or iPad. (The web still works, too.) Here‚Äôs how you do it. Change your Apple Account primary email on your iPhone or iPad First, ensure your devices are running iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, or a later version. Open Settings, then tap your name at the top to access your Apple account settings Tap Sign-In \u0026 Security Tap the email address marked ‚ÄúPrimary email‚Äù Turn off the Primary Email switch to remove this as your main email. You‚Äôll be prompted to select a new primary email address, either from another email associated with your Apple Account or by adding a new one Follow the onscreen steps to enter and verify your new primary email address If you have a third-party email address (not an @icloud.com or @me.com address) associated with your Apple Account and you want to remove it, just select it and tap Remove from Account.

    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
