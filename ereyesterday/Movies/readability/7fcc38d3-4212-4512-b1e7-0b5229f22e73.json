  "text": "Patrick Schwarzenegger is thankful to share the screen with Walton Goggins. “The Staircase” and “Gen V” star Schwarzenegger appears alongside (although not particularly in any scenes with) Goggins in “The White Lotus” Season 3. Schwarzenegger shared the advice that Goggins gave him on set to Interview, and later reposted it with a caption, writing, “One of the best parts of being on a show like ‘White Lotus’ is getting to learn from other incredible actors. I look up to / respect Walton Goggins’ career. He told me this on set.” The Interview piece reads, “I got some cool advice from Walton Goggins on set. It was the first day of filming and I asked him if he still gets nervous. He was just like, ‘Yeah, I get nervous.’ And then, he kind of put his finger on my chest and said, ‘But, I never fucking question that I’m the right actor for this job, and I never fucking question my process and that I can go out there and crush it.'” Goggins previously told IndieWire that the ensemble cast become like a surrogate family during the six-month shoot. “When you are sequestered for six months and all you have is each other, one can imagine that people get very, very close and familial and you’re roughing it out in five star accommodations,” Goggins said. “But the experience is so creative and psychologically — it’s a psychological experiment as much as it is a creative endeavor because you are a guest and you’re an actor playing a guest, checking into a hotel, playing a guest who is a real human being, who is a guest checking into a hotel.” He added, “It’s the longevity of the experience and the intensity of the experience that you have to have some mental fortitude to get through. It is one of the greatest experiences I’ve ever had in my life. And I’m still kind of unpacking, as we all are, the things that we learned about each other and the things that we learned about ourselves.” Goggins additionally noted to the Los Angeles Times that making the show was “meta on every level.” “We spend all this time together, whether we like it or not, eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner,” Goggins said. “We work where we stay.” One of the best parts of being on a show like white lotus is getting to learn from other incredible actors.
