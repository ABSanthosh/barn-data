  "text": "Indonesian filmmaker Paul Agusta (“Onde Mande!”) is set to present his latest project “All Things Real and Unreal” (Segala Yang Semu Dan Nyata) at the inaugural JAFF Market, running alongside the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival, from Dec. 3-5. The drama follows Daniel, a 21-year-old college student from Manado, Sulawesi, who turns to sex work in Jakarta to finance his aspirations of social media stardom, despite having his basic needs and tuition covered by his single mother. The narrative unfolds over a day as Daniel, having spent his tuition money, desperately seeks funds through various means, from attempting to sell gifts from clients to seeking new encounters through dating apps. “I have always wanted to tell the story of male sex workers in Indonesia, specifically in the metropolis of Jakarta,” Agusta said. “Many of the male sex workers in Jakarta do not come from poverty, many come from middle class families.” Popular on Variety The director noted that the project stems from his observations of pressures facing young people today. “This current wave of youth has to deal with so much more than the previous generations. Blinded and pressured by what they perceive as the ideal lifestyle and social media fame and luxury, they are driven to live far beyond their means, and has led many to resort to sex work to fulfil their dreams.” Producer Bunga Ineza of Kapsul Waktu Studio emphasized the project’s examination of contemporary social issues. “It tells a deeply human and timely story about the pressures of modern society, particularly among young people navigating identity, materialism, and societal expectations in an era dominated by social media,” she said. At JAFF Market, the team aims to secure financing and identify co-production partners. They’re also seeking connections with film labs and pitching forums to advance the project’s development. Discussing the current landscape for Indonesian independent cinema, Ineza pointed to increasing opportunities through streaming platforms, international co-productions, and festivals. She noted that government cultural programs are supporting filmmaker participation in international labs, forums, and festivals, creating pathways to global networks. However, she acknowledged persistent challenges, including funding and distribution barriers, censorship concerns, and infrastructure limitations for emerging talent. “Filmmakers must balance local authenticity with global appeal, ensuring their stories resonate both at home and internationally,” Ineza said. The project, which is at the market’s Future Project platform, is being developed through a partnership between Kapsul Waktu Studio and Relate Films.",
