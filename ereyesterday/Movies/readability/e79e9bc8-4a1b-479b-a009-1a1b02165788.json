Delpero is the first woman to win the David di Donatello Best Director prize in the history of the awards, and only the third female filmmaker to win Best Film. The film picked up seven David di Donatellos in total which also included Best Original Screenplay, Casting, Producer, Cinematography and Sound. Set in a remote mountain village in 1944, Vermiglio revolves around a family whose life is disrupted by the arrival of a deserted soldier. The feature world premiered in Venice where it won the Silver Lion Grand Jury Prize and went on to be Italy’s 2025 Oscars submission. It was an historically strong night for female directors. Watch on Deadline Other big winners included Italian actress and singer-songwriter Margherita Vicario who won Best First Film, Composer and Song for feature directorial Gloria. The film, which debuted in the Berlin in 2024, is set in Venice at the end of the 1700s and revolves around an orphanage and music conservatory for girls, where the young charges are trained to the highest standard but denied the right to shine in the wider world. Valeria Golino’s The Art of Joy also performed well clinching Best Actress (Tecla Insolia), Supporting Actress (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi) and Adapted Screenplay. The drama follows a woman born into modest circumstances in Sicily in 1900, who goes on to navigate life in a convent, and then carves herself out a place in aristocratic household achieving happiness and emancipation in the process. It debuted as a Special Screening in Cannes. A big winner on the craft side was Gianluca Jodice’s French-language drama The Flood, starring  Guillaume Canet and Mélanie Laurent as Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. The historical drama won Best Art Direction, Costumes, Make-up and Best Hair. The ceremony unfolding in Theater 5 of Rome’s Cinecittà studios kicked off just hours after the beginning of the papal conclave in the Vatican City on the other side of the city, to decide the next head of the Roman Catholic Church following the death of Pope Francis. Despite recent a spike in popularity for Edward Berger’s timely drama Conclave, the film lost out to Sean Baker’s Anora in the Best International Film category.
