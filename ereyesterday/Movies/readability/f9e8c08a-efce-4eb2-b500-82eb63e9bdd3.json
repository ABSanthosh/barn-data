This has been a long time in the making! William Gibson's seminal sci-fi masterpiece was published in 1984, and Hollywood has been trying to adapt it and many of his other novels since then. It's finally happening. They've started shooting, and we'll actually get to see his cyberpunk world brought to life. From Skydance Television (also behind the the Foundation series) the series is created by Graham Roland \u0026 J.D. Dillard (best known as director of the films Sleight, Sweetheart, Devotion). The sci-fi series stars Callum Turner as Case, a data-thief, Briana Middleton as Molly, a street-samurai, with Joseph Lee as Hideo, Mark Strong as Armitage, ClÃ©mence PoÃ©sy, Peter Sarsgaard, Emma Laird, plus Max Irons and Dane DeHaan. The video reveals a small piece of the set - a look at The Chatsubo, or also Chat, a bar on Ninsei in Chiba City, a place mainly serving expats where Case spends time. That's all we get so far, but I'm hyped - I've got a very, very good feeling about this series. [â€¦]",
