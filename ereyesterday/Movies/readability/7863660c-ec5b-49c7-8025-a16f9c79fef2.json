Netflix, Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment and Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground emerged victorious over as many as 11 competing bids, multiple sources familiar with the deal told Variety. Amblin and Higher Ground will develop the book – described as a family crime drama —  as a TV series with Netflix backing.  Spielberg personally got involved to help bring the author over the finish line in recent days, two sources added. Representatives for all three companies did not immediately return Variety’s requests for comment. Veteran lit agent Lucy Stille represented Cosby in the sale process. The author’s popularity has exploded in recent years, as has his brand of Southern noir crime fiction. His previous works include “My Darkest Prayer,” “Blacktop Wasteland,” “Razorblade Tears” and “All the Sinners Bleed.” The latter is already in development with Amblin and Higher Ground, announced in June as another crime series.  Popular on Variety “King of Ashes,” which others involved in the auction noted had hints of “The Godfather,” will not hit shelves until next summer. The title will debut on the new Flatiron Books imprint Pine \u0026 Cedar. It will mark the first of a three-book deal he’s engaged in at Flatiron.",
