  "text": "Hannah Berner is unstoppable and giggling through life, hosting several podcasts, touring the U.S. with her comedy show, and appearing on TV shows like The Bachelor. The comedian recently talked to Deadline to share an update on the Giggly Squad podcast, how she ended up on ABC’s dating reality series, and if she would ever return to Bravo. Berner surprised the gigglers (fans of Giggly Squad) when she shared a video of her appearance on The Bachelor and, in an interview, told us how that came to be. “[The Bachelor reached out and] was like, ‘We’re doing a finance date.’ And I was like, ‘Then, why are you contacting me? I don’t even know algebra,’ but I got to wear a tie, so I was very invested,” Berner told us. “I was bossing everyone around. My job [on the show] was to give girls money when they got answers right, but I didn’t even know when the answers were right or not, so I just gave them all a ton of money, so I felt like it was a success for everyone. I had so much fun because I’m a Bachelor fan. I’ve been watching since college.” Watch on Deadline Since The Bachelor is on ABC, like Dancing with the Stars, we asked the comedian if she would ever see herself competing for the Mirrorball Trophy. “OK, I do have to say my husband did Dancing with the Stars in Ireland, and he loved it, and he talks about it. Maybe one day!” she said. “I do have to say I can’t touch my toes. so there would be no splits involved. I might just do the worm the entire time, which has never been done before. So I’d probably be out in the first round. Imagine I just do the worm every single and [the judges] are like ‘That’s not the waltz.'” Berner is a former tennis player who is quite competitive. We asked if The Traitors would be a good fit for her in the future, to which she said, “My good friend, Ciara [Miller from Summer House], is on The Traitors right now, and she’s killing it.” “I don’t know the rules of The Traitors, so I’d have to look it up, because I am quite competitive, and I wouldn’t want to just go and not know what I’m doing, but The Traitors has been killing it,” she added. “Alan Cumming is amazing. With competition reality shows. I get scared because I’m afraid I’ll get too competitive and cry on the first episode.” Berner has been touring the U.S. with her Giggly Squad podcast co-host Paige DeSorbo and their Club Giggly comedy show. The duo recently appeared in New York City to host a special episode at Lactaid’s Dairy Lovers Lounge pop-up. “I always talk about how I struggle with dairy since I was a little kid, but I’m not going to not eat dairy,” she said. One of the things that Berner said she likes to do after a show is to drink chocolate milk, making a call to “normalize” it. “I feel [with] Giggly Squad, it’s our responsibility to talk about the things that maybe people don’t want to talk about because I’m not avoiding quesadillas, I’m not avoiding chicken parm – It’s part of my culture. We are going to add new jokes into the show tonight, just for Lactaid,” she said of the special. Berner has opened up on her podcast about going to auditions and taking a shot at acting. Although the comedian jokes that she and DeSorbo “never set goals” about what they see themselves doing next, she does think there’s an idea to explore about adapting her podcast into a show. “We always just keep trying to make each other laugh. We do love [shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm], so I think there could be something funny there,” Berner explained. “I always joke that Paige is an amazing actress. You’ve seen her in Summer House, and I feel like she could really nail a role. We’re very open to just creating new, fun stuff.” She continued, “[For] both of us, we never like to put each other in a box. We just want to try new things, and we never like to be told that we can’t do something, so we thrive on that kind of stuff.” Berner recently met her Bravo’s Chat Room co-host, Porsha Williams, for the first time in person. The comedian and the Real Housewives of Atlanta star recorded the short-lived talk show remotely during the pandemic and had never met in real life. “It’s crazy. I hadn’t seen Porsha in person ever, because [Chatroom was filmed all during COVID] on Zoom. So we were like, ‘How is this possible?’ I had so much fun with Portia, and she’s so funny,” Berner said. Berner left Summer House in 2021 after three seasons to focus on her comedy career, which has exploded ever since. With her newfound fame away from Bravo, Berner left the door open to explore possibilities with the network if they ever asked her to return. “I love creating, so it doesn’t matter where it is – if it’s a great show, I’m always down to clown,” she said. Berner also has a solo standup tour and is trying out new material in comedy clubs around the U.S., adding, “[I’m] getting it together so that I’m ready to do a theater tour. So, right now, I’m going to Alabama next weekend to keep working on it and trying to develop that hour. Once I’m proud of it enough, I’ll go to theaters [and] try to get another special.” “[I’m also] really into acting right now,” she continued. “I’m auditioning [and] I’m writing some stuff, so I’m excited to see where that goes.”",
