  "text": "James Marsden is looking to make his biopic debut — and has his sights set on Mickey Blue Eyes. “Paradise” actor Marsden told The Post that he aspires to portray Frank Sinatra onscreen in a feature similar to Oscar-winning 2004 Ray Charles biopic “Ray.” “To do a biopic like what Jamie Foxx did with Ray Charles would be a lot of fun,” Marsden said. “I would love to. And you’re actually using your singing voice, as well.” Marsden previously sang in 2007 films “Enchanted” and “Hairspray,” the latter of which Marsden deemed to be like a “Broadway show” to film. He added that “Hairspray” was a “joyous” production akin to attending a “party.” Perhaps a Sinatra biopic could be the same. “I’ve always loved emulating some of the old crooners, like Bobby Darin and Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin,” Marsden said of potentially playing Sinatra. “I always thought there were so many interesting stories of Frank Sinatra’s life that could be played. And for whatever reason, you’ve never really seen a movie about him.” Marsden continued, “I just think there’s so many stories that could be told about that man — some of the really tortured and darker stories, and some uplifting ones as well. What he did, what he accomplished. I’ve never really done a biopic about somebody.” Marsden may not have to wait too long for Sinatra’s story to be told onscreen…but he might have to fight for the lead role. Martin Scorsese has long been developing a Sinatra biopic with Leonardo DiCaprio in talks to lead. Jennifer Lawrence was being eyed to portray Ava Gardner, who was Sinatra’s second wife after Nancy Barbato. The project has since been placed on hold. Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” screenwriter Paul Schrader also voiced his desire to direct a Sinatra biopic, with Kevin Spacey portraying the singer. Schrader told Variety in May 2024 that he had been in contact with Spacey about him playing an elderly Sinatra for a yet-announced film. However, any biopic would most likely have to get approval from Sinatra’s daughter Tina Sinatra, who controls her late father’s estate. Variety reported that the estate hasn’t yet approved any film adaptation of Sinatra’s life story as of April 2024.",
