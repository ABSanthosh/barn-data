GKids Films has unveiled a brand new teaser trailer for the 4K remastered re-release of the other Japanese Gojira movie recently known as Shin Godzilla. This one originally debuted in 2016, opening in Japan and US the same year, also under the original title Godzilla: Resurgence. It was the first big Japanese reboot of Godzilla in a long time, and it was handed to iconic filmmakers Hideaki Anno \u0026 Shinji Higuchi (who later went on to direct Shin Ultraman \u0026 Bullet Train Explosion) to re-imagine. So they gave us this strange, new, gilled lizard creature instead of the typical Gojira kaiju – it wasn't exactly a big hit in the US. After the immense success of Godzilla Minus One, GKids got their hands on a new 4K remaster and will give it another shot. With a re-release in US theaters this August. \"Something has surfaced in Tokyo Bay...\" As the Prime Minister pleads with the public to remain calm, a horrific creature of tremendous size makes landfall in the city, leaving death and destruction in its wake. Then it evolves. Starring Hiroki Hasegawa, Yutaka Takenouchi, Satomi Ishihara. I remember watching this back in 2016 and being let down by it, but it does have its fans. Though I'm not sure a 4K polish will make the movie that much better. Take a look. Here's the new 4K remaster trailer (+ poster) for Anno \u0026 Higuchi's movie Shin Godzilla, from YouTube: You can rewatch the original 2016 trailer for Toho's Shin Godzilla movie right here, for the first look again. \"A god incarnate. A city doomed.\" It's a peaceful day in Japan when a strange fountain of water erupts in the bay, causing panic to spread among government officials. At first, they suspect only volcanic activity, but one young exec dares to wonder if it might be something different... something alive. His nightmare comes to life when a massive, gilled monster emerges from the deep and begins tearing through the city, leaving nothing but destruction in its wake. Shin Godzilla, also called Godzilla: Resurgence or Shin Gojira or シン・ゴジラ, is directed by Japanese filmmaking legends Hideaki Anno (of Neon Genesis Evangelion) and Shinji Higuchi (known for his visual FX for the Gamera trilogy). The screenplay is credited to Hideaki Anno, inspired by the original Gojira (1954). Shin Godzilla first opened in Japan on July 29th, 2016 and October that year in the US. GKids will re-release Anno \u0026 Higuchi's Shin Godzilla in 4K in US theaters again on August 14th, 2025 later this summer. For more details, visit their official site. Ready to watch again?
