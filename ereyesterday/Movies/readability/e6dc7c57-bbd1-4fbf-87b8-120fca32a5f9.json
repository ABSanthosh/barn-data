  "text": "The recently released teaser for the upcoming The Fantastic Four: First Steps has fans buzzing with excitement to catch Marvel’s first family on the big screens. While the teaser manages to establish the film’s setting without giving away many plot details in an effective manner, a few sequences in the video featuring Vanessa Kirby’s Sue Storm have piqued the viewers’ interest, with many speculating that the character is pregnant. So, here’s what you need to know about if the theory regarding the Invisible Woman’s pregnancy holds any ounce of credibility. Is Vanessa Kirby’s Sue Storm pregnant in The Fantastic Four: First Steps? At the time of writing, Marvel Studios has yet to officially confirm if Sue Storm is pregnant in The Fantastic Four: First Steps. The rumor comes after many eagle-eyed viewers pointed out certain peculiarities in the Fantastic Four’s official teaser. One scene in the video showcases Joseph Quinn’s Johnny Storm jetting off into the sky from a balcony after activating his fiery form. Nevertheless, in the background, Pedro Pascal’s Reed Richards is seen escorting Sue Storm inside the building while she holds on to her stomach as if she were pregnant. Check out the The Fantastic Four: Family Steps teaser below: Moreover, at the 45-second mark, a concerned Reed tries to comfort Sue, who seems to be facing some issues in controlling her powers. However, the ordeal suspiciously looks like the Invisible Woman is giving birth, further fueling rumors that she could be pregnant in the movie. Meanwhile, Vanessa Kirby herself dodged the question about her embracing motherhood in The Fantastic Four: First Steps. During a recent appearance on Good Morning America, the actress stated, “You’ll have to wait and see.” Nonetheless, the most definitive argument to support this theory is the role that Franklin Richards, the son of Reed Richards and Sue Storm, plays in the Secret Wars event in the comics. Incidentally, or as planned by Marvel, the MCU’s ongoing multiverse saga will also conclude with 2027’s Avengers: Secret Wars. As such, it would be the perfect time to introduce and build Franklin’s character in The Fantastic Four: First Steps before he takes center stage in the aforementioned Avengers sequel. Despite all the speculations, there is no way to validate that Sue Storm will be pregnant in the forthcoming MCU film until it hits the theatres on July 25, 2025.",
