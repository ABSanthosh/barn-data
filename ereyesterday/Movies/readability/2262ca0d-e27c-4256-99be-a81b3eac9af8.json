The next installment is scheduled to make its Peacock debut on April 17 with the first two episodes, followed by a new episode every Thursday. In addition, a special telecast of the season premiere will also air on NBC on April 17 at 10 p.m. ET/PT. “Season 5 explores the dangerous worlds of cross-border smuggling, high-tech domestic terrorism and a crime family intent on repaying Stabler for the injury he did them in Rome. As his worlds collide, Stabler will put everything on the line to protect the vulnerable and fight for justice,” reads the logline for the latest installment. Check out the Law \u0026 Order: Organized Crime Season 5 trailer below (watch more trailers): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nBCMz7dUCs Mariska Hargitay guest stars in Law \u0026 Order: Organized Crime Season 5 The video teases the highly-anticipated reunion between Law \u0026 Order vets Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni, with Hargitay guest-starring as Olivia Benson in the second episode of Season 5. This marks Hargitay’s latest appearance in the spin-off after three years since appearing in multiple episodes of Season 3. The teaser trailer also features Meloni’s Stabler getting seriously injured from one of his assignments this season. Law \u0026 Order: Organized Crime is created by Dick Wolf, Ilene Chaiken, and Matt Olmstead. In addition to leading the cast, Meloni is also executive producing alongside Wolf, Olmstead, John Shiban, Mike Slovis, Peter Jankowski, and Tim Walsh. The series also stars Danielle Moné Truitt as Ayanna, Ainsley Seiger as Jet, Rick Gonzalez as Bobby, Dean Norris as Randall, and more. It is a production by Universal Television and Wolf Entertainment. “Reprising the role he originated on Law \u0026 Order: SVU, Meloni stars as Det. Elliot Stabler, who returned to New York after a decade abroad to rebuild his life following a devastating personal loss. As lead detective in Sgt. Ayanna Bell’s Organized Crime Control Bureau, he works to dismantle New York’s most vicious and violent illegal enterprises while fending off dangers that often follow him home,” reads the show’s official synopsis. “Helping to expose the dark and complex criminal world of their targets are undercover expert Bobby Reyes and tech genius Jet Slootmaekers. While on assignment, Stabler leans on his brother Randall to keep the Stabler family safe and thriving.”",
