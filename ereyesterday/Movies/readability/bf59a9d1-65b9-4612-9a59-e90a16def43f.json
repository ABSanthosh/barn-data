  "text": "Angelina Jolie has played many a real-life figure throughout her Oscar-winning career, from supermodel Gia Carangi (“Gia”) to journalist Mariane Pearl (“A Mighty Pearl”) and now opera singer Maria Callas (“Maria”). But she’s not interested in having her own life story become a big screen biopic. Asked by The Sunday Times what an Angelina Jolie biopic would look like, the real Jolie quickly shut the topic down. “That gets the most insane question award,” Jolie responded. “When you’re a public person and you’re playing [someone else], you’re conscious of how you would hate for somebody to interpret your life or think they understand your life, so we tried to be thoughtful [with Maria]. Let’s hope there isn’t one about my life.” Jolie is currently a frontrunner to land an Oscar nomination for best actress thanks to her work in “Maria,” which centers on the opera singer’s final days as she drifts through memories of her acclaimed and turbulent career. The actor learned to sing opera in order to record her live vocals on set. Popular on Variety “I walked into room with the piano, and somebody said, ‘Ok, let’s see where you’re at.’ And I got really emotional. I took a big deep breath, and I let out a sound, and I started crying,” Jolie previously told Variety about doing her own singing. “I think we all don’t realize how much we hold inside our bodies, and how much we carry and how much that affects our sound and our voice and our ability to make sound.” “I’ve been holding a lot for a long time, and that beginning and that sound, and then when that sound would eventually come, it was the best therapy I’ve ever had,” Jolie continued. “Honestly, I think I would tell a lot of people before you try therapy and spend too much time there, go to singing class.” Jolie went on to say that singing opera helped her confront her own feelings about her life as “it brings up certain emotions that you may have not wanted to confront, and there’s no way to sing at your full voice and your full emotion without confronting your feelings and your limitations.” “Maria” streams Dec. 11 on Netflix.",
