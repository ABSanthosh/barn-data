  "text": "Ahead of Severance Season 2’s premiere on January 17, it has been announced that executive producers Ben Stiller and Adam Scott will be hosting a companion Severance podcast. Besides Stiller and Scott, they will also be accompanied by several guests, including some of the cast and crew, as well as celebrity fans of the show, such as Jon Stewart. When is the Severance podcast release date? The Severance podcast is scheduled to launch its first two episodes on January 7, which will feature the hosts tackling the first season of the acclaimed sci-fi drama series. While waiting for the Season 2 premiere, the following Season 1 episodes will be released daily on weekdays through January 16. Afterward, new episodes will be released weekly on Fridays throughout the second season of Severance. “We have severed ourselves from the world for five years making this show. While we have no memory of what happened during that time, we thought we should do a podcast for all the Innies who will have no recollection of watching in an attempt to reintegrate them with their memory of the show,” Stiller and Scott said in a joint statement (via Variety). “We’re happy not to be working with Lumon Industries on this podcast and instead to be bringing it to the world with Audacy Podcasts, who would never send us to the break room.” The Apple TV+ series was created and written by Dan Erickson, who’s also serving as an executive producer along with director Ben Stiller. In addition to Scott, Season 2 will also feature returning cast members Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Zach Cherry, Jen Tullock, Michael Chernus, Dichen Lachman, Emmy Award winner John Turturro, Christopher Walken, and Patricia Arquette. They will be joined by new cast members Sarah Bock, Bob Balaban, Robby Benson, Stefano Carannante, Gwendoline Christie, Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, John Noble, Alia Shawkat and Merritt Wever.",
