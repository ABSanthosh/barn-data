  "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger was completely unfazed watching his son Patrick Schwarzenegger‘s nude scene at the Monday night premiere of “The White Lotus” Season 3. “I was so pumped to take a break from filming to celebrate [Patrick Schwarzenegger] at the ‘White Lotus’ Season 3 premiere,” the “Predator” star wrote on Instagram Tuesday. “What a show! I could claim to be surprised to find out he has a nude scene, but what can I say – the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. Don’t miss it this Sunday – trust me.” In the new season of the HBO drama, Patrick Schwarzenegger plays Saxon, the son of a wealthy Southern family. Other cast members include Jason Isaacs, Parker Posey, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola, Tayme Thapthimthong, Lek Patravadi, Michelle Monaghan, Carrie Coon, Julian Kostov, Leslie Bibb, Shalini Peiris, Walton Goggins, Aimee Lou Wood, Arnas Fedaravičius, Natasha Rothwell, Dom Hetrakul and Blackpink member Lisa. Variety exclusively reported that “White Lotus” had been greenlit for a fourth season ahead of the Season 3 premiere. After Season 2 ended, series creator Mike White mused that the third season “would be maybe a satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality. It feels like it could be a rich tapestry to do another round at ‘White Lotus.’” Popular on Variety Variety‘s TV critic Alison Herman described “White Lotus” Season 3 as “quite literally the biggest yet,” noting a significant uptick in production value. She writes, “Season 3 of ‘The White Lotus’ may boast the most spectacular location yet, augmented by off-property adventures in Bangkok, at dance clubs and on palatial yachts — the kind of expensive, extra-crowded environments that were a distant dream back in the [Season 1] Hawai’i days.”",
