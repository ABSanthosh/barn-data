  "text": "JoJo Siwa can take a joke when it comes to her style, but don’t knock her moves. After Chloe Fineman reprised her impersonation of the ‘Karma’ artist on Saturday Night Live this month, Siwa said the comedian “nails it every time” with her impersonation on the NBC sketch comedy show, but she had one tip. “I think she needs to be a little more full out in the dance, but other than that, everything was perfect,” Siwa told People of Fineman’s impression on the Nov. 14 episode, in which she auditioned for Wicked as the Dance Moms alum. Watch on Deadline She admitted she hasn’t personally complimented Fineman on the performance, “but I do need to reach out and tell her that I’m honored again.” Siwa unveiled her new look earlier this year on the music video for her single ‘Karma’ in April, donning a Kiss-esque black jeweled bodysuit with matching heavy metal makeup. The dramatic transformation inspired Fineman to debut her impression on the ‘Weekend Update’ sketch on May 4. The latest sketch saw Fineman in the bodysuit, accessorized with a pink tulle cape and matching face paint, as she began singing the movie musical’s track ‘Popular’ in her best Siwa voice with some signature Siwa dance moves. “I may be a good witch, but I’m still a bad girl,” said Fineman before busting out some more moves. Fineman joined the cast of SNL during Season 45 in 2019, and she’s become known for her celebrity impersonations of Drew Barrymore, Timothée Chalamet, Anna Delvey and more.",
