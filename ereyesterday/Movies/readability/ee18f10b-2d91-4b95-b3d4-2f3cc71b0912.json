  "text": "Broadcast and cable networks went to special reports on Thursday for Israel‘s attack on Iran, with reports that nuclear sites were targeted. The Israel defense minister said in a statement that the strikes were “preemptive,” news outlets reported. On ABC News, anchor Linsey Davis went to Marcus Moore in Tel Aviv, where he was in a shelter. “The tension has already been high across the region,” Moore said, adding that air raid sirens went off, given the expectation that Iran would launch retaliatory strikes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, “Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region. Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense. President Trump and the Administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners. Let me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.” Watch on Deadline CBS News also had a special report with John Dickerson anchoring, with a feed of Press Tv showing explosions in Tehran. NBC News provided a crawl on the broadcast network, but later went to a special report with Gadi Schwartz anchoring and going to Richard Engel . There was continuous coverage on cable news networks and on the broadcasters’ streaming channels. More to come.",
