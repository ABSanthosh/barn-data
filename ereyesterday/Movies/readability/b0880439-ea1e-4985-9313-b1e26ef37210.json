The third installment was originally slated for a March 2024 release. However, it was ultimately delayed and removed from Sony Pictures‘ current theatrical calendar. At the moment, the highly-anticipated animated threequel has no release date yet. What did Brian Tyree Henry say about the Beyond the Spider-Verse ending? Henry, who has been lending his voice to the role of Miles’ father Jeff Morales since 2018’s Into the Spider-Verse, has shared his thoughts about the potential ending of Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse. He believes that the film won’t have a happy conclusion at the end, teasing fans to expect an emotional story. “Look, it takes time, but we got to make you wait a little bit. You know what I mean? But it’s coming. It’s coming,” Henry said (via Variety). “There’s not going to be a dry eye in the house. I’ll tell you that. Good luck. It’s not going to wrap up in a nice little bow.” Disney+ Has the Best Bundle in the Business Sign-up today for access to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ Sony Pictures most recently announced that Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse will now be directed by Bob Persichetti and Justin K. Thompson. This comes after it was rumored that the project’s original script was reportedly scrapped by the studio. The voice cast consists of Shameik Moore as Miles Morales, Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy, Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker, Nicolas Cage as Spider-Noir, John Mulaney as Spider-Ham, Issa Rae as Spider-Woman, Daniel Kaluuya as Spider-Punk, Karan Soni as Spider-Man India, Oscar Isaac as Spider-Man 2099, Jason Schwartzman as The Spot, Brian Tyree Henry as Jefferson Davis, Luna Lauren Velez as Rio Morales, and more.",
