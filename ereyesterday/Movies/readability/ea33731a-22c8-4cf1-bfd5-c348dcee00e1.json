The new game was announced during Summer Game Fest in Los Angeles on Friday, complete with a trailer drop, which came as a surprise after developer Capcom teased the “Resident Evil” franchise’s upcoming 30th anniversary and a ninth game earlier in the presentation — but didn’t include any new footage or release date. “Thanks to all of you, ‘Resident Evil’ is about to celebrate its 30th anniversary this coming March,” Capcom game director Jun Takeuchi said in a video message. “We truly appreciate your continued support. Now, about the latest ‘Resident Evil’ game you’ve all been waiting for, bear with us a little longer, just a blink of an eye more, and it’ll be ready. We’re incredibly grateful for your ongoing support of the ‘Resident Evil’ series.” Popular on Variety About 20 minutes later, the “Resident Evil Requiem” trailer and release date was the final piece of news revealed before the SGF 2025 show ended. The survival horror game will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S and Steam on Feb. 27, 2026. The last “Resident Evil” game, “Resident Evil Village,” launched in 2021 as the eighth installment in the franchise. The original “Resident Evil” was created by Shinji Mikami and Tokuro Fujiwara for PlayStation and debuted in 1996. In addition to spawning multiple followup games, “Resident Evil” has been adapted for TV and film franchises. Watch the trailer for “Resident Evil Requiem” in the video below.",
