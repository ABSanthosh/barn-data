  "description": "\"You don't remember me?\" Neon has unveiled a first look teaser trailer for the new genre film titled Alpha, the third feature from French filmmaker maestro Julia Ducournau. This is her highly anticipated follow-up to Titane, which won the Palme d'Or in 2021 when Spike Lee was head of the jury. She's back again 4 years later with her next feature - filmed in Le Havre in the north of France. It's described as her \"most personal, profound work\" yet - the rest of the plot is being kept a secret. Alpha, a troubled 13-year-old lives with her single mom. Their world collapses the day she returns from school with a tattoo on her arm. What does it all mean? We'll know soon. Starring Mélissa Boros as Alpha, with Golshifteh Farahani as Maman, Tahar Rahim, Emma Mackey, and Finnegan Oldfield. The film is premiering tonight at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival in the Main Competition - which is why this teaser is out now. Stay tuned for initial reactions \u0026 reviews very soon. Good news is Neon will release this later in 2025, and I expect they'll be putting all their weight behind it just like with her film Titane […]",
