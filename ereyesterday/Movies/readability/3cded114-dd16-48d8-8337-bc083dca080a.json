But what’s the story behind this clash of titans? Here’s everything you need to know: details about the fight’s location, the eye-popping payouts, and the unique campaign that’s bringing this spectacle to life. Conor McGregor and Logan Paul fight details leak Conor McGregor and Logan Paul will face off in a highly anticipated boxing match scheduled for 2025. The Ambani family will host the event at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium as part of India’s “Visit India” tourism campaign. As per reports, each fighter will earn an impressive $250 million. Although there is no specific date yet, early agreements suggest the fight is moving forward. McGregor announced his involvement on social media, while Logan Paul hinted at the bout by sharing training clips. This will be McGregor’s second professional boxing match since his 2017 fight with Floyd Mayweather Jr. Meanwhile, Paul last competed against Dillon Danis in 2023. The Ambani family, known for ventures in telecom and sports, hopes to position India as a destination for global sporting events. The fight is a key part of the “Visit India” campaign, which aims to boost tourism and highlight India’s rich heritage. However, the fight isn’t without challenges. Conor McGregor remains under contract with the UFC, which must permit the match to proceed. Moreover, UFC CEO Dana White has reportedly indicated McGregor’s interest in returning to the Octagon by late 2025, potentially complicating matters. Hence, legal battles could ensue if the UFC does not approve the event. If finalized, this event will likely draw massive global attention, bringing combat sports and India’s tourism campaign into the spotlight. Fans and analysts await further updates on the Conor McGregor vs Logan Paul match as 2025 commences.",
