Apple TV+ will be releasing this movie; we've yet to see if they'll be sending it to theaters (perhaps it'll play at a film festival or two this fall?) or just dropping it streaming directly later in the fall. Inspired by real events, The Lost Bus is a white-knuckle ride into one of the deadliest wildfires as a wayward school bus driver (Matthew McConaughey) and school teacher (America Ferrera) battle to save 22 children from the terrifying inferno. The film explores more of what went wrong in California's Camp Fire, America's deadliest wildfire in a century (85 were killed), and how to prevent future tragedies, also including the story of a bus driver and school teacher who helped kids through the blaze. In addition to McConaughey and Ferrera, the cast includes Yul Vazquez, Ashlie Atkinson, and Spencer Watson. Yet another new wildfire movie following Kosinski's Only the Brave (in 2017) and the doc Rebuilding Paradise [â€¦]",
