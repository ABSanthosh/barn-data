With the recent release of Episode 10, fans are curious to know if they can expect additional episodes from the television series. Here’s all you need to know about the possibility of more episodes of Transplant Season 4. Transplant Season 4 Episode 11 release date and time explained There isn’t a Transplant Season 4 Episode 11 release date and time. This is because the fourth installment had a total of 10 episodes. The fourth season was having a rerun. However, Season 4 originally concluded last year in January. So, it is safe to assume there aren’t any extra episodes lined up. Has Transplant Season 4 ended? Yes, Transplant Season 4 has finished. The fourth installment ended on January 19, 2024, with the rerun concluding on July 17, 2025. Furthermore, there won’t be any more seasons for Transplant. It was previously announced that the fourth season would be the last, and creator Joseph Kay confirmed planning the series to be a four-season work. The last episode saw June and Novak trying to resolve their differences, while Theo risked his life for a patient. On the other hand, Bash took charge during an emergency, concluding the television series by showcasing just how far he had come from when he first started at York Memorial. Where to watch previous Transplant Season 4 episodes You can watch Transplant Season 4 episodes via NBC and Peacock. Following its premiere on NBC, the episodes were streamed the next day on Peacock. The latter is NBCUniversal’s streaming platform, launched to offer a blend of on-demand movies and TV shows. This includes classics like The Office and Parks and Recreation, new NBC and Bravo titles’ episodes, and originals such as The Traitors and Poker Face. The series’ synopsis reads: “Dr. Bashir Hamed, a Syrian doctor with battle-tested skills in emergency medicine, makes the difficult decision to flee his country and build a new life in Canada with his younger sister Amira. Bash works to navigate a new environment after earning a coveted residency in the Emergency Department of one of the best hospitals in Toronto, York Memorial.”",
