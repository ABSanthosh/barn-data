  "text": "If you heard that a new 20-screen complex was about to hit New York City, you’d expect that it would likely be a cluster of large rooms screening a Nicole Kidman commercial dozens of times a day. But Tim League, the man behind the film lovers’ favorite Alamo Drafthouse, has something entirely different in mind. Coming soon — exact date to be determined — Metro Private Cinema will provide an experience that lives up to its name. “It’s a night out,” League told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview. “If you’re going to casually catch ‘The Legend of Ochi,’ you’re probably going to go to the IFC Center, you’re going to go to the Alamo, to the AMC. But if you want to have what we’re trying to create, a very special experience with dinner, friends and a movie, I think there’s an audience for it here.” Upon the opening in Chelsea, moviegoers will be able to choose a theater ranging in size from four to 20 seats — and we mean comfy, fancy chairs and sofas. Then they can choose the movie and a gourmet menu. The movie, too, doesn’t need to be a current release. Patrons can select a favorite from a large library of retro offerings, as well. The meals will be only the finest — THR’s coverage cited “stone fruits, heirloom tomatoes, and summer squash” as samples. League, too, said that they hope to offer “cinematic adventures,” as well, with themed meal experiences for popular titles. Its website already lists dining menus for “Superman,” “Goodfellas,” and even the fall release “Wicked: For Good.” “Whenever we’ve done that type of thing at Alamo, it’s been some of my favorite moments and we’re just trying to go even further,” he explained. It’s not a typical night at the theater. Instead, it’s a movie night that someone else is in charge of cleaning up. That said, it is pricey. The food is $100 per person — not including alcohol. The rooms range from $200 to $600 or even more, depending on the party size. League, who stepped down as Alamo Drafthouse‘s leader in 2020, has long advocated for creating unique experiences for film fans. In 2017, he penned an editorial for IndieWire expanding on his position. “Cinemas are in the business of offering an incredible, immersive experience that you simply cannot duplicate at home,” he wrote. “Our job is to put on a show and provide a great value proposition for getting out of the house, turning off your phone and enjoying great stories in the best possible environment. At our best, cinemas should also be local community centers with a real, tangible relationship to their surrounding neighborhood.” One difference, League said, with this new chain is that people will now be able to text and talk (an Alamo Drafthouse no-no), since they won’t be in a theater with other strangers. “It’s just you’re a worse person if you do.” Metro Private Cinema is anticipated to open in September 2025.",
