  "text": "Macaulay Culkin’s net worth in 2024 has constantly grown despite him taking a break from acting in the past. As the holiday season is ongoing, his Home Alone movies are considered the most popular watch among fans during Christmas and New Year time. Naturally, they are keen to learn how much wealth he has amassed over the years. Here is how much money Macaulay Culkin has earned and what are the different sources of his income. What is Macaulay Culkin’s net worth in 2024? Macaulay Culkin has a speculated net worth of $18 million in 2024. Culkin’s net worth in 2024 consists of earnings from his work in movies, music, and also, real estate. The actor is most famous for his performance in the Christmas comedy film franchise, Home Alone. What does Macaulay Culkin do for a living? Macaulay Culkin is an actor and musician by profession. Most recently, Culkin has been cast in a recurring role in the second season of the Prime Video series, Fallout. It is based on popular video games of the same name created by Bethesda Softworks. Macaulay Culkin’s earnings explained — how does he make money? Macaulay Culkin earns money from several acting projects and his music career. With his entry into the acting scene, Culkin emerged as one of the highest-earning child actors of all time. Although he started in the industry with a salary of $40,000, for the first Home Alone movie, he took a salary of $100,000. Following its huge success, with Home Alone 2, the actor became a household name and bagged $4.5 million to reprise his role. This led to him bagging roles in movies like Getting Even with Dad, and Richie Rich, for which he got $8 million each. Given the evergreen popularity of the Home Alone franchise, he likely receives a major sum in royalties to date. Additionally, Culkin made a comeback in 1998 and starred in movies like Saved!, Changeland, and more. Later, he explored his talents even further and started a music band, The Pizza Underground, which split in 2016. Macaulay Culkin is also the CEO and publisher of his satirical pop culture website called Bunny Ears. More recently, he appeared in Season 10 of American Horror Story, AKA Double Feature.",
