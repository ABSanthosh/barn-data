  "text": "Bitters End has acquired international sales rights for “Two Seasons, Two Strangers,” the latest feature from Japanese director Sho Miyake, ahead of the Cannes film market. With three decades in the business, Bitters End has established itself as a leading Japanese distributor, handling films from internationally acclaimed filmmakers including Ryusuke Hamaguchi, Bong Joon-Ho, the Dardenne brothers, and Jia Zhangke. Recent acquisitions include “Anora,” “Sex/Love/Dreams,” “Caught by the Tide,” “La Chimera,” and “Perfect Days.” The company also produces and was behind the Academy Award-winning “Drive My Car.” “Two Seasons, Two Strangers” stars Korean actor Shim Eun-kyung (“Miss Granny,” “The Journalist”) alongside Japanese actor Shinichi Tsutsumi (“Always: Sunset on Third Street”). Currently in post-production, the project is targeting a November domestic release in Japan. Popular on Variety Miyake has built a strong festival reputation with previous works including “All the Long Nights” (Berlinale 2024), “Small, Slow But Steady” (Berlinale 2022), “And Your Bird Can Sing” (Berlinale 2019), and “Playback” (Locarno 2012). His contemplative, emotionally nuanced storytelling has established him as a significant voice in contemporary Japanese cinema. The new film adapts works by celebrated manga artist Yoshiharu Tsuge, “Mister Ben of the Igloo” and “A View of the Seaside.” The narrative follows Li, a screenwriter played by Shim, who embarks on a journey of self-reflection following a chance meeting with Benzo (Tsutsumi). Through her writing process, she explores meaningful moments of human connection. “It was so fascinating that it sometimes felt overwhelming,” Miyake said about adapting Tsuge’s distinctive material. “I have a strong feeling that something truly new is taking shape.” Bitters End will handle both international sales and Japanese distribution for the film, which is co-produced by Culture Entertainment, Sedic International, and TheFool. The company’s Cannes lineup features additional titles including “Linda Linda Linda 4K,” a restored version of Nobuhiro Yamashita’s cult favorite celebrating its 20th anniversary, which will have its world premiere at Tribeca; “After the Quake,” Tsuyoshi Inoue’s adaptation of Haruki Murakami short stories; and “White Flowers and Fruits,” the debut feature from Yukari Sakamoto, produced by “Drive My Car” producer Teruhisa Yamamoto.",
