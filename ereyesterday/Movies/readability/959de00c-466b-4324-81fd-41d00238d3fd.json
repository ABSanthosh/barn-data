  "description": "\"I was there when took his last breath...\" Chilling. Vertical has unveiled the trailer for Sharp Corner, a thriller made by Canadian filmmaker Jason Buxton. This first premiered at the 2024 TIFF last year, and it also played at the most recent Rome, Glasgow, and San Francisco Film Festivals. A dedicated family man named Josh becomes obsessed with saving the lives of the car accident victims on the sharp corner in front of his house – an obsession that could cost him everything. A troubled man begins to spiral, consumed by the fatal car crashes caused by the sharp corner in front of his house. As his sick obsession takes hold, he places his wife and son in jeopardy, threatening to permanently break the family apart. Sharp Corner stars Ben Foster, Cobie Smulders, Gavin Drea, \u0026 William Kosovic. This obviously should remind anyone of Cronenberg's Crash film, but without the sexual intrigue, thoguh even more unsettling as he breaks down. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Jason Buxton's thriller Sharp Corner, direct from YouTube: On the night they move from the city into a sprawling suburban home, parents Josh (Ben Foster) \u0026 Rachel (Cobie Smulders) are jolted by a […]",

Vertical has unveiled the trailer for Sharp Corner, a thriller made by Canadian filmmaker Jason Buxton. This first premiered at the 2024 TIFF last year, and it also played at the most recent Rome, Glasgow, and San Francisco Film Festivals. A dedicated family man named Josh becomes obsessed with saving the lives of the car accident victims on the sharp corner in front of his house – an obsession that could cost him everything. A troubled man begins to spiral, consumed by the fatal car crashes caused by the sharp corner in front of his house. As his sick obsession takes hold, he places his wife and son in jeopardy, threatening to permanently break the family apart. Sharp Corner stars Ben Foster, Cobie Smulders, Gavin Drea, \u0026 William Kosovic. This obviously should remind anyone of Cronenberg's Crash film, but without the sexual intrigue, thoguh even more unsettling as he breaks down. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Jason Buxton's thriller Sharp Corner, direct from YouTube: On the night they move from the city into a sprawling suburban home, parents Josh (Ben Foster) \u0026 Rachel (Cobie Smulders) are jolted by a car crashing into the tree on their front lawn, killing the driver and also injuring his passengers. And once Josh discovers the accidents are a regular occurrence due to the design of the road, he becomes obsessed with being ready to save the next victims... to the exclusion of everything else. Foster holds us in a state of queasy apprehension as Josh’s impulsive, sanctimonious dedication to learning CPR and policing the street start to form a pattern of privileged overconfidence — or maybe it’s deluded competence. Foster has played tightly wound characters before, but it is a higher, unsettling gear. Sharp Corner is written and directed by Canadian filmmaker Jason Buxton, his second feature film after directing Blackbird previously, as well as many other short films as well. It's based on the short story by Russell Wangersky. Produced by Paul Barkin, Jason Buxton, Jason Levangie, Susan Mullen, Marc Tetreault. This first premiered at the 2024 Toronto Film Festival last year. Vertical will debut Buxton's Sharp Corner in select US theaters + on VOD starting May 9th, 2025 coming soon. Curious?
