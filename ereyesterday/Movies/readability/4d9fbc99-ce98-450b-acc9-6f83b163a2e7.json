Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Annie Bradley's film Montana Mavericks, from CW's YouTube: Heather (Katherine McNamara) is a New York City girl and a best-selling author on a mission to conquer writer's block and avoid paying back an advance on her next book.

Heather and her friends find more than they bargained for in this big sky love adventure. Montana Mavericks is directed by Canadian filmmaker Annie Bradley, director of the films I'm Going to Break Your Heart, Meet Me at Christmas, The Killer I Picked Up, and episodes of series \"In the Dark\" and \"Spellbound\" previously.
