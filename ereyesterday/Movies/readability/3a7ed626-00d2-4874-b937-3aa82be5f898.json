  "text": "Sony has been silent over the days since Blake Lively filed sexual harassment and retaliation claims against her It Ends With Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni, but now the movie’s distributor is speaking out as more and more of Hollywood offers support for the Gossip Girl alum “We have previously expressed our support for Blake in connection with her work on and for the film,” a spokesperson for the studio said Monday afternoon after SAG-AFTRA made a public full throated backing of Lively as more and more details of a Crisis PR smear campaign against the actress emerged.. “We fully and firmly reiterate that support today. Further, we strongly condemn any reputational attacks on her. Any such attacks have no place in our business or in a civil society.” Late last week, IEWU star/producer Livley filed a graphic and text messages illustrated complaint against Baldoni, along with his company Wayfarer Studios and others with California’s Civil Rights Department. While not formally a lawsuit, Lively’s action is a clear tip of the legal hat of an official filing in the courts to follow. After the claims of sexual harassment, retaliation and a social media campaign allegedly orchestrated to smear Lively, Baldoni was abruptly dropped from their mutual agency WME [which also reps Lively’s husband Ryan Reynolds] on December 21. Watch on Deadline Besides a very specifically detailed list of misconducts by Baldoni and his Wayfarer co-founder on the 2023 set of the film baed on Colleen Hoover’s 2016 toxic and violent relationship novel of the same name and attempts to straighten things out once the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes of last year were over, Lively’s 10-claim complaint puts the invisible hand and tactics of Crisis PR in a harsh spotlight. To be very specific, Lively and her lawyers allege that Baldoni’s personal rep Jennifer Abel, former of Joneswork, and  the pricey Melissa Nathan, and her company The Agency Group PR LLC teamed up to for an online and media “astroturfing” of the actress and destroy her reputation as rumors started getting out that all was not good on the movie and the interactions between its leads. Though Baldoni’s lawyer Bryan Freedman adamantly denies any wrongdoing on his client’s part, the matter seems to be escalating quickly with many Hollywood A-listers flocking to Lively’s side and further industry blowback against Baldoni.
