  "text": "Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Elena Rose is bringing the sunshine to spring with “Carteras Chinas” (“Chinese Handbags”), new pop song featuring Camilo and cumbia group Los Ángeles Azules. Over a combination of Latin pop and cumbia beats, Rose uses her skills as a storied songwriter — she’s co-written hits for Becky G, Selena Gomez, Daddy Yankee, Jennifer Lopez and Christina Aguilera, to name a few — to shine a light on love and unity. The single was released Thursday with alongside a music video that features its guests. Rose begins the video by attempting to complete the song’s main chorus. Popular on Variety Throwing in the towel, Rose and her collaborator leave the studio, but Rose gets distracted by the sound of bouncing cumbia beats in a trailer behind them. She uncovers the six-member cumbia group inside, and thus begins her journey to Camilo and to finishing “Carteras Chinas.” “There are so many lies/There are so more Chinese handbags/Than people who love with their hearts,” Rose sings in Spanish. Camilo follows, singing, “But that’s why we’re here, you and I.” The Venezuelan songstress released her debut LP, “En Las Nubes – Con Mis Panas,” in November but she closed the year earning four Latin Grammy nominations for another collaboration, the Danny Ocean and Jerry Di- featuring “Caracas en el 2000,” an ode to their home country. Elena is also riding on the success of “Orion,” a song she shared with Panamanian singer-songwriter Boza. The song became both artists’ first top 10 single (No. 4) on Billboard’s Latin Pop Airplay chart in October. Watch the video below.",
