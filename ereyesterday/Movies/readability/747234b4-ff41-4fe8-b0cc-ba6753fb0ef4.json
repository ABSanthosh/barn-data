  "description": "\"I am waiting for contact...\" Mongrel Media \u0026 Saban Films have unveiled the official trailer for The Last Spark of Hope, a Polish post-apocalyptic survival thriller marking the feature debut of filmmaker Piotr Biedron. The film played at the 2023 Octopus \u0026 Gdynia Polish Film Festivals, and Trieste Science+Fiction Festival in Italy, and is just now getting a VOD release in the US this spring. A woman named Eva (aka Ewa In Polish), who may be the last human on Earth, struggles to survive with only her robot companion in a lonely, post-apocalyptic reality. As she battles the harsh realities of her existence, the stakes intensify when her once-trusted robot turns against her. She doesn't have the password to enter and is trapped. Starring Magdalena Wieczorek and Jacek Beler. The robot in this looks like a funny character - reminds me of Johnny 5 from Short Circuit. Even though I think they're going for a Polish version of that Tom Hanks sci-fi movie Finch. Not sure if this will be any good, but it's worth a look at least – should be entertaining enough.

Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Piotr Biedron's The Last Spark of Hope, direct from YouTube: Imagine our future Earth: Humanity has lost in the climate wars and there is probably only one person left on Earth - it is a woman called Ewa (Magdalena Wieczorek). She is accompanied by a robot whose job is to guard the boundaries and not let anyone in who does not know the password. One day Ewa goes to repair the solar panels. On her return she gives an incorrect password as it is updated every three months and she didn't check her new password. The robot, despite knowing Ewa, does not let her in. The woman finds herself in a stalemate. She is trapped on a small patch of land, between the solar panels and robot. Her next fight for survival begins. The Last Spark of Hope, also known as W nich cala nadzieja in Polish or The Last Human, is written and directed by Polish indie filmmaker Piotr Biedron, making his feature directorial debut after a few other short films previously. Produced by Beata Pisula. This initially premiered at the 2023 Octopus Film Festival a few years ago, and it also played at the Trieste Science+Fiction Festival in Italy and already opened in Poland cinemas in late 2023. Saban Films debuts Biedron's The Last Spark of Hope direct-to-VOD in the US starting April 29th, 2025 coming soon this spring. Anyone want to watch?
