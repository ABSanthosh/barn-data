Apple TV has debuted a funny new TV spot for their upcoming series arriving in March called The Studio. This wacky series is one big riff on Hollywood, making fun of movie studios and the egotistical executives who work at these places. The series follows a legacy Hollywood movie studio striving to survive in a world increasingly difficult for art \u0026 business to thrive together. \"The job is a meat grinder.\" Ain't that the truth. Seth Rogen stars as Matt Remick, who takes over Continental Studios. Desperate for the approval of celebrities, he \u0026 his team of executives at Continental must juggle corporate demands with creative ambitions as they try to keep movies alive and relevant. The Studio cast includes Catherine O'Hara, Kathryn Hahn, Ike Barinholtz, Chase Sui Wonders, with Bryan Cranston, Keyla Monterroso Mejia, and Dewayne Perkins. This new promo spot also features cameos from Johnny Knoxville and Josh Hutcherson (in a fake dumb zombie movie called Duhpocalypse).

This new promo spot also features cameos from Johnny Knoxville and Josh Hutcherson (in a fake dumb zombie movie called Duhpocalypse). The original teaser was better - still can't wait to watch this when it's out soon. Here's the fun Super Bowl TV spot for Evan Goldberg \u0026 Seth Rogen's series The Studio, from YouTube: You can rewatch the teaser trailer for Rogen \u0026 Goldberg's The Studio series right here for more footage. In The Studio, Seth Rogen stars as Matt Remick, newly appointed head of embattled Continental Studios. As movies struggle to stay alive and relevant, Matt and his core team of infighting executives battle their insecurities as they wrangle narcissistic artists and craven corporate overlords in the ever-elusive pursuit of making great films. With their power suits masking their never-ending sense of panic, every party, set visit, casting decision, marketing meeting \u0026 award show presents them with an opportunity for glittering success or career-ending catastrophe. As someone who eats, sleeps and breathes movies, it's the job Matt's been pursuing his whole life, and it may very well destroy him. The Studio is a series created and directed by comedy masterminds / filmmakers Evan Goldberg \u0026 Seth Rogen, both directors of This is The End, The Interview, and episodes of \"Preacher\" previously. It's also created and written by Alex Gregory, Peter Huyck, Frida Perez, with Goldberg \u0026 Rogen. Showrun by Alex Gregory \u0026 Peter Huyck. Executive produced by Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, James Weaver, Alex McAtee, Josh Fagen, Alex Gregory, Peter Huyck. Apple will debut The Studio series streaming on Apple TV+ starting March 26th, 2025 coming soon. Who's in? Find more posts in: Streaming, To Watch, Trailer, TV Spots",
