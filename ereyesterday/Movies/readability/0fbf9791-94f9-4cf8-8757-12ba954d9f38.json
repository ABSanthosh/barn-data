The 18-track collection, initially scheduled for release in 2022, features the track “SCIFI,” which notably incorporates elements from Kim Kardashian’s Saturday Night Live monologue. Without further ado, here are all the details for fans to know about West’s new album and its tracklist. Kanye West’s new album tracklist details Kanye West’s new album, Donda 2, features several cameos of artists like Future, Playboi Carti, and Jack Harlow. The rapper dropped the eighteen-track album on Tuesday, April 29, after months of teasing several other musical projects, including Bully. Here’s the complete tracklist of Donda 2: TRUE LOVE (ft. XXXTENTACION) BROKEN ROAD (ft. Don Toliver) GET LOST KEEP THE FLOWERS TOO EASY PABLO (ft. Travis Scott, Future) MR MIAGI (ft. Future, Playboi Carti) HAPPY (ft. Future) SECURITY CITY OF GOD (with Fivio Foreign ft. Alicia Keys) 530 SCIFI (with Sean Leon) BURN EVERYTHING (with Sean Leon) LOUIE BAGS (ft. Jack Harlow) WE DID IT (ft. Baby Keem, Migos) MAINTENANCE (ft. Future) LORD LIFT (ft. Vory) FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME (ft. Soulja Boy) In the Donda 2 track, “SCIFI,” Kanye West included his former wife Kim Kardashian’s famous SNL monologue. At the beginning of the track, she says, “I married the best rapper of all time. Not only that, he’s the richest Black man in America. A talented, legit genius who gave me four talented, incredible kids.” West previously revealed to fans that his daughter, North, has ignited his passion to make new tracks. In a now-deleted Instagram post in January 2025, he detailed how his daughter has made him “love music” again. The rapper added, “She asked me to make beats for her. I got back on the ASR Chopped up beats for her album and chopped every beats with my bare hand for BULLY.” (via Page Six) Meanwhile, the “Jesus Is Lord” singer’s 2021 album, Donda, achieved significant commercial success. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and marked West’s tenth chart-topping project. Moreover, the album placed him among just seven artists in Billboard history to reach this milestone.",
