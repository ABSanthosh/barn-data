  "text": "Billboard Women in Music 2025 SPOILER ALERT: Details follow for Season 13, Episode 8 of “The Masked Singer,” “Boy Band Night,” which aired April 2 on Fox. Wu-Tang is for the children, and “Masked Singer” welcomes audiences young and old as well. On Wednesday’s “Boy Band”-themed episode of the hit Fox competition, Method Man was the next celebrity to be unmasked, as he was revealed to be the voice under the “Stud Muffin” costume. “I may not be in a boy band, but I know what it’s like to be a part of a brotherhood,” Method Man said in his pre-taped package as Stud Muffin, referring to Wu Tang Clan. “We grew up together, blew up together. There was no limit to what we could do. But when you’ve got a good thing going, people try to poison it. But at the end of the day, nothing can come between me and my team. Now tonight I’m singing a song from one of my favorite groups. They once sent me a birthday message, so this is my gift to them.” He performed “Poison,” by Bell Biv DeVoe, on the episode. For Stud Muffin, Rita Ora got it right with Method Man, and Robin Thicke agreed. Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg named M.C. Hammer. Ken Jeong went with 2 Chainz. “Becoming Stud Muffin makes sense because I’ve had a muffin time the majority of my life,” Method Man as Stud Muffin said during his voiceover last week. “I’ve always said, if I could have any dream job, I would be a mascot. You get people pumped up and nobody knows who you are! So that’s why I’m here as Stud Muffin, to rep my team. I learned from day one having a strong crew is the only way to score. But before we were sweeping up the competition, I was sweeping up the floors. Literally. Until I found my right hook and my shot at the big time. Me and my crew went from the muffin bottom to the muffin top. But we’re still those hungry players we were from the jump. Now, this Stud Muffin is here to hype you all up. Because I’m here to win.” Method Man as Stud Muffin joins Candace Cameron Bure as Cherry Blossom, James Van Der Beek as Griffin, Flavor Flav as Space Ranger, Sheana Shay as Bat, Aubrey O’Day as Ant, Oscar de la Hoya as Fuzzy Peas and Cedric the Entertainer as Honey Pot as the celebrities unmasked on “The Masked Singer” Season 13. “Boy Band Night” kicked off with the Group C performers singing “Everybody (Backstreet’s Back),” by the Backstreet Boys. This episode was part of the Group C competition, which will ultimately end with two more contestants moving on to the “Lucky Six.” So far, that group includes Group A winners Coral and Paparazzo, and Group B winners Pearl and Boogie Woogie. Back for Season 13 are host Nick Cannon, alongside panelists Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, Rita Ora and Robin Thicke. Ora was at the desk for a third consecutive season to fill in for Nicole Scherzinger. New this season, a mysterious masked character dubbed “Detective Lucky Duck” will appear throughout the season to give clues and help the panelists “quack” the case of who’s under the masks. This week, Season 2 winner Wayne Brady appeared to give a clue to “my travel buddy, Stud Muffin. Here it is: He has shared the stage with Ken.” Also new: The “Crack the Case” clue cases, in which more clues are shared about the eliminated contestant. For Stud Muffin, the clue was a street sign that said, “Stud Muffin District.” “They named a whole street after us, me and my crew. Whomever drives down that street is proof that I existed.” “The Masked Singer” Season 13 themed episodes include a tribute to franchises “Shrek” and “Ghostbusters,” as well as the Grand Ole Opry as it hits its 100th anniversary. Also on tap are a tribute to the Rat Pack and themes such as “Voices of Olympus: Unmasking of the Gods,” “Carnival,” “Boy Bands,” “Decades,” “Lucky 6 Speed Guessing,” a “Clash of the Masks” and the return of “Soundtrack of My Life.” Masked contestants in Season 13 include Honey Pot, Space Ranger, Cherry Blossom, Coral, Fuzzy Peas, Ant, Paparazzo, Griffin, Boogie Woogie, Pearl, Bat, Yorkie, Stud Muffin, Nessy and Mad Scientist Monster. Watch the unmasking of Method Man here: Here were the performances on Wednesday’s Episode 8, “Boy Band Night”: Nessy, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Nessy Song: “Tearin’ Up My Heart,” by *NSYNC Panel guesses: Dave Matthews, Darius Rucker, Pat Monahan Nick Cannon T-shirt cannon clue: Shot by *NSYNC’s Chris Kirkpatrick (Season 8’s Hummingbird), who thought it was a country singer: A t-shirt featuring Nessy in a heart. “Just like a boy bander, I was also known for my love songs.” Nessy voiceover: “This is so unexpected. I never thought I’d be singing a boy band song. But look at me. I’m committed to the bit, and I love a good theme night. Back in the height of the boy band days, music was so competitive. I was fighting these guys for TRL spots, charts and CD sales. But there was one boy band that kept getting in my way. *NSYNC. We always seemed to be neck and neck, and it tore up my heart when those boys constantly came out on top. So when we faced off at a celebrity golf tournament, I knew it was my time to settle the feud once and for all. I’m gonna win, and then I played the worst game of my life. I crashed and burned. While they may have had a better score, I got to raise a glass with those guys, and we had a pretty good time. I realized, just being in the game is huge. What a cool club we’re all a part of. Now all these years later, I kind of miss that friendly competition, which is why I’m loving being here. So this one is for you, *NSYNC. Can’t wait to hear you guys sing one of my songs next.” Previous song: “Roxanne,” by The Police Previous panel guesses: Gene Simmons, Dan Reynolds, Daryl Hall Stud Muffin, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Song: “Poison,” by Bell Biv DeVoe Panel guesses: Method Man, M.C. Hammer, 2 Chainz Nick Cannon T-shirt cannon clue: Shot by Omarion (Season 5’s Yeti) T-shirt with “Ingredients: Dash of sugar, sprinkle of flour, a Grammy of gold.” “All the ingredients were there. I’m extra proud of this one.” Stud Muffin voiceover: “Listen up. I’m gonna bake up a little history on boy bands for you. Pay attention, Jenny. Before NKOTB, Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, it started with crooners like the Temptations, the Four Tops, who inspired groups like Boyz II Men, New Edition, Bell Biv DeVoe. Now, I may not be in a boy band, but I know what it’s like to be a part of a brotherhood. We grew up together, blew up together. There was no limit to what we could do. But when you’ve got a good thing going, people try to poison it. But at the end of the day, nothing can come between me and my team. Now tonight I’m singing a song from one of my favorite groups. They once sent me a birthday message, so this is my gift to them.” Previous song: “Jump Around,” by House of Pain Previous panel guesses: Method Man, Shaquille O’Neal, Michael Jordan Yorkie, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Yorkie Song: “Step By Step,” by New Kids on the Block Panel guesses: Teresa Giudice, Paris Hilton, Erika Jayne Nick Cannon T-shirt cannon clue: Shot by Chris Kirkpatrick: T-shirt that says, “touring up my heart.” “My life has been a comedy and a tragedy. But right now it’s real good. Yeah, I’ve been around, all around the world!” Yorkie voiceover: “Sure, the boy band golden era was fabulous. But nothing makes headlines more than a boy band scandal. And oh honey, I know a thing or two about that myself. When this New Yorkie broke onto the scene, baby I was adored. Until I found myself wrapped up in a major scandal, paying for someone else’s choices, someone I loved. My name was in the news, the gossip sites, even on the billboards around town. And let’s be real, I was dragged through the dirt. But I stayed true to myself and did everything I could to keep my chin up. I’m most proud of that. And as it always does, the truth came out. Life can be messy. Love can be messier. But you can also survive. Once you have a strong foundation, you can rebuild step by step and come out stronger. And I’m proof of that.” Previous song: “Hot To Go!,” by Chappell Roan Previous panel guesses: Chelsea Handler, Paris Hilton, Kyle Richards Mad Scientist Monster, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Mad Scientist Monster Song: “I Swear,” by All-4-One Panel guesses: Alan Jackson, Tim McGraw, Keith Urban Nick Cannon T-shirt cannon clue: Omarion shoots the cannon. T-shirt says “BTS BSB.” “It’s an honor to have won the same award as both Backstreet Boys and BTS.” Mad Scientist Monster voiceover: “Everybody loves a hunky boy bander, but there’s more below the frosted tipped surface. At their core, boy bands are about chemistry. And I know a little something about that. When I met my boo, it was festive fall evening, gathered around a Friendsgiving table, and when our hands brushed passing the cranberry sauce, sparks flew. I swear, right then and there, I knew I’d marry that girl someday. But seasons passed, until one sweltering summer day we reconnected, and I serenaded her until her Bunsens were burning. I made her a promise I’d never leave her side, for better or worse. Now here’s an epic boy band love song for that woman I made a promise to, my wife.” Previous song: “Unwell,” by Matchbox Twenty Previous panel guesses: Luke Combs, Luke Bryan, Blake Shelton In Season 12, Boyz II Men (as the Buffalo) won the Masked trophy, beating out Mario, as the Wasp, who was this season’s runner-up.

Pay attention, Jenny. Before NKOTB, Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, it started with crooners like the Temptations, the Four Tops, who inspired groups like Boyz II Men, New Edition, Bell Biv DeVoe. Now, I may not be in a boy band, but I know what it’s like to be a part of a brotherhood. We grew up together, blew up together. There was no limit to what we could do. But when you’ve got a good thing going, people try to poison it. But at the end of the day, nothing can come between me and my team. Now tonight I’m singing a song from one of my favorite groups.
