  "text": "Kieran Turner, a documentary filmmaker who created the web series “Wallflowers,” died Dec. 23 in West Hollywood. He was 56. Turner’s death after a battle with cancer was confirmed by Christy Grosz, president of CLG3 Communications. In addition to creating “Wallflowers,” Turner wrote and produced the online web series which ran for two seasons from 2013 to 2014 and followed four friends who join a support group to help them get dates. The show starred Gibson Frazier, Sarah Saltzberg, Christianna Tisdale, Susan Louise O’Connor and Ricky Dunlop and is now streaming on Dekkoo. Through his independent production company Eight Track Tape Productions, which works in both film and television, Turner directed and produced the documentary “Jobriath A.D.” about the ‘70s glam rock musician who died of AIDS. The production company specializes in telling LGBTQ+ related stories both fictional and non-fictional. Popular on Variety While working at Cinemarket, Turner helped finance and market films like “Terminator Salvation,” “Love \u0026 Mercy,” “From the Rough,” “Very Good Girls” and “Dylan Dog: Dead of Night.” Turner’s first feature film “24 Nights,” which he directed, wrote and produced as his New York University graduate thesis, was picked up for distribution by TLA Releasing. His screenplay “Black Dogs” made the 2022 Black List and is currently in development with Star Thrower Entertainment. At the time of death, Turner was working on “Ghost Lights: Reclaiming Theater in the Age of AIDS,” a documentary detailing the impact of the AIDS epidemic in theater. Turner is survived by his cousins on the East Coast and his “close chosen family of friends.”",
