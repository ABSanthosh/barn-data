  "text": "UPDATED with latest: Olivia Rodrigo is the latest powerhouse joining the FireAid benefit concert. The news, first reported by TMZ and later confirmed by Rolling Stone, also includes additions Peso Pluma and Stevie Wonder. PREVIOUS, Jan. 17: Following No Doubt‘s Coachella reunion last year, Gwen Stefani is getting the band back together once again for a good cause. After The Voice coach was previously announced as part of Live Nation’s star-studded FireAid benefit concert, the Anaheim-bred ska group has also signed on for the performance. Watch on Deadline “JUST ADDED: NO DOUBT. January 30th,” FireAid announced Saturday on Instagram, which Stefani shared to her story with a white heart emoji. PREVIOUS, Jan. 16: As Southern California begins to rebuild in the wake of the wildfires, some of Hollywood’s biggest talents are coming together in support. On Thursday, Live Nation announced Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish and Finneas, Jelly Roll and Green Day as some of the headliners for the FireAid one-night-only benefit concert, which will take place Thursday, Jan. 30 at 6pm at Intuit Dome and Kia Forum. The lineup also includes Earth, Wind \u0026 Fire, Gracie Abrams, Gwen Stefani, Joni Mitchell, Katy Perry, Lil Baby, P!nk, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rod Stewart, Sting, Stephen Stills, Stevie Nicks, Tate McRae, and performing together for the first time, Dave Matthews and John Mayer. Additional artists will be announced soon. Hosted by Live Nation with AEG Presents and the Azoff family, FireAid will raise money for rebuilding communities devastated by wildfires and supporting efforts to prevent future fire disasters throughout Southern California. Tickets go on sale Wednesday, Jan. 22 at noon PT via Ticketmaster. FireAid will be broadcast by select AMC Theatres, Apple Music and the Apple TV app, Max, iHeartRadio, KTLA+, Netflix/Tudum, Paramount+, Prime Video and the Amazon Music Channel on Twitch, SiriusXM, SoundCloud, Veeps and YouTube.

Applications are open for grants up to $5,000, available to people working in the music industry that are dealing with expenses related to displacement. “L.A. is home to so many who help make live music possible, and Crew Nation is continuing its core mission of helping this hardworking community through unforeseen hardship,” said Michael Rapino, president and CEO of Live Nation Entertainment, in a statement. Stars like Paris Hilton, Milo Ventimiglia, Adam Brody, Leighton Meester and Billy Crystal have lost their homes in the wildfires, which broke out in the Pacific Palisades, Eaton Canyon, Malibu, the Hollywood Hills and other areas around Los Angeles County amid a “life-threatening and destructive” windstorm that picked up last week. As of Wednesday, at least 25 people have died in the Southern California wildfires. Meanwhile, more than 105,000 people have received mandatory evacuation orders. Since the fires started, officers have made 44 arrests across the impacted areas, including for arson, burglary, breaking curfew and other violations. President Joe Biden, who extended his Los Angeles trip last week to visit first responders and those affected, declared the fires a major disaster and directed the federal government to cover 100% of costs for disaster assistance.",
