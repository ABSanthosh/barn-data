Months after May’s passing, the reality TV star posted a collection of photos taken during a past lake trip with close friends.  So, here’s everything fans need to know about the details surrounding May’s demise and Kardashian’s tribute in her memory. Kim Kardashian posts a tribute for her friend Lindsay May The Kardashians star has paid tribute to her late friend, sharing a heartfelt message on social media months after her passing. On July 6, Kim Kardashian remembered Lindsay May, who died of cancer in November 2024. She posted a series of personal photos on Instagram from a previous lakeside getaway with their close-knit friend group.  “Happy Heavenly Birthday, Lindz,” Kardashian began. Noting that while May didn’t like attention on her birthday, she continued, “I waited months to post this, mostly because I couldn’t find the right words. Nothing really captures how quiet and empty our lifers chat feels without you in it.” The American Horror Story actress also acknowledged May’s dislike for public attention, especially since she wasn’t active on social media. However, she added, “But I couldn’t go through this lake trip without feeling you everywhere, and I needed to share it.” Moreover, Kim Kardashian described the lake as a place May cherished, writing, “The lake was your happy place. It made you feel lighter, healthier… you were you.” Calling the lake their “favorite lifers tradition,” she expressed how deeply she felt Lindsay’s absence. The SKIMS founder wrote, “We felt your absence this year in every sunset, every laugh, every quiet moment.” Reflecting on moments from a year ago, Kardashian expressed gratitude for the memories they shared. “Looking back at these pictures from a year ago, I feel so grateful for all the memories we made. Our world is not the same without you. I guess that’s why I hold onto this lake tradition so tightly,” she added. Previously, Kim Kardashian had confirmed Lindsay May’s passing on June 17 through her Instagram Story.",
