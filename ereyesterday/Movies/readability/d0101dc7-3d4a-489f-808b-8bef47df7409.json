  "description": "\"I feel like I don't fit...\" Lionsgate has revealed an official trailer for a coming-of-age film titled I Wish You All The Best, arriving in theaters this November. It premiered at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival last year, and is based on the novel of the same name written by Mason Deaver. Described as a \"sweetly funny journey of self-discovery that celebrates the power of being true to yourself\" and is the feature directorial debut of actor Tommy Dorfman. The film follows Ben DeBacker, a non-binary teen who is thrown out of their house and forced to move in with their estranged older sister, Hannah, and her husband, Thomas. Struggling with anxiety, they come out only to Hannah, Thomas, and their art teacher, Ms. Lyons, while trying to keep a low profile at their new school. Ben's attempts to survive junior year unnoticed are thwarted when Nathan, a funny \u0026 charismatic student, decides to take Ben under his wing. Starring Corey Fogelmanis as Ben, with Alexandra Daddario, Cole Sprouse, Miles Gutierrez-Riley, Amy Landecker, and Lena Dunham as Ms. Lyons. This definitely looks sweet and charming, with some good reviews far. Opening later this year. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) [â€¦]",

This definitely looks sweet and charming, with some good reviews far. Opening later this year. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Tommy Dorfman's film I Wish You All The Best, from YouTube: In this refreshingly modern coming-of-age story based on the best-selling book from Mason Deaver, a high school junior (Corey Fogelmanis) comes out as nonbinary and is thrown out of their family's home. With nowhere else to turn, they move in with their estranged older sister (Alexandra Daddario) and her husband (Cole Sprouse). After enrolling in a new school, they find support from an eccentric art teacher (Lena Dunham) and form an unexpected bond with a kindhearted student (Miles Gutierrez-Riley). With the help of their new relationships, they navigate the awkward hurdles of young adulthood in this sweetly funny journey of self-discovery that celebrates the power of being true to yourself. I Wish You All The Best is both written and directed by American actress / writer / filmmaker Tommy Dorfman, making her feature directorial debut with this film after appearing in \"13 Reasons Why\" previously. Adapted from the novel of the same name written by Mason Deaver. It's produced by Matt Kaplan and Tommy Dorfman. This initially premiered at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival last year. Lionsgate will debut Dorfman's I Wish You All The Best film in US theaters starting November 7th, 2025 later this fall. Anyone interested in watching?
