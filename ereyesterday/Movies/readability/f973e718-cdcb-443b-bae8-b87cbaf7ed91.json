  "text": "If you haven’t already, today is a great time to figure out what movie you want to see over the Fourth of July weekend and buy your tickets. And if you’ve already locked down your seats for “F1” or “40 Acres” this weekend, why not buy some movie tickets for July 4th, 2026? Angel Studios has announced that its upcoming film “Young Washington,” a biopic about America’s first president from “House of David” creator and “Jesus Revolution” director Jon Erwin, will patriotically roll into theaters on America’s 250th birthday. The faith-based media company and “Sound of Freedom” distributor, which is co-producing the film with Wonder Project, already has tickets available for purchase through its ticketing platform on Angel.com. The studio is so excited about the project that tickets went on sale before a single camera rolled on the film. Production on “Young Washington” is expected to begin later this summer, with no word yet on who will be cast as George Washington. “Our shared commitment to inspirational, powerful storytelling made ‘Young Washington’ an easy project to partner on with Wonder,” Angel Studios president Jordan Harmon said in a statement.  “George Washington helped shape our nation and so many of the American values we hold dear. I can’t imagine a more meaningful way to celebrate America’s 250th birthday than by watching this adaptation of such a pivotal period in his young life.”  “I’ve dreamed of telling the powerful origin story of George Washington for nearly a decade. It’s a story of a true pioneer, which makes it the perfect project to partner on with the pioneers at Angel and their world-class distribution network,” Erwin said. “’Young Washington’ isn’t just a film — it’s a celebration of the American spirit and the miracle of the forging of our nation.”  No showtimes or theater locations have been announced yet, so the tickets available to purchase today merely guarantee you a seat at a showing near you, with the promise of a refund if you end up being too far away from one. Purchasers will be able to select specific showtimes and seats closer to the release date. The early ticket sales are being marketed as a way for diehard Angel fans to ensure that the film opens in as many theaters as possible. And as an added bonus for those still on the fence, purchasing tickets enters you in a contest to win a Ford F-250 pickup truck.",
