  "text": "With the fifth and final season of The Boys approaching, Eric Kripke has something special in store for fans of his work. Soldier Boy actor Jensen Ackles recently teased his reunion with Supernatural co-stars Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins ahead of the Prime Video series’ concluding episodes, for which their characters have not yet been revealed. “We see each other more often than you would think — honestly, at least once a month,” he told People after they starred in Kripke’s CW series for 15 seasons from 2005 to 2020. Watch on Deadline Ackles added, “It was weird. It was like inviting my friends over to somebody else’s house for dinner. I was like, ‘Listen, guys, don’t make me look bad. I got to stay here.’ They were amazing. I can’t wait to talk more about it because it was quite an experience.” After Kripke expressed his desire to work with Padalecki on the concluding season of The Boys, the actor told Deadline he’s in. “The answer is yes,” he said last June. Jensen Ackles as Soldier Boy on ‘The Boys’ (Jasper Savage/Amazon/Courtesy Everett Collection) “We have talked [about a role]. As a matter of fact, we talked today,” added Padalecki. “I think at this point in my acting life, I only want to work on projects that I really care about or with people that I really care about, and obviously Eric and I are indelibly connected forever.” After Ackles joined the series as Soldier Boy during Season 3, his and Padalecki’s Supernatural onscreen dad Jeffrey Dean Morgan appeared as Joe Kessler via Billy Butcher’s hallucination in Season 4. This week, Kripke bid farewell to The Boys set as he wrapped the finale. “It’s bittersweet, but my primary feeling is gratitude,” he wrote in part. “We have the best cast, the best crew, the most fun story to write, and something that is impossible to predict: the right timing. You wait your whole career to have maybe two of those things, if you’re lucky. We got all of them.” The final season of The Boys, premiering in 2026, comes after Season 4 topped the Nielsen streaming scores for the first time, setting multiple records for Prime Video.",
