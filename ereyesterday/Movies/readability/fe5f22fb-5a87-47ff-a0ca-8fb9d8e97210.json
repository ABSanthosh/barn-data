Netflix has unveiled an official trailer for the crime thriller titled Straw, the latest Tyler Perry film created for streaming on Netflix as part of his deal with the film studio. This will be out in June - his second film this year following Duplicity for Prime Video a few months ago. In Straw, Taraji P. Henson a single mother who watches her desperate day spiral into chaos. Sounds like that title is a reference to the idiom about \"the last straw.\" She becomes the prime suspect in a crime she never meant to commit—suddenly, her survival depends on the one thing she’s never been able to trust: the people around her. \"She finds herself in a horrible situation where one of those days, you wake up and everything that could go wrong, goes wrong.\" The film also stars Sherri Shepherd, Teyana Taylor, Sinbad, Rockmond Dunbar, Ashley Versher, Mike Merrill, and Glynn Turman. This doesn't seem like Tyler Perry's typical thrillers, I just hope he wrote her a good way out of this bank robbery predicament.
