Is there a trailer for The Sex Lives of College Girls Season 3? Yes. The trailer arrived in October. What happened in The Sex Lives of College Girls Season 2? Season 2 picked up after the Fall Break at Essex, introducing the girls to the winter weather and more new challenges during their freshman year. Season 3 will take place at the start of sophomore year. In Season 2, Leighton Murray (Reneé Rapp) came out to all of her roommates and embraced her sexuality by openly pursuing women. She dealt with chlamydia, but the STI didn’t stop her from also pursuing her other college goals, like getting accepted to Kappa Beta Rho, her mother’s sorority. She ultimately rejected the invitation, though. She also struck up a relationship with tennis player Tatum (Gracie Dzienny), but by the season’s end, she gets back together with Alicia (Midori Francis). Kimberly Finkle (Pauline Chalamet), lost her scholarship at Essex after she cheated on an exam, but she refused to tell her parents, leaving her in quite the pickle. Among other things, she tries to sell her eggs to make money to maintain her spot at the school. Ruby Cruz and Mia Rodgers in ‘The Sex Lives of College Girls’ Season 3 She also has a fling with Jackson (Mitchell Slaggert), a new student from Kansas, but she eventually realizes her feelings for her coffeeshop co-worker Canaan (Christopher Meyer), her roommate Whitney’s (Alyah Chanelle Scott) ex-boyfriend. Whitney ultimately decides to move into the Kappa house, despite initial hesitations due to her heavy schedule for sophomore year, after she spots Kimberly and Canaan kissing one night. This spells out some tension for the core four come Season 3, as it looks like they’ll no longer be roommates. Bela Malhotra (Amit Kaur) started girls-only comedy magazine The Foxy after Fall Break, and she also went from a friends with benefits arrangement with her arch-rival Eric (Mekki Leeper) — editor-in-chief of The Catullan which has launched many an Essex alum into their comedy careers — to a real relationship, though that unfortunately unravels. Bela also served as student liaison to Dan O’Connell, late-night host and Essex alum. That doesn’t last long, though, because Eric poaches the position from Bela at a frat party, and it is eventually revealed that Bela cheated on Eric and slept with Dan in order to get an internship with him. The Foxy decided to kick her out, and by the end of the year, she applied to transfer schools, leaving her fate at Essex up in the air as well.
