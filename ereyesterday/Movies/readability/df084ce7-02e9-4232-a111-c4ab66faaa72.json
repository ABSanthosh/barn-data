  "description": "\"By closing the Gates of Hell, you'll be saving them, too!\" Hopefully. ðŸ’€ Vertical just revealed another new official trailer for the movie Home Sweet Home: Rebirth, also written the opposite as Rebirth: Home Sweet Home. It's made by two VFX supervisors directing together, adapted directly from the video game called Home Sweet Home - a single-player, first-person survival/horror/puzzle video game from Thailand. They turned a big, crazy, supernatural horror video game into live-action movie set in Thailand. When a city is overrun with a demonically-possessed crowd of violent people, a cop must uncover the source of evil to save his family (and sure everyone else). Starring Michele Morrone, William Moseley, and Urassaya Sperbund. To save the city, and his trapped family, Jake must ally himself with a mysterious Novice Monk and embark on a journey through the supernatural world of \"The Hindrance\" to shut the Gates of Hell. I am surprised to see that this US trailer does not show the giant skeleton monster in it at all. Even though it's on the poster and in the UK trailer many times, yet in this trailer they don't even hint at it. Huh. Very strange... Here's the official US trailer [â€¦]",

Even though it's on the poster and in the UK trailer many times, yet in this trailer they don't even hint at it. Huh. Very strange... Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Hacker \u0026 Kiesl's Home Sweet Home: Rebirth, via YouTube: You can rewatch the other full UK trailer for Rebirth: Home Sweet Home right here for even more footage. This supernatural action horror based on the hit video-game franchise is off-the-wall madness. American cop Jake (starring William Moseley), who whilst on holiday with his family in Thailand, is thrust into a supernatural world after interrupting a mass murderer's ritual that opens the literal Gates of Hell. When demons escape, possessing people on the streets, the city is thrown into chaos. To save the city, and his trapped family, Jake must ally himself with a mysterious Novice Monk and embark on a journey through the supernatural world of The Hindrance to shut the Gates of Hell. This supernatural action horror movie Home Sweet Home: Rebirth is co-directed by two VFX artist / filmmakers Steffen Hacker (also director of Ingenium) \u0026 Alexander Kiesl (of a few other shorts as well). No writing credits are listed. Produced by Dean Altit, Steffen Hacker, Alexander Kiesl, and Pakin Maliwan. Vertical will release the Rebirth: Home Sweet Home movie direct-to-VOD in the US starting April 11th, 2025 this spring. Anyone want to watch?
