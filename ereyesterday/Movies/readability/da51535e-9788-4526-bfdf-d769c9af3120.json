  "text": "No Other Land, the powerful documentary set in a Palestinian community of the occupied West Bank, may lack U.S. distribution, but it’s got awards momentum behind it. The film directed by a collective of Palestinian and Israeli filmmakers earned a place on DOC NYC’s coveted Short List — the festival’s nod to what it considers to be among the year’s best feature documentaries. The list – a harbinger of potential traction with Oscar voters — also gave recognition to Will \u0026 Harper, a Netflix film built around a road trip taken by Will Ferrell and his longtime friend Harper Steele after Harper came out as trans. Both No Other Land and Will \u0026 Harper earned nominations for Best Documentary Feature at the Critics’ Choice Documentary Awards announced earlier this week. Also pulling off the DOC NYC-Critics’ Choice double is Sugarcane, the National Geographic documentary investigating the disappearance of Indigenous children at a so-called Indian residential school. Watch on Deadline Two other Netflix documentaries – The Remarkable Life of Ibelin, directed by Benjamin Ree, and Daughters, directed by Natalie Rae and Angela Patton – also made the DOC NYC shortlist and earned Best Doc nominations from the Critics’ Choice Documentary Awards. Mountain Queen: The Summits of Lhakpa Sherpa, a Netflix acquisition directed by two-time Oscar nominee Lucy Walker, also secured a spot on the DOC NYC short list. [Scroll for the full lineup of films to make DOC NYC short lists of features and short films, as well as DOC NYC’s Winner’s Circle of additional awards-worthy films]. Interestingly, Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story did not make the DOC NYC short list after earning six Critics’ Choice Documentary Awards nominations Monday. Queer artist Jenna Marvin in ‘Queendom’ Galdanova Films/Greenwich Ent. Queendom, the story of Jenna Marvin, an extraordinary Russian drag performance artist, made the DOC NYC short list, giving recognition to a film that has been a film festival darling. Frida, about the beloved Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, also made the short list. Between Will \u0026 Harper, Queendom, and Frida, DOC NYC elevated the profile of several films that touch on LGBTQ themes. The Bibi Files, director Alexis Bloom’s investigation into corruption allegations against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, earned a spot on the short list. That film, produced by Oscar winner Alex Gibney, will make its official world premiere at DOC NYC, after bowing as a work-in-progress at the Toronto International Film Festival. ‘Soundtrack to a Coup D’Etat Kino Lorber Johan Grimonprez’s Soundtrack to a Coup D’Etat, soon to be released by Kino Lorber, also made the features short list. Among short documentaries to make the DOC NYC roster of the year’s best is A Swim Lesson, directed by actress-filmmaker Rashida Jones and Will McCormack, and The Turnaround, directed by Kyle Thrash and two-time Oscar winner Ben Proudfoot. Motorcycle Mary, directed by Haley Watson and executive produced by Proudfoot, made the DOC NYC cut of shorts. Also earning recognition among shorts is I Am Ready, Warden, directed by Oscar nominee Smriti Mundhra, and Incident, directed by Bill Morrison, which uses CCTV footage to interrogate the police shooting of an unarmed Black man in Chicago. “The Short Lists sections showcase a selection of nonfiction features and shorts that the festival’s programming team considers to be among the year’s strongest contenders for Oscars and other prizes,” DOC NYC said in a release, “while Winner’s Circle is a reminder of films already awarded at major international film events that are worthy of additional consideration.” DOC NYC All of the shortlisted films as well as the Winner’s Circle selections will screen at DOC NYC — the nation’s biggest documentary film festival. In most cases, the filmmakers will be on hand for the screenings. “With these new announcements, DOC NYC will present a total of 111 features, including 32 World premieres and 24 U.S. premieres, and 129 short films in its 15th edition,” DOC NYC said. “The festival runs in-person November 13-21 at IFC Center, SVA Theatre, and Village East by Angelika and continues online through December 1 with films available to viewers across the U.S.” See below for the complete slates in each section as revealed Thursday: SHORT LIST: FEATURES The DOC NYC Short List for documentary features was launched in 2012 and has a long history of being a predictor of other awards—from critics’ prizes and top-ten lists to the Oscars.
