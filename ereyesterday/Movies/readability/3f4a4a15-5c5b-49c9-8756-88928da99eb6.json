This new promo comes direct from CCXP in São Paulo - featuring behind-the-scenes footage in addition to some awesome movie footage. Ana de Armas stars as Eve, an assassin trained in the traditions of the Ruska Roma getting revenge hunting the murderers of her family. The same character was previously portrayed by Unity Phelan in 2019's John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum and this takes place before Chapter 4. The superb supporting cast includes Ian McShane, Anjelica Huston, Keanu Reeves, Gabriel Byrne, Catalina Sandino Moreno, and Norman Reedus. With an appearance by Lance Reddick shot before he passed away. This is much better than the first trailer a few months ago, presenting a better look at what hopefully going to be a properly a kick ass action movie. The flamethrower bit actually looks badass, most of the fights seem legit.
