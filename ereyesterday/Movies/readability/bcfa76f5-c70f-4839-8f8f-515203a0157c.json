I'll be there on launch day for sure. ðŸŒ™ Here's the new 30th Anniversary trailer (+ poster) for Ron Howard's Apollo 13, direct from YouTube: \"We have lift off.\" ðŸš€ Released on June 30th, 1995, Apollo 13 recounts the real-life events of April 1970, when an oxygen tank explosion aboard NASA's third planned mission out to the Moon transformed the flight into a harrowing battle for survival. With their spacecraft losing power and life support, astronauts Jim Lovell (Academy Award winner Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon), Fred Haise (SAG Award winner Bill Paxton) were forced to abort their lunar landing and chart a perilous return to Earth without a functioning command module. Apollo 13 is directed by the American actor / filmmaker Ron Howard, directing his 11th movie at the time just after making The Paper (1994) and before making Ransom (1996) right after. The screenplay is by William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert. Adapted from the book \"Lost Moon\" by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger. Produced by Brian Grazer. This originally opened in the summer of 1995 and was a huge hit - earning a global total of $224 million at the box office that year. Universal Pictures will re-release Ron Howard's Apollo 13 space thriller movie exclusively in IMAX theaters starting on September 19th, 2025 for one week only. A chance to enjoy the original theatrical version again! Go see it in theaters. Find more posts in: Sci-Fi, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
