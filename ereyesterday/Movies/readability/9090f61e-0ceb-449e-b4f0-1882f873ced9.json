A24 has debuted another new teaser trailer for the disquieting new horror Bring Her Back, the latest creation from the brothers Danny \u0026 Michael Philippou - the Australian filmmakers (also called RackaRacka) who brought us Talk To Me. Described as \"visceral new horror\" and the only synopsis so far states: \"A brother and sister uncover a terrifying ritual at the secluded home of their new foster mother.\" What is she up to with them? Who is she trying to bring back and why? This looks like it's going to get extra dark \u0026 freaky (view the full trailer). Bring Her Back stars Sally Hawkins, with Billy Barrat, Sora Wong, Jonah Wren Phillips, Sally-Anne Upton, \u0026 Stephen Phillips. Ready for a late summer 2025 release at the end of May coming up very soon. This is looking creepier and creepier the more they show. The cat from the first teaser makes an appearance in this trailer, which is much more unsettling.
