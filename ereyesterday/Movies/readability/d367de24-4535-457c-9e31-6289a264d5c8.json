  "text": "Are we in store for more “Emmy sweepers?” With more than 25,000 voting members, the Television Academy is made up of 31 peer groups, each representing a specific field of expertise — actors, writers, editors, and so on. Of the many categories, only 15 are voted on by the entire membership. These include outstanding comedy, drama, limited or anthology series, television movie, talk series, variety special (live and pre-recorded), short form (comedy, drama, variety, nonfiction, or reality), hosted nonfiction series, structured and unstructured reality, reality competition, scripted variety and game show. Unlike the Oscars, which allow all eligible members to vote in the final round, the Emmys restrict both nomination and winner selection to designated peer groups. That exclusivity shapes the voting landscape — and it explains the rise of a modern phenomenon: the Emmy sweep. Popular on Variety Only once before 2020 had a series ever won all seven major categories (series, acting, writing, and directing): HBO’s “Angels in America” in 2004. Then came the COVID-era stunner: Pop TV’s “Schitt’s Creek,” in its final season, swept the board — an outcome few saw coming, given it had been nominated only once in its first five seasons and had never previously won. Netflix followed suit in 2021 with “The Crown” Season 4, which also nabbed seven major wins. Since then, full sweeps have remained elusive, but the domination has continued. The first season of HBO’s “The White Lotus,” technically a limited series at the time, won five of the seven categories it was eligible for — mostly due to skipping lead actor submissions. Then came the 2023 Emmys (held in January 2024 due to the WGA-SAG strikes), which saw the final season of HBO’s “Succession” win six of seven, falling only in supporting drama actress. Meanwhile, FX’s “The Bear” debuted by sweeping all six of its major categories — though it notably didn’t submit a lead comedy actress, with Ayo Edebiri winning instead in supporting. Netflix’s “Beef” also took five of its seven major categories, losing only to Paul Walter Hauser (“Black Bird”) and Niecy Nash-Betts (“Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story”). Fast forward nine months to the September 2024 ceremony: “Hacks” pulled off one of the biggest upsets in recent Emmy memory, taking comedy series over the heavily favored sophomore season of “The Bear.” That loss didn’t sting too badly for FX, though — “The Bear” still set a record with 10 wins, including five of six acting prizes. Only writing slipped away — to “Hacks” star Jean Smart and writing team Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky. FX also dominated with “Shōgun,” which set a new high for drama wins, while Netflix’s “Baby Reindeer” landed five of its six. In the age of near-sweeps, this trend has become a norm. And as a pundit who’s covered the Emmys for years, I’ll admit: it’s getting harder not to expect it. But should it be this way? HBO/Max If past is prologue, Apple TV+’s cerebral drama “Severance,” the high-concept satire “The Studio,” and the gritty British crime miniseries “Adolescence” are poised to be the next major sweepers. It helps to be loved by the four largest branches of the Academy — Executives, Actors, Writers, and Editors. Series with strong support across these groups tend to fare well. And while executives only vote on series, it’s not unreasonable to assume many will back their own studio’s flagship. HBO Max enters the race with a record-breaking 142 nominations, and three drama contenders: the sophomore season of the zombie hit “The Last of Us,” the buzzy medical series “The Pitt,” and the third outing of Mike White’s “The White Lotus.” Though “The Pitt” has the fewest noms of the three, it may have the clearest path to drama series gold. Noah Wyle is in a tight battle with “Severance” lead Adam Scott, whose show scored a staggering 27 nominations. Supporting nominations like Katherine LaNasa, and nods in writing and directing, give “Severance” a robust toolkit, but can it go all the way with Wyle as the central figure? Mike White’s dramedy isn’t going quietly. “The White Lotus” has writing heat for the “Full-Moon Party” episode — complete with Sam Rockwell’s show-stopping monologue — and strong contenders in Walton Goggins and Carrie Coon in supporting. But “Severance” can still outpace it. Scott is a top-tier contender in lead drama actor, with co-stars Tramell Tillman and John Turturro able to take down any of their competition. A Tillman win would be historic as the first Black man to win the category, which would be a very worthy inaugural entry in the history books. Kathy Bates as Matty Matlock. CBS In lead actress, Britt Lower may benefit from Kathy Bates being the only nomination from CBS’s “Matlock.” It’s been 20 years since someone won a lead acting Emmy as the sole nominee for their show — Patricia Arquette for “Medium” in 2005. It’s a steep hill, even for Bates, who made history as the oldest lead drama actress nominee ever. Speaking of Arquette, she’s back in supporting for “Severance,” and with seven past nominations and another Emmy win for “The Act” in 2019, she’s Emmy royalty. With no co-stars to split the vote — unlike “The White Lotus,” which fields four women in the same category — she could cruise to another win, especially if “Severance” is winning elsewhere. Then there’s “The Studio,” which tied “The Bear” for the most comedy nominations ever. “Hacks” dropped two key nominations, including Paul W. Downs in supporting actor, opening the door wide for “The Studio.” Ike Barinholtz is in a tough supporting race with 83-year-old legend Harrison Ford (“Shrinking”), while writing could go to either “The Studio” or to the surprise player: Nathan Fielder’s “The Rehearsal,” which snagged four unexpected noms. When the writers go out of their way for a series, it can mean something significant. Look at “My Name is Earl” which in 2006 became the first and still series to win writing and directing, but fail to be nominated for comedy series. Could Fielder fly towards the same destination? Then there’s “Adolescence” with 13 noms, going head-to-head with HBO Max’s “The Penguin,” which boasts a monster 24 nominations. Genre shows often struggle to convert nominations into major wins. For every “Watchmen” (which scored 11 wins from 26 noms), there’s a “WandaVision” (23 noms, three wins) or “The Mandalorian” the same year in drama series (24 noms, seven technical wins). Still, “The Penguin” could buck that trend. Colin Farrell and Cristin Milioti are serious threats in lead acting. Stephen Graham, both co-creator and star, is a strong candidate, but will actors choose someone else while supporting the show in every other way? Owen Cooper and Erin Doherty are frontrunners in supporting, and the show looks likely to take writing and directing. A partial sweep feels realistic. The road ahead is long, and momentum shifts fast. But if recent years are any indication, Emmy night 2025 may once again belong to just a handful of series, each hoping to run the table. Winner predictions are below, and the Emmy charts will be updated over the coming days. The 77th Emmy Awards will be hosted by Nate Bargatze and broadcast live Sunday, Sept. 14 at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on CBS, as well as stream live and on demand via select packages on Paramount+.

With no co-stars to split the vote — unlike “The White Lotus,” which fields four women in the same category — she could cruise to another win, especially if “Severance” is winning elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tThen there’s “The Studio,” which tied “The Bear” for the most comedy nominations ever. “Hacks” dropped two key nominations, including Paul W. Downs in supporting actor, opening the door wide for “The Studio.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tIke Barinholtz is in a tough supporting race with 83-year-old legend Harrison Ford (“Shrinking”), while writing could go to either “The Studio” or to the surprise player: Nathan Fielder’s “The Rehearsal,” which snagged four unexpected noms. When the writers go out of their way for a series, it can mean something significant. Look at “My Name is Earl” which in 2006 became the first and still series to win writing and directing, but fail to be nominated for comedy series. Could Fielder fly towards the same destination?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ThePenguin-cristin-milioti-colin-farrell.1.jpg?w=1024\" data-lazy-src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ThePenguin-cristin-milioti-colin-farrell.1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ThePenguin-cristin-milioti-colin-farrell.1.jpg 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ThePenguin-cristin-milioti-colin-farrell.1.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ThePenguin-cristin-milioti-colin-farrell.1.jpg?resize=300,149 300w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px\" height=\"509\" width=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ThePenguin-cristin-milioti-colin-farrell.1.jpg 1200w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ThePenguin-cristin-milioti-colin-farrell.1.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ThePenguin-cristin-milioti-colin-farrell.1.jpg?resize=300,149 300w\"/\u003e\n\t\n\t\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cfigcaption\u003e\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tThen there’s “Adolescence” with 13 noms, going head-to-head with HBO Max’s “The Penguin,” which boasts a monster 24 nominations. Genre shows often struggle to convert nominations into major wins. For every “Watchmen” (which scored 11 wins from 26 noms), there’s a “WandaVision” (23 noms, three wins) or “The Mandalorian” the same year in drama series (24 noms, seven technical wins).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tStill, “The Penguin” could buck that trend. Colin Farrell and Cristin Milioti are serious threats in lead acting. Stephen Graham, both co-creator and star, is a strong candidate, but will actors choose someone else while supporting the show in every other way? Owen Cooper and Erin Doherty are frontrunners in supporting, and the show looks likely to take writing and directing. A partial sweep feels realistic.\n\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tThe road ahead is long, and momentum shifts fast. But if recent years are any indication, Emmy night 2025 may once again belong to just a handful of series, each hoping to run the table. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tWinner predictions are
