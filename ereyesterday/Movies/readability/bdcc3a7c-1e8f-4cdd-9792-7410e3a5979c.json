The pop culture mogul announced Tuesday that her non-profit, 11:11 Media Impact, raised $800,000 in emergency relief funds in 72 hours. $150,000 has already been granted to GoFundMe’s Wildfire Relief Fund to provide 150 Altadena families with immediate cash assistance. “After meeting with people impacted by the Los Angeles wildfires, I heard heartbreaking stories of loss but also inspiring resilience. My goal is to help as many as I can as quickly as possible, which is why I’m making a $150,000 grant to the GoFundMe Wildfire Relief Fund, providing direct cash assistance,” Hilton said in a statement to Variety. “Hundreds of families will receive this assistance immediately ensuring they can address their needs and begin to rebuild their lives today. My heart is with everyone affected by this devastating situation, and my team and I at 11:11 Media Impact will continue to show up.” Hilton has amplified several non-profits over the weekend by using social media to highlight their work. She spent time volunteering at Baby2Baby packing essential items for families in need, and at the Pasadena Humane Society, where she fostered Zuzu, a dog surrendered to the shelter due to the Altadena fire. Popular on Variety A call to action for volunteers needed at Project Angel Food resulted in 8,000 responses in 48 hours, up from 3,800 volunteers in all of 2024 Hilton revealed on Jan. 9 that she and her husband Carter Reum lost their Malibu home. “Heartbroken beyond words,” she wrote while sharing the news footage of her home burning on Instagram. “Sitting with my family, watching the news and seeing our home in Malibu burn to the ground on live TV is something no one should ever have to experience. This home was where we built so many precious memories. It’s where [son] Phoenix took his first steps and where we dreamed of building a lifetime of memories with [daughter] London.”",
