  "text": "Updated on Tuesday, January 14, 2025 at 8:34 p.m. ET. Hollywood is hunkered down as deadly wildfires rage all around Los Angeles County. Tens of thousands have evacuated from their homes, primarily from the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in northern Los Angeles along the coast and in Altadena, and several deaths have even been reported. With life and property of course taking precedent over production and premieres, below are some of the more high-profile Hollywood events scrapped or postponed due to the fires. We’ll update this list as more events are postponed or canceled. Critics Choice Awards The Critics Choice Awards, originally set to air on Sunday, Jan. 12 on E! via the Santa Monica Airport’s Barker Hanger, has been postponed a second time. It will now air on Friday, February 7. It was first moved to Jan. 26, The show will remain on E! and will be available on Peacock the next day. However, the “Live from E!: Critics Choice Awards” two-hour red carpet special ahead of the telecast will no longer take place.   The Critics Choice Awards had no additional statement, but CEO Joey Berlin previously said after the first postponement, “This unfolding tragedy has already had a profound impact on our community. All our thoughts and prayers are with those battling the devastating fires and with all who have been affected.” ACE Eddie Awards The 75th ACE Eddie Awards and accompanying nominee cocktail party has been postponed indefinitely. The TBD rescheduled event will look very different. “Due to the ongoing concerns for safety within our LA communities, we have made arrangements with UCLA and Royce Hall to postpone the 75th ACE Eddie Awards. The preceding Nominee Cocktail Party will also be rescheduled. The ACE Board agrees it is smarter and safer for everyone to push to a later date (TBD). When that date is finalized, we will still be pivoting the ceremony to a community-building fundraiser rather than a full-fledged black-tie gala. As soon as we know more, we will share the information. This is unprecedented and we are trying to stay as fluid as possible. Again, as soon as we have details we will let you know, and when the event finally happens we will need to band together more than ever before. Thank you for your understanding, and it goes without saying that our hearts go out to all of our members who have been affected by the fires and to our industry as a whole.” ASC Awards Nominations The announcement of the nominees for the 2025 American Society of Cinematographers Awards has been postponed again, first from last week to January 13, to now without a new date. However, a new date will be announced in the next week, the awards body said. “Our focus is on supporting our beloved community during this difficult time,” an ASC representative said in a statement. “We will share a new announcement date within the next week.” WGA Awards Nominations The WGA Awards were meant to announce its nominations for 2025 on Thursday Jan. 9, but that announcement will now be delayed “until further notice.” The WGA originally delayed until Jan. 13. No additional comment was provided. Oscar Nominations and Nominees Luncheon The Oscar nominations and voting period have been delayed again amid the fires after Academy CEO Bill Kramer previously wrote a note to members delaying both by two days. This time, nominations will be announced on the morning of Thursday, Jan. 23, and the event will now be virtual, absent any press coverage in person. As a result, the voting period too was extended until Friday, Jan. 17 at 5 p.m. PT. Additionally, the Oscars Nominees Luncheon, scheduled for Monday, February 10, has been canceled, and the Scientific and Technical Awards, originally set for Tuesday, Feb. 18, will be rescheduled to a later date to be determined. “Our members always share how important it is for us to come together as a community, and we are determined to use this opportunity to celebrate our resilient and compassionate industry. We also look forward to honoring our frontline workers who have aided with the fires, recognizing those impacted, and encouraging people to join the Academy in supporting the relief efforts,” Kramer and Academy President Janet Yang said in a joint statement. “We will get through this together and bring a sense of healing to our global film community.” “With Love, Meghan” Netflix Premiere Date “At the request of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and with the full support of Netflix, the release of the show — a heartfelt tribute to the beauty of Southern California — has been moved from its previously announced January premiere date to March 4, due to the ongoing devastation caused by the Los Angeles wildfires,” Netflix said on Sunday, January 12. Meghan Markle’s statement: “I’m thankful to my partners at Netflix for supporting me in delaying the launch, as we focus on the needs of those impacted by the wildfires in my home state of California.” “One of Them Days” Premiere Sony’s premiere of “One of Them Days,” the comedy film starring Keke Palmer and SZA, has been canceled due to the ongoing fires, IndieWire has learned. It was meant to premiere in Hollywood on Jan. 13. “Severance” Season 2 Premiere Apple TV+ is being proactive and canceling its “Severance” Season 2 premiere event set for Monday, January 13. “As devastating wildfires continue to impact the Los Angeles area, and with safety as our first and foremost priority, we have made the decision to cancel Monday’s ‘Severance’ season two premiere event,” an Apple TV+ spokesperson said in a statement shared with IndieWire. “Apple is donating to support the relief efforts on the ground and our thoughts and heartfelt support remain with everyone who has been affected by these tragic fires.” LA Film Critics Banquet The Los Angeles Film Critics delayed its awards season banquet that was originally scheduled for January 11. No rescheduled date was announced. “Stay tuned for updates. And until then, wishing safety and strength for our community,” the group tweeted. PGA Voting Period The producers guild is giving members extra time to vote for the 2025 PGA Awards. First, the PGA announced that nominations would be moved from Thursday, January 9 to Sunday, January 12. “Due to LA County wildfires, the Producers Guild of America will be extending the voting window for the PGA Awards by two days until Saturday, January 11 to allow members additional time to cast their ballots,” the PGA said on Thursday, January 9. “The official PGA Awards nominations will now be announced on Sunday, January 12.” When they still could not be announced on that new date, the PGA postponed for another week. “Back in Action” NYC Premiere The New York City premiere for Cameron Diaz/Jamie Foxx movie “Back in Action” has also been canceled. “Back in Action” marks the on-film returns of Diaz (who just took a long time off) and Foxx (who nearly died in a medical emergency). “Due to the tragic fires happening in Southern California we will be cancelling our ‘Back in Action’ New York City premiere,” reps said in a statement. “We recognize many in our industry and their loved ones are currently affected and our thoughts are with them at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.” Donna Langley Celebratory Toast Universal chief Donna Langley was meant to be celebrated on Friday at an event at the Sunset Tower in Hollywood, celebrating Universal’s impressive year of film, but the event has now been canceled. Langley herself in a statement hoped everyone stays safe. “Given the devastation in Los Angeles and the surrounding area we are canceling our event this Friday,” Langley said. “There will be more moments to come together and celebrate as a community this awards season, but our primary focus at this time is your safety. Please take care.” “The Last Showgirl” Premiere Though Pamela Anderson was just this morning nominated for a SAG Award, her Los Angeles premiere for “The Last Showgirl” will have to wait. Distributor Roadside Attractions cancelled the premiere that was scheduled for Wednesday evening at the TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood. The film opens on January 10. “In light of the devastation in LA County, and out of an abundance of caution for everyone involved, the Los Angeles premiere for Roadside Attractions’ “The Last Showgirl” has been cancelled,” a spokesperson told IndieWire. “We are thankful to all first responders and our thoughts are with the people being affected.” “Love Me” Special Screening Google was meant to host a special screening, Q\u0026A, and reception of Bleecker Street’s upcoming drama “Love Me,” starring Kristen Stewart and Steven Yeun, at the Academy Museum on Thursday, January 9, but it will be postponed to a later date. A rep tells IndieWire the move was made “out of an abundance of caution.” Directors Sam and Anthony Zuchero were to be in attendance and participate in a Q\u0026A. AFI Awards Luncheon AFI said in a statement, “Given the tragedies that prevail in Los Angeles, the spirit of community we strive for at AFI AWARDS will be unachievable on Friday – and so we will be postponing the event.” The event was to have taken place at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills. No new date has been announced yet. “Hacks” Pauses Production Universal Studio Groups, which produces Max’s “Hacks,” Peacock’s upcoming “Suits: LA,” and series like “Loot,” “Ted,” and “Happy’s Place,” have all paused production amid the fires, an individual with knowledge of told IndieWire. The shows were filming on Universal’s lower lot in Universal City, which has been closed for the day. Numerous other shows have also paused production, while other live shows such as “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” “The Price Is Right,” and “After Midnight” have canceled live tapings for the evening. “The Pitt” Premiere Think of “The Pitt” as Max’s “E.R.” — even if “The Pitt” producers really, really don’t want you to think of their show that way. (And even if at least two of “The Pitt” producers, John Wells and showrunner R. Scott Gemmill, were also “E.R.” producers.) Like “E.R.,” “The Pitt” stars Noah Wyle as an emergency room doctor in a city hospital. The Max series is staged in close to real time across 15 episodes of a single shift at a Pittsburgh hospital. The series was meant to premiere on Wednesday. “Out of an abundance of caution due to the ongoing Palisades Fire and continued wind advisories through tomorrow, we are canceling Wednesday’s premiere event for ‘The Pitt,'” a Max spokesperson emailed to media booked to attend. “The safety and well-being of our attendees, staff, and community are our top priority. We are grateful for the first responders bravely working to protect our community, and our thoughts are with those affected. Stay safe!” “Better Man” Premiere “Better Man,” the Robbie Williams musical in which the pop singer appears as a CGI chimp, is hoping for awards buzz and box office love, but count its high-profile premiere among the events canceled due to the raging wildfires. The film was meant to have its LA premiere on the Paramount lot in Hollywood. “Due to the dangerous conditions affecting Los Angeles we are canceling [Wednesday’s] premiere of ‘Better Man,'” a Paramount Pictures spokesperson said. “Our thoughts are with those impacted by the devastating fires resulting from these conditions, and we encourage everyone to stay safe and follow guidance and orders from local officials and government agencies.” “Unstoppable” DGA Event The spreading wildfires stopped an “Unstoppable” red carpet event from taking place at the DGA on Tuesday, the day the fires broke out. Stars Jharrel Jerome and Jennifer Lopez as well as co-stars Don Cheadle and Michael Peña were meant to attend, as was the subject of the true story wrestling drama Anthony Robles and his mother. “In light of today’s safety concerns around heightened wind activity and fire outbreaks in Los Angeles, we regret to inform you that we are canceling tonight’s premiere of ‘Unstoppable,’” the studio said in a press statement Tuesday afternoon. “As much as we were looking forward to celebrating this wonderful and inspiring film with you, safety is our first priority. We encourage everyone to watch ‘Unstoppable’ on Prime Video, which will be available globally on January 16. Thank you for your understanding and please stay safe.” “Wolf Man” Premiere Universal’s horror movie “Wolf Man” stars Julia Garner and Christopher Abbott and is directed by Leigh Whannell. The film was meant to make its world premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on Tuesday evening. It’s unclear if the date will be rescheduled. The film opens nationwide on January 17. “[Tuesday’s] premiere of ‘Wolf Man’ is cancelled due to sensitivities around the worsening weather situation in LA and related evacuations,” a Universal Pictures rep shared with IndieWire. SAG Awards Nominations (live in-person) We still got the SAG Awards nominations on Wednesday morning, they just didn’t happen as originally planned. “In an abundance of caution for the safety of our presenters, guests, and staff, the live in-person 31st Annual SAG Awards nominations announcement has been cancelled due to the wildfires and adverse wind conditions in Los Angeles,” the Screen Actors Guild said in a statement shared Tuesday with media. Instead, we got the announcement via press release. “We look forward to celebrating these incredible actors and their work at the SAG Awards ceremony on February 23,” the statement continued. “In the meantime, we urge everyone to stay safe, and thank you for your continued support.” BAFTA Tea Party BAFTA’s annual tea party that celebrates film honorees from the year was preemptively canceled ahead of its scheduled date on January 11. Like the AFI Awards Luncheon, the BAFTA Tea Party was to have taken place at the Four Seasons Beverly Hills, but a day after the AFI event. “In light of the dangerous winds and wildfires in Los Angeles, we are cancelling this weekend’s BAFTA Tea Party. The safety of our colleagues, friends and peers in Los Angeles remains our utmost priority and our thoughts are with everyone impacted,” a spokesperson for the event said in a statement.",
