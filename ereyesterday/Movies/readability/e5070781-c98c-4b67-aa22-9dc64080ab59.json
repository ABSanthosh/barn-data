  "text": "SPOILER ALERT: The story includes details about Episode 815 of 9-1-1, “Lab Rats.“ On a series known for its shocking twists, this may be the biggest one to date. 9-1-1 co-lead and executive producer Peter Krause is leaving the hit first-responder drama after eight seasons as LAFD Station 118 Captain Robert “Bobby” Nash, who died a heroic death in the April 17 episode “Lab Rats.” Krause addressed his departure from the show in a lengthy, heartfelt letter to fans, which you can read in full below. 9-1-1 will continue without him as the series has been renewed for an 18-episode ninth season by ABC. Co-lead Angela Bassett has a deal to carry on as 9-1-1 executive producer and star, playing LAPD patrol sergeant and Bobby’s widow Athena Grant-Nash, I hear. She also executive produces the upcoming spinoff 9-1-1: Nashville and has a first-look pact with the franchise’s studio 20th Television. Watch on Deadline “Lab Rats” is Part 2 of the two-episode lab leak arc, in which Bobby, Chimney, Hen and Ravi get locked in an underground lab that had been experimenting with a deadly virus after they went in to put out a fire. Bobby went on to save the lives of each of his team members, performing life-saving surgery on Hen when her lung collapsed; delivering oxygen to Ravi when he fainted after his tank went empty; and helping treat Chimney, who had become infected with the virus, slowing the disease’s progression while sending Athena to track down the stolen vial of anti-viral. The vial was successfully retrieved and Chimney was saved, only for Bobby to reveal after his team had been rescued that his air tube had been compromised and he also had become infected, selflessly hiding his illness so the only dose of the antidote could go to expectant father Chimney. ‘9-1-1’ Peter Krause and Angela Bassett in “Lab Rats” Disney/Christopher Willard In a heart-wrenching goodbye scene between Athena and Bobby through a glass door, he referenced his character’s tragic past of a recovering addict leaning on his faith as he carried the guilt of inadvertently causing the deaths of dozens of people, including his wife and children, back in Minnesota. Noting that he had always lived on borrowed time, he told Athena, “L.A. was supposed to be my penance, not my home,” adding, “But then you said ‘yes’ to a dinner invitation, and I started to live again.” Bobby then kneeled to pray and died. In his letter to fans, Krause spoke of Bobby’s arc on the show, which was picked up by Fox in 2017 where it aired for six seasons before moving to ABC. In a milestone for the character, he finally reconciled with his estranged mother earlier this season. “In October 2017, through him, we began tackling topics such as grief, guilt, anger and addiction while exploring his relationship with a higher power, forgiveness and grace,” Krause said. “On his path of healing, we watched him join and embrace both his new family at the firehouse and his new family with Athena Grant where he found love and acceptance. We also had plenty of fun along the way. It was a joy.” Peter Krause as Bobby Nash Disney/Justin Stephens In a Deadline interview with Bassett and 9-1-1 executive producer/showrunner Tim Minear, Minear said that the decision to kill off Bobby was “100% creative,” pointed out the clue to Bobby’s looming demise early in the season, which you likely missed, and teased upcoming 9-1-1 cast addition(s). Bassett detailed the filming of Bobby and Athena’s emotional goodbye scene, shared that they shot a different version of its ending and hinted who else could’ve died in the lab. Chatter about the Parenthood alum possibly leaving 9-1-1 was sparked by an Instagram Story 9-1-1 star Oliver Stark posted and quickly deleted on April 1 (April’s Fool’s Day), which showed a portion of a script page in which Maddie answers a 911 call from Bobby (in a coffin) saying, “I’m being buried alive!” Around the same time, social media footage surfaced from a 9-1-1 location shoot of what looked like a funeral procession with Athena and her children in black and Bobby MIA, leaving many convinced he was dead. Their fears were intensified by the reveal of “The Last Alarm” — a term for a special bell-ringing ceremony when someone’s career ends in retirement or death — as the title of the May 1 episode. Krause is aware of the strong online reaction to Bobby’s presumed death that has left many fans devastated, and has a message for them. “I’ve heard that many fans are upset by this loss and they have a right to be,” he said. “It is a loss. That said, it was more than a bold creative choice on a bold show. Bobby Nash was written in sacrifice and he was built for this. First responders risk their lives on the job so that others can see another day. His story arc honors them.” Following the airing of the “Lab Rats” episode, ABC released a promo for “The Last Alarm,” which features scenes from Bobby’s funeral and his grieving wife and colleagues. Calling his eight-season run on 9-1-1 “one wild adventure,” Krause thanked the creators, networks, studios and crew, giving special shoutout to his on-screen partner, Bassett. “Her strength and her sweetness, and us holding hands. We parted ways too soon,” he said. Addressing his “beloved and unruly children of the 118,” Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Oliver Stark, Ryan Guzman and Anirudh Pisharody, he admitted, “this is a tough goodbye.” “Stay unruly, but be professional and get the job done. Misfit heroes need each other,” he said. “That’s how we do it at our firehouse. Pass it along to the next new guy.” Across eight seasons and two networks, 9-1-1 remains a top linear and digital performer. Created by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Minear, the series follows the lives of Los Angeles first responders: police officers, paramedics, firefighters, and dispatchers. Here is the 9-1-1 farewell letter by Krause who just last year told TV Guide that he “could do another hundred episodes” of the show: I would like to thank Dana Walden, Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear for entrusting me with such a complex character over these nine years. It has been my honor to portray Captain Bobby Nash.In October 2017, through him, we began tackling topics such as grief, guilt, anger and addiction while exploring his relationship with a higher power, forgiveness and grace. On his path of healing, we watched him join and embrace both his new family at the firehouse and his new family with Athena Grant where he found love and acceptance. We also had plenty of fun along the way. It was a joy.Humbled by working in step with our technical advisor, Chief Mike Bowman, and real firefighters, I wish to thank you all for helping me bring a sense of dignity and realism to the character in our larger-than-life emergency landscape. Your kind and complimentary words have meant the world to me.I’ve heard that many fans are upset by this loss and they have a right to be. It is a loss. That said, it was more than a bold creative choice on a bold show. Bobby Nash was written in sacrifice and he was built for this. First responders risk their lives on the job so that others can see another day. His story arc honors them. We at 9-1-1 salute all the incredible men and women who do these dangerous jobs and strive to keep us safe.Our show is incredibly difficult to make at times with long hours, challenging stunts and elaborate disasters. We couldn’t do it without each other. I wish to thank everyone in every department and all those at ABC, 20th Television and Fox. We are a sprawling team.I will miss all my 9-1-1 family. Our incredible crew whose professional excellence is second to none. All the writers who keep pulling rabbits out of hats. All the directors tasked with the same. All the incredible guest cast over the years as well as Jennifer Love Hewitt and the cast in the call center.I will miss my partner, Angela Bassett. Her strength and her sweetness, and us holding hands. We parted ways too soon. Much love.Tim Minear and Brad Buecker, you’ve been my pillars and are two of the best in the business. I will miss you both.Finally, I will miss my beloved and unruly children of the 118. Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Oliver Stark, Ryan Guzman and Anirudh Pisharody: this is a tough goodbye. Stay unruly, but be professional and get the job done. Misfit heroes need each other. That’s how we do it at our firehouse. Pass it along to the next new guy.This has been one wild adventure. I thank you all, with all my heart.",
