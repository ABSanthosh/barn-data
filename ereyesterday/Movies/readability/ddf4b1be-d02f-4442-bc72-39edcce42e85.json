  "text": "Taylor Swift recently surprised fans with a performance of “Shake It Off” at a concert in Nashville, Tennessee, called Tight Ends \u0026 Friends, hosted by boyfriend Travis Kelce, as part of his annual Tight End University (TEU) event. She was joined in this performance by country singer Kane Brown. Both musicians have made their mark in the music industry. Accordingly, fans have been wondering whether Taylor Swift and Kane Brown are friends. So, are Swift and Brown related to one another? Here’s what we have gathered about the same. Is Taylor Swift friends with Kane Brown? As per recent information, the “Anti-Hero” singer and Kane Brown do seem to be pals. It is clear that the “Miles on It” crooner respects Taylor Swift and recognizes her fame. This is further evidenced by his recent Instagram post. Brown uploaded a snap with her and Travis Kelce on the social media site. In the captions, he poked fun at himself for thinking he was the Tight Ends \u0026 Friends’ special guest when she was actually one. “When you think you’re the special guest BUT you’re not,” Brown wrote. Check out the photo below: Moreover, Brown had teased Swift’s reveal as the special guest at the end of his performance at Tight Ends \u0026 Friends. He then joined her during the last few moments of her “Shake It Off” performance. Once it concluded, Swift thanked Brown and his band members. She also shared a hug with each of them before exiting the stage. At the end of her performance, Taylor Swift even revealed that she and Kane Brown had decided to perform “Shake It Off” just three minutes earlier. “We’re up there, me and Kane are having some drinks, and we were thinking like how loud could this place get?” Swift told attendees. “Theoretically, how loud could the singing get in here?” She even added that singer Chase Rice had given her his own guitar for the performance. (via E! News) Swift’s performance at the Tight End \u0026 Friends event marks her first on-stage performance since the conclusion of her globe-spanning Eras Tour. It is also her first performance since reclaiming ownership of her masters. Besides Taylor Swift and Kane Brown, the Tight Ends \u0026 Friends concert in Nashville also saw performances from Jordan Davis, Chase Rice, Sophia Scott, and Graham Barham.",
