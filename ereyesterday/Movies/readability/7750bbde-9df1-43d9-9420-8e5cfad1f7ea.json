While speaking about the design during the “Live From E!” preshow, she said the look took her nail artist five hours to complete. Cynthia Erivo’s Golden Globes nails When asked what she did during that time, Erivo said she was able to work and get several things done. Celebrity manicurist Rose Hackle, who has worked with Erivo since 2020, including on the “Wicked” press tour, broke down the actor’s nail philosophy. “More is more with Cynthia,” she said in an interview with Elle. “She really loves nails and is always shopping for little jewels and trinkets to add to her designs … She is adamant about wanting my energy and my creative freedom to be expressed on her hands.” Dax Shepard made headlines in November when he had Erivo on his podcast and brought up her intricate nails, asking if they got in the way of her “wiping” in the restroom. “My answer is that nobody uses just their fingers to wipe their backside,” she said. “You use tissue, correct? And you wipe!” Shepard asked if she was offended by the question, and Erivo was honest, saying, “I’m annoyed by it. I’m, like, ‘Come on, guys.’ But I get it, but it’s also, like, ‘I’m a functioning adult, and I’ve never walked around smelling like, you know…’ ” “Wicked” has been nominated for four Golden Globes, including Best Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy and a Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy nod for Erivo.",
