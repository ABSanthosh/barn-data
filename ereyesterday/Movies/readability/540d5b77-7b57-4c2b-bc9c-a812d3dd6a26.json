  "text": "The much-awaited Spotify Wrapped 2024 is set to arrive soon on the popular music streaming app, marking the year’s listening highlights for users globally. This annual feature allows listeners to reflect on their favorite songs, artists, and genres. Here’s everything to know about the anticipated release of Spotify Wrapped 2024. When will Spotify Wrapped release in 2024? Spotify Wrapped, introduced in 2016, provides users with a unique way to look back at their music preferences from the year. It typically highlights top songs, favorite genres, and new artists discovered. With the holiday season approaching, users are prompted to update their apps to prepare for the release. Recently, a pop-up on Spotify read, “2024 is almost a wrap. Don’t miss your chance to discover your top songs \u0026 artists of the year. Update the app to get Wrapped-ready.” Although Spotify hasn’t announced a specific release date for Wrapped 2024, recent years suggest it may drop in late November. In 2023 and 2022, Wrapped released on November 30, while it launched on December 1 in 2021 and 2020. This trend points to a similar timing for Wrapped 2024, making it likely to go live before December. User data for Wrapped is tracked throughout the year, from January 1 through the fall. Spotify’s X (formerly Twitter) account confirmed that data collection typically extends past October 31, ensuring that most of the year’s listening habits are included. In a recent post on X, user @tvommy shared excitement about the upcoming Wrapped release. They highlighted the joy users feel when discovering their personalized stats. Another notification will alert users in the app when Wrapped is available. Spotify is also expected to announce the official release on social media. For those using Apple Music, Apple’s “Replay” feature, launched in 2019, offers a similar experience, highlighting monthly stats and overall listening history. A 2024 Replay release date has not yet been announced.",
