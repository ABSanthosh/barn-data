  "text": "The comedies “Based on a True Story” and “Mr. Throwback” have been canceled at Peacock, Variety has learned exclusively. “Based on a True Story” had debuted its second season in November 2024, while “Mr. Throwback” aired its one and only season at the NBCUniversal streamer in August 2024. Peacock does not release regular viewership information, so gauging the exact audience of either show is difficult, but both received solid reviews upon their release. “Based on a True” story starred Kaley Cuoco and Chris Messina as a financially struggling couple who decide to start a true crime podcast to investigate whether or not their plumber is in fact a serial killer. The cast also included Tom Bateman, Liana Liberato, and Priscilla Quintana. The show originally premiered in 2023. Craig Rosenberg created the series and served as an executive producer. Annie Weisman served as writer, showrunner, and an executive producer on Season 2 with Jaclyn Moore also writing and executive producing. Both Cuoco and Messina executive produced in addition to starring. Jason Bateman and Michael Costigan executive produced via Aggregate Films, while Alex Buono executive produced and directed multiple episodes. UCP was the studio. Popular on Variety The official logline for “Mr. Throwback” stated, “A down-on-his-luck memorabilia dealer (Adam Pally) looks for redemption by reuniting with his sixth-grade teammate, NBA legend Steph Curry.” Curry played himself in the comedy series. Ego Nwodim and Ayden Mayeri also starred, with Tracy Letts, Layla Scalisi, Tien Tran, and Rich Sommer appearing in recurring guest star roles. David Caspe, Matthew Libman, and Daniel Libman served as writers and executive producers on the project. Both Curry and Pally executive produced in addition to starring, with Curry executive producing under his Unanimous Media banner along with Erick Peyton. David Wain directed all six episodes and executive produced. Universal Television was the studio. The series reunited Pally with Caspe and the Libmans, as Pally previously starred in the ABC comedy “Happy Endings,” which was created by Caspe and on which the Libmans were writers. Peacock’s current scripted slate includes shows like recent entries like “Long Bright River” with Amanda Seyfried, the upcoming fifth season of “Law \u0026 Order: Organized Crime,” and “Poker Face” Season 2. On the horizon, the streamer has shows like the “Twisted Metal” Season 2 coming this summer, as well as the followup to “The Office,” a series version of “The Burbs” starring Keke Palmer, and Season 2 of the hit comedy prequel “Ted.”",
