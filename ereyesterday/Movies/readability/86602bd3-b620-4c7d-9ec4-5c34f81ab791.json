  "text": "Reacher (Alan Ritchson) should pick on somebody his own size — and for once, we mean someone smaller than the dude he fights in the “Reacher” Season 3 teaser trailer, released on Saturday by Amazon Prime Video. Good lord, Paulie (Olivier Richters, who played Ursa in “Black Widow”) is enormous. How big is the big baddie? Reacher describes Paulie as “twice my size,” to which Neagley (Maria Sten) quips, “Last time I saw a guy twice your size was on Mt. Rushmore.” Good one, Neagley. Richters is not literally twice Ritchson’s size of course, but he is legitimately way bigger. Richters is a 7’2″-7’3″ Dutch bodybuilder, dwarfing Ritchson’s impressive 6’3″-6’4″ frame. Along with the teaser trailer, Prime Video revealed the premiere date for “Reacher” Season 3: Thursday, February 20, 2025. The announcements came at CCXP in São Paulo, Brazil. Season 3 will consist of eight episodes — the first three will be available at the time same, the subsequent five episodes will launch one by one every Thursday through March 27, 2025. “Reacher” has already been renewed for a fourth season, which will begin shooting in 2025. And “Reacher” has already birthed a spin off: Sten, Reacher’s good pal and former U.S. Army buddy, is getting her own show, “Neagley.” Why not? In 2023, “Reacher” Season 2 was the most-watched release on Amazon Prime Video. “Reacher” is based on the Jack Reacher books by novelist Lee Child. The third season is specifically based on Child’s “Persuader,” in which Reacher “hurtles into the dark heart of a vast criminal enterprise when trying to rescue an undercover DEA informant whose time is running out,” per Prime Video. “There he finds a world of secrecy and violence — and confronts some unfinished business from his own past.” New to the cast this season are Anthony Michael Hall, Sonya Cassidy, Brian Tee, Johnny Berchtold, Robert Montesinos, Daniel David Stewart, and Olivier Richters. “Reacher” is produced by Amazon MGM Studios, Skydance Television, and CBS Studios. It’s written (for television) by showrunner Nick Santora, who executive produces with Child, Ritchson, Don Granger, Scott Sullivan, and Mick Betancourt, as well as David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Matt Thunell for Skydance. Carolyn Harris and Kenny Madrid are the executives-in-charge of the series for Skydance Television. Watch the trailer here:",
