  "text": "Having performed professionally now since they were 13 years-old, acting has become second-nature to the still relatively young talent, Bella Ramsey. Now co-lead of the hit HBO series “The Last of Us,” Ramsey has gotten more opportunities to hone their craft and in doing so, has only gotten to learn more about themself. In wake of the show’s success and their own rise to stardom, they were able to come out as non-binary. And now, ahead of the show’s Season 2 premiering next month, they’ve discussed the impact of being “diagnosed with autism” during the shooting of Season 1. Speaking in an interview in British Vogue, Ramsey shared that a crew member with an autistic daughter noticed certain habits they were exhibiting that related to sensory issues and hyperawareness common with the diagnosis. Now that Ramsey has had formal assessments and knows more about their own neurodivergence, they have been able to embrace it wholeheartedly, especially when it comes to acting. “I’ve always been watching and learning from people. Having to learn more manually how to socialize and interact with the people around me has helped me with acting” they said. Of the routine their career brings to their life and how it fits the way their mind works, they added, “I have a call time, and I’m told what to wear, how to stand, where to stand, and what to eat.” As Ramsey puts it, this can be incredibly “freeing” when you’re neurodivergent and offers them a great deal of “grace” towards themselves. This diagnosis has also allowed them to further understand elements of their identity, but at the same time, they’re not interested in being thought of as just one thing. “The label of being autistic has been so helpful to me because that’s helped me to understand myself,” said Ramsey, “but gender and sexuality-wise, labels do not feel comfy for me in any capacity, because I feel like I’m putting myself into a box. I feel trapped.” Being one of the most famous talents in their age range has made it so that they can’t exactly avoid being in the “public eye” and while they do feel more comfortable once people are aware of their autism, they do wonder what it must feel like not to have to put themself out there, especially when it comes to exploring the more sensitive elements of their life. “It does make me a bit sad that people who aren’t in the public eye can explore their gender identity or sexuality in private,” Ramsey told British Vogue. “That’s a privilege I don’t really get any more. If I did want to explore other things, like facets of my gender identity, that would be done publicly. As much as I would try and keep it private, if someone recognizes me on the street, say if I’m presenting differently, [and] takes a photo, then that is just talked about.” “The Last of Us” Season 2 premieres on HBO Sunday, April 13.",
