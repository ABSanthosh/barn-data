  "description": "\"Resistance to evil must be uncompromising.\" Picturehouse has revealed the full trailer for a documentary film called Porcelain War, an award-winning film that brings us into Ukraine during the ongoing war. It has won tons of awards at many film festivals, including the Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary at Sundance 2024, and Audience Award at the Nantucket Film Festival. Under roaring fighter jets, Ukrainian artists Slava, Anya, and Andrey choose to stay behind. Defiantly finding beauty amid destruction, they show that although it's easy to make people afraid, it's hard to destroy their passion for living. \"Porcelain War is a story far bigger than Ukraine, it’s an unforgettable story about all of us. It’s about the human need to create, to restore meaning and beauty in the darkest of times,\" said co-director Slava Leontyev.

Worth a watch. Here's the first official trailer for Bellomo \u0026 Leontyev's doc Porcelain War, direct from YouTube: Porcelain War is the story of three Ukrainian artists defiantly finding inspiration \u0026 beauty as they defend their culture and their country against Russian invaders. In a war waged by professional soldiers against ordinary civilians, Slava Leontyev, Anya Stasenko, and Andrey Stefanov, choose to stay behind, armed with their art, their cameras and – for the first time in their lives – guns. As the war intensifies, Andrey picks up his camera to film their story, and on tiny porcelain figurines, Anya \u0026 Slava capture their idyllic past, uncertain present, and hope for the future. Porcelain War is directed by the two filmmakers Brendan Bellomo \u0026 Slava Leontyev, both making their first feature film with this doc. It's produced by Olivia Ahnemann, Paula DuPré Pesmen, Camilla Mazzaferro, \u0026 Aniela Sidorska. This initially premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. Picturehouse opens Porcelain War in select US theaters starting November 22nd, 2024 this fall. For updates visit the film's official site. Interested in watching?
