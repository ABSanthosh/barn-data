  "description": "\"No eating friends.\" Only the bad guys! The concept for this is pretty much: what if they mashed up E.T. and Alien into one fun-for-the-whole-family adventure movie? Take a look at the trailer for XENO, produced by Kevin Hart and his production company called Hartbeat. \"One Bond. Two Worlds.\" A teenage girl makes a terrifying extraterrestrial alien her friend after it crashes nearby in the desert. The youngster manages to deal with her sad mother and the mother's violent boyfriend while simultaneously protecting her dangerous new buddy. Together they embark upon an adventure that questions the nature of good and evil. \"I didn't just find it... we found each other.\" Awwww, that's adorable. Starring Lulu Wilson, Omari Hardwick, Trae Romano, Wrenn Schmidt, Paul Schneider, and Garrett van der Leun. And the most exciting part - the movie features creature designs by the legendary Jim Henson Company's Creature Shop. To bring to life this alien creature that she befriends. This looks pretty cheesy, of course, but I have to say - it doesn't look that bad. I'm definitely intrigued. Especially with a practical creature? Maybe I do have to watch this... Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Matthew Loren Oates' [â€¦]",
