  "description": "\"We both know I can hack it better than any ding-dong out there!\" ðŸª“ RLJE Films has revealed an official trailer for an indie horror comedy called Bloody Axe Wound, the latest from genre filmmaker Matthew John Lawrence. The concept is basically: what if Jason Voorhees had a daughter? And what if she wanted to follow in his footsteps but also go her own way? Sounds like fun. Abbie Bladecut is a teenager torn between the macabre traditions of her family's bloody trade and the tender stirrings of her first crush. In the town of Clover Falls, her father, Roger Bladecut, has built an infamous legacy by capturing real-life killings on tape \u0026 selling them. But as Abbie delves deeper into the grisly family business, she begins to wonder if it's time to take the family tradition in a new direction. With Sari Arambulo as Abbie, Molly Brown, Eddie Leavy, with Jeffrey Dean Morgan \u0026 Billy Burke. As the first female slasher, she battles sexism while realizing the harsh realities behind the mass murders. Looks like fun meta horror about slashers that's also a slasher. First official trailer for Matthew John Lawrence's slasher Bloody Axe Wound, direct from YouTube: Abbie [â€¦]",
