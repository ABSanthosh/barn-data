  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania actress Kathryn Newton and Coyote vs. Acme star Lana Condor are headlining Amazon MGM Studios’ Devil’s Mouth, from director Jeff Wadlow. The survival thriller is a co-production with Lionsgate and follows college friends who are on a trip to get to Thailand and get trapped in an underwater cave system with a bull shark. Old tensions and power struggles resurface as they fight to survive. Aja Gabel (Sunny; The Staircase; upcoming Five Star Weekend) and Myung Joh Wesner (Star Wars: Skeleton Crew; High Potential) wrote the script, which was featured on the 2019 Black List, with latest revisions by Jeff Wadlow. Producers include Thunder Road Films’ Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee, and Wadlow. Thunder Road is natch, behind the John Wick movies. Carsten Lorenz will executive produce. Chelsea Kujawa will oversee for Lionsgate. Helen Lee-Kim and Michael Meyer negotiated the deal on behalf of Lionsgate. Newton is represented by WME, Entertainment 360, and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman. Condor is represented by CAA, Untitled Entertainment and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson \u0026 Christopher. Wadlow is represented by UTA, Artists First, Empirical, and Hirsch Wallerstein Hayum Matlof and Fishman. Gabel is represented at UTA, Untitled, and Writers House. Myung Joh Wesner is represented by Verve and Artists First.  Watch on Deadline Newton most recently starred opposite Dan Stevens in Universal’s vampire thriller, Abigail. Also in 2024, Newton starred as the lead, titular role in Lisa Frankenstein for Focus Features. She also entered the Marvel Universe as Cassie Lang in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, and headlined Amazon MGM Studios’ sci-fi romance, The Map of Tiny Perfect Things. She also starred in the body-swap slasher Freaky opposite Vince Vaughn. Her earlier credits include blockbusters like Pokemon Detective Pikachu, Netflix’s fan-favorite series The Society, and Universal’s Blockers, the top-grossing R-rated comedy of 2018. Up next, she will star in Searchlight’s Ready or Not 2, opposite Samara Weaving.  Condor can recently be seen starring in Valiant One, which was released on Jan. 25, and will next be seen in the romantic comedy Worth the Wait for Tubi. Next in film, Condor will star in the action-thriller Ballerina Overdrive, produced by David Leitch. She also stars in the film Coyote vs. Acme alongside Will Forte and John Cena which is expected to release worldwide in theaters sometime next year. On TV, Condor recently appeared in several episodes of the critically acclaimed, Emmy and Peabody Award-winning series, Abbott Elementary. Condor became a household name in 2018 with the launch of Netflix’s feature film To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, based on Jenny Han’s New York Times best-selling novel. Condor reprised her role in To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You (2020) and, To All the Boys: Always and Forever (2021). Additional credits include Moonshot, Alita: Battle Angel, Boo, Bitch, Deadly Class, X-Men: Apocalypse, and Ruby Gillman: Teenage Kraken.  DGA award nominee Wadlow’s most recent theatrical film, Imaginary, marked his third collaboration with Jason Blum under a first-look deal that launched Wadlow’s own production company, Tower of Babble Entertainment. Prior to that, he was the director and executive producer of The Curse of Bridge Hollow, starring Marlon Wayans (White Chicks), which debuted at No. 1 on Netflix. This followed the two feature films he had in theaters at the same time: Bloodshot, the big screen adaptation of the critically acclaimed comic book that Wadlow developed and wrote for Sony/Columbia Pictures, starring Vin Diesel (The Fast and the Furious); and Fantasy Island, the re-imagining of the classic TV show that Wadlow directed, wrote, and produced for Blumhouse. His first collaboration with Blum, the original theatrical feature, Truth or Dare (via Universal Studios), grossed roughly $100M in theaters from a budget of just $3.5M. Wadlow’s other credits include True Memoirs of an International Assassin, Kick Ass 2, Never Back Down, Non-Stop, Bates Motel, The Strain, Ryan Hansen Solves Crime on Television, and the reboot of the classic 90’s TV show, Are You Afraid of the Dark?",
