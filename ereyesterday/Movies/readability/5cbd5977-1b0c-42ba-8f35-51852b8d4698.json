  "text": "A huge memorabilia from Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, which ran from March 2023 to December 2024, seems to have been purchased by the Pennsylvania-born artist herself. Recent reports suggest that Taylor Swift has bought the giant friendship bracelet that decorated the entrance of the New Orleans stadium that hosted her October 2024 concert. As such, fans have come out to inquire if she did, in fact, shell out money to acquire the said artefact. So, here’s everything to know about the recent sale of the bracelet and if the 14-time Grammy winner was indeed the buyer. Did Taylor Swift buy giant friendship bracelet from Eras tour? The “Blank Space” singer has reportedly splashed over $13,000 to purchase the giant inflatable friendship bracelet. According to the New Orleans media outlet 4WWL, the decoration hung over the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana during three of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour concerts at the location. It stretches over 140 feet in length and adorned the Caesars Superdome throughout her three-day stint at the venue back in October 2024. The friendship bracelet spells out ‘Taylor Swift The Eras Tour,’ with two beads of different colors separating each word. In a previous interview with Nola.com, Shawn Kolodny, a Miami-based artist who is famous for creating gigantic inflatable designs, described his creation for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour concert by saying, “It’s like a giant friendship bracelet bouncy house.” Kolodny, who primarily leads his creative ventures at the Big Shiny Balls studios, further explained that each bead, made out of nylon, is approximately seven feet tall. Due to the enormous nature of the structure, several workers had to make use of forklifts to put the bracelet in position prior to Swift’s concert. Meanwhile, Abby Jones, a sales and marketing director at ASM New Orleans, was the one who came up with this unique concept. She thought of it just one month before the pop icon graced the Louisiana audience with her presence. If things go as planned, the Louisiana Stadium and Exposition District should approve Taylor Swift’s purchase of the giant friendship bracelet following a board meeting later this week. Meanwhile, the singer’s personal services company, named Firefly Entertainment Inc., will collect, ship, and deliver the item to her after the fulfillment of the required paperwork.",
