This year's line-up boasts 95 world premieres from filmmakers across 36 countries, collecting everything from feature films to shorts, episodic content, audio storytelling, interactive games, and more.  I'll be on site for several days of the festival to screen films and speak with attending talent, so let's take a look at some of the selections that made my shortlist of interest: First off, the big trend this year is music documentaries - the festival has programmed at least fifteen music-based films, beginning with the opening night gala selection BILLY JOEL: AND SO IT GOES. The festivities will likely be more of a eulogy than a celebration due to recent developments, but it's still nice to kick off a definitively New York festival with one of the City's own beloved sons as the subject of its inaugural film. Other documentaries that feature prominently are METALLICA SAVED MY LIFE, BILLY IDOL SHOULD BE DEAD, BOY GEORGE 7 CULTURE CLUB, DEPECHE MODE: M, I WAS BORN THIS WAY: CARL BEAN, MOVE YA BODY: THE BIRTH OF HOUSE, and THE SIXTH BOROUGH. This final film made my shortlist as a documentary that explores the contribution of Long Island's \"indelible yet often overlooked impact on hip-hop's evolution, presented through the voices of the pioneering artists who shaped the genre's expansion beyond its urban roots.\" The film's premiere promises a post-screening performance from De La Soul and Rakim, which should prove entertaining as well as enlightening. Another music documentary of specific interest to me is called COUNTING CROWS: HAVE YOU SEEN ME LATELY? Taking its name from one of the songs from their sophomore album, Recovering the Satellites, the film directed by Amy Scott combines archival footage with reflections from the band member's hindsight, as well as contemporaries, fans, and more. As one of the Gen Xers caught by the throat by the band's seemingly overnight success, I am a fan of the music as well as the pageantry behind and around it. August and Everything After was a transformative album that catapulted its lead singer Adam Duritz into the spotlight, shining brightly on his humility and poetry. Acclaimed writer Daphne Merkin even wrote an essay about her obsession with him, and he became a posterchild of nineties Americana. This film hopefully explores what that sort of notoriety does to a \"normal\" guy and offers glimpses of what he and the band have been up to lately (hence the name). On the narrative side, there are several films that have piqued my interest, though from different latchpoints. Some boast flashy casts while others intrigue with story. Some offer director pedigree and some just seem unique. In no particular order, we begin with AFTER THIS DEATH. \"While hiking alone in the woods, Isabel encounters the enigmatic and alluring Elliott, a mysterious musician whose sudden presence transforms a remote cave into the stage for a dangerous dance of longing, attraction, and lust. What begins as a fleeting affair soon spirals into something heart ripping, until Elliott abruptly disappears, leaving Isabel to navigate the haunting aftershocks of their vanished love. As she struggles with obsession, toxic fandom, and fractured ideals, Isabel is forced to confront her hidden desires and the shifting boundaries of her own identity.\" While the story doesn't speak directly to me, the cast of Lee Pace (GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY), Rupert Friend (\"Obi-Wan Kenobi\"), and Gwendoline Christie (STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS) makes this a film that should at the very least have a picaresque carpet. Next is THE BEST YOU CAN, bringing Kevin Bacon (R.I.P.D.) and Kyra Sedgwick (CRITICAL CARE) together on screen after twenty years, from filmmaker Michael J. Weithorn. Weithorn is a seasoned Hollywood writer whose career stretches as far back as episodes of \"Benson\" and \"Family Ties,\" and the film costars Judd Hirsch (INDEPENDENCE DAY). \"Kyra Sedgwick and Kevin Bacon return together on screen — this time as two halves of an unlikely friendship between a security guard and a urologist whose chance encounter blooms into something deeper. As a series of text conversations over the phone lead to late-night revelations, the two navigate the ups and downs of their lives and their growing connection towards each other that feels impossible to describe.\" The synopsis gives me Liam Neeson (THE NAKED GUN) and Sandra Bullock (MISS CONGENIALITY) GUNSHY vibes, though I imagine with much less gunplay and, sadly, Oliver Platt (THE IMPOSTORS). However, I'm still intrigued and look forward to the opportunity to speak with the cast and crew next week. The next film is a funny one to look forward to at Tribeca, as the film will be available to stream on Prime Video two days after its premiere, but it looks so damned fun that I can't be blamed. The film is called DEEP COVER, and it stars Bryce Dallas Howard (\"The Walking Dead\"), Orlando Bloom (\"Carnival Row\"), Nick Mohammed (\"Ted Lasso\"), Sean Bean (GOLDENEYE), Paddy Condisine (THE WORLD'S END), and Ian McShane (HELLBOY 2019). \"When a down-on-her-luck improv comedy instructor (Howard) and a pair of her misguided students (Bloom and Mohammed) are recruited to go undercover and bust petty criminals, the offer seems like a unique opportunity. But when one of them decides to go off book, they suddenly find themselves trapped in an escalating London gang war where their “yes and…” skills do more harm than good. As they scramble to maintain their cover as hardened criminals, their real lives start to bleed dangerously close to their underworld personas until the trio finds unexpected allies — and even more unexpected enemies — in dark corners. The unlikely team is forced to confront their individual lives in a whole new way, asking themselves what comes next… if they make it out alive.\" The film makes its United States premiere at Tribeca on June 10th but if you can't make it, it starts streaming on Prime on June 12th. Next is EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE GREAT, starring Bryan Cranston (TOTAL RECALL) and Allison Janney (\"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\"), written and directed by Jon S. Baird (FILTH). \"The Smart family's life takes a dramatic turn when tragedy forces them to confront their oversized dreams, struggles with identity and chaotic regional theater life. As theater manager parents (Janney and Cranston) work to support their two sons — a hunky football star (Champion) and his flamboyant, theater-loving younger brother (Ainsworth) — unexpected circumstances compel them to move in with Janney's estranged brother (Cooper). What begins as a temporary arrangement soon unravels years of familial tension, prompting each member to reevaluate their place in the world and in their relationships.\" The film costars Jack Champion (SCREAM VI), Benjamin Evan Ainsworth (PINOCCHIO 2022), and Chris Cooper (AMERICAN BEAUTY), which alone seems worth the price of admission. The film seems to be a dramedy, a genre that holds a special sway over me, and with this cast, I feel very good about this film's prospects. The film makes its world premiere at Tribeca on Monday, June 9th. Another film with a stacked cast is HORSEGIRLS, starring Gretchen Mol (THE LAST TIME I COMMITTED SUICIDE), Lillian Carrier (EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY), and Tony Hale (HAPPYTHANKYOUMOREPLEASE). This film also appears to be a dramedy, though the subject matter makes riding the razor of comedy a more delicate task: \"As her mother battles an uncertain diagnosis, neurodivergent 22-year-old Margarita discovers a source of strength in an unexpected place: the sport of hobbyhorsing.\" I was suprised to discover while researching this title that hobbyhorsing actually is becoming a recognized sport in several countries and is even being considered for the 2028 Olympics. Bet you didn't have that on your bingo card. One of the films I'm most excited to see is PARADISE RECORDS from writer/director/rapper Logic (THE 4:30 MOVIE). In a film that could very well be this generation's EMPIRE RECORDS, Logic has paired with Kevin Smith (who serves as executive producer and editor) to bring this alt-comedy to life. \"Cooper, a well-meaning record store owner, is trying to keep the doors of Paradise Records open. He’s facing foreclosure, the bank won’t give him a loan, someone keeps offering to buy the property — and then the robbery. He’s not having a great day. Thankfully, he’s got his motley crew of entertaining employees and a lot of weed to help him figure out how to get himself out of this mess.\" I have high hopes for this film, pun intended. Another film that promises to be interesting, and a likely diversion from the comedies that have permeated this list, is SOVEREIGN, starring Dennis Quaid (INNERSPACE), Nick Offerman (CIVIL WAR), and Jacob Tremblay (THE TOXIC AVENGER). \"This gripping thriller follows Jerry Kane (Offerman), a struggling single father who desperately tries to provide for his homeschooled fifteen-year-old son, Joe (Tremblay). Jerry embraces the Sovereign Citizen Movement, indoctrinating Joe into believing that laws are mere illusions and freedom must be seized by force. As they travel the country, Joe quietly begins to question his father’s worldview, dreaming of a normal life beyond their constant travels.\" The film, written and directed by Christian Swegal, promises to tackle the nuance of anti-government movements and counterculture ideologies through the lens of a father-son dynamic, a topic that desperately needs some measured reflection on screen and off. One last narrative that intrigues me through casting alone is A TREE FELL IN THE WOODS, starring Josh Gad (PIXELS), Daveed Diggs (\"Snowpiercer\"), Alexandra Daddario (BURY THE EX), and Ashley Park (JOY RIDE). \"Mitch (Gad) and Debs (Daddario) are childhood friends who go on a New Year’s Eve trip to a cabin in the woods with their respective spouses (Park and Diggs), but things are clearly not all great for both couples. As the titular tree falls, nearly killing Mitch and Debs, things are seen that were not meant to be seen and truth-telling enters the picture when an unidentifiable and slightly psychedelic drink is drunk in this entertaining dramedy about the lies we tell ourselves about ourselves and how to untangle them all.\" This seems like just the type of claustrophobic comedy that Tribeca needs, and could serve as a nice digestif to more serious fare like SOVEREIGN. Finally, swinging back to documentaries, there are two that have really caught my eye, and it's likely because I'm such a fan of 90s sketch comedy. WE ARE PAT follows the comedy troupe of the same name, comprised of trans and androgynous improvisers in their own lives who re-appropriate the problematic character as portrayed by Julia Sweeney on Saturday Night Live to wrench Pat free from mishandling. LONG LIVE THE STATE dives into the titular sketch comedy show from MTV that launched the careers of Michael Ian Black, Joe Lo Truglio, Thomas Lennon, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Ken Marino, Robert Ben Garant, and Michael Showalter. If I'm jazzed about learning more about the Counting Crows, then I'm chuckled to learn more about these classics. This is of course just the tip of the iceberg at Tribeca Film Festival, which will showcase 118 feature films and 93 short films. I'm going to watch as much as I can, talk to as many folks as I can, and hopefully find time for a slice of pizza or a burrito. I'll let you know how it shakes out after all the dust has settled. Of course, you can check out the whole program here and let us know what films would make your shortlist. Until next time, take care. -McEric, aka Eric McClanahan-",

Thankfully, he’s got his motley crew of entertaining employees and a lot of weed to help him figure out how to get himself out of this mess.\u0026#34; I have high hopes for this film, pun intended.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg title=\"Logic in PARADISE RECORDS\" src=\"https://media.aintitcool.com/media/_versions/article_images_2022/mceric/paradise_records_medium.png\" alt=\"Logic in PARADISE RECORDS\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother film that promises to be interesting, and a likely diversion from the comedies that have permeated this list, is SOVEREIGN, starring Dennis Quaid (INNERSPACE), Nick Offerman (CIVIL WAR), and Jacob Tremblay (THE TOXIC AVENGER). \u0026#34;T\u003cspan\u003ehis gripping thriller follows Jerry Kane (\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOfferman\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e), a struggling single father who desperately tries to provide for his homeschooled fifteen-year-old son, Joe (\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTremblay\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e). Jerry embraces the Sovereign Citizen Movement, indoctrinating Joe into believing that laws are mere illusions and freedom must be seized by force. As they travel the country, Joe quietly begins to question his father’s worldview, dreaming of a normal life beyond their constant travels.\u0026#34; The film, written and directed by Christian Swegal, promises to tackle the nuance of anti-government movements and counterculture ideologies through the lens of a father-son dynamic, a topic that desperately needs some measured reflection on screen and off.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg title=\"Nick Offerman in SOVEREIGN\" src=\"https://media.aintitcool.com/media/_versions/article_images_2022/mceric/sovereign_medium.png\" alt=\"Nick Offerman in SOVEREIGN\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne last narrative that intrigues me through casting alone is A TREE FELL IN THE WOODS, starring Josh Gad (PIXELS), Daveed Diggs (\u0026#34;Snowpiercer\u0026#34;), Alexandra Daddario (BURY THE EX), and Ashley Park (JOY RIDE). \u0026#34;\u003cspan\u003eMitch (\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGad\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e) and Debs (\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDaddario\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e) are childhood friends who go on a New Year’s Eve trip to a cabin in the woods with their respective spouses (\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePark\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e and \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDiggs\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e), but things are clearly not all great for both couples. As the titular tree falls, nearly killing Mitch and Debs, things are seen that were not meant to be seen and truth-telling enters the picture when an unidentifiable and slightly psychedelic drink is drunk in this entertaining dramedy about the lies we tell ourselves about ourselves and how to untangle them all.\u0026#34; This seems like just the type of claustrophobic comedy that Tribeca needs, and could serve as a nice digestif to more serious fare like SOVEREIGN.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg title=\"Diggs, Daddario, Gad, and Park in A TREE FELL IN THE WOODS\" src=\"https://media.aintitcool.com/media/_versions/tree_fell_in_the_woods_medium.png\" alt=\"Diggs, Daddario, Gad, and Park in A TREE FELL IN THE WOODS\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, swinging back to documentaries, there are two that have really caught my eye, and it\u0026#39;s likely because I\u0026#39;m such a fan of 90s sketch comedy. WE ARE PAT follows the comedy troupe of the same name, comprised of trans and androgynous improvisers in their own lives who re-appropriate the problematic character as portrayed by Julia Sweeney on Saturday Night Live to wrench Pat free from mishandling. LONG LIVE THE STATE dives into the titular sketch comedy show from MTV that launched the careers of Michael Ian Black, Joe Lo Truglio, Thomas Lennon, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Ken Marino, Robert Ben Garant, and Michael Showalter. If I\u0026#39;m jazzed about learning more about the Counting Crows, then I\u0026#39;m chuckled to learn more about these classics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is of course just the tip of the iceberg at Tribeca Film Festival, which will showcase 118 feature films and 93 short films. I\u0026#39;m going to watch as much as I can, talk to as many folks as I can, and hopefully find time for a slice of pizza or a burrito. I\u0026#39;ll let you know how it shakes out after all the dust has settled.
