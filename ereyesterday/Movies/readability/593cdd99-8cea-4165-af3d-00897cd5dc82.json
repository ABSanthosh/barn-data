  "description": "\"I'm one of those lucky people who got to do for a living what I would've done anyway!\" This is wonderful! Coldplay has released a brand new music video for the single \"All My Love\" off their brand new album called \"Moon Music\". But it's nothing like any usual music video. Coldplay's Chris Martin hangs out with the legendary Dick Van Dyke, who is turning 99 years old (!!) and plays on his piano while Dick dances around his home. All of it is filmed \u0026 edited into a lovely tribute to the iconic performer / comedian / actor Dick Van Dyke, cut with footage \u0026 photographs from his illustrious career in show business. It's co-directed by the filmmakers Spike Jonze \u0026 Mary Wigmore, which actually makes it the first real Spike Jonze-directed project we've seen in a while. And it's just so delightful. Shot in location at his home in Malibu, it's a lovely, heartfelt look at his life as he reflects on his age. \"I'm acutely aware that I could go any day now... but I don't know why it doesn't concern me. I'm not afraid of it. I have the feeling that I'm gonna be alright.\" Dance [â€¦]",
