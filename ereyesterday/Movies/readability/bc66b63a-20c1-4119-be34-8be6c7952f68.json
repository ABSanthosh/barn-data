  "text": "Cole Hauser and Kelly Reilly in 'Yellowstone' Season 5 Part II Paramount+ Although his work with Taylor Sheridan is far from over, Cole Hauser is keeping tight-lipped on what’s to come for the Duttons. The Yellowstone star recently played coy about his and Kelly Reilly‘s upcoming spinoff of the Paramount Network neo-Western family drama, which airs its finale ‘Life Is a Promise’ on Sunday, Dec. 15 at 8pm ET, as he discussed the future of the franchise. “I think America has spoken. They still love the show,” he told People. “There’s obviously just tons of people that every Sunday get together with their families, and we give them the experience of taking ’em out of their own living rooms and putting ’em in Montana and entertaining them. And I think ultimately it’s just that simple.” Watch on Deadline Hauser’s interview comes after Deadline revealed that he and Reilly had closed deals to reprise their roles as Rip Wheeler and Beth Dutton in their own spinoff. “We will see what happens over the next year or so and we’ll see what’s next,” added Hauser without specifics. “Hopefully, we can continue to get in people’s living rooms and entertain them the way we have over the last seven years.” Cole Hauser as Rip Wheeler in Yellowstone Reilly also stayed mum on the spinoff as she bid farewell to the parent series, which has run for five seasons since it premiered in 2018. “Hi, I’m so deep into another role at the moment about another land worth fighting for in the UK .. but across the pond the finale is happening tonight of the show,” she wrote Sunday on Instagram. “Whatever the future holds this is the ending of the show we have been making for the past 7 years. “Words cannot convey how I feel about the people I got to work and create with over the seasons. I have made true life long friends. The support from the crew and the trust and dedication of the cast. The words I got to say and the woman I got to inhabit. It changed me. It lit me up. It challenged me in every way possible and I will forever be grateful for it. For Taylor Sheridan who took a chance on me and continued to write her in ways I got to feel on fire as an actor. Thank you Taylor.” Reilly added, “Thank you the audience we made it for, for being on this journey with us. We really cared about making something special for you all … Enjoy tonight ,get your tissues and your [drink emoji].” In addition to Reilly and Hauser’s upcoming series, the Yellowstone offshoot 1923 continues on Feb. 23 with Season 2 on Paramount+, with the upcoming spinoff The Madison also expected to debut in 2025.
