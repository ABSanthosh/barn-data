  "text": "Armie Hammer is not working with the Safdie brothers, despite a cryptic Instagram post teasing a collaboration. On Monday afternoon, Hammer shared a movie poster to his Instagram account teasing a project called “Persona Non Grata” directed by “Uncut Gems” duo Josh and Benny Safdie, writing, “Fall 2026” in the caption. Despite dozens of comments hyping up Hammer, Variety is told by reps for both Benny and Josh Safdie that the project is not real. Hammer, who previously starred in films like “The Social Network” and “Call Me By Your Name,” saw his career derailed four years ago following allegations of sexual assault. Popular on Variety Hammer was accused in 2021 of sexual abuse and improper behavior by multiple women; private messages he allegedly sent to women about his cannibalistic fantasies and sexual fetishes were also leaked online. In the wake of the scandal, Hammer was dropped by his agency, WME, and exited several projects, including the Paramount+ series “The Offer” and Jennifer Lopez’s “Shotgun Wedding.” The actor, who returned to acting last year opposite William H. Macy in the Western feature “Frontier Crucible,” will next appear in Uwe Boll’s “Citizen Vigilante.” Earlier this year, Hammer told Christina Pazsitzy and Tom Segura on the most recent episode of their podcast “Your Mom’s House” that his acting career has now picked up so much that he’s “turning jobs down.” “My dance card’s getting pretty full. That first job that I turned down after four years of this shit, I mean, it was the best feeling I’ve ever had,” he said. “It’s slow, but generally now the conversation when my name comes up with people in the industry is, ‘Man, that guy got fucked.’ And that feels really good. It’s really encouraging.”",
