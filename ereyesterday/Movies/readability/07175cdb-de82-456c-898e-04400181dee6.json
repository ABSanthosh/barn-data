  "text": "The two-part HBO documentary “Billy Joel: And So It Goes” has been revealed as the opening night film of the 2025 Tribeca Festival, this year presented by OKX. The announcement came from Co-Founder and CEO of Tribeca Festival and Tribeca Enterprises, Jane Rosenthal, who delivered the news during NAB Show’s Business of Entertainment event, presented by Ankler Media on Sunday, April 6. “For nearly 25 years, the Tribeca Festival has celebrated the artists who give New York its heart and soul, and on the opening night of the 2025 Festival, we are thrilled to honor Billy Joel — an artist who has embodied that very spirit,” said Rosenthal. “Paying tribute to the legendary performer who captured the essence of a ‘New York State of Mind’ is a perfect way to kick off this year’s celebration of creativity and inspiration.” Tribeca’s opening night at the Beacon Theatre in New York on June 4 will be presented by OKX and City National Bank, with “Billy Joel: And So It Goes” produced by HBO Documentary Films and directed by Emmy winners Susan Lacy (HBO’s “Jane Fonda in Five Acts” and “Spielberg”) and Jessica Levin (HBO’s “The Janes” and “Jane Fonda in Five Acts”). Lacy is also known as the creator and executive producer of PBS’ “American Masters” series. She is currently in a multi-year deal to produce and direct documentaries for HBO. “I and my co-director, Jessica Levin, couldn’t be more thrilled about our film ‘Billy Joel: And So It Goes’ opening the esteemed Tribeca Festival,” said Lacy in a statement. “Our thanks go out to Jane Rosenthal and the Festival team and to HBO and the wonderful folks there who have supported us throughout in our efforts to bring an in-depth, honest, and musically expressive portrait of this complex talent. We are beyond appreciative of Billy Joel’s trust in us to bring his story to the screen. There is no better place for this film to premiere than at the Beacon Theater, the venue for so many historic musical events for decades, and in the city so important to Billy Joel.” Continuing to highlight groundbreaking stories that unite communities and fans globally, the 2025 Tribeca Festival is scheduled to run from June 4 to June 15 in New York City and will include curated lineups across film, music, TV, audio storytelling, talks, games, and immersive programming. “Billy Joel: And So It Goes” is also produced by Lacy and Levin’s company Pentimento Productions in association with Hazy Mills Productions and Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman’s shingle, Playtone Productions. It’s official synopsis describes the doc as “an expansive portrait of the life and music of Billy Joel, exploring the love, loss, and personal struggles that fuel his songwriting. With unprecedented access to never-before-seen performances, home movies, and personal photographs, along with extensive, in-depth one-on-one interviews, the documentary intimately explores the life and work of Joel, whose music has endured across generations.” Following its world premiere at the Tribeca Festival, the film will debut on HBO and will be available to stream on Max this summer. The full festival lineup will be announced soon.",
