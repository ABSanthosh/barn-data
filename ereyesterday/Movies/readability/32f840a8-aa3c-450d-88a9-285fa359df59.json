  "text": "“Cable Girls” lead Yon Gonzalez and Samantha Siqueiros, from “Money Heist” prequel “Berlin,” are set to topline Telemundo’s remake of Spanish hit series “Velvet.”  They are joined by Ecuador’s Danilo Carrera, whose credits include “Sed de Venganza” and “Hijas de la Luna.” The original “Velvet” is a 2014 Spanish drama series produced by Bambú Productions for Atresmedia Televisión. Created by Ramon Campos and Gema R. Neira, the show is set in the world of fashion and delves into themes of love, family and ambition. Spanning four seasons, it received acclaim for its depiction of the era’s glamorous lifestyle. The main plot revolves around the “impossible” romance between Alberto Márquez, heir of Galerías Velvet, one of the most prominent fashion houses of that era, and Ana who works as a seamstress there. Telemundo’s new version is a multi-episode telenovela format, set in present-day New York. It will be filmed at Telemundo Studios in Miami and on location in New York starting late February. Talks are underway with leading Latino fashion designers to have cameos in the series. Popular on Variety “Since we’re filming in Miami, we’re also taking the opportunity to include celebrities — singers, athletes and other famous personalities. We’re in talks with many of those who reside here in Miami, so they can potentially participate in the series at some point,” says Telemundo Studios executive VP Javier Pons in an interview with Variety. “I must say that ever since we announced our plans to create ‘Velvet,’ there has been an extraordinary wave of excitement and anticipation across the market. We’ve received countless casting proposals from actors and actresses eager to join the project. It’s been a challenging process, but we’ve curated something truly special,” he adds. Reflecting on the upcoming show, Pons notes: “This once again highlights Telemundo’s commitment to innovation, along with Telemundo Studios’ efforts to not only feature an impressive cast — filled with prominent names from the North American and Mexican entertainment industry, but also to showcase and provide opportunities to emerging talents.” Siqueiros will play Ana Velásquez, who rises from humble beginnings in her native Mexico to establish herself at a young age in New York, reflecting the struggles and challenges faced by Latinos across generations in the United States. “It’s a series centered around two hearts of humanity, not just one. One heart lies in haute couture, where glamour, luxury, ambition, and betrayal reside, set in Manhattan. The other heart is in Queens, where the Velvet workers live — a heart grounded in simplicity, everyday life and the struggles of the ordinary,” Pons tells Variety, adding that they would closely follow the plotlines of the original. NBCUniversal’s U.S. Hispanic broadcast network is expecting banner years ahead, given its upcoming slate and exclusive coverage of the FIFA Soccer World Cup in 2026. In its year-end report, Telemundo announced that it had secured the top spot as the #1 Spanish-language broadcast network in Monday-Sunday primetime, attracting 962,000 total viewers with its regular programming, led by “El Señor de los Cielos” and reality show “La Casa de los Famosos.” The network achieved a 13% year-over-year increase in audience, outperforming its Spanish-language rivals, who saw a decline.",
