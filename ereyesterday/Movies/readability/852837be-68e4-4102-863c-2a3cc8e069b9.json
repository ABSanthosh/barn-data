  "text": "Two prominent last-minute additions have been made to the Coachella 2025 lineup, with the announcement of set times revealing that Ed Sheeran and Weezer have both joined the bill. Festivalgoers won’t get both artists in the same weekend, though. They are playing virtually in the same time slot in the same venue on respective Saturdays, with surprisingly early start times. Weezer will perform in the Mojave tent on April 12 at 3:10 p.m., and Sheeran will take the same stage at 3 p.m. on April 19. Weezer is scheduled to play for a brisk 45 minutes, while Sheeran has a full hour. The announcement of set times clears up a few mysteries, like how the equally billed Saturday headliners Green Day and Travis Scott will share performance duties on Saturday night of each weekend. Green Day is scheduled to play those nights from 9:05 to 10:45 p.m. PT, and after a healthy set break, Scott will take the stage at midnight. Popular on Variety On the other two nights of each weekend, with no after-hours attraction on the main stage, things should wrap up somewhat earlier. On the two Friday nights, Lady Gaga will take the stage at 11:10, and on the Sunday night bills, Post Malone will cap things off starting at 10:25. Coachella announced the times via social media posts; see the full lineups for both weekends on the festival’s Instagram post, below. A few artists who were initially announced as part of the lineup are missing, though those were announced prior to Saturday’s set time unveiling. FKA Twigs announced Friday that she would have to miss the festival due to visa issues. Prior to that, Anitta had announced in late March that she would be MIA on account of “unexpected personal reasons.” For Sheeran, his surprising addition is part of a slow rollout of promotion, information and music for his upcoming album, “Play.” No release date has been announced for the record, and it’s said not to be looming immediately, but a first single from the album, “Azizam.” Sheeran has made some pop-up appearances recently, busking in front of surprised passers-by, while also previewing tracks from the forthcoming record for tastemakers. He’ll next be embarking on a tour of Europe from late May through August.",
