  "text": "The Mediapro Studio’s North American division has tapped former Apple TV+ creative exec Francesca Ricagni for its newly created position of Head of U.S. Hispanic Content as it ramps up its operations in the region. Founded last year, the studio’s new Los Angeles-based operation, led by J.C. Acosta, has been bolstering its English-language content. Ricagni will lead the complementary U.S. Hispanic content strategy aimed at Spanish-language television channels, operators, and streaming platforms in North America. At play is a lucrative Latino market comprising more than 60 million in the U.S. alone and in excess of 650 million worldwide. “Francesca’s long experience, vast network of talent relationships and expertise on entertaining U.S. Hispanic audiences, make her a perfect fit for our team,” Acosta said. Popular on Variety “At such a transformative time in our industry, I am inspired to join the team at The Mediapro Studio U.S. and Canada.  What a unique opportunity to tell rich, authentic stories that represent and resonate with the U.S. Hispanic audience while captivating the world,” said Ricagni, adding: “Together with the rising and exceptional Hispanic talent, we’re excited to break new ground, showcasing our diverse, multi-layered experiences and creating content that celebrates our stories, culture, and unique perspectives, elevating them all on the global stage.” Ricagni has played a key role in the success of several acclaimed Apple TV+ projects. She was instrumental in bringing “Land of Women,” starring Eva Longoria in her first Spanish-speaking lead role, to the platform. She also contributed to “Acapulco,” starring Eugenio Derbez, one of Apple TV+’s most celebrated series. Now in its fourth season, the show has garnered widespread recognition, including The Comedy Series Award at the Critics Choice Awards during the 4th annual Celebration of Latino Cinema and Television. Additionally, Francesca worked on the groundbreaking “Midnight Family,” produced by Fabula, Oscar-winning director Pablo Larraín’s company, which won Best International Series at the same Critics Choice event, enhancing the platform’s presence in U.S. Hispanic and Latin American markets. Previously at Amazon Studios, Francesca helped shape the studio’s original Latin American programming, overseeing over 30 projects in development, including hits like “Como Sobrevivir Soltero,” “Porno y Helado,” “El Fin del Amor” and the second season of “Juego de las Llaves.”",
