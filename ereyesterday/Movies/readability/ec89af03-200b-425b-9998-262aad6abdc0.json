Sure, it's a disturbing sort of magical, but that’s the best kind.\" Ed Kemper features Lew Temple, Cassandra Gava, Robert Miano, Brinke Stevens, Susan Priver, and Brandon Kirk. This looks like a really bad student film - don't waste any of your time on this. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Chad Ferrin's horror movie Ed Kemper, direct from YouTube: This story is based on actual events. Chad Ferrin's horror feature Ed Kemper follows the horrifying true story of Ed Kemper (starring Lew Temple), a cunning and sadistic serial killer shaped by childhood abuse, whose charming facade masked his grotesque obsession with murder, mutilation, and the ultimate act of revenge against the woman who scarred him most—his mother. Ed Kemper is directed by American B-movie filmmaker Chad Ferrin, director of many genre films including Parasites, The Chair, Attack in LA, Exorcism at 60,000 Feet, Night Caller, Pig Killer, Scalper, and H.P. Lovecraft's the Old Ones previously, plus other horror projects. The screenplay is written by Chad Ferrin and Stephen Johnston. Produced by Michael Conroy, Chad Ferrin, Silawn Lewis, and Jeff Olan. Dread will debut the Ed Kemper film in select US theaters on April 4th, 2025, and also on VOD starting April 8th soon this spring. Anyone into this story?
