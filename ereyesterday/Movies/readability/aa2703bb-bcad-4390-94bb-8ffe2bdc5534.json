This looks really lovely and wholesome and uplifting - Leguizamo seems to be bringing so much charm \u0026 warmth to his role. Here's the official trailer for Tracie Laymon's indie film Bob Trevino Likes It, direct from YouTube: Bob Trevino (John Leguizamo) works long hours alone at a construction company to support his wife's scrapbooking habit. The couple has endured a lot in the past decade, and Bob has sought to put his wife first, to the point of ignoring his own feelings and need for friendship, meaning, and connection. Until he gets an unexpected Facebook message from a stranger. Lily \u0026 Bob's blossoming friendship becomes a vital source of connection and healing in both their lives. Bob’s small acts of fatherly kindness fill a familial void in Lily's life and hold the power to change her direction forever. In their own ways, these two must both learn they are worthy of extraordinary love exemplified through small acts of kindness. Bob Trevino Likes It is written and directed by indie filmmaker Tracie Laymon, making her feature directorial debut after many shorts previously including in Girls! Girls! Girls!. It's produced by Tracie Laymon, Sean Mullin, Edgar Rosa, Felipe Dieppa. This initially premiered at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival last year. Roadside will debut Laymon's Bob Trevino Likes It in select US theaters starting March 21st, 2025 coming soon. Interested? Find more posts in: Indies, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
