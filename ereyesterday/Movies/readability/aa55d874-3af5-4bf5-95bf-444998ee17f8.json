  "text": "During the Summer Game Fest live showcase, Tribute Games revealed that its next side-scrolling beat ‘em up will be based on the popular Bryan Lee O’Malley Scott Pilgrim. A brand new trailer was shown, giving players a glimpse of the upcoming game. What is the new Scott Pilgrim video game? From the makers of the critically acclaimed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, Tribute Games’ newly revealed game is called Scott Pilgrim EX. The retro-inspired beat ‘em up will feature seven playable characters from the beloved comics, each with their own abilities. Alongside the typical beat ‘em up gameplay, there will be some non-linear exploration sections that allow players to openly traverse the game’s setting of Toronto. Check out the trailer below: For Scott Pilgrim EX, Tribute Games entered a “creative partnership” with O’Malley. The game also features new art from Paul Robertson and music from Anamanaguchi. Scott Pilgrim Takes Off director BenDavid Grabinski is a creative advisor on the game. It has been quite a while since Scott Pilgrim received a video game adaptation. Back in 2010, Ubisoft released the cult-classic beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World which is based on the story and art from O’Malley’s iconic comic book. When it originally launched for PS3 and Xbox 360, it was met with decent reviews. According to review aggregate site Metacritic, it garnered an average score of 77. The PS3 and 360 game was eventually brought to Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC in 2021. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World: Complete Edition included the full game, as well as its Knives Chau and Wallace Add-On Packs. Scott Pilgrim EX launches for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC in 2026. Make sure to check back to see more announcements coming from the Summer Game Fest live showcase.",
