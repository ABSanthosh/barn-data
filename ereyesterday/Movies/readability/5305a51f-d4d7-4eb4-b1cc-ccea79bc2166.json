Director Gareth Edwards discusses his approach to making prehistoric creatures feel lifelike for actors on set. Cast members praise Edwards' ability to craft believable dinosaur interactions despite VFX challenges. The featurette highlights the film's ambitious use of visual effects and practical filmmaking techniques. Everyone loves dinosaurs, but bringing them to the big screen doesn't always go well. Sometimes, you get classics that stand the test of time, and sometimes you get movies that are forgotten within what feels like days. Universal is looking to make another film that will last with¬†Jurassic World Rebirth¬†, and bringing on director¬†Gareth Edwards was a good first step. A new behind-the-scenes featurette was released, which spotlights Edwards' philosophy and perspective when it comes to directing a film where most of the monsters aren't there for your actors to react to. Several cast members also praised Edwards for how he went about making the dinosaurs feel real, even if they weren't there at all. Jurassic World Rebirth: Summary, Cast List, Release Date A new era is born. Next summer, three years after the¬†Jurassic World trilogy concluded, with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring¬†Jurassic¬†series evolves in an ingenious new direction with¬†Jurassic World Rebirth. Anchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, breakthrough talent Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar¬Æ¬†winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an intrepid team racing to secure DNA samples from the three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air. Also starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo,¬†the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story)¬†from a script by original¬†Jurassic Park¬†screenwriter David Koepp. Five years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion,¬†the planet's ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures within that tropical biosphere hold the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind. Academy Award¬Æ¬†nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure genetic material from the world's three most massive dinosaurs. When Zora's operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on an island where they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that's been hidden from the world for decades. Ali is Duncan Kincaid, Zora's most trusted team leader; Emmy nominee and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked,¬†Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland,¬†Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer,¬†Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. The cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben's family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs' crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). Jurassic World Rebirth¬†is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar¬Æ¬†nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime¬†Jurassic¬†franchise producers and of this summer's blockbuster,¬†Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.¬†Jurassic World Rebirth will be released in theaters on July 2, 2025. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!
