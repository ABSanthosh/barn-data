The five-time host took aim at Justin Timberlake, Kevin Hart, Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs and The Vatican as he shared a taste of some of the jokes he would have used if he’d returned for Sunday’s awards show, which will be hosted by Nikki Glaser for the first time. “Sat in the bath wondering about what I would say if I were hosting The Golden Globes on Sunday. It’s been a pretty good year for material,” wrote Gervais on X after previously hosting in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2016 and 2020, Watch on Deadline He began, “Hello, and welcome to the 82nd Golden Globe awards. What a year it’s been. Hundreds of entertainers jumped at the chance to go to The Vatican to meet The Pope. Many from Hollywood. Obviously they weren’t content with only being part of the 2nd biggest pedo ring in the world…” “Justin Timberlake was convicted of Drink Driving,” wrote Gervais in another post. “If he’d have gone to jail he’d have heard the words ‘Sexy Back’ a lot more often.” Sat in the bath wondering about what I would say if I were hosting The Golden Globes on Sunday. It’s been a pretty good year for material 😂 pic.twitter.com/cCelTdy0Eb— Ricky Gervais (@rickygervais) January 3, 2025 “Kevin Hart said that being at one of Diddy’s parties was uncomfortable, as he wouldn’t leave him alone. Eventually he had to shout ‘Imma Midget, not a child,'” he joked. Gervais’ jokes come after Glaser said she’s “not gonna go so hard that anyone’s gonna be offended” during her hosting gig on Sunday’s awards show, airing live at 8 p.m. ET on CBS and streaming on Paramount+. “I’ve made a point not to, and that’s not to disappoint anyone who’s hoping I’m going to pull a Ricky Gervais,” added Glaser. “I’m not Ricky Gervais. This isn’t my last Golden Globes, this is my first one. He really went hard on his last one. He was ready to burn some bridges [because] it didn’t matter anymore.”",
