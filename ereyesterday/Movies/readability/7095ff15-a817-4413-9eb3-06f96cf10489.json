  "text": "While many are suffering from superhero fatigue, Prime Video has found a way into the genre that seems to be working for many with the series “The Boys” and its animated adaptation of “Invincible” from Robert Kirkman. Celebrating the approaching Season 3 of “Invincible,” Kirkman, as well as voice cast members Sandra Oh and Gillian Jacobs, appeared today at CCXP, a comic convention held in São Paolo, Brazil, to unveil the official trailer. Featuring the voice talent of Steven Yeun, J.K. Simmons, Walton Goggins, and many more, “Invincible” follows the trials and tribulations of Mark Grayson, a normal teen with the world’s strongest superhero for a dad whose life is turned upside down upon his own powers being developed. After facing his own father in Season 1 and a multiverse traveler with a mutated brain in Season 2, it seems the foe Mark must encounter in Season 3 is himself. With the threat of the superior humanoid Viltrumites still present, Mark/Invincible, the Guardians of the Globe, Allen the Alien (Seth Rogen), and all those in their corner must work harder than ever to protect their world. A strong force working against Viltrumites and trying to get Mark to do the same is Global Defense Agency director Cecil Stedman (Goggins). Furthering his use of the techno-zombie ReAnimen, Stedman finds himself pitted against Invincible as they both work to defend the planet in different ways. But is it the real Invincible or a variant who’s come over from one of last season’s multiverses? With a new black-and-blue suit, it seems that no matter what, this is not the character fans have come to know and love, and no one is recognizing that more than Invincible himself. Popular on IndieWire Other members of the voice cast include Zazie Beetz, Zachary Quinto, Jason Mantzoukas, Chris Diamantopoulos, Andrew Rannells, Ben Schwartz, Clancy Brown, Jay Pharoah, Mark Hamill, Grey DeLisle, Ross Marquand, Khary Payton, Kevin Michael Richardson, and Melise Jow. Co-produced by Skybound and Amazon MGM Studios, the first three episodes of “Invincible” Season 3 stream exclusively on Prime Video starting Thursday, February 6, 2025, with additional new episodes dropping every Thursday through March 13.
