The \"world's best boss\" ‚Äì Feathers McGraw ‚Äì is back with a vengeance. üêß A brand new epic Wallace \u0026 Gromit family adventure from Aaardman, this is the first full length W\u0026G feature film in 19 years since BAFTA \u0026 Academy Award-winning The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. When Wallace invents a \"smart gnome\" it seems to develop a mind of its own and go haywire with evil A.I. programming.

With the voices of Ben Whitehead (who gets his own video below), Peter Kay, Lauren Patel, Reece Shearsmith, Diane Morgan, Adjoa Andoh, Muzz Khan, and Lenny Henry.

Especially seeing how much work goes into hand-crafting literally every single part of the film - including even deciding where the camera goes, what the lighting \u0026 animation will look like for every last character, and everything else. Enjoy. Here's a few behind-the-scenes videos for Wallace \u0026 Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, from YouTube: You can watch the official trailer for Wallace \u0026 Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl right here for more footage. Aardman's 4-time Academy Award-winning director Nick Park \u0026 Emmy-nominated Merlin Crossingham return with a brand new epic adventure: Vengeance Most Fowl. In this next Wallace \u0026 Gromit installment from Aardman, Gromit's concern that Wallace is becoming too dependent on his own inventions proves justified, when Wallace invents a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù gnome that seems to develop a mind of its own. When it emerges that a vengeful figure from the past might be masterminding things, it falls to Gromit to battle sinister forces and save his master... or Wallace may never be able to invent again! Wallace \u0026 Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl is co-directed by animation filmmakers Nick Park (director of Wallace \u0026 Gromit: The Wrong Trousers, Chicken Run, Wallace \u0026 Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, Early Man previously) \u0026 Merlin Crossingham (\"Morph\" series, Wallace \u0026 Gromit: The Big Fix Up video game). The screenplay is written by Mark Burton; from a story by Nick Park \u0026 Mark Burton. Produced by Richard Beek. Made by Aardman in Bristol, UK. This is premiering at AFI Fest in LA soon. Netflix will then debut Wallace \u0026 Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl streaming on Netflix starting January 3rd, 2025 - it's now ready to view. Who's excited for it?
