  "text": "In a surprise piece of news, Kevin Costner‘s Horizon: An American Saga: Chapter 1 is now available to watch on Netflix. ‘The Western, which released in June 2024, is available to watch now. The move comes as a surprise, as previous reports on the film hinted that the film would be a Max exclusive. However, it seems as if that’s no longer the case. The first chapter of Kevin Costner’s planned saga released to mostly mixed reviews, and grossed just $38 million worldwide against a $50 million budget. Following its poor release, New Line Cinema removed the film’s sequel — which was filmed back-to-back with Chapter 1 — from its original release date of August 2024. The film still has not yet come out, but did premiere at 2024’s Venice Film Festival in September. What do we know about the Horizon: An American Saga sequels? Horizon: An American Saga was initially envisioned by Costner as a four-part Western saga. It’s unclear if Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 will ever release, however, although Costner has remained committed to making the films in some capacity. In a recent interview with Deadline, he said he would be making the movies in some way or form. “I’m don’t know how I’m going to do it, but I’m going to make [Chapter 3] and then I’m going to make the fourth one. And if you want to say ’the end’ at that point, then that’s the end.” Horizon: An America Saga is set over a 15-year period during the American Civil War. Plot details are largely being kept under wraps at this time; however, according to Deadline, the epic will see Costner battle natural elements and interact with the indigenous peoples affected by the settlement of the American West. Along with directing, Costner stars in Horizon: An America Saga with Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Jena Malone, Abbey Lee, Michael Rooker, Danny Huston, Luke Wilson, Isabelle Fuhrman, Jeff Fahey, Will Patton, Tatanka Means, Owen Crow Shoe, Ella Hunt, and Jamie Campbell Bower. Costner is also credited as a producer alongside Howard Kaplan and Mark Gillard.",
