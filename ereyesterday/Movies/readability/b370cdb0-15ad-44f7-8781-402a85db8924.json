  "text": "Paul Simon has cancelled two shows on the A Quiet Celebration tour, his first since 2018, as he undergoes a minor surgery. On Saturday, the 16x Grammy winner had to cancel his June 28 and 29 shows scheduled for Philadelphia’s Academy of Music following “chronic and intense back pain.” “Today it became unmanageable and demands immediate attention,” reads a statement on Simon’s Instagram. “Unfortunately we have to cancel these shows at this time, as we don’t have the ability to reschedule them.” The post continued, “However, we are hopeful after this minor surgical procedure which has been scheduled in the next few days, Paul will be able to complete the tour as well as look into returning to make up these dates.” Watch on Deadline After retiring from touring in 2018 due to hearing loss, Simon announced his 20-city tour in February, kicking off in New Orleans back in April. A Quiet Celebration features music from his 2023 album Seven Psalms, as well as notable hits from his solo career and Simon \u0026 Garfunkel. Simon’s next stop is scheduled for the Terrace Theater in Long Beach, California on July 7, followed by a five-night run at Disney Hall in Los Angeles, starting July 9.",
