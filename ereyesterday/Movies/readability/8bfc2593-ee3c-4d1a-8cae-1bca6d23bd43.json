  "text": "Sydney Sweeney is in final talks to star in Legendary’s “Gundam” movie. “Sweet Tooth” showrunner Jim Mickle is set to write and direct the live-action film, which is co-developed between Legendary and Bandai Namco Filmworks. Mickle also serves as a producer on the project with Linda Moran through their company Nightshade. The Japanese military science fiction media franchise “Gundam” first launched in 1979 as a TV series from Yoshiyuki Tomino, “Mobile Suit Gundam.” It grew in popularity through the 1980s due to a wide array of adaptations across animated feature films, novels, manga, toys, models and video games. The original series is set in the distant future in what is known as the Universal Century, as human colonies in space fight for independence from Earth. The battles are fought largely through giant robots called Mobile Suits. Legendary first announced the “Gundam” film in 2021 with “Kong: Skull Island” filmmaker Jordan Vogt-Roberts as the project’s original director. Plot and character details are currently under wraps. Legendary declined to comment. Sweeney’s recent film work includes “Madame Web,” “Immaculate” and Ron Howard’s “Eden.” She’s next set to appear in the AppleTV+ film “Echo Valley” alongside Julianne Moore, the Freida McFadden adaptation “The Housemaid” with Amanda Seyfried and and untitled biopic in which she stars as boxer Christy Martin. The InSneider was first to report Sweeney’s “Gundam” involvement. More to come…",
