  "text": "Netflix has released the official Adolescence photos for its newest crime drama, starring Boardwalk Empire alum Stephen Graham. The four-part limited series is expected to make its debut sometime in 2025. “The series tells the story in real-time of how a family’s world is turned upside down when a 13-year-old boy is arrested and charged with the murder of a teenage girl,” reads the logline. Who is in the Adolescence photos? The photos provided viewers with a first look at the main cast, including Graham as Eddie Miller, Ashley Walters (Top Boy) as Bascombe, Erin Doherty (The Crown) as Briony Ariston, and newcomer Owen Cooper as Jamie Miller. Additional cast members include Faye Marsay as Misha Frank, Christine Tremarco as Manda Miller, Amelie Pease as Lisa Miller, Jo Hartley as Mrs. Fenumore, Mark Stanley as Paul Barlow, and Claudius Peters as Frank. Adolescence is directed by Philip Barantini from a screenplay written by Graham and Jack Thorne. The upcoming miniseries is executive produced by Graham, Barantini, Thorne, Dede Gardner, Brad Pitt, Carina Sposato, Nina Wolarsky, Emily Feller, Mark Herbert, Jeremy Kleiner, and Hannah Walters, with Jo Johnson set as a producer. This marks the filmmaker’s latest project with Graham after previously working together on the kitchen drama film Boiling Point, which earned him two British Independent Film Award nominations, including Best Director and Best British Independent Film. Barantini also recently signed on to helm Netflix’s Enola Holmes 3, with Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown expected to reprise the titular detective.",
