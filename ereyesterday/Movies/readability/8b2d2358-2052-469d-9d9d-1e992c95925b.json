Here's the official trailer (+ two posters) for Jed Hart's indie thriller Restless, direct from YouTube: How far would you go to maintain a peaceful home? This is the quandary that Nicky, a mild-mannered woman \u0026 caregiver, faces after a group of young men move into the adjoining house. Nicky hopes their first eardrum-bursting party is an anomaly, but what begins as her polite request to keep the music down quickly escalates into an angry series of confrontations that edge toward violence. Pushed to full insanity after weeks of no sleep, she begins to contemplate increasingly severe means to find solitude. Restless is written and directed by British indie filmmaker Jed Hart, making his feature directorial debut after a few short films \u0026 music videos previously. Produced by Sophie Ede, Harri Kamalanathan, Jens Nielsen, Iain Simpson, Benedict Turnbull. This initially premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival last year. Quiver will release Jed Hart's Restless film direct-to-VOD in the US starting May 23rd, 2025 coming soon. Too loud? Find more posts in: Indies, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
