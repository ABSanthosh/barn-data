  "text": "Blessed be the Emmys rulebook, but it needs some serious updating. With “The Handmaid’s Tale” having taken its final bow, Hulu has confirmed its official Emmy submissions for the critically acclaimed drama, with one entry in particular already causing waves. Variety has learned exclusively that the streamer has submitted Alexis Bledel in the guest drama actress category for her appearance in the series finale (“610 – The Handmaid’s Tale”), despite a newly enforced Emmy rule disqualifying actors who have been previously nominated in a lead or supporting category for the same show. Bledel won the Emmy for guest in 2017, and garnered two additional noms in the same category in 2020 and 2021. However, in 2018, after appearing in seven of the 13 episodes for a season, she was ineligible to compete as a guest; she was submitted and eventually nominated for supporting drama actress. The one-year recognition for her character, Ofglen, appears to fall outside the bounds of eligibility, but the streamer is hopeful the TV Academy will consider her circumstances. Insiders say Hulu expects the TV Academy to reclassify Bledel’s submission to supporting drama actress before ballots are opened on June 12. But as of now, no decision has been issued. The rule aims to clarify what defines a “guest” star. According to the new guidelines, any actor previously nominated in a lead or supporting role for a series can no longer be considered a guest, regardless of how briefly they appear in the series’ new season. The policy has already drawn industry-wide criticism and confusion. Meryl Streep, for instance, was ruled ineligible for guest consideration for her turn in Hulu’s “Only Murders in the Building” — despite appearing in just four episodes — and will instead compete in the supporting comedy actress category due to her previous nom. Meanwhile, Paul Rudd, playing a new character in the same series, was nearly eligible as a guest but was in one episode too many, exposing inconsistencies with the changes. The guidelines have created more ambiguity than clarity. There should be a fundamental difference between a major series lead attempting to go guest and a long-time supporting player who has only occasionally appeared in a new season. Industry voices argue that the change unfairly penalizes performers with limited screen time who have previously been recognized — especially when those appearances are few and far between. Some believe this growing backlash will prompt the Emmys to consider revisions ahead of future cycles. Despite the rule conflict, “The Handmaid’s Tale” still remains a formidable force in this year’s Emmy race. The drama, which concluded its six-season run on Monday, has garnered 76 nominations and 15 wins over its lifetime — including a historic outstanding drama series win in its first season, the first ever for a streaming platform. This year, Hulu submitted 36 entries for the show across both Primetime and Creative Arts categories. Notable acting entries include Elisabeth Moss for lead actress and for helming the penultimate episode, “Execution,” which is somewhat surprising considering long-running shows often reserve their final episodes for consideration. However, the episode that sees many favorite characters’ shocking deaths is more visually striking, partnered with June screaming, “Don’t let the bastards grind you down” as she’s being hanged. In addition, Bradley Whitford, Max Minghella, and O-T Fagbenle will vie in the supporting actor race, while Yvonne Strahovski, Samira Wiley, and Ann Dowd will seek love in supporting actress. Guest actress submissions beyond Bledel include Emmy winners Cherry Jones (episode 602) and D’Arcy Carden (episode 608). Hulu’s complete 2025 Emmy submission list for “The Handmaid’s Tale” includes: Variety Awards Circuit: Outstanding Drama Series: Bruce Miller, Eric Tuchman, Yahlin Chang, Warren Littlefield, Elisabeth Moss, and others.
