  "text": "Defamed actor Kevin Spacey reprised his long-retired “House of Cards” character, Frank Underwood, in a promo video for Tim Dillon‘s new Netflix comedy special “I’m Your Mother.” Netflix declined Variety‘s request for comment. “You podcasters think you’ve inherited the kingdom,” Spacey, in character as Underwood, tells Dillon in the video released Tuesday. “Whispering in ears, swaying elections, spinning the truth like it was cotton candy, when in fact, you’re nothing but a bunch of clowns juggling boner pills and hair tonic.” “Frank Underwood? I thought you were dead,” Dillon replies. Popular on Variety “I’m as dead as John McCain,” Spacey quips back. Spacey’s Underwood then tries to blackmail Dillon, using his DoorDash receipts and compromising photographs as leverage. However, his plans are quickly foiled as Dillon tells him, “These photos you gave me, I’ve posted them all. I’m on the internet. We don’t have blackmail. We have content.” “There is no limit to your duplicity, to your pandering, to your shameless and desperate desire to cling to relevance,” Spacey retorts. “You’re my kind of bastard.” Dillon then informs Spacey of his Netflix special. When Spacey learns which streaming service “I’m Your Mother” is on, he calls Dillon “a foul, lonesome, evil little cockroach.” In 2022, five years after Spacey was kicked off Netflix’s “House of Cards” for allegations of sexual assault against young men, a judge ordered the “American Beauty” star to pay production company MRC roughly $31 million in damages for sexual misconduct on the set of the White House drama. In 2024, that figure was reduced to $1 million.",
