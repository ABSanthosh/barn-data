  "text": "Wondering why Days of Our Lives fans are suddenly talking about Jeremy Horton returning? The once-troubled Horton disappeared from Salem years ago, but his past remains one of the show’s most dramatic arcs. With his history of crime, betrayal, and a volatile romance with Stephanie Johnson, his story always left room for unfinished business. Let’s take a closer look at Jeremy Horton’s history, where he left off, and whether DOOL could be setting the stage for a shocking return. What happened to Jeremy Horton in Days of Our Lives? Jeremy Horton, the son of Mike Horton and Robin Jacobs, had a tumultuous journey in Days of Our Lives. Jeremy was born offscreen in 1987 and raised away from Salem. He briefly returned in 2007, with Trevor Donovan playing the role. By then, he was already dating Stephanie Johnson, whom he met while she pursued a racing career in Daytona. His storyline quickly took a dark turn as he launched Touch the Sky Airlines, a front for a DiMera smuggling operation. Alongside his shady business dealings, Jeremy exhibited abusive tendencies, particularly towards Stephanie. His violent streak became evident when he nearly drowned her in a hot tub during a fit of rage. His criminal record also included fraud and shoplifting. Eventually, when his illegal dealings were exposed, he fled Salem to evade legal repercussions and was never seen again. Is Jeremy Horton returning to Days of Our Lives? With his name recently mentioned in Days of Our Lives, speculation about Jeremy’s return is growing. The show has been reviving several Horton family members, especially in the wake of Doug Williams’ death and the upcoming 60th-anniversary celebrations. Given Salem’s long history of redemption arcs, it wouldn’t be surprising if Jeremy reemerged, seeking a second chance. If he does return, it could be as a reformed man attempting to make amends for his past mistakes. However, considering Stephanie’s lingering trauma from their abusive relationship, a romantic reunion seems highly unlikely. Instead, his return could serve as a fresh start or a new source of drama, particularly if he still has unfinished business with his former allies—or enemies. Viewers eagerly await confirmation on whether Days of Our Lives will recast Jeremy Horton or bring back Trevor Donovan, but in Salem, anything can happen.",
