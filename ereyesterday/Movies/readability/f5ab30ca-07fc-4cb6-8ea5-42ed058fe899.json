  "text": "The 15th Beijing International Film Festival kicked off with glamor and historical significance despite rain-soaked conditions, as international and Chinese film luminaries gathered to celebrate a remarkable triple anniversary in cinema history. This year’s festival commemorates 130 years since the Lumière brothers pioneered the first public film screening in Paris, 120 years since China’s inaugural film “The Battle of Dingjunshan,” and the festival’s own 15th anniversary. Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president Janet Yang delivered a bilingual keynote speech that underscored film’s power as a universal language. “Film is the most universal language to connect the world,” Yang stated in Mandarin before switching to English. Yang, a Chinese American producer, reflected on her introduction to Chinese cinema: “I first fell in love with Chinese cinema through the works of the ‘Fifth Generation’ filmmakers. Their films felt like poetry, quiet and reflective.” She underlined the importance of authentic storytelling in an era of rapid technological advancement. Popular on Variety “Technology can assist us, but what truly moves people are the stories that emanate from human empathy,” Yang said. “In recent years, what gives me great hope is seeing more and more Asian and Asian diaspora storytellers step onto the global stage. They’re telling stories about what it’s like to live between cultures, in their own unique voices,” Yang added. “As a Chinese American producer, I know how challenging this path can be – but that’s exactly why it matters. As we’re seeing more Chinese films reach audiences around the world, playing a bigger role in global cinema, it’s clear that film is bringing China and the rest of the world closer together.” The producer concluded by invoking the Chinese philosophical concept of “Harmony in Diversity,” expressing hope for increased collaboration between Chinese and international filmmakers. Speaking on the red carpet, British director David Yates, known for helming several “Harry Potter” films, showed good humor about the inclement weather, quipping, “Thank you for the rain, it’s lovely.” On a more serious note, Yates, who is serving on the jury of the festival’s flagship Tiantan Awards, said, “I’ve been struck by the spectacle and the scale and the splendor of everything here. It’s truly magnificent and wonderful to experience, and most of all, the courtesy and the kindness of lots of people. It’s a very, very warm welcome for people from outside of the country, and we’re thankful for that. We feel very welcome to this amazing festival.” The jury is led by Chinese actor-director Jiang Wen, and includes Chinese American actor Joan Chen, Chinese actor Ni Ni, Finnish filmmaker Teemu Nikki, and Swiss actor-director Vincent Perez. The red carpet was a dazzling showcase of Chinese cinematic talent, with a lineup of actors including Zhang Yuqi, Tan Zhuo, Wang Yang, Song Shuting, Liu Jiayuan, Zhang Dage, Yang Huiqing, Fu Jing, Zhao Shuzhen, Liu Yichun, and Liu Meihan. Male stars were equally well-represented with Xu Weizhou, Wang Dongcheng, Liu Guanyou, Pan Binlong, Qiao Shan, Wang Yanhui, Wang Duofei, Zhou You, and Zhou Yiran making appearances. The directorial contingent was led by acclaimed filmmaker Guan Hu, known for “Black Dog,” alongside Li Yongyi, Shen Tao, Yi Xiaoxing, A Nian, Gao Qunshu, Tong Jiage, Chen Xiaoliang, Wang Mu, Cui Rui, Hai Ming, Li Pieran, Li Muzi, Huang Xiang, and Zhang Chi. Chen Jianbin, Jiang Qinqin, Zhang Jingyi, Bai Ke, Xin Baiqing, and Geng Le added star power to the proceedings, while talents like Zhang Zifeng, Ouyang Nana, Tan Jianci, Ou Hao, Huang Yi, Jiang Mengjie, Lang Yueting, and Zhong Xintong represented the next generation of Chinese cinema. Behind-the-scenes talent was also celebrated, with producers Wen Bo, Kong Jialin, Chen Jie, Zhang Qun, Sun Rong, Ma Zhe, Ying Luojia, Hu Qingcheng, Guo Dongnan, Zhao Yongqiang, Lin Xiaoqiang, and Jiang Zhiqiang in attendance, along with scriptwriter Qin Junfang and art director Mu Jing. The international presence included directors Bela Tarr, Noelle Bastin, Baptiste Bogaert, and Tobias Schmitzler, alongside a Swiss delegation and representatives of several major film festivals. The opening ceremony featured dance and musical performances, including commemorations of 130 years of cinema, 120 years of Chinese cinema and a focus on the history of Chinese animation, including a display featuring characters from blockbuster animated franchise “Ne Zha.” The festival continues through April 26.",
