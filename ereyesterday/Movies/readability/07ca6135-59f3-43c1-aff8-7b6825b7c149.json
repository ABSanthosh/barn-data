This \"crypto heist movie\" premiered at last year's SXSW Film Festival and is being present by Steven Soderbergh. After losing everything in a cryptocurrency scam, a ragtag team of vigilante Redditors attempt to kidnap the kingpin who screwed them over. But when the home invasion takes a turn for the worst, they become victims in a sadistic game. The film stars Raul Castillo, Melonie Diaz, Tony Cavalero, Josh Brener, and Zoe Winters.
