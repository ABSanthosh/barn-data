After the actor’s casting in Scream 7 was announced in February, he recalled auditioning for the original 1996 Wes Craven-helmed teen slasher film that launched the popular horror franchise. “The one thing that I can tell about Scream 7 was that it was absolutely incredible to be invited,” he told Bloody Disgusting. “That is a lovely community of people, from the very beginning to what it is now. And I’ve been wanting to be a part of that franchise since the very beginning.” Watch on Deadline Embry added, “I remember auditioning for Scream 1. I can’t remember if it was for [Jamie Kennedy’s Randy] or [Matthew Lillard’s Stu]. It was one of those. But I remember not getting good feedback from Mr. Craven.” While plot and character details remain under wraps, Embry joins returning franchise stars Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Scott Foley, Matthew Lillard, Mason Gooding and Jasmin Savoy Brown, as well as newcomers Isabel May, Celeste O’Connor, Asa Germann, Mckenna Grace, Sam Rechner, Michelle Randolph, Jimmy Tatro, Anna Camp, Joel McHale and Mark Consuelos. ‘Scream VI’ Paramount Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection After Melissa Barrera was dropped from Scream 7 over her stance on the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, and Jenna Ortega’s exit from the film shortly after, Campbell said the next movie will once again “follow Sydney” after she originated the final-girl character in the 1996 movie.",
