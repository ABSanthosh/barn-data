The 52-year-old actor shared his diagnosis with People, while stating that his health has not impacted his plans to return for “Euphoria” Season 3. He will be on the HBO series’ set in the coming days. “I have been diagnosed with ALS. I am grateful to have my loving family by my side as we navigate this next chapter,” Dane said. “I feel fortunate that I am able to continue working and am looking forward to returning to set of ‘Euphoria’ next week. I kindly ask that you give my family and I privacy during this time.” ALS is a fatal, progressive degenerative disease that breaks down the nerves in the body, weakening muscles and causing eventual paralysis, impacting patients’ ability to breathe, speak and move. There is no known cure. Popular on Variety On “Euphoria,” Dane plays Cal Jacobs, the strict father to Jacob Elordi’s character Nate Jacobs. Per People, Dane will begin shooting his role for the long-developing third season on April 14. Production on new episodes began in January, with Elordi, Zendaya and Sydney Sweeney among the other cast members confirmed to return. “There’s gonna be redemption [for Cal],” Dane told Variety after Season 2 aired, teasing the trajectory of his character in future episodes. “I can’t judge the character. That’s a dead end street for any actor. So I didn’t pass any judgments on Cal. But I did know that eventually there was going to be a moment of truth and some sort of redemption for him.” Along with “Euphoria,” Dane is also beloved for his multi-season turn as Dr. Mark Sloan on “Grey’s Anatomy” and for leading TNT’s naval series “The Last Ship,” as well as more villainous performances in “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” and “Burlesque.”",
