  "description": "\"Remembering you're dreaming...\" Vertical has revealed the official trailer for Eye for an Eye, a horror thriller set in Florida marking the feature directorial debut of acclaimed music video director Colin Tilley. Not to be confused with any other film also titled Eye for an Eye, such as the 1996 thriller movie with Kiefer Sutherland \u0026 Sally Field. This is the story of Anna who grieves the death of her parents as she moves from New York to Florida to stay with her grandmother. She falls in with some other teens, but when she sees a grisly act of violence, she ends up even more traumatized. She finds herself ensnared by Mr. Sandman – the twisted soul of a tormented child who haunts bullies' dreams before feasting on their eyeballs. Uhhh whoa, WTF. Staring Whitney Peak, S. Epatha Merkerson, Golda Rosheuvel, and Finn Bennett. This looks like it has tons of creepy imagery, but the story looks quite generic. Doesn't seem like it'll amount to much.

Isolated and in unfamiliar surroundings, she falls in with a couple of local teens (Finn Bennett and Laken Giles), but when she becomes a bystander to an unforgivable act of violence, she finds herself ensnared by Mr. Sandman – the twisted soul of a tormented child who haunts bullies' dreams before feasting on their eyeballs when they finally wake. Eye for an Eye is directed by American music video creator / filmmaker Colin Tilley, making his first feature film after many music videos and shorts. The screenplay is written by Elisa Victoria and Michael Tully. Produced by Tim Headington, Theresa Steele Page, Rachael Fung, and Nate Kamiya.
