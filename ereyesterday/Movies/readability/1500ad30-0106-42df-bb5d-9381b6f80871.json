Monáe called out the St. Louis rapper at a Grammys afterparty (via TMZ) while performing a cover of his hit song “Hot In Herre.” “Fuck you Nelly. I used to like Nelly, but then he went to perform for Donald Trump,” Monáe rapped. “I care about women, I care about Hispanics. … You sold out. I used to think you were cool. But now you look like a motherfucking fool.” According to TMZ, Monáe’s rap was part of an impromptu performance with Anderson .Paak, the co-owner of the bar at which the party was hosted. Popular on Variety Nelly faced heavy backlash after it was announced that he would perform at Trump’s Liberty Inaugural Ball. He went on to defend the decision in an interview with Houston rapper and former Geto Boys member Willie D Live. “I thought you was riding with me because I put on for my city and I try to bring my city up every step of the way,” Nelly said. “I did not know you was riding with me because you thought I would ride with who you voted for. I didn’t know that. I didn’t know I had to agree with your political choices, and I thought it was the things that you do not the things that you say should be done. If you follow what I do, this shouldn’t even be an argument. He’s the president. He won. This isn’t a campaign, this isn’t an RNC. I’m not out on a political campaign.”",
