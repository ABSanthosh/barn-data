  "text": "We will update this article throughout the season, along with all our predictions, so make sure to keep checking IndieWire for the latest news from the 2025 Emmys race. The nomination round of voting takes place from June 12 to June 23, with the official Emmy nominations announced Tuesday, July 15. Afterwards, final voting commences on August 18 and ends the night of August 27. The 77th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards are set to take place on Sunday, September 14, and air live on CBS at 8:00 p.m. ET/ 5:00 p.m. PT. The State of the Race Prior to the most recent Emmys, where Lamorne Morris earned both a surprise nomination and win for his turn in the fifth season of “Fargo,” the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or a Movie race usually saw one contender breeze their way toward a victory with little competition. For instance, “Black Bird” star Paul Walter Hauser and “The White Lotus” star Murray Bartlett had their shows premiere a full year before final voting started, and therefore collected multiple trophies well before winning their Emmy.  This year, the narrative is slightly closer to that. The Netflix hit “Adolescence” just premiered in March, but within a week there were people already calling that breakout star Owen Cooper will win the Emmy. Prior to that, the only other names that have been in the mix based on winter TV awards have been Javier Bardem for “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story” and Diego Luna for “La Máquina.” One could argue Liev Schreiber from “The Perfect Couple” as well, since he won the Critics Choice Award, but that group does not have as much overlap or influence on the Television Academy as the SAG Awards or Golden Globes. Even Jesse Plemons for “Zero Day” seems like a greater priority for Netflix, since that show seems to have a chance at breaking into more Emmys categories than Schreiber’s. Some of the earlier premieres that received awards wins and nominations but did not have their supporting actors recognized are series like HBO’s “The Penguin,” which features actors like Rhenzy Feliz and Clancy Brown; “Presumed Innocent” with Peter Sarsgaard and Bill Camp; and fellow Apple TV+ series “Disclaimer,” which had significant roles for Oscar nominees Sacha Baron Cohen and Kodi Smit-McPhee. Only “Adolescence” and “The Penguin” have been true blue hits in the limited series space this season, so they may take up all the nomination slots. However, Emmys voters have proven to seek out FX and Hulu for their limited series, so “Good American Family” stars Mark Duplass and Dule Hill, or even “Dying for Sex” star Rob Delaney, all have a shot based on the ideas that voters seem more inclined to give their shows a try. Though we have a sense of the leads, sight unseen, Netflix’s “Sirens” and Amazon Prime Video’s “The Better Sister” are two more series that could provide some contenders. There is also a big question as to whether the stars of any Outstanding TV Movie contenders, like Don Johnson in “Rebel Ridge,” or the men of “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy” make it in, but those projects are all still building an audience. Current Contenders (In Alphabetical Order):Javier Bardem, “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story” (Netflix)Sacha Baron Cohen, “Disclaimer” (Apple TV+)Clancy Brown, “The Penguin” (HBO)Owen Cooper, “Adolescence” (Netflix)Rob Delaney, “Dying for Sex” (FX)Mark Duplass, “Good American Family” (Hulu)Rhenzy Feliz, “The Penguin” (HBO)Dule Hill, “Good American Family” (Hulu)Samuel L.

Even Jesse Plemons for “Zero Day” seems like a greater priority for Netflix, since that show seems to have a chance at breaking into more Emmys categories than Schreiber’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the earlier premieres that received awards wins and nominations but did not have their supporting actors recognized are series like HBO’s “The Penguin,” which features actors like Rhenzy Feliz and Clancy Brown; “Presumed Innocent” with Peter Sarsgaard and Bill Camp; and fellow Apple TV+ series “Disclaimer,” which had significant roles for Oscar nominees Sacha Baron Cohen and Kodi Smit-McPhee.\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnly “Adolescence” and “The Penguin” have been true blue hits in the limited series space this season, so they may take up all the nomination slots. However, Emmys voters have proven to seek out FX and Hulu for their limited series, so “Good American Family” stars Mark Duplass and Dule Hill, or even “Dying for Sex” star Rob Delaney, all have a shot based on the ideas that voters seem more inclined to give their shows a try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThough we have a sense of the leads, sight unseen, Netflix’s “Sirens” and Amazon Prime Video’s “The Better Sister” are two more series that could provide some contenders. There is also a big question as to whether the stars of any Outstanding TV Movie contenders, like Don Johnson in “Rebel Ridge,” or the men of “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy” make it in, but those projects are all still building an audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Contenders (In Alphabetical Order):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJavier Bardem, “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story” (Netflix)\u003cbr/\u003eSacha Baron Cohen, “Disclaimer” (Apple TV+)\u003cbr/\u003eClancy Brown, “The Penguin” (HBO)\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOwen Cooper, “Adolescence” (Netflix)\u003cbr/\u003eRob Delaney, “Dying for Sex” (FX)\u003cbr/\u003eMark Duplass, “Good American Family” (Hulu)\u003cbr/\u003eRhenzy Feliz, “The Penguin” (HBO)\u003cbr/\u003eDule Hill, “Good American Family” (Hulu)\u003cbr/\u003eSamuel L.
