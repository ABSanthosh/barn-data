  "text": "Apple TV+ has announced a multi-year, first-look feature film deal with North Road Company‘s Chernin Entertainment, the company behind “Ford v Ferrari,” “Planet of the Apes,” “Hidden Figures,” and “The Greatest Showman.” Chernin is also producing the Jason Momoa epic miniseries “Chief of War,” set for release on August 1. “We’ve had a great experience working with Apple on the series side, where they’ve been smart, daring, and always supportive — we’re excited to build on that success by making movies together,” North Road Company Chairman Peter Chernin said in a statement. Apple TV+ has an impressive slate of upcoming feature films, including “F1 The Movie” with Brad Pitt, which is set to hit theaters on June 27. Apple was the first streaming service to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, as well, with 2021’s “CODA.” Chernin Entertainment was founded in 2009, while North Road Company was established three years ago and produces a variety of content across film, television, and streaming platforms. Other North Road labels include North Road Television, Kinetic Content, and Words + Pictures. This year, Chernin released “Back in Action” with Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz on Netflix, as well as “Fear Street: Prom Queen.” Upcoming film releases include “Apex” with Charlize Theron, “Altar” with Kyle MacLachlan, and the found-footage horror flick “The Backrooms.” Additionally, the series “Age of Innocence,” “Man on Fire,” and “The Body” are all in production under North Road’s television banner. Kinetic Content, meanwhile, is responsible for the massive Netflix unscripted hit “Love is Blind.” Words + Pictures has released major documentaries such as last year’s acclaimed “Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story.” Chernin has also entered the realm of AI last year with his investment in Promise, which boasts top Generative AI and storytelling talent. “There is something undeniably exciting about Generative AI, and we are bullish on George and Promise’s ability to empower storytellers,” Chernin said in November 2024 statement. “This team understands that prioritizing artists and creatives is the only approach as we begin to apply Generative AI into the creative process, and Promise has the most inventive and user-friendly model we have seen.”",
