Netflix has unveiled an official trailer for a new comedy series called No Good Deed, made by TV creator Liz Feldman, also creator of the other series \"One Big Happy\" and \"Dead to Me\". It tells the story of three very different families vying to buy the very same 1920s Spanish style villa that they think will solve all their problems. Sounds like a very personal story turned into a comedy series. Netflix's No Good Deed is a series about the highs and lows of searching for a safe, happy home and just how far we're willing to go to protect ourselves and our loved ones in the process. Featuring Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano as a couple who list their \"gorgeous 1920s Spanish-style villa\" located in one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Los Angeles - and the real estate frenzy begins. Also stars Linda Cardellini, O-T Fagbenle, Abbi Jacobson, Denis Leary, Poppy Liu, Teyonah Parris, and Luke Wilson. Executive produced by Will Ferrell's Gloria Sanchez Productions. This looks like it gets extra wild \u0026 crazy, reminding me of that other series \"Beef\" about all the sneaky/petty [â€¦]",

This looks like it gets extra wild \u0026 crazy, reminding me of that other series \"Beef\" about all the sneaky/petty grudges people have. Here's the first official trailer (+ poster) for Liz Feldman's series No Good Deed, from Netflix's YouTube: When Lydia (Lisa Kudrow) \u0026 Paul (Ray Romano) decide to move on from their empty nest to forge a new life, they list their gorgeous 1920s Spanish-style villa located in one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Los Angeles - and the real estate frenzy begins. Multiple families all race to buy what they believe to be their dream house, convinced it will fix all of their very different problems. But as Lydia and Paul know all too well, sometimes the home of your dreams can be a true nightmare. As they struggle to hide the dark and dangerous secrets that linger inside their longtime home, Paul and Lydia begin to realize that the only way they'll escape the past is to finally face it. No Good Deed is a comedy series created and showrun by TV writer Liz Feldman, formerly of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", creator of the series \"One Big Happy\" and \"Dead to Me\" previously. It's also written by Liz Feldman. And episodes are directed by and it's executive produced by Silver Tree (\"Shameless\", \"You\", \"The Flight Attendant\", \"Dead to Me\", \"Fatal Attraction\").
