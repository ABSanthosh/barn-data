  "text": "Cap is back… again! Marvel unveiled the latest trailer for “Captain America: Brave New World” at the first-ever D23 Brazil fan event on Saturday. Anthony Mackie, who plays Sam Wilson/Captain America, and Danny Ramirez, who portrays Joaquin Torres/Falcon, were there to greet fans before the new trailer was shown. The film includes Mackie as Sam Wilson, Harrison Ford’s U.S. President Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, Ramirez as the new Falcon, Carl Lumbly as Isaiah Bradley, Shira Haas as the Israeli superhero Sabra, Giancarlo Esposito as Sidewinder, Liv Tyler as Betty Ross and Tim Blake Nelson as the Leader. Mackie took over the Cap mantle from Chris Evans’ Steve Rogers, who famously starred in the previous three Captain America movies and the four Avengers films. At the end of 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame,” Steve bids farewell to his fellow superheroes and goes back in time to spend a new life with his beloved Peggy Carter. He gives his iconic vibranium shield to Sam, who vows to do right by the world-famous hero. Popular on Variety The first time Marvel fans saw Sam suit up as Cap was in the Disney+ TV series “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.” There, Sam teamed up with Sebastian Stan’s antihero Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier, to take down a group of terrorists. The show received praise from fans and critics alike, in addition to five Emmy nominations. “Captain America: Brave New World” follows Sam as Ross approaches him with a compelling offer. Ross wants to make Captain America a U.S. agent. Sam is skeptical, but before he can make his decision, the hero must stop a would-be assassin at the White House. Ford’s Ross will also transform into the Red Hulk, another gamma-irradiated monster who is Ross’ alter-ego in the Marvel comics. Julius Onah directs “Captain America: Brave New World,” written by Malcolm Spellman, Dalan Musson and Matthew Orton. The film hits theaters on Feb. 14, 2025. Watch the trailer below.",
