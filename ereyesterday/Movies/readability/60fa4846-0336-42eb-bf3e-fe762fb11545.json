  "description": "\"We're gonna be okay, right?\" \"I hope so... it would suck if we werent.\" Quiver Distribution has unveiled an official trailer for an absurd new comedy called Nuked, about a group of friends who get super stoned. The title isn't really a pun on being high, it's actually related to the story and what happens while they're high. This premiered at last year's Tribeca Film Festival and will be released this summer on VOD for everyone to also get stoned and watch. A group of friends gets together for a cannabis-infused, technology free, dinner party only to learn a bomb is headed right for them. This seems to be a riff on that Hawaii nuclear missile freak out from 2018, where they accidentally announced that a missile was on the way for 30 minutes before it was called off as a mistake. The pot kicks in right as they realize that they may only have 30 minutes to live... What will they do? The cast features Anna Camp, Justin Bartha, Lucy Punch, George Young, Tawny Newsome, Ignacio Serrichio, Maulik Pancholy, Stephen Guarino, Natasha Leggero, and Cole Stockel. This definitely looks like a fun pizza and beer movie night movie but [â€¦]",

This definitely looks like a fun pizza and beer movie night movie but nothing more than that. Here's the full official trailer (+ poster) for Deena Kashper's comedy Nuked, direct from YouTube: It's Jack \u0026 Gill's 40th birthdays, so the long-time sweethearts invite their college friends for a night away to celebrate. When couples arrive at the rented mansion, Jack and Gill surprise them with an unplugged party, confiscating their phones for the evening. To appease their friends' unease, Jack and Gill also announce their five-course meal will be a cannabis-infused journey. Lots and lots of cannabis. That did the trick. The dinner's in full swing, until someone sneaks a peek at their phone and discovers a nuclear bomb is headed right for Los Angeles. Holy f#$k. The pot kicks in right as they realize they may only have 30 minutes to live. Will they survive in the makeshift basement bomb shelter, or will they get nuked? Nuked is written and directed by the American indie filmmaker Deena Kashper (formerly Deena Adar), making her first feature film after directing the TV movie Thirtyish previously, plus shorts and a few TV series. Based on a story by Deena Kashper \u0026 Danny Kashper. Produced by Julie Christeas, Daryl Freimark, \u0026 Deena Kashper. This originally premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival last year. Quiver Distr. will release the comedy Nuked in select US theaters + on VOD starting July 11th, 2025 this summer. Anyone want to catch this? Find more posts in: To Watch, Trailer prev next",
