  "text": "“The Old Man” has been canceled after two seasons on FX. The series, based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Perry, starred Jeff Bridges as veteran and former CIA operative Dan Chase. Season 1 followed Chase after he killed a home intruder and went into hiding. In Season 2, he and former FBI assistant director Harold Harper (John Lithgow) — who in Season 1 intended to arrest him — work to recover Chase’s daughter, Emily (Alia Shawkat), after she is kidnapped by powerful Afghan tribal leader Faraz Hamzad (Navid Negahban), though Harper and Hamzad also claim her as their own. “The Old Man” premiered in June of 2022 and was a success among critics while achieving strong viewership. Season 2 wrapped its run in October of this year and maintained the positive reception of the first installation though the series’ two years off the air brought down the size of its audience. Jonathan E. Steinberg and Robert Levine developed “The Old Man” for television and served as executive producers alongside Dan Shotz, Warren Littlefield, Bridges, David Schiff, Craig Silverstein and Jon Watts. 20th Television produced the series in association with the Littlefield Company. Popular on Variety Deadline was first to report new of the series’ cancellation.",
