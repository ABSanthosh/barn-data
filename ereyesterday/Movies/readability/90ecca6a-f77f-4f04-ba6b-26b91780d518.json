This the kind of marketing I dig! Anora just opened in US theaters last weekend and will be expanding to more cities soon - and some special locations will be showing it in 35mm.

Anora was also shot on 35mm using Arricam LT cameras, processed into a digital negative by Kodak Film Lab. It's nice to see them going back and letting it screen on film in at least a few theaters. Of course, Brady Corbet's The Brutalist will also be getting a full-on 35mm \u0026 70mm film release coming up in December this fall.

I also enjoy any videos about projectionists and the few projection rooms that still have real film projectors installed. Enjoy. You can rewatch the first US trailer for Sean Baker's Anora right here, plus the intl. trailer / US trailer #2. Ani (Mikey Madison) is a young Uzbek-American stripper from Brighton Beach, a Russophone enclave in New York City. As she is somewhat conversant in Russian, her boss at the strip club fixes her up with a Russian-speaking client. After meeting Vanya, the son of a Russian oligarch, a romance kindles that leads to their elopement while on a trip to Las Vegas. Their fairytale marriage is threatened when the man's parents travel to New York to force an annulment. Anora is written and directed by acclaimed American filmmaker Sean Baker, director of the films Four Letter Words, Take Out, Prince of Broadway, Starlet, Tangerine, The Florida Project, and Red Rocket previously. Produced by Alex Coco, Samantha Quan, and Sean Baker. This first premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival earlier this year (read our review). Neon debuts Baker's Anora in select US theaters starting October 18th, 2024. Check your local listings to see it. Find more posts: Horror, Indies, To Watch prev next",
