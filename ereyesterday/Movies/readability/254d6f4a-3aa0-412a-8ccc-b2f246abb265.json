  "text": "In a sea of science fiction series that take themselves far too seriously, “Star Trek Lower Decks” has been a sweet and funny balm, a loving parody of the iconic speculative fiction universe that celebrates and pisses on its history in equal measure. Like all good sitcoms, however, “Lower Decks” is coming to an end, and the finale promises to be…maybe, possibly, moderately serious? The animated series will premiere the finale to its fifth and final season Thursday, December 19, on Paramount+. The episode, titled “The New Next Generation” in reference to the beloved ’80s-’90s “Star Trek” series starring Patrick Stewart, will have an extended running time, and bring back a few characters from the show’s past. Among them are Klingon brothers, Malor (voiced by Sam Witwer) and Ma’ah (Jon Curry), first seen in a previous Season 5 episode. In an exclusive clip shared with IndieWire, the duo is given some spotlight in the finale, as they encounter a deadly threat from a fellow Klingon. The second animated “Star Trek” series, after the short-lived “Original Series” spinoff that aired from 1973 to 1974, “Star Trek: Lower Decks” is a comedic take on the sci-fi institution’s mythos, focusing on the least important ship in the United Federation of Planets’ Starfleet, the USS Cerritos. On the Cerritos, the show focuses not on the leaders of the crew, but on the low-ranking officers who are forced to do the dirty work. Seasons 4 and 5 saw the four main characters all get promoted to junior lieutenants, after slumming it as ensigns for the majority of the series. The animated series debuted in August 2020, to relatively positive reviews. In 2023, the series crossed over with live-action “Star Trek” series “Strange New Worlds,” in an episode that featured Newsome and Quaid portraying live-action versions of their characters. “Strange New Worlds” has been ordered for a third season, set to premiere in 2025, and has already been renewed for a fourth. Other upcoming “Star Trek” projects in the works include kids series “Starfleet Academy,” which will star Holly Hunter, as well as a feature film, “Section 31,” starring Michelle Yeoh and slated to release this January. “Lower Decks” was created by Mike McMahan, who is also known for co-creating Hulu series “Solar Opposites” and for his work on “Rick and Morty.” The series stars Tawny Newsome, Jack Quaid, Noël Wells, Eugene Cordero, Dawnn Lewis, Jerry O’Connell, Fred Tatasciore, and Gillian Vigman as the crew of the USS Cerritos. CBS’ Eye Animation Productions, Secret Hideout, and Roddenberry Entertainment. McMahan executive produces the show with Alex Kurtzman and Aaron Baiers of Secret Hideout, Rod Roddenberry and Trevor Roth of Roddenberry Entertainment, and Katie Krentz of 219 Productions. The series is animated by Titmouse, the independent animation studio that also produces “Big Mouth” for Netflix. The series finale of “Star Trek: Lower Decks” premieres December 19.
