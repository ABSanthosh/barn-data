An interesting question to ask before it has even debuted. Another series made for true crime fans. Main trailer (+ poster) for Netflix's doc series Cold Case: Who Killed JonBenét Ramsey, via YouTube: On December 26, 1996, John and Patsy Ramsey wake up the morning after a loving family Christmas to discover their youngest child, six-year-old JonBenét, is missing, a chilling ransom note left downstairs. Later that day, John Ramsey discovers his daughter's body in the basement, revealing the shocking truth that JonBenét had not been kidnapped, but was instead sexually assaulted and brutally murdered in their own home. The Boulder, Colorado police, who had little practical experience in homicide investigations, quickly cast suspicion on JonBenét's family as the most likely suspects, fanning flames of media scrutiny \u0026 largely one-sided reporting, turning the case into a national obsession. 28 years later, that obsession — and all the finger-pointing — hasn't gone away, and the murder of JonBenét Ramsey remains unsolved. Cold Case: Who Killed JonBenét Ramsey is a docu series directed by the acclaimed, Oscar-nominated doc producer/filmmaker Joe Berlinger, director of doc films Brother's Keeper, Paradise Lost, Paradise Lost 2: Revelations, Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, Crude, Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory, Under African Skies, Whitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger, Tony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru, Madoff: The Monster of Wall Street, and Intent to Destroy, plus the feature films Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil \u0026 Vile. A RadicalMedia Production in assocation with Third Eye Motion Picture Company. Executive produced by Joe Berlinger, Craig D’Entrone, Jon Kamen, Jen Isaacson. Netflix will release this Who Killed JonBenét Ramsey doc series streaming on Netflix on November 25th, 2024. Find more posts: Documentaries, Streaming, To Watch, Trailer",
