  "text": "Romantic comedy You, Always, starring Adrian Grenier and Jessica De Gouw, has wrapped production in Queensland, Australia. Principal photography for You, Always primarily took place on location in far-north Queensland, with some scenes shot at Screen Queensland Studios’ sound stage in Cairns. Grenier, who previously starred in Entourage and The Devil Wears Prada, plays the role of Ethan in You, Always. Ethan is a devoted best friend who soon realises he has long been in love with Dr Jen Bell (played by The Union star De Gouw). However, Jen’s world is turned upside down by the arrival of a charismatic author named Patrick (played by Desmond Chiam from Joy Ride and Mortal Kombat 2). Other cast members include comedian Yasmin Kassim (One Perfect Match), Spencer McLaren (The Secret Life of Us) and newcomer Adyn Kingi. Watch on Deadline Produced by Brisbane-based Jaggi Entertainment, You, Always is written by Ansley Gordon and directed by Christine Luby, with producers Steve Jaggi and Kylie Pascoe leading the project. “The natural beauty of Far North Queensland provides such a stunning backdrop for this story, and the warmth of the local community and the Jaggi Entertainment family has been incredible,” said Grenier. “It’s exciting to bring this project to life in such a special place, and I can’t wait for audiences to see it. Wrapping just before the holidays makes it feel even more magical — it’s the perfect way to end the year.” John-Paul Langbroek, Queensland’s Minister for the Arts, said: “You, Always is expected to generate approximately $3.5 million for the state economy and create 100 employment opportunities for cast and crew in Far North Queensland. “This is the sixth production that Jaggi Entertainment has brought to North Queensland, including Netflix smash Love is in the Air, which demonstrates the appetite Australian and international audiences have for seeing our northern tropics on screen and the opportunity that exists for the screen industry to continue to capitalise on this demand through increased local production.” Screen Queensland CEO Jacqui Feeney said the production of You, Always was made with the support of the Screen Finance Fund, Post, Digital and Visual Effects Incentive and marks the first project to receive funding from Screen Queensland’s new North Queensland Production Incentive. Feeney added: “The new incentive supports film and series production in the North Queensland region, securing employment and training opportunities for local screen practitioners while increasing regional economic expenditure and stimulating wider business and tourism benefits for regional communities.”",
