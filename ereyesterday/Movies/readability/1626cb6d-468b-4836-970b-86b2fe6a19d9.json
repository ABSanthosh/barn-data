  "text": "Amanda Seyfried is on board for any “Jennifer’s Body” sequel, which could come sooner than later. The actress, though not confirming the film, told Bloody Disgusting that a “Jennifer’s Body 2” could be in the works soon. “I think we’re making another one,” Seyfried said while on the red carpet for “Seven Veils.” “I didn’t confirm it! I said, ‘I think.'” IndieWire has reached out to representatives for Seyfried, screenwriter Diablo Cody, and director Karyn Kusama for further comment. “Jennifer’s Body” was released in 2009. While the feature barely broke even at the box office, the now-iconic film is considered to be a feminist horror classic. Seyfried stars as Needy, whose best friend Jennifer (Megan Fox) is the high school queen bee. However, after Jennifer is sacrificed by the lead singer (Adam Brody) of a band touring through town, she is left as a half-girl, half-demon who feasts on unsuspecting boys to survive. Academy Award-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody told Bloody Disgusting in 2024 that she is “not done” with the world of “Jennifer’s Body” during its 15-year anniversary. “I want to do a sequel. I am not done with ’Jennifer’s Body,’” Cody said. “I need to partner with people who believe it in [sic] as much as I do and that hasn’t really happened yet. I need someone to believe in it who has a billion dollars.” In 2024 while talking about her “Lisa Frankenstein” script, Cody told IndieWire about renewed interest in a potential “Jennifer Body’s” sequel. “I had no idea people would get so excited about that,” Cody said. “I was delighted to see the response, I’m going to clip those articles and show them to all the people who are like, ‘We don’t think this is such a good idea.’ Bring it into the people that I need to green light it.” She told IndieWire that the renewed chatter around a potential sequel really excited her. “It’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me in my career, it’s like total validation,” she said of the continued fandom around the film. “It came late, I’m OK with that, I’ve made my peace with that. I went through a lot when that movie came out, just personal attacks. It was about more than just the movie. … I always believed in it, but I did lose my confidence. If people hadn’t rediscovered ‘Jennifer’s Body,’ I would not have written ‘Lisa Frankenstein.’ With that whole area, that genre, I kind of felt unwelcome in it, because I had flopped so hard on my last attempt.” Meanwhile, Seyfried next stars in Mona Fastvold‘s upcoming “Ann Lee” musical, which centers on the founder of the Shaker Movement in the late 1770s. The musical biopic is co-written by Fastvold and her “The Brutalist” collaborator and real-life partner Brady Corbet. Seyfried told Vanity Fair that shooting Fastvold and Corbet’s secret indie film after wrapping the upcoming Peacock limited series “Long Bright River,” was tough. “I went to hell and back,” Seyfried said of the demanding back-to-back projects. “Oh, my God. What the fuck? Even my assistant’s like, ‘You need to take a break,’” Seyfried said. “We could only do [‘Ann Lee’] in the summer. … We moved everybody to Budapest, including my dog. Then we did a crazy thing. We did a crazy thing.” She added of the musical, “I don’t know how it’s going to turn out.”",
