A standalone sequel to Jurassic World Dominion (2022) with its own mission, it is the 4th installment in the current Jurassic World series and the 7th film overall in this dinosaurs series.

But this place is even more dangerous than anyone of them expected. They're stuck on this island now â€“ will they survive? Jurassic World: Rebirth stars Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali, Jonathan Bailey, with Rupert Friend, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Luna Blaise, David Iacono, and Ed Skrein. I'm glad they've released so many behind-the-scenes featurettes for this movie, I just hope it means the movie is actually good! Let's hope. Always cool to see what it's actually like on this set, [â€¦]",

I'm glad they've released so many behind-the-scenes featurettes for this movie, I just hope it means the movie is actually good! Let's hope. Always cool to see what it's actually like on this set, especially shooting on location for tons of scenes. Here's the final \"Shooting on Film\" promo for Gareth Edwards' Jurassic World Rebirth, on YouTube: You can rewatch the first trailer for Edwards' Jurassic World Rebirth movie right here and trailer #2 here. This action-packed new chapter sees an extraction team race to the most dangerous place on Earth, an island research facility for the original Jurassic Park, inhabited by the worst of the worst that were left behind. Five years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion (released in 2022), the planet's ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind. Jurassic World Rebirth is directed by the acclaimed British sci-fi filmmaker Gareth Edwards, director of the sci-fi movies Monsters, Godzilla, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and The Creator previously. The screenplay is written by David Koepp (also of Jurassic Park, Carlito's Way, Mission: Impossible, Premium Rush, Inferno, Kimi). Produced by Frank Marshall Patrick Crowley. Made by Amblin Entertainment and The Kennedy/Marshall Company. Universal will debut Edwards' Jurassic World Rebirth movie in theaters worldwide starting July 2nd, 2025 this summer movie season.
