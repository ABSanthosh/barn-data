  "text": "Purple Ticket is a new referral program on TikTok that allows users to earn rewards by sharing a special link with others. Whether you’re an existing TikTok user or someone new to the platform, the Purple Ticket offers a way to earn money. Now, many are curious to know how to get the ticket and what are the requirements. Here is everything to know about the Purple Ticket referral program. How to get Purple Ticket on TikTok? TikTok’s new purple ticket feature offers users the opportunity to earn rewards through a unique referral program. When a user clicks the ticket on their profile, it generates a personalized referral link. Through this, existing users who click the link can earn the referrer up to $10 per person, with a daily limit. Additionally, if a new user signs up and downloads the app via the link, the referrer earns $50 and the new user gets $10. However, it’s important to note that these rewards are not directly transferable to a bank account. Instead, the money earned through the Purple Ticket program can only be redeemed as coupons to shop on TikTok’s platform. This makes the program especially beneficial for users who frequently purchase items from TikTok’s marketplace. To participate in the Purple Ticket program, users must be over 18, reside in the United States, and refrain from using a VPN. If eligible, users will see the Purple Ticket on the top-left corner of their profile, where they can generate and share their referral link. Although the Purple Ticket program offers a tempting way to earn rewards, not all TikTok users have access to it. The video-sharing platform has not revealed the specific criteria for who receives the ticket. However, for those who have it, sharing the referral link can lead to significant rewards and the opportunity to grow the TikTok user base.",
