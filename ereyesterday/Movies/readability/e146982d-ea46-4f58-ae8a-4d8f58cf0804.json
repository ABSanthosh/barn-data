  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: CBS has put in development Token White Friends, a multi-camera comedy from The Neighborhood team of executive producers Aaron Kaplan via Kapital Entertainment, Wendi Trilling via TrillTV and Cedric The Entertainer \u0026 Eric Rhone via A Bird and Bear Entertainment as well as CBS Studios. Written and executive produced by Josh Greenberg (Not Dead Yet), Jordan Black (The Wonder Years) and Jon Haller (30 Rock) White Token Friends is inspired by a true story. In it, when a Black couple adopts a white child, they reach out to three estranged white college friends to be part of their village. Per the creators, Token White Friends is “about parenthood, culture clashes, and why it’s problematic for a 7-year-old white kid to wear cornrows.” Greenberg, Black and Haller, who all previously worked on Last Man Standing, recently sold The Nerd Table, an animated series based on the trio’s nerdy 90s childhoods to Peacock and Universal with Will Glick producing. Black’s series credits also include Punky Brewster, The Last OG and Saturday Night Live. He is repped by IAG, manager Pamela Thomas and VanderKloot Law. Greenberg’s series credits also include Crowded and Raising Hope. He is repped by Gersh and managers Jarrod Murray \u0026 Allard Cantor of Epicenter. Heller is repped by Gersh and manager Zadoc Angell \u0026 Amotz Zakai at Echo Lake.",
