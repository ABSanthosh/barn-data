His granddaughter, Naomi Biden, has become the mother of a baby boy. She welcomed her first child with her husband, Peter George Heermann Neal. The couple tied the knot on the South Lawn of the White House on November 19, 2022. Without further ado, here are all the details fans need to know about the newest member of the Biden family. Naomi Biden welcomes first child with her husband After two years of marriage, Joe Biden’s granddaughter gave birth to her first child on Wednesday, January 8. The President’s wife, Jil Biden, shared an adorable snap of the baby boy with his great-grandfather on Instagram. She further announced the name of Naomi’s son, William Brannon Neal, IV. Moreover, President Biden announced the happy news at a news conference, stating, “The good news is I’m a great-grandfather as of today.” He also mentioned the baby boy is “a 10-pound, 4-ounce.” (via Fox News) Previously, Joe Biden had talked about traveling to California for Naomi’s delivery on January 8th. He told USA Today, “I’m about to be a great-grandfather, Jesus God. But Naomi is due to have a cesarean on the 8th of January.” Naomi is the daughter of Biden’s son, Hunter, and he is always impressed with her stellar success as a lawyer. In the interview, the proud grandfather gushed, “She works for one of the major law firms. She went to Penn, at Columbia Law School.” Additionally, Joe Biden reportedly became the first modern President to be a great-grandfather while still in office. On the professional front, Naomi Biden followed her father Hunter Biden’s path as a lawyer and studied for a Doctor of Law degree from Columbia Law School. Per her LinkedIn, the 31-year-old lawyer is an associate attorney at Arnold \u0026 Porter Kaye Scholer LLP.",
