  "text": "Robert Pattinson might be hanging up his hat after being the Caped Crusader. The actor/producer told The New York Times Style magazine that Matt Reeves‘ planned trilogy for “The Batman” might bookend his decades-spanning career. “The Batman” was released in 2022, with its sequel expected in theaters in late 2026. Reeves’ iteration of the comic book superhero also has expanded into Max series “The Penguin.” “I could genuinely be retiring by the end of them,” Pattinson said of the state of his career after three Reeves films, adding of acting as a whole, “Not in a million years did I think I’d still be doing this when I got my first job. I can’t believe this is still going.” Pattinson, whose breakout turn at age 17 in “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire” (2005) led to his five viral “Twilight” films, explained that acting is all about balance. “The main thing is constantly remembering what your job is,” he said. “It’s a discipline to not use your energy on anything other than that.” “The Batman” proved to resonant with Pattinson in a different way, especially by playing a character that has two different sides to him: public figure Bruce Wayne and the private Batman. “That was my one idea for Bruce,” Pattinson said. “He’s been portrayed until now as a playboy. But what if he’s completely socially inept and kind of agoraphobic?” The “Batman” line “If I can’t change things here, if I can’t have an effect. I don’t care what happens to me,” also stuck with him. “I was very aware, that no one was really thinking about me,” Pattinson said of his early career. Now, as a producer, Pattinson has found more autonomy in Hollywood. “If you’re just an actor, you don’t really meet with anyone other than directors who want you to play an English prince,” Pattinson, who is next leading Bong Joon Ho’s “Mickey 17,” said. “Doing this, I’ve met so many different people and I have something to provide them. It’s made me more understanding of what I’m doing as a performer, as well.”",
