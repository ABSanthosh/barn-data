  "text": "The latest spoilers of General Hospital are keeping fans on the edge of their seats, with the 2025 Nurses Ball set to uncover new developments. The long-running soap opera will see several entries, with characters dressing up in their best outfits to attend the grand event. However, the ball will also witness the revelations of several secrets, with the upcoming episode of the ABC show promising much drama for its viewers. So, let’s take a look at what fans can expect from the 2025 Nurses Ball in General Hospital. How will the 2025 Nurses Ball unfold in General Hospital? As per the recent General Hospital spoilers, the 2025 Nurses Ball will begin with Drew Cain encapsulating what lies ahead by saying, “It’s going to be a wild night!” After this, Lucy Coe will make an unusual entrance, bringing a llama to the occasion. Moreover, Jordan Ashford and Jenz Sidwell will closely follow her, with Gio Palmieri and Josslyn Jacks arriving at the venue shortly afterward. Lucy is expected to encounter a problem, probably due to the animal she brought along with her to the ceremony. However, all eyes will be on Cody Bell, who will invite Molly Lansing-Davis to the floor. Though the duo continues to insist that they’re no more than “just friends,” their dynamics would suggest something more. Meanwhile, Dante Falconeri and Harrison Chase will find themselves in awe after witnessing the magnetic entry of Lulu Spencer. The group, along with the Quartermaines, will then head to the Metro Court to enjoy the fireworks. The latest General Hospital spoilers also indicate a development in Anna Devane’s plans, while the 2025 Nurses Ball carries forward. She will confide in Felicia Scorpio with her plot, revealing that she has discovered a way to go ahead with their covert plan. While Anna will miss out on the event due to her plotting, Chase might skip the ball due to a call from a mysterious person. Additionally, his conversation could allude to Drew’s talk with Mac Scorpio, sparking even more drama.",
