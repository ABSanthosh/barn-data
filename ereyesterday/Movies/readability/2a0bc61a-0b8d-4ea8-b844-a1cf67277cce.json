Created by Craig Sweeny, the series stars Morris Chestnut as John Watson, Holmes’ trusted friend. The show debuted on January 26, 2025, on CBS and it is also available for streaming on Paramount Plus. Without further ado, let’s delve into everything we know about Sherlock Holmes’ absence from the series. Here’s why Sherlock Holmes doesn’t appear in the Watson series on CBS CBS’ Watson, doesn’t feature Sherlock Holmes as it is set after the death of the legendary detective. A modern-day retelling of Arthur Conan Doyle’s novels, the series’ storyline begins six months after Holmes passes away and follows the aftermath of his death. It shines the spotlight on Dr. John Watson and looks to expand the fictional universe. The series centers on Watson, who has now devoted his time to his clinic where he specializes in rare disorders. However, his quiet routine is disrupted when the late Holmes’ infamous nemesis and supposed killer, Professor Moriarty, makes an appearance. Following the show’s recent television debut, fans have also raised the question of whether it is tied to CBS’ 2012 series Elementary, which stars Jonny Lee Miller as Sherlock Holmes and Lucy Liu as Dr. Joan Watson. Although the two series share Craig Sweeney as a writer, they do not share any connection with each other. Hence, one doesn’t have to watch Elementary before jumping into Watson as the two shows are completely unrelated. The only common ground between the two shows is that they are both inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle’s evergreen creation. Viewers can enjoy the two shows separately, as they are both very unique takes on the classic Sherlock Holmes fictional universe. Lucy Liu’s Joan Watson in Elementary was the first gender-bent rendition of the eponymous John Watson. On the other hand, Watson on CBS explores the doctor’s adventures as a protagonist rather than the beloved sidekick. With Morris Chestnut as the titular Watson, the show also stars Eve Harlow, Peter Mark Kendall, Inga Schlingmann, Randall Park, and more.",
