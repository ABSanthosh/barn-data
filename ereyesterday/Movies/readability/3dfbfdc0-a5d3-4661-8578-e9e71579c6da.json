Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Mandy Fabian's comedy Jess Plus None, direct from YouTube: Screwball comedies feel like something from a bygone era, which makes it even more impressive that Jess Plus None understands the formula so well. When Jess, a reluctant maid of honor, finds herself at her best friend's \"middle of the woods\" wedding, she is confronted by her ex-girlfriend, her ultra successful friend from college, her gay friend and his new partner, and every bad choice she's made throughout her life. Jess Plus None is written and directed by American indie filmmaker Mandy Fabian, making her feature directorial debut after many short films and other projects previously. Produced by Sarah Chaney, Heather Olt, and Mandy June Turpin. This initially premiered at the 2023 BFI Flare \u0026 Frameline Film Festivals a few years ago. Freestyle Digital Media will debut Fabian's Jess Plus None film direct-to-VOD in the US on April 29th, 2025 coming soon. For any more info, visit the film's official site. Anyone want to watch this?
