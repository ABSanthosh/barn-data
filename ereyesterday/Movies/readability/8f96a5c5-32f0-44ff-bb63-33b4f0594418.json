  "text": "SPOILER ALERT! This post contains details from the Season 2 premiere of CBS‘ Tracker. The Season 2 premiere of Tracker gives audiences an answer as to why Teddi Bruin won’t be around much to help Colter Shaw on his cases of the week. Robin Weigert, who played Teddi in the first season, exited as a series regular ahead of Season 2. While the premiere episode doesn’t go into much detail, it does explain that Teddi is out of town helping her mother. Watch on Deadline “She’s gonna be there a while,” Abby McEnany’s Velma Bruin, Teddi’s wife, tells Colter over the phone in the first few minutes of the episode. “She’s helping her mom get sorted.” Justin Hartley’s Colter points out that Velma was supposed to go back and forth between home and wherever Teddi is, but Velma says she felt like she was “getting in the way,” so she decided to come back and put herself to work helping Colter again. It’s not clear if this means that Weigert will make any appearances this season, or if Teddi will be staying with her mother for the long haul. Teddi is a former touring manager for rock musicians who’s now settled into comfortable middle age in Northern Florida with her wife and a bunch of pets. Together, Teddi and Velma run Colter’s “back end”: seeking out new jobs, keeping track of the money and occasionally getting him sprung from jail. In the premiere, Velma helps Colter track down a family of four who disappears, seemingly out of thing air, from Pine Bluffs, Arkansas. Velma says in the episode that she’s also going to be helping Reenie (Fiona Rene) open her own criminal law office this season. New episodes of Tracker air Sundays at 8 p.m. ET/PT.",
