  "text": "Close to two years after their public separation, actor Joe Alwyn has come out to share his thoughts on his past relationship with Taylor Swift. The two started their romance sometime after Alwyn starred in the 2016 film Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk. The celebrity couple seemed to be progressing steadily until they confirmed their split in early 2023. Nevertheless, many fans are still interested to know more about their time together. Here’s what Joe Alwyn said about his previous relationship with Taylor Swift and their current dynamic. Joe Alwyn said he has ‘moved on’ from Taylor Swift While talking to The Guardian in a recent interview, the 33-year-old star emphasized that he has, as the interview puts it, “moved on” from Taylor Swift. He then stated that people should follow suit and leave their relationship in the past. Talking about fans’ opinions on his former relationship with Taylor Swift, Joe Alwyn said, “That’s something for other people to do. We’re talking about something that’s a while ago now in my life. So that’s for other people. That’s what I feel.” The outlet then questioned Joe Alwyn about the impact of his relationship with Swift on his career. Alwyn provided a balanced reply to this query before explaining his approach to dealing with negative things. “I have tried just to focus on controlling what I can control,” he said. “And, right from the beginning, tried to focus on the things that are meaningful for me: friends, family, work, of course. So noise outside of that, I think I’ve done what lots of people who find themselves in the public eye do, which is just try and ignore it. If you don’t, and if you let all of that other stuff in, and if it starts to affect you and your behavior, you’re living from the outside in.” Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift ended their six-year relationship in April 2023, with People reporting “differences in their personalities” as the reason behind their breakup. Swift has since struck up a romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, which currently appears to be going strong.",
