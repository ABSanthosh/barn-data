  "text": "UPDATED: After being denied entry into Saudi Arabia to present her film “Sima’s Song,” which is playing in competition at the Red Sea Film Festival, and denouncing this, Afghan filmmaker Roya Sadat has been cleared to visit the kingdom. “On Wednesday, the 4th, I was stopped at Dallas Airport and prevented from boarding my flight to Jeddah. The airline claimed that Saudi Arabia does not accept extended Afghan passports. Extended passports are issued by Afghan embassies abroad and are not recognized by the Taliban, as these embassies operate independently of their control. The Taliban have requested that countries reject these passports, but since countries do not recognize the Taliban as a legitimate authority, they do accept them,” Sadat said in a statement email to Variety. “I was shocked when the airline representative stated that Saudi Arabia does not accept extended Afghan passports. Many Afghans travel to Mecca every year, and for most of them, this is the only type of passport they possess,” Sadat added. “Today, I received a call from the festival organizers informing me that the issue had been resolved and that I would be able to travel with the same visa. I’m relieved because this confirms that the situation was a mistake on the part of the airline. It also reassures me that Saudi Arabia aligns with the majority of nations and therefore accepts passports and their extended issued by Afghan embassies, not under Taliban control.” Popular on Variety “I want to express my heartfelt thanks to the Red Sea Film Festival for their incredible support in resolving this matter,” Sadat said. PREVIOUSLY: Prominent Afghan director Roya Sadat, whose latest film “Sima’s Song” is playing in competition at Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea Film Festival, is denouncing being denied entry into the kingdom to present the film, despite having been issued a Saudi visa. Sadat, in an email to Variety, said she was scheduled to travel to Jeddah, the Saudi city on the Red Sea’s eastern shore where the fest is being held, on Dec. 3 to participate and present her film. “But I was denied boarding because Saudi Arabia does not accept Afghan passports renewed after the Taliban’s return to power,” she added.  “This raises a key question: if such passports are not accepted, why issue visas in the first place?,” Sadat went on to point out. “Was the visa granted, only to be rejected later? Despite repeated calls to Jeddah, I was ultimately not allowed to travel,” she noted. Representatives for the Red Sea Film Festival did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation and comment. In a subsequent email, Sadat said she was deeply frustrated by two issues in this seemingly absurd situation. “First, they [Saudi authorities] refused to honor the visa they themselves issued,” she said. “Second, the hypocrisy is glaring,” Sadat went on. “The Taliban, holding the same passports as mine and millions of other Afghans, face no such restrictions,” she added. Sadat noted that current Taliban Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, a U.S.-designated terrorist who has a $10 million bounty on his head, reportedly recently visited Saudi Arabia, specifically traveling to Jeddah and to the Kaaba in the Holy City of Mecca, which is Islam’s most important mosque, for a pilgrimage. “He, a terrorist, was granted entry, while I, an artist, was denied,” Sadat denounced. “I considered withdrawing my film from the festival in protest of this policy,” Sadat, who is now based in the U.S., went on to say. However, out of respect for the two actors and the producer, who had already arrived in Jeddah, I decided to let it go,” she added.  “Sima’s Song,” which follows a wealthy Communist and a poor Muslim woman as they navigate the country’s socialist transition during the Soviet invasion and the emergence of anti-Soviet resistance movements, premiered at the Tokyo Film Festival last month. A pioneering figure in Afghan cinema, Sadat’s career spans the turbulent evolution of filmmaking in her homeland, from writing her first screenplay during the initial Taliban regime – when screening movies could result in public lashings – to becoming one of Afghanistan’s most prominent directors.
