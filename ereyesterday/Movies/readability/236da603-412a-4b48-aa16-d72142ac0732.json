Each of the six finalists will also be featured in Produced By magazine and their producers will participate in December called “Conversations In Innovation.”  Watch on Deadline Presented annually since 2019, the Innovation Award is presented to the production as a whole, not to individual producers. Per the guild, it honors exceptional distinctiveness, inventiveness and impact in expanding the conventions of program format, content, audience interaction, production technique and delivery. The expansion of programming around the PGA Innovation Award underscores  the guild’s mission of recognizing and embracing innovation and emerging technologies utilized by producers. “The PGA is committed to honoring and encouraging innovation and emerging media formats,” PGA Presidents Stephanie Allain and Donald De Line said in a joint statement. “With the expansion of the PGA Innovation Award this year, the Guild has committed to ensuring that its members have an opportunity to experience and engage with some of the year’s most innovative productions that push the boundaries of creative expression and emerging media.” The 36th annual Producers Guild Awards ceremony is set for Saturday, February 8, at L.A.’s Fairmont Century Plaza.",
