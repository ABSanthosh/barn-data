  "text": "Ben Affleck is set to direct and star in the upcoming Netflix thriller Animals, according to a recent report from Deadline. What do we know about Animals? According to the report, the thriller will also star Gillian Anderson, who is on board to produce the project alongside Affleck’s Artists Equity banner. The film’s plot details are mostly under wraps for now, but Deadline notes that the movie will revolve around a kidnapping of some sort. Other producers on the project include Matt Damon, Dani Bernfield, Gerry Cardinale, Brad Weston, and Collin Creighton. Artists Equity’s Michael Joe, Kevin Halloran, and Lucy Damon are attached to the film as executive producers. For Affleck, this will be the next movie he directs following 2023’s biographical sports drama Air, which he starred in alongside Matt Damon. Deadline notes that Affleck was originally planning on directing the film with his longtime friend and partner Matt Damon in line to star. However, Deadline notes that a holdup with the rights to things held up production, and with Damon now off to star in Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey, Affleck will direct the project anyway. Outside of his directorial efforts, Affleck will also star in The Accountant 2 this year, as well as RIP, an upcoming project that will see he and Damon reunite once again. As for Anderson, she’ll next star in the upcoming Tron: Ares, the standalone sequel to Tron: Legacy. (Source: Deadline)",
