  "text": "As a former Saturday Night Live cast member, David Spade joked he’s so old he recalls a time when he and his colleagues treated Lorne Michaels more as a boss than a friend. While listing their New Year’s resolutions, Spade (who left the late-night show in 1996) told co-host Dana Carvey on a new episode of the Fly on the Wall podcast that times indeed have changed, so much so that it shocks him. He recalled an anecdote where repertory player Sarah Sherman told him she “texted [Lorne Michaels] and said, ‘Why did my sketch get cut?’ I’m like, you text Lorne? That floors me.” Carvey, who left SNL in 1993 and has since returned on the sketch series’ storied 50th season as POTUS Joe Biden, incredulously asked: “As a cast member? During the show?” Watch on Deadline When prompted by an off-camera producer, Spade expanded on a behind-the-scenes tidbit featuring Sherman. “Lorne was giving notes when I did Hunter Biden,” he began, recalling the Dec. 7 episode of the long-running comedy program. “We’re all sitting there and Lorne’s got a microphone and he’s like, ‘Cold open,'” he continued. “He starts reading and then he goes, ‘Sarah,’ because she was [playing] Matt Gaetz, ‘maybe you gotta face … you’re not in the light enough. Can you face more towards the middle?’ She goes, ‘I’ll try.’ I’m like, ‘How about yes, sir?'” By all accounts, Michaels — who created SNL in 1975 and has executive produced it since, for half a century — is not difficult to work with nor a demanding boss. In November, SNL MVP Bowen Yang recounted feeling intimidated by the TV legend, especially after a “disaster” of a screen test: “Aidy Bryant was the one who told me, ‘You can be, like, friends with him now.’ I think Lorne at one point was hanging out with Aidy and was kind of chuckling about it like, ‘I think Bowen sees me as a mountain to climb, and I don’t want him to think that anymore.’ And that kind of gave me the encouragement to just go up to him and be like, ‘Oh, we can relate to each other on a human-to-human level,’ which I never thought would happen with him.”",
