From the creator of \"Dollface\" comes an original movie - which is skipping theaters and will be out on streaming on Max at the end of November. Two college freshmen pull a \"Turkey Dump\" and break up with their high school sweethearts over \"Drunksgiving\" – the one chaotic night before Thanksgiving in their hometown that puts their codependent friendship to the test.
