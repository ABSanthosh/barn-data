  "text": "Loren Ruch, head of content for HGTV and co-host of “HGTV House Party,” died Thursday of acute myeloid leukemia. He was 55. “Loren was the rare leader who lifted everyone around him,” Channing Dungey, chair of Warner Bros. Television Group, wrote in a memo sent Thursday to staff members. “Known for his unwavering dedication, endless kindness, and unshakeable integrity, Loren built not only hit shows but enduring relationships, serving as mentor, advocate and true friend to countless colleagues across the television landscape. His impact stretched far beyond the screen. Loren was the connective tissue of every room he entered – the glue that bound teams, departments, and friendships. He possessed the rare gift of making people feel seen, valued, and inspired to do their best work.” Ruch had been with HGTV as a top programming executive since 2008. He was named head of content for the lifestyle cabler in January 2023. Early on in his HGTV tenure, Ruch oversaw the production of such series “HGTV Dream Home,” “HGTV Green Home,” “Rose Parade” and “White House Christmas” as an executive producer. As the head of content, he managed the programming of “My Lottery Dream Home,” “Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge,” “Celebrity IOU,” “Battle on the Beach” and “A Very Brady Renovation.”   Popular on Variety Earlier, Ruch served as VP of development and programming for HGTV, DIY Network and Great American Country. He started his tenure at the Warner Bros. Discovery-owned cable network in 2005, supervising additional programming, including Food Network and Fine Living. Channing Dungey, chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. Television Group and U.S. Networks honored Ruch and his contributions to the network in a memo she sent to her staff announcing his death.  Prior to joining HGTV, he worked in Los Angeles for Fox O\u0026O KTTV-TV on “Good Day LA” and “Good Day Live” as the senior producer of the morning news shows. He began his career in daytime talk shows and game shows, including “Home \u0026 Family,” “Love Connection” and “Family Feud.” Ruch also served as a board member of Live Out Loud, a nonprofit organization that supports LGBTQ+ youth by connecting them with LGBTQ+ professionals in their community.  “For those of us lucky enough to have known and loved Loren, the things we remember and cherish go far beyond his professional accomplishments,” Dungey said. “We warmly recall the way he supported his team and his colleagues, celebrating their victories and lending a sympathetic ear when things were difficult. Loren’s light touched everyone lucky enough to know him. Though gone too soon, he leaves behind a lasting imprint on both the television industry and the lives of those who loved him.”  Ruch is survived by his husband, David Salas; his mother and father and a brother. Donations may be made in Ruch’s memory to the Alisa Ann Ruch Burn Foundation or Be the Match.",
