  "text": "DC’s planned Clayface movie has officially begun hearing pitches from directors, with Deadline reporting that Jeff Wadlow and James Watkins are in the mix to helm the project. The latest report notes that DC Studios is beginning to hear pitches from potential directors in the coming week, with both Wadlow and Watkins being names that were floated as potential future directors. Deadline’s report also notes that there is “buzz” that casting for the film has also begun, but that won’t likely happen until a director has already been set and can help weigh in on the moves. Wadlow is best known for his work in the horror genre, having directed 2024’s Imaginary, 2020’s Fantasy Island, and 2018’s Truth or Dare. He also directed the 2013 sequel Kick-Ass 2, as well as 2008’s Never Back Down. Watkins most recently directed 2024’s Speak No Evil remake, as well as 2016’s Bastille Day, and 2012’s The Woman in Black. What do we know about DC’s Clayface movie? Currently, not a whole lot about the movie is known, but the list of directors being looked at does corroborate reports that the film will be a horror-thriller of sorts. The movie is being written by prolific and critically acclaimed writer/filmmaker Mike Flanagan. On Threads, James Gunn called Clayface a “DCU story,” meaning that it will be set within the continuity of Gunn and Peter Safran’s new shared DC universe that recently kicked off with the animated Creature Commandos series.  While no casting has been officially announced for the Clayface movie as of yet, it’s worth noting that Alan Tudyk is voicing the character in Creature Commandos. Gunn has previously said that actors who voice major animated characters in DCU projects will also play them in live-action, which is the case for Frank Grillo as he’s voicing Rick Flag Sr. in Creature Commandos and will also appear in 2025’s live-action Superman movie. Additionally, Gunn has said that Tudyk will play a live-action character in the DCU. It wasn’t initially clear who he meant as Tudyk also voices Doctor Phosphorus and Will Magnus in addition to Clayface in Creature Commandos. (Source: Deadline)",
