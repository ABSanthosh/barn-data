  "description": "\"Making it to the top is not worth your life. It's just... not worth it.\" Blue Harbor Ent. has revealed a teaser trailer for an intriguing new horror film called The Sound, made by filmmaker Brendan Devane. Has there been a rock climbing horror movie before (not counting Cliffhanger which is action)? A group of climbers embarks on a dangerous climb that has been off-limits for years. What begins as an audacious expedition transforms into a battle for survival against a force that toys with them. During their ascent, they come face to face with a malevolent force that quickly turns their expedition into a harrowing battle for survival. This poster hints at the supernatural force hanging over the rock wall. And they even have some rock music, too. Actor William Fichtner is in the cast with Marc Hills, Jocelyn Hudon, David Clennon, Christina Kirkman, plus special guests Kyle Gass and real climber Alex Honnold. Gotta say, I'm kinda intrigued by this - at least the climbing will be real and not bad Hollywood fake. Check out the quick first look below. Here's the first look teaser trailer (+ poster) for Brendan Devane's film The Sound, from YouTube: In terrifying […]",

Here's the first look teaser trailer (+ poster) for Brendan Devane's film The Sound, from YouTube: In terrifying horror thriller The Sound, a world-class group of climbers is granted access to the Forbidden Wall, a mysterious rock wall previously closed for decades. Among all the climbers is Sean (Marc Hills), whose grandfather made an ill-fated attempt 63 years earlier. During the group’s ascent, they come face to face with a malevolent force that quickly turns their expedition into a harrowing battle for survival hundreds of feet above the ground. The Sound is written \u0026 directed by American indie filmmaker Brendan Devane, making his second film after directing The Canyonlands (2021) previously. It's also produced by Brendan Devane.
