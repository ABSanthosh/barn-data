Here's the new 2024 trailer for the re-release of Takashi Yamazaki's Godzilla: Minus One, via YouTube: You can rewatch the final 2023 trailer for Godzilla: Minus One here / or the 70th anniversary tribute here. \"Set in a post-war Japan, Godzilla Minus 1 will once again show us a Godzilla that is a terrifying and overwhelming force, which you already get a sense of from the teaser trailer and poster,\" Koji Ueda, President of Toho International, said in a statement. \"The concept is that Japan, which had already been devastated by the war, faces a new threat with Godzilla, bringing the country into the 'minus.'\" Godzilla Minus One, also known as ゴジラ-1.0 or Gojira Mainasu Wan in Japanese, is both written and directed by the Japanese producer / filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki, director of many films including Space Battleship Yamato, The Fighter Pilot, Stand by Me Doraemon, Parasyte: Part 1 \u0026 2, Destiny: The Tale of Kamakura, Lupin III: The First, Dragon Quest: Your Story, and Ghost Book previously. Yamazaki also worked on the Oscar-winning VFX in this. Filming began in mid-March 2022, taking place in Kantō and wrapped in mid-June. Toho originally debuted the film in US theaters on December 1st, 2023 later last year. Yamazaki's Godzilla: Minus One will re-open in US theaters (AMC only) on November 1st, 2024. Ready to go back?
