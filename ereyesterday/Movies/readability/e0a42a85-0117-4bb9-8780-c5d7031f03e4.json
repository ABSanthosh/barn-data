  "text": "“Clone Cops,” an independent comedy about outlaws combatting an endless wave of cutting-edge law enforcement on a dystopian streaming show called “CrimeTime360,” has been picked up for video on-demand and a DVD release by Freestyle Digital Media. The banner has set a Jan. 31 date for the film, directed by Danny Dones, for both physical media and digital distribution. “Clone Cops” kicked off a roadshow theatrical run at the start of the month, with a special screening in Philadelphia. It has since played Boston and Memphis, with seven more cities to come, including weeklong runs in Los Angeles and New York City beginning Jan. 31. “I’m so excited to be partnering with Freestyle Digital Media for the release ‘Clone Cops,’” said Dones. “We made this movie for people who love campy sci-fi comedies, and we’ve been having a blast showing it to them at festivals and theaters across the country. Now, we can finally bring this weird little indie flick to people’s living rooms! I want to thank our incredible cast and crew for everything they’ve contributed, and the continuing support they’ve shown for ‘Clone Cops’ as we’ve worked to bring it to screens large and small. Making this movie was so much fun, and now we get to share that experience with audiences everywhere!” Dones directed “Clone Cops” and co-wrote the screenplay with Phillip Cordell. Charles Royce, Nate Eggert and Cordell are producers, while Cordell plays the innumerable Clone Cops in the film. The cast also includes Ravi Patel, Quinnlan Ashe, Steve Byrne, Ted Welch, Allison Shrum, Laura Holloway, Schyler Tillet, Dean Shortland, Henry Haggard, Rashad Rayford, Justin Tarrents and Victoria Keum Jee. Popular on Variety Freestyle Digital Media, a division of Allen Media Group, negotiated the acquisition deal with Glen Reynolds and Circus Road Films.",
