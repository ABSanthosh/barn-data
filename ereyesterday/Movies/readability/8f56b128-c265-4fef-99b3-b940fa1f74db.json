Despite bagging a lower opening than its predecessors and getting low scores on Rotten Tomatoes, Tom Hardy-starrer Venom 3 is doing fairly well following its opening weekend at the box office. Heretic’s box office predicted to beat Venom 3’s $12 million domestic weekend The box office predictions for Heretic’s opening weekend have finally dropped. The movie is set to release in theaters across the United States on November 8, 2024. Heretic features a star cast filled with talents like Hugh Grant, Chloe East, Sophie Thatcher, and Topher Grace. It is expected to generate approximately $12 million in its opening weekend at the box office, according to Deadline. The predictions by A24 stand at $8 million to $10 million. This is based on the number of theaters the film will be released in. However, Deadline indicates that with a figure of $12 million, Heretic is expected to surpass the collection of Venom 3 in its third weekend. The outlet also states that on Election Day, the latter clocked in $3.3 million. It is a significant drop from its opening weekend of $51 million, as per Box Office Mojo. Meanwhile, Heretic has already wowed the critics with its brilliant storytelling. It was rated at 94 percent on Rotten Tomatoes with 119 critic reviews. James Dyer from Empire Magazine wrote in his review, “An incredibly tense, tightly contained bottle horror, showcasing a genuinely chilling turn from Hugh Grant. You’ll never watch Notting Hill the same way again.” As per the description of the movie provided on Rotten Tomatoes, the movie falls under the horror thriller genre. Additionally, this A24 project is rated R and has received praise for being gripping and entertaining.",
