And playing in theaters soon. Here's the latest \"Inside Look\" featurette for Steve McQueen's film Blitz, from Apple TV's YouTube: You can rewatch the main official trailer for Steve McQueen's Blitz film right here, for even more footage. A boy's journey. A mother's love. Miles of burning city between them. Sir Steve McQueen's Blitz follows the epic journey of George (Elliott Heffernan), a 9-year-old boy in World War II London whose mother Rita (Saoirse Ronan) sends him to safety in the English countryside. George, defiant and determined to return home to his mom and his grandfather Gerald (Paul Weller) in East London, embarks on an adventure, only to find himself in immense peril, while a distraught Rita searches for her missing son. Blitz is written and directed by acclaimed Oscar winner British filmmaker Steve McQueen, director of the films Hunger, Shame, 12 Years a Slave, and Widows, plus the Small Axe anthology (Mangrove, Lovers Rock, Red White \u0026 Blue, Alex Wheatle, Education) previously. It's produced Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, Steve McQueen, Arnon Milchan, Yariv Milchan, Anita Overland, Michael Schaefer, Adam Somner. This is premiering at the 2024 New York and London Film Festivals this fall. Apple TV will debut Blitz in select US theaters on November 1st, 2024, then streaming on Apple TV+ starting November 22nd.
