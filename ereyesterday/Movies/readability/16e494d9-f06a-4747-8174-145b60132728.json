She is currently engulfed in a legal battle with her It Ends With Us co-star. Tensions between the two emerged in 2024 after Lively accused Baldoni of a smear campaign and sexual harassment. Without further ado, here are all the details fans need to know about Lively and DiCaprio’s former relationship. Blake Lively and Leonardo DiCaprio’s breakup resurfaces While Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni prepare to face each other in a trial, which is scheduled for March 2026, her previous relationship with Leonardo DiCaprio has taken over the internet. The Titanic actor and Lively first sparked dating rumors in May 2011, after they were pictured together in Cannes on a yacht. From thereon, they were frequently spotted hanging out together. According to E! News, just weeks after breaking up with his former girlfriend, Bar Rafaeli, DiCaprio was photographed taking a walk with Lively in Portofino, Italy. In June 2011, the former couple was spotted enjoying the rides at Disneyland as part of a private getaway. While rumors swirled that the two had split, they were again spotted having a shopping date in Santa Barbara. In August of the same year, DiCaprio and the Gossip Girl star were photographed spending time at the Featherdale Wildlife Park in Sydney, Australia. However, after this, the two reportedly went their separate ways. Speaking to US Weekly about Blake Lively and Leonardo DiCaprio’s breakup after just 5 months, a source close to them stated that they chose to have a friendship. Furthermore, a close friend of DiCaprio claimed that the actor was very different with Lively. Moreover, they never saw him “like this with a girl.” Sources also conveyed that the two spent most of the baking and cooking before the breakup. They added that “Leo’s never dated a girl who can cook. And he’s smitten!” Blake Lively eventually tied the knot with Ryan Reynolds in 2012. On the other hand, Leonardo DiCaprio is currently in a relationship with Vittoria Ceretti. It is unclear if the former pair is still in touch. Albeit, fans have shown renewed interest in their relationship and breakup details amid Lively’s legal battle with Justin Baldoni.",
