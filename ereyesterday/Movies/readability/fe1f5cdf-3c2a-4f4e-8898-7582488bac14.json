  "text": "Bravo has put a pause on The Real Housewives of Dubai after two seasons, Deadline has confirmed. The most current season of the series starred Chanel Ayan, Sara Al Madani, Carolina Brooks, Lesa Milan, Taleen Marie, and Caroline Stanbury. According to a report by Us Weekly, “The cast was told a couple days ago,” a third season of the reality series would not be happening at this time. The cable network has not publicly stated if this is the end of RHODubai or if they are ending the spinoff for good. Bravo has previously hit pause on shows like Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard after two seasons, Winter House Season 4, and even ratings hit Vanderpump Rules. Watch on Deadline RHODubai was the first international version of The Real Housewives franchise produced directly by Bravo. The reality series was announced in 2021 and premiered in 2022, with Chanel Ayan becoming a fan favorite for her wit and extravagant fashion. Ayan fans need not worry as the Bravo star will be one of the celebrities competing in The Traitors Season 3, which is set to premiere on January 9 on Peacock. The Real Housewives of Dubai was the 11th city of the franchise and its future after Season 2 wrapped in September had already been questioned. Caroline Brooks addressed rumors that the show had been canceled, taking to social media to clarify things. “Not sure where all of these #RHODubai rumors are coming from. Bravo hasn’t announced anything and our ENTIRE cast hasn’t been told anything,” Brooks posted on X on October 22. “So I thought I might share that since there are people ‘teasing’ and ‘debunking’ rumors. Just saying it’s giving THIRSTY calm down.” After news that RHODubai was being paused, Brooks took to X once again to confirm the news and said, “This aged well… #RHODubai Ladies, don’t debunk things and make false announcements to mislead people. Girls speaking about ‘shakeups’ and all of the debunking, was.. well.. interesting to watch on my timeline. I TOLD YOU.”",
