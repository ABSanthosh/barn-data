The 19-year-old student was critically injured on a black diamond trail, prompting a swift emergency response. Despite rescue efforts, the tragedy unfolded over the next day, raising questions about the circumstances and aftermath. Here’s what we know so far about the incident and investigation. Alex Kemp’s ski accident explained Alex Kemp, a 19-year-old first-year student at Williams College, died on January 7, 2025, after a skiing accident at Jiminy Peak Mountain Resort. Kemp, from Lincroft, New Jersey, crashed while skiing down the Cutter Trail in Hancock, Massachusetts. The trail is classified as an expert-level black diamond slope. The Berkshire County District Attorney’s Office reported that a witness called 911 at 2:39 p.m. on January 6. The caller said Kemp went over an embankment and suffered severe head trauma. Jiminy Peak Ski Patrol and Northern Berkshire EMS administered life-saving measures and transported Kemp to Berkshire Medical Center. They later transferred him to Baystate Medical Center, where he succumbed to his injuries. According to CBS News, Massachusetts State Police and the Berkshire State Police Detective Unit are overseeing the investigation. Authorities confirmed Kemp was wearing a helmet, and there was no evidence of drugs or alcohol playing a role in the incident. Kemp was a member of the Williams College cross country and track teams and had been recruited from Christian Brothers Academy in New Jersey. His academic interests included computer science, political science, and economics. Faculty at Williams College described him as a diligent and highly capable student. This incident marks the second skiing fatality in New England within a month. On December 31, 2024, a 12-year-old boy died in a skiing accident at Cranmore Mountain in Conway, New Hampshire. Authorities at Jiminy Peak have cooperated with the investigation and extended condolences to Kemp’s family. Williams College President Maud Mandel acknowledged Kemp’s death and expressed sympathy for the community. The college offers support services on campus and plans a public gathering to honor his life.",
