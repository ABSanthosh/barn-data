  "text": "“When you bring little kids to a park, they run up to other kids they don’t know and become friends. I’ve never seen that happen with adults — until now.” That was the sentiment on board the Hallmark Christmas Cruise, as described by one guest, who was enjoying her vacation with her adult nieces and granddaughter. The group of four, dressed in matching pink dresses with sequined nutcrackers, sipped cocktails while they opened up about how excited they were to just watch the Christmas movies and meet the stars. “It’s like a cult — but a good one,” one of the women joked, explaining that so many people gathered on the ship with one common interest: Hallmark Channel. While the crowd was mostly women, there were many couples on board — including one pair celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary and another who got engaged during the trip. Men also donned some of the funniest shirts on board. One had Christmas lights on the front and read, “My wife made me wear this.” Another read “Hallmark Husband.” A few men were dressed as Santa. I was lucky enough to be invited on board the Norwegian Gem for the inaugural sail, along with around 2,500 Hallmark fans and 11 celebrity guests, which departed on Nov. 5. However, the fan experience accidentally began the day before for some guests, as many actors arrived at a Miami hotel near the port of departure a day early and, before they knew it, fans were waiting in the lobby, hoping to get a selfie before the work actually began — and none of the actors said no. Popular on Variety Upon entering the ship, guests were sent into a winter wonderland. The atrium and check-in area was decorated with Hallmark-branded pillows, Christmas lights, extra large ornaments and festive backdrops perfect for photos. Elsewhere around the boat, it was less Christmas-y, but still Hallmark-branded — movie posters were placed on the hallway walls for upcoming movies, and the library was transformed into a store for Hallmark merchandise. Plus, with the Hallmark+ app having just launched this fall, the actors took many opportunities to remind the fans of content available only on the app (like “Finding Mr. Christmas” and “The Groomsmen” trilogy). To get it out of the way early, yes, we departed on Election Day. The first night for many was spent in their cabins, watching and waiting for results after partaking in some of the opening night events. (While Hallmark Christmas movies were available to watch 24/7 on the TVs in the room, there were also news channels offered.) Around midnight ET, I decided to get some much-needed fresh air with a walk around the ship and what I witnessed was that many people were doing the same — but not because of the election. Guests were having fun, sitting at the multiple bars, enjoying vacation. One bar had Fox News on the television, but no one was watching. I decided to get some hot cocoa, take some deep breaths and head back to my room. The rest of the week went on in the same pattern — very few people talked about the election, and most decided to focus on the Christmas magic happening in front of them. So, I managed to to do the same. “Hallmark” icon Jonathan Bennett was the cruise’s official host, and easily gets the MVP award — with an honorable mention to his husband, Jaymes Vaughan, and Hunter King’s fiancé, Chris Copier, both of whom spent every day cheering on their partners. For his part, Bennett kept his energy up from start to finish while hosting every event, including “Festive Feud,” a holiday take on “Family Feud,” featuring actors mixed with audience members. Bennett had never actually watched “Family Feud” and was so funny and engaging that he may have a future taking over for Steve Harvey. Much of the top deck was closed. The walking paths were shut down due to intense winds, and all of the suites and rooms were reserved for the Hallmark staff and talent to have a little bit of privacy. Speaking of which, getting the talent around the ship was a challenge in itself. Luckily, Sixthman, the company Norwegian Cruise Line partners with for themed cruises, had their ways. For example, ahead of moderating a panel with “The Groomsmen” cast Bennett, Tyler Hynes, B.J. Britt and Heather Hemmens, we were all escorted as a group through a maze of back hallways and white staircases until we found our way backstage. We didn’t encounter one person who wasn’t a ship employee, making the talent’s commute a bit simpler — until it was time to get to the elevator after the panel and return to their own quarters. “The Groomsmen” panel at the Stardust Theater on the Norwegian Gem By the time any event was over, especially those inside the main venue, the Stardust Theater — which held 1,042 fans — guests quickly learned where the exit door was. While it was only a mere 10 steps to the elevator, crowds gathered in herds to meet talent, and multiple security guards were assigned to make sure no one got too close. It’s hard to think of a group of actors who could have handled this better. Despite their packed schedules, the actors stopped each and every time, taking photos with babies (I’m looking at you, Rachel Boston!) whose parents couldn’t contain their excitement. They would listen to fans’ personal and often heartbreaking stories about how their movies have helped them, and gladly received gifts like stuffed animals, shirts and friendship bracelets that read “Cruisin’ With Hallmark.” Although there was a separate dining area exclusively for talent to use, many took the chance to walk down to to the buffet on the main floor as well, mingling with fans and snapping photos throughout the days. Tyler Hynes, for example, joined fans for a Boot Shot — a tradition he’s shared with fans via social media — taking a shot out of a boot-shaped Christmas ornament. Brooke D’Orsay, Rachel Boston, Brendan Penny, Ashley Williams, Will Kemp, Kristoffer Polaha, Tyler Hynes The large nighttime events were held at the main pool, which was covered by a stage for the duration of the cruise. The evenings were broken up into a tree lighting “sail-ebration,” a pajama party, an Ugly Christmas Sweater contest and a Christmas ball. The attendees and talent alike went all out — from pajamas decorated with actors’ faces to ball gowns and shoulder-length gloves. Each night, after about an hour or two on stage doing a plethora of fun and games, the actors would head off stage and over to the VIP area, where fans quickly figured out they’d be. Although there were barriers put up, some of the talent spent hours posing for selfies and giving fans hugs. (But they had to say no when some asked for a kiss — boundaries, people!) Tyler Hynes snapping photos onboard As in Hallmark movies, the cruise also featured heartwarming moments. During “The Groomsmen” panel, Bennett cried when discussing the importance of the trilogy, which he co-wrote and produced, featuring a gay wedding for the first time for Hallmark. He thanked Hallmark, then later asked everyone who is part of the Hallmark family in the audience to stand up (many executives were on board). He continued to ask — and it took a few minutes for people to stand up — proving that every person on board was part of the Hallmark family, reminding the crowd that they were the reason for the event. In another instance, nearly 2,000 fans gathered on the top deck to sing, without music, “Silent Night,” in front of the Christmas tree while the actors swayed together on stage. Actors weren’t involved in all activities, but events were planned to keep guests having fun: ornament and cookie decorating, Christmas carol-oke, gift exchanges and Christmas card writing with some of the Hallmark artists. One of the most entertaining guests on board was Julie Sherman Wolfe, who has written two dozen Hallmark movies, including two this year — “Hanukkah on the Rocks” and the highly anticipated “Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story.” Not only was she part of the “Holiday Touchdown” panel with the cast — sharing tidbits about working with Donna Kelce at Arrowhead Stadium — but she also wrote multiple scenarios to be acted out on stage throughout the week. Following the pajama party, the talent headed to a private location where they gathered around for a script reading of “‘Twas the Scene Before Christmas,” a script Wolfe penned that followed a chaotic family at Christmas with the actors playing wacky characters. Throughout the “table read,” the actors shared ideas of their own, tweaked certain lines, and perfected what turned into magic on stage the following day. The audience was able to get involved a bit, too, as Hynes portrayed an over-the-top influencer who ended up teaching his friends and family (and fans) a viral dance — the one memorably performed in “Three Wise Men and a Baby.” Another very fun (especially to watch) event was Cocktail Tastings. Kristopher Polaha and Ashley Williams hosted the first installment, while Polaha and Brooke D’Orsay hosted the second. The event was held inside the 372-seat Spinnaker Lounge and featured audience members asking talent questions… while everyone drank a lot of alcohol. Upon entering the theater, guests were given a placemat with five circles on it, for five different cocktails. On stage, D’Orsay and Polaha were joined by a mixologist, who broke down what each drink was and instructed the audience when to move on to the next. In hindsight, consuming five cocktails with five different types of alcohol probably wasn’t the smartest, since the actors then had to head to another event. (I tasted each one, but knew better than to drink five drinks in under an hour.) On the final night of the cruise, the second cocktail tasting took place before the Christmas Ball, which D’Orsay was set to open with a waltz with Will Kemp. She did it — somehow, still making it look flawless — but did have to remove her shoes first, laughing and telling the crowd she’d had a few drinks. Will Kemp and Brooke D’Orsay Eli Johnson After changing out of their gowns, many of the actors wanted to keep celebrating with the fans, heading down to the silent disco. Polaha, D’Orsay, Kemp, Ashley Williams, Brendan Penny, B.J. Britt and Hunter King headed to the Spinnaker Lounge. They started in the VIP area, but quickly moved onto the dance floor with headphones, ready to dance. In fact, a group of us were still there when the lights were turned on. A mere eight hours later, it was time to disembark. Although many were running on zero sleep, the fans were still buzzing with excitement as they lugged their bags off board. In the Facebook group dedicated to cruisers only, hundreds of comments flooded the page about how, despite a few kinks, this felt like the perfect way to kick off the holiday season. With a second sold-out sail kicking off just 12 days later, fans are now just waiting for news about a 2025 cruise… and crossing their fingers they will be one of the lucky few to snag a ticket before it sells out. Talk about a Christmas wish come true.",

Tyler Hynes, for example, joined fans for a Boot Shot — a tradition he’s shared with fans via social media — taking a shot out of a boot-shaped Christmas ornament.\n\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg\" data-lazy-src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px\" height=\"667\" width=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EliJohnson_HALL1_2024_Gem-420.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\"/\u003e\n\t\n\t\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cfigcaption\u003e\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003eBrooke D’Orsay, Rachel Boston, Brendan Penny, Ashley Williams, Will Kemp, Kristoffer Polaha, Tyler Hynes\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tThe large nighttime events were held at the main pool, which was covered by a stage for the duration of the cruise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tThe evenings were broken up into a tree lighting “sail-ebration,” a pajama party, an Ugly Christmas Sweater contest and a Christmas ball.

During “The Groomsmen” panel, Bennett cried when discussing the importance of the trilogy, which he co-wrote and produced, featuring a gay wedding for the first time for Hallmark. He thanked Hallmark, then later asked everyone who is part of the Hallmark family in the audience to stand up (many executives were on board). He continued to ask — and it took a few minutes for people to stand up — proving that every person on board was part of the Hallmark family, reminding the crowd that they were the reason for the event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tIn another instance, nearly 2,000 fans gathered on the top deck to sing, without music, “Silent Night,” in front of the Christmas tree while the actors swayed together on stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tActors weren’t involved in all activities, but events were planned to keep guests having fun: ornament and cookie decorating, Christmas carol-oke, gift exchanges and Christmas card writing with some of the Hallmark artists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tOne of the most entertaining guests on board was Julie Sherman Wolfe, who has written two dozen \u003ca href=\"https://variety.com/lists/hallmark-countdown-to-christmas-2024-movies-schedule/\"\u003eHallmark movies, including two this year\u003c/a\u003e — “Hanukkah on the Rocks” and the highly anticipated “Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story.” Not only was she part of the “Holiday Touchdown” panel with the cast — sharing tidbits about working with Donna Kelce at Arrowhead Stadium — but she also wrote multiple scenarios to be acted out on stage throughout the week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tFollowing the pajama party, the talent headed to a private location where they gathered around for a script reading of “‘Twas the Scene Before Christmas,” a script Wolfe penned that followed a chaotic family at Christmas with the actors playing wacky characters. Throughout the “table read,” the actors shared ideas of their own, tweaked certain lines, and perfected what turned into magic on stage the following day. The audience was able to get involved a bit, too, as Hynes portrayed an over-the-top influencer who ended up teaching his friends and family (and fans) a viral dance — the one memorably performed in “Three Wise Men and a Baby.”\n\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hallmark-Cruise-Drinks-1.jpg\" data-lazy-src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hallmark-Cruise-Drinks-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hallmark-Cruise-Drinks-1.jpg 750w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hallmark-Cruise-Drinks-1.jpg?resize=138,150 138w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hallmark-Cruise-Drinks-1.jpg?resize=276,300 276w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px\" height=\"814\" width=\"750\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hallmark-Cruise-Drinks-1.jpg 750w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hallmark-Cruise-Drinks-1.jpg?resize=138,150 138w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hallmark-Cruise-Drinks-1.jpg?resize=276,300 276w\"/\u003e\n\t\n\t\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cfigcaption\u003e\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tAnother very fun (especially to watch) event was Cocktail Tastings.

On stage, D’Orsay and Polaha were joined by a mixologist, who broke down what each drink was and instructed the audience when to move on to the next. In hindsight, consuming five cocktails with five different types of alcohol probably wasn’t the smartest, since the actors then had to head to another event. (I tasted each one, but knew better than to drink five drinks in under an hour.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tOn the final night of the cruise, the second cocktail tasting took place before the Christmas Ball, which D’Orsay was set to open with a waltz with Will Kemp.
