  "text": "How do you follow up the epic 40th season of MTV’s “The Challenge“? Bring back one of the most popular themes for “The Challenge: All Stars.” That’s exactly what the series will do when Season 5 debuts on Wednesday, Jan. 29. Plus, it’s moving back to the original home of “The Challenge,” MTV. (It previously streamed on Paramount+.) “It was a long, long, long walk down memory lane and then talking to everybody to see what’s been happening since other seasons,” showrunner Emer Harkin tells Variety of Season 5, which features 13 teams of two. “It was really about authentic rivalries and a real and meaningful entry point. It’s such a fan favorite season so we just want to do it justice.” The “Rivals” theme first debuted in 2011, with “Rivals II” airing in 2013, followed by the third in 2016. This time around, some players are teamed up with new rivals (full team list here!) — like Steve Meinke and Adam Larson, who had a falling out on “All Stars” Season 4 — while others are paired with decade-long opponents, like Veronica Portillo and Katie Doyle, who came to blows on 2004’s “The Inferno.” And then there’s exes Ashley Kelsey and Dario Medrano, who were once in love… and haven’t spoken in years. Popular on Variety Below, Harkin breaks down the casting process for “Rivals,” the move from Paramount+ to MTV, bringing back Ashley Mitchell and Turbo Çamkıran and more. “Rivals” has been a favorite theme since it debuted. How did you decide to bring it back for “All Stars” rather than the flagship? Emer Harkin: We’ve all been dying to do “Rivals” for so long. We’ve been waiting for the most opportune moment. With “Challenge 40” being such a huge season and the fact that we were expanding our casting in 40 to include so many all stars, we really felt like this was the opportune moment to further set “All Stars” apart, and bring back one of the most beloved formats of all time. At what stage did you decide to move from Paramount+ to MTV? Harkin: I can’t speak directly for the network, in terms of timing but we’re delighted about it. It’s great news. There’s such a loyal fandom dedicated to “The Challenge.” So moving to MTV just pays homage to the franchise’s legacy on the iconic network where it all began. Understood. There have been so many rivalries through the years; how did you go about choosing these pairs? Harkin: We went through every relationship, all the nuances, all the ups, the downs, the highs and lows, for virtually every cast member across the entire franchise. It’s an enormous undertaking. We really wanted to focus on authentic rivalries: What’s real? What’s current? What’s long-standing, but there’s still bad blood? It was a long, long, long walk down memory lane and then talking to everybody to see what’s been happening since other seasons. It was really about authentic rivalries and a real and meaningful entry point. Again, it’s such a fan-favorite season so we just want to do it justice. The Challenge: All Stars Season 5 Jonne Roriz Do you look at players you want back first, then who their rivals are? Or look right at pairs? Harkin: It’s absolutely the pairings. It’s about the dual relationship. You can’t have one without the other. So it was just absolutely about looking at those duos and what felt varied, what felt new, what felt fresh, and beef that the fans may not know about — some of the more hidden rivalries that are lurking behind closed doors. Then there are some that have played out on social media or hit our screens 20 years ago. So many good options! OK, let’s get into this cast. During “The Challenge 40” reunion, it was brought up that Ashley Mitchell should have been there. Why bring her back for “All Stars” but not for 40? Harkin: I can’t speak to 40 because I was not involved in the casting process for 40, but what I can say is that this was such an amazing moment to bring Ashley back. We were just so thrilled. I’m so excited to see her back. I love Ashley, and it felt like a great time to bring her back in a really authentic, only Ashley way and I’m thrilled. I’m so stoked that I had the privilege of getting her. The fans of “The Challenge” are very opinionated — myself included! — about casting. Not everyone is thrilled that Turbo Çamkıran was brought back after his past behavior. What kind of conversations did you have about bringing him back? Harkin: A lot of our cast have ups and downs. Some people may have a checkered past. Some people make mistakes. For us, there are conversations about everyone. We are in constant conversations with cast about their growth and moving forward and their evolution, the work that they do on themselves — both during the show and after the show. That’s something that we’re cognizant of and that’s something that is definitely a component in casting. You’ve worked on this franchise for many years. Do you watch the cast members compete on other shows, like “The Traitors?” Do you think it’s good promotion for “The Challenge?” Harkin: I do, and I’m so proud of them! It’s so awesome. To see CT [Tamburello], Trishelle [Cannatella], Johnny Bananas and now Wes [Bergmann], I’m just so proud of our cast and that they get to shine across platforms, and that everybody gets to see that we really do have the cream of the crop. I’m so proud of them, and I think it’s awesome. Alright, I know this is hard but who were you most excited to get back this season? Harkin: Oh, God, that is really hard. Melissa [Reeves] and Nicole Zanatta we knew were going to be explosive, so I was just ready for the fireworks. The Nany [Gonzalez] and Turbo rivalry is so palpable. When you’re in a room with them, it’s so real and so raw. Watching that was emotional and so compelling. Let me go through more. Veronica and Katie? I mean, come on. They’re TV gold. There’s also Ashley K. and Dario! That was one of the most significant relationships of their life, and they had never seen each other. It’s real! …There was such a range of rivalries, and we’re really, really proud of that. The flavors of rivalries that we were able to showcase are super fun.
