  "text": "In today’s newsletter: New-model studio supports creator economy’s feature ambitions  Future Adventures saw a multi-platform creator in this author, podcaster, and Sundance winner Others will move into this space, but will the creator economy share the wealth? When Further Adventures co-founder Steve Beckman joins our Zoom, his camera’s off. He’s deep in West Virginia, scouting creators who live — and power their channel — completely off the grid. “They started making YouTube videos as a way of keeping in touch with their family,” Beckman said. “And then all of a sudden other people started watching. They became filmmakers.” That’s exactly the kind of origin story Further Adventures wants to scale. Beckman, a former YouTube exec, launched the studio with longtime Black Bear Pictures producer Ben Stillman. Right now, it’s just the two of them — no bloated staff, no legacy overhead, just a belief that creator-first storytelling can go bigger. (They’re mum on the studio’s investors.)They want to partner with creators who, with support, could become the next MrBeast or Dude Perfect. That goes for indie filmmakers as well. Future Adventures believes YouTube masters, Sundance breakouts, and investments in internet phenoms like golf disruptors Good Good Golf can be part of the same storytelling ecosystem. One project, “Greener Grass Awaits,” is a horror-golf video game that’s becoming a horror-golf movie. Horror, golf, and a rabid online fanbase: the unholy triumvirate. Letting Audience Set the Stage “We’ve seen such a changing landscape with more talented people and more creators than ever, with more limited opportunities than when we started 15 years ago,” said Stillman. “People who have unique perspectives but don’t have the infrastructure, don’t have the resources, don’t have necessarily a lot of companies at the moment to jump in and be that for them.” In other words: Further wants to close the widening gap between creative talent and opportunity … for creators with an audience or the potential to build one. That includes the off-grid West Virginians (no name yet, the deal’s not done) and Andrew Rea of Babish Culinary Universe, which has 10M+ YouTube subscribers. Andrew Rea on Netflix’s ‘The Chef Show’ with Roy Choi and Jon FavreauCourtesy Everett Collection That said: It’s worth noting that, for now, they’re not participating in Rea’s food-based IP. They’re developing his metaphysical action-thriller, “Old Soul.” However, Further wants its development to lean into his massive fanbase by starting as a digital short. They’re also backing “If I Go Will They Miss Me” from Walter Thompson-Hernández, based on his 2022 Sundance Grand Jury Prize-winning short. On paper, he is the definition of a Sundance ascendant: Before making his short, he got a Masters at Stanford, did PhD studies at UCLA, was a multimedia journalist at the New York Times, created NPR One podcast “California Love,” and wrote “The Compton Cowboys.”  All that, and Thompson-Hernández struggled to finance his feature adaptation. Investing in the IP Value of Creators  “Ben was very important for finalizing the financing,” he said. “There was a wave of support for filmmakers of color beginning in the early 2020s. Because we made it at the sort of tail end of this wave, I think it was tougher.” The production shot in Los Angeles this spring with a budget of around $1 million. He hopes it can premiere at Park City’s final Sundance. Thompson-Hernández is not a digital juggernaut (his IG following hovers around 68k), but he fits the Further mold: multi-platform storytelling, festival credibility, and a POV that’s sharp enough to cut through. His most recent project, “Kites,” just won the Viewpoints Award at Tribeca. Further Adventures is making a smart bet as a lean studio built to meet creators where they are. They’re treating online audiences and festival buzz as equally valid launchpads. And while their “creator-first” model feels fresh, it won’t stay that way for long. Agencies may have repped digital stars for years, but let’s be honest: It wasn’t that long ago those same creators were stuck at the kids’ table. Now even your mom knows who they are. And frankly? While Further’s current slate leans feature-heavy, the real winners of this arms race will be the ones who look past film and TV. That’s hard to pull off: Creator-first means creator-power and they’re not looking to hand that over. “There are a lot of reps who have really talented clients who have something that’s really working on YouTube or TikTok and they’re trying to figure out, ‘How does that IP that works there apply to the traditional space, and how can that audience that exists in that platform come to a feature film or a traditional series?’” Stillman said. “I think part of it is focused companies that want to be able to do both, like ours.” See you next week,  Dana 📩 Want more? Subscribe and check the “In Development” box. ✉️ Have an idea, compliment, or complaint? dana@indiewire.com;  (323) 435-7690. FUTURE OF FILMMAKING🔥 TOP 5 🔥 Weekly recommendations for your career mindset, curated by IndieWire Associate Editor Harrison Richlin 5. The machine cinema times — June 20, 2025 by Machine Cinema GenAI is here and it’s here to stay. How do creators learn to work with it rather than be replaced by it? Start by visiting the Machine Cinema substack and checking out last week’s update, which includes summaries of the latest advancements and where the tech still needs work. 4. Celery juice, raving…and the collapse of the free world by Jennifer Esposito At her A Rebellious Life substack, actress Jen Esposito addresses the realities of being an artist today, while also offering a dose of inspiration for those under the weight of dark times. In her latest piece, she breaks down the benefits of seeking joy and how its driven her work with Rebel Collective, which offers mentorships and classes. 3. If big tech companies change their strategies, how does that affect TV producers? by Jen Topping Writing for her Business of TV substack, Topping deep dives into the seismic shifts occurring in tech and its possible effect on entertainment. For instance, should the Google antitrust case lead to the company being broken up, it may lead Apple to pull back on some of their programming ambitions due to their financial ties. 2. The accidental gatekeeper by Enrico Banson In the process of “saving cinema,” Banson argues in his Director’s Notes substack that those deciding what’s worth rescuing aren’t acting with everyone’s best interests in mind. Even at the recent Cinequest Festival, Banson found underrepresented voices weren’t getting as much of an opportunity to showcase themselves as established filmmakers were. 1. 12 things Hollywood can do to thwart ICE by Dan Mirvish It is now undeniable that we currently live under the tyranny of fascism, but the resistance brought to light by the recent Los Angeles and subsequent nationwide No Kings protests is a hopeful reminder of the people’s power. That energy must be sustained though and in his Hollytics/Pollywood substack, filmmaker, author, and educator Dan Mirvish offers a bounty of ways to stay active.",

They’re treating online audiences and festival buzz as equally valid launchpads. And while their “creator-first” model feels fresh, it won’t stay that way for long. Agencies may have repped digital stars for years, but let’s be honest: It wasn’t that long ago those same creators were stuck at the kids’ table. Now even your mom knows who they are.\u003cbr/\u003e \u003cbr/\u003eAnd frankly?

something that’s really working on YouTube or TikTok and they’re trying to figure out, ‘How does that IP that works there apply to the traditional space, and how can that audience that exists in that
