  "text": "Kendrick Lamar‘s “GNX” — a November release — has notched a third non-consecutive week as the No. 1 album in the United States. Results for the Billboard 200 arrived well over 24 hours behind schedule, likely due to an unusually close finish between the top three albums: Lamar’s “GNX” landed back at No. 1 with a total of 90,500 units (per Luminate), followed by Drake and PartyNextDoor’s “$ome $exy $ongs 4 U” with 90,000 units, and Tate McRae’s “So Close To What” tallied 87,000 units. “$ome $exy $ongs 4 U” entered at No. 1 in February as Drake’s 14th chart-topping LP and PartyNextDoor’s first. It knocked out Lamar’s “GNX” out of the summit, and was later replaced by McRae’s “So Close To What,” which debuted with the biggest opening numbers for a woman artist this year. Popular on Variety “GNX” continues to have a strong presence on streaming, logging 103 million streams this week, and in sales, as 16,500 of its 95,000 total units are credited to physical and digital sales. The only new release in the Top 10 this week comes from Blackpink member Lisa, whose first full-length studio effort, “Alter Ego,” enters at No. 7 with 45,500 units earned. It is the top-selling album this week with 28,000 units sold. It made a smaller splash on streaming, logging an estimated 23 million streams in its first full week. The set included guest verses from Future, Megan Thee Stallion, Tyla and Rosalía, as well as Raye and Doja Cat. Lisa also performed alongside Raye and Doja Cat at the Academy Awards in a musical tribute to the music of the James Bond film series.",
