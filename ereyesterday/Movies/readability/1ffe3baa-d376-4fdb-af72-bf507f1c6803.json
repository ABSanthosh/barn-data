  "text": "Korean sales banner Finecut has locked in a string of international deals for “A Girl With Closed Eyes,” a psychological thriller starring breakout “Pachinko” actor Kim Minha, ahead of its European Film Market (EFM) premiere in Berlin. The feature debut from director Chun Sunyoung has been acquired by Red Castle Group for CIS territories, The Klockworx for Japan, Media4Fun for Poland, Cola Films for Taiwan and Aeonbeta for Vietnam. The thriller follows a detective investigating a bestselling author’s murder who discovers an unexpected connection to the prime suspect. Kim stars as the suspect. The detective is portrayed by Moon Choi, known for her performances in “Deliver Us From Evil,” “Okja” and “Anarchist From Colony.” The film is presented by Solaire Partners, a venture capital firm that has backed numerous box office hits including “Parasite,” “Extreme Job,” “12.12: The Day” and “Next Sohee.” Popular on Variety Chun previously gained recognition when her short film “Good Night” was selected for Cannes Critics’ Week. After premiering at the Busan International Film Festival, “A Girl With Closed Eyes” is set to close the Florence Korea Film Festival. The Seoul-based sales agent is also handling Hong Sangsoo’s latest competition title “What Does That Nature Say to You” – the auteur’s 12th Berlin selection following his Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize win at last year’s festival. At EFM, Finecut will unveil first footage from revenge thriller “Tristes Tropiques,” the new film from action-noir specialist Park Hoon-jung (“New World,” “The Witch” franchise). The star-studded international cast includes Park Hae-soo (“Squid Game”), Kim Myung-min (“Your Honor”), Lee Sin-young (“Crash Landing on You”), Park Yu-rim (“Drive My Car”), and Taiwanese stars Austin Lin (“Marry My Dead Body”), Chen Yi-Wen (“The Pig, The Snake, and The Pigeon”) and Wang Po-Chieh (“Eye of the Storm”). The company’s Berlin slate also features K-pop idol D.O.’s musical drama “Secret: Untold Melody,” the festival-lauded animated feature “Exorcism Chronicles: The Beginning,” and horror-thriller “Noise.”",
