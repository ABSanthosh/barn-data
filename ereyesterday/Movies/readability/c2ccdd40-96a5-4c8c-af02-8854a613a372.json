  "text": "What was that? Anitta and the Weeknd‘s new single “São Paulo” arrived Wednesday afternoon alongside an unsettling video featuring the Brazilian pop star with a pregnant belly that sings. The odd visualizer comes just in time for Halloween and depicts Anitta in distress as she walks around New York in lingerie. Surrounded by flashing lights, the camera zooms in on her large stomach, showing the moment it grows lips to croon the Weeknd’s lyrics. The video was directed by experimental artist Freeka Tet, and the FX were constructed by Manny Lemus. Earlier this week, Anitta posted a photo of her in a hotel room wearing the same wardrobe and belly we seen in the video. “It was meant to be kept a secret…,” Anitta captioned the post. The Weeknd responded with “Omg… Congrats [crying laughing emoji],” and also re-posted the photo and wrote, “@Anitta you hid it so well in São Paulo.” The pair previously debuted the upbeat single during the Weeknd’s “One Night Only” concert in Brazil in September. “São Paulo” will make up part of the Weeknd’s upcoming “Hurry Up Tomorrow” album, according to Billboard Brasil. Popular on Variety “We knew [the song ‘São Paulo’] was too special to just play on stage,” he told the publication. “We saw great potential in the song and found the beat, which is the heart of the show.” Anitta was quoted saying of the song, “I wrote some verses as a joke and never imagined they would become serious. Suddenly, I received the finished song. I loved it! I felt very honored and flattered.” Watch the video below.",
