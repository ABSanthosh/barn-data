After she hit the red carpet showing off a big rock, netizens wondered if the EGOT nominee had gotten engaged to her partner, fellow actress Lena Waithe. Here’s everything we know about whether Cynthia Erivo wore an engagement ring at the 2025 Grammys. Did Cynthia Erivo wear an engagement ring at 2025 Grammys? A source close to Cynthia Erivo has confirmed that the singer and actress was not wearing an engagement ring at the 2025 Grammy Awards. The Wicked star first sparked engagement rumors when she sported a dazzling stone on her left hand on the Grammy red carpet. Fans were quick to conclude that she might be announcing her engagement to longtime girlfriend Lena Waithe. However, an insider source soon dismissed this assumption. They confirmed exclusively to PEOPLE that it was just a regular ring. In fact, the source also revealed that designers loaned all of Erivo’s jewelry that night, except for one ring. Since Erivo often dons extravagant manicures, she strategically placed the rings to highlight her nails. Her celestial look, completed with a custom Louis Vuitton dress and intricate accessories, took a whopping five hours to complete. The vocalist later hit the Grammys stage with jazz icon Herbie Hancock, captivating the audience with their powerful performance. The duo delivered a heartfelt tribute to the late industry legend Quincy Jones, who passed away in 2024, leaving an undeniable legacy in the music world. Erivo and her partner, Lena Waithe, reportedly started dating in 2019, but they have never officially confirmed their relationship. They actively keep their personal lives private, rarely addressing speculation. However, they drew attention when they began attending several public events together, sharing moments that sparked curiosity among fans, prompting speculation that they are indeed a couple.",
