  "text": "Posted in: Disney, Movies | Tagged: Lilo \u0026 StitchDisney released a new behind-the-scenes featurette for Lilo \u0026 Stitch, which spotlights...working with Stitch? Plus three new images.Article Summary Disney unveils a meta behind-the-scenes featurette for the live-action Lilo \u0026 Stitch film. The new featurette spotlights the experience of working with the character Stitch on set. Maia Kealoha, who plays Lilo, is featured alongside the film's playful promotional approach. Three high-quality images debut alongside the featurette, teasing more from the anticipated remake. To the surprise of exactly no one, the marketing for¬†Lilo \u0026 Stitch is extremely meta because if there was a film where Disney gets the opportunity to lean in, it's this one. It's fun, though, and it makes for something different from all of the other featurettes and whatnot that we've seen from films. We've known since the Super Bowl that this was going to be the angle Disney went with, and it's carrying over into the featurettes. They released a new one which focuses on \"working with Stitch,\" but it's also a spotlight on¬†Maia Kealoha¬†as Lilo. We also got three new high-quality images. I swear to god if you people are mean to her, I'm throwing every single one of you directly into a dumpster where you belong. Lilo \u0026 Stitch: Summary, Cast List, Release Date Lilo \u0026 Stitch¬†is the wildly funny and touching story of a lonely Hawaiian girl and the fugitive alien who helps to mend her broken family. The film is directed by award-winning filmmaker Dean Fleischer Camp, with a screenplay by Chris Kekaniokalani Bright and Mike Van Waes, and stars Sydney Elizebeth Agudong, Billy Magnussen, Tia Carrere, Hannah Waddingham, Chris Sanders, with Courtney B. Vance, and Zach Galifianakis, and introducing Maia Kealoha.¬†Lilo \u0026 Stitch¬†is produced by¬†Jonathan Eirich, p.g.a., and¬†Dan Lin, with¬†Tom Peitzman,¬†Ryan Halprin,¬†Louie Provost, and¬†Thomas Schumacher serving as executive producers, and will be released in theaters on May 23, 2025.
