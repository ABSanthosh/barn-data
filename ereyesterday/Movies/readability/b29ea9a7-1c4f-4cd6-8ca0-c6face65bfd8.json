Disney has unveiled the main official trailer for Freakier Friday, another long-awaited legacy sequel out in theaters soon. This is a follow-up to the hit comedy classic Freaky Friday from 2003, now 22 years later they're picking up where things left off with mother and daughter. This summer is about to get Freakier.

As they navigate the challenges that come when two families merge, Tess and Anna discover that lightning might strike twice. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan return as Tess and Anna once again, along with Mark Harmon, Chad Michael Murray, Ryan Malgarini, Christina Vidal Mitchell, Haley Hudson, Stephen Tobolowsky, Lucille Soong, Rosalind Chao back in their respective roles from the original. With Julia Butters, Manny Jacinto, Vanessa Bayer, and Sophia Hammons joining in this cast. The big twist in this new one is it's now a four-way body swap between the other grandkids, too? This looks ridiculous, and not in a good way - [â€¦]",
