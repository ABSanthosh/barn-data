  "description": "\"Get the hell off this island.\" And stay the hell away from this really, really bad dinosaur movie. The Asylum has revealed an official trailer for their next offering titled Jurassic Reborn, a boring riff on the upcoming Jurassic World: Rebirth movie this summer. Even after all these years later, The Asylum still loves to mock and make fun of all the Hollywood movies by making this knock-off B-movie crap. Someone is still paying to watch this! When cutting-edge research leads to the creation of living dinosaurs, a team of scientists on a secluded island must risk their lives to prevent the rapidly growing creatures from escaping \u0026 then attacking the mainland. Huh, this plot sounds familiar! But that's the point, obviously. Jurassic Reborn stars Daniel Baldwin, Danielle Titus, Esmeree Sterling, Bryan Scamman, and William Castrogiovanni. VFX have improved so much over the years they can put very cheap dinosaur VFX in this and they still don't look as bad as they used to in films. The rest of this looks as terrible as expected from The Asylum - so have fun. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Marcel Walz's B-movie Jurassic Reborn, from YouTube: When cutting-edge research leads [â€¦]",
