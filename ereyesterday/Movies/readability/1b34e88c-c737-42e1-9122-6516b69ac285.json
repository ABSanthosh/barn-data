The actor is promoting his latest film, Magazine Dreams, and said if Marvel called him to reprise his role in the MCU, he would accept. “Yeah, of course I say yes. Disney, Marvel Studios, I love them,” Majors told USA Today. “Tom Hiddleston, loved working with that guy. Loved working with Paul Rudd. Loved working with Gugu Mbatha-Raw. I love the industry so much, and now I’m in the place where I can feel the love from them and actually express my love for them.” Majors was dropped by Marvel after he was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of reckless assault and harassment. The actor was sentenced to probation. Watch on Deadline The actor played Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantimania and was reportedly set to reprise his role in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. However, following the accusations and subsequent conviction, Marvel distanced themselves from the character. Instead, Marvel re-titled the following Avengers films to Avengers: Doomsday and focused on Doctor Doom, set to be played by Robert Downey Jr. RELATED: Jonathan Majors “Heartbroken” Over Marvel Casting Robert Downey Jr. For ‘Avengers’ \u0026 Moving Away From Kang In a separate interview with Entertainment Weekly, Majors was again asked if he would return to Marvel and if he would reprise his Creed III role as Damian “Diamond Dame” Anderson. “Yes. Yes, to both,” he said. “The version of me that would come back to those places, though, would be different. I don’t think anything different would happen between ‘action’ and ‘cut.’ That’s why I got the job. But there would be something different about it if I were to come back, and I would like that. But as I said, it’s not in my control.” Majors’ Creed III co-star, Michael B. Jordan, recently said he would want to work with him again.",
