  "text": "Posted in: 20th Century Studios, Movies, Trailer | Tagged: 20th century studios, Predator: BadlandsThe new, fantastic trailer for Predator: Badlands was released this afternoon. The latest chapter will release in theaters on November 7.Article Summary The full trailer for Predator: Badlands just dropped, teasing a bold new direction for the franchise. Director Dan Trachtenberg returns, expanding Predator mythology with a story from the Yautja's perspective. Meet Dek, the \"runt\" Yautja hero, promising a Predator tale unlike any seen before on the big screen. 2025 is packed with Predator content, including comics, animation, and the highly anticipated Badlands film. Predator is arguably more popular than it has ever been, and 2025 has seen multiple projects thrill fans. We got the animated film Killer of Killers on Hulu, multiple Marvel Comics series with the ultimate hunter taking on some of our favorite characters, and we wrap it up with this fall's theatrical film, Badlands, again directed by Dan Trachtenberg. He pumped all this energy into the franchise with Prey in 2022, and with this film, he will continue to expand the mythology in ways we never would have expected. He even recently teased what is to come in that regard. Today, a new full trailer was released, along with an awesome new poster for the film. Predator As We Have Never Seen It Before On the Big Screen The \"hero\" of Badlands is a Yautja named Dek, described by the director as \"the runt of the litter\". \"He's a thing of few words, pretty blunt,\" Trachtenberg teases about Dek. \"He cuts straight to the point. Literally and figuratively.\" Dek is played in the film by Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi. He also understands that asking audiences to take this leap with him in the franchise is a risk: \"That feels like a big idea, not just within Predator, but in sci-fi generally,\" he explains. \"In most sci-fi universes, the 'creatures' are either bad guys or sidekicks. In [Badlands] it's: 'What if you were with the creature on this crazy mission to prove itself, seeing everything through its eyes?'\" I am here for whatever he wants to do with the Predator franchise. Prey was one of my favorite films of 2022, and I still hope that when Badlands releases, we get a small theatrical run for it. He also teased in that interview another Predator project that he seemingly hasn't started work on. Whatever keeps him in the universe and making content, go for it, man. Predator: Badlands stars Elle Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi and opens in theaters on November 7. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!
