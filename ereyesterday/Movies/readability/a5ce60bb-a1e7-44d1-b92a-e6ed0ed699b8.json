  "description": "\"Those delinquents hot-wired a carnival ride the other night.\" Hulu has revealed an fun trailer for a holiday comedy called Nutcrackers, the newest comedy directed by David Gordon Green. He spent a long time making his Halloween trilogy, but it's good to see him back directing more lively \u0026 funny films like he used to (Pineapple Express, Your Highness, Prince Avalanche, Manglehorn). Nutcrackers premiered at TIFF a few months ago and is opening direct-to-streaming on Hulu at the end of November in time for the holiday season. DGG's Nutcrackers follows strait-laced and work obsessed Mike as he is suddenly thrust into being a caregiver for his rambunctious, orphaned nephews. In the most unlikely of places, 4 siblings find a loving shelter in an unexpected turn of circumstances. This endearing dramedy draws inspiration from actual events and deftly crafts a gripping story that unites everyone. Starring Ben Stiller, Linda Cardellini, Edi Patterson, Tim Heidecker, Toby Huss, Homer Janson, Ulysses Janson, Arlo Janson, and Atlas Janson. This looks kooky and funny, with a few amusing laughs, but it's a story we've seen so many times. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for David Gordon Green's film Nutcrackers, direct from YouTube: Hotshot Chicago […]",

This looks kooky and funny, with a few amusing laughs, but it's a story we've seen so many times. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for David Gordon Green's film Nutcrackers, direct from YouTube: Hotshot Chicago real estate developer Michael (Stiller) never had time for family. His sister once said he was incapable of love. But when Michael’s sister and her husband have a terrible accident, their house, farm, and four boys become Michael’s responsibility. He drives out to his sister’s small Ohio town thinking all he needs to do is sign some papers and get back to the city, but it’s not nearly that simple. With the parents gone, the boys are practically feral. Until the family services worker (Linda Cardellini) can find them a home, their only guardian is Uncle Mike. Before he knows it, he is chasing chickens \u0026 providing improvised \"health\" classes. Desperate to free himself from inherited fatherhood, he’s both surprised and thrilled to learn his sister trained her boys in ballet. Can that make them cute enough to foster? Via TIFF. Nutcrackers is the latest comedy directed by acclaimed American filmmaker David Gordon Green, of the films George Washington, All the Real Girls, Snow Angels, Pineapple Express, Your Highness, The Sitter, Prince Avalanche, Joe, Manglehorn, Our Brand Is Crisis, Stronger, and the trilogy Halloween + Halloween Kills + Halloween Ends previously. The screenplay is written by Leland Douglas. It's produced by Rob Paris, Mike Witherill, \u0026 Nate Meyer. This initially premiered at the 2024 Toronto Film Festival this fall. Hulu will debut DGG's Nutcrackers movie streaming on Hulu starting November 29th, 2024 this fall. Look funny? Find more posts: Streaming, To Watch, Trailer",
