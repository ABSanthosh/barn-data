  "text": "DC and HBO’s The Penguin wowed viewers last year as the sequel series to 2022’s The Batman delivered a grounded and stellar look at Oswald Cobb’s rise of power. While a second season is looking less like the sure thing people expected following its critical and commercial success, The Penguin Season 1 4K release allows fans to savor all eight episodes in incredible quality. “Starring Colin Farrell in the title role, the DC Studios drama The Penguin continues The Batman epic crime saga that filmmaker Matt Reeves began with Warner Bros. Pictures’ global blockbuster and centers on the character played by Farrell in the film,” says the official description. Beyond the stigma of comic book adaptations, The Penguin is, quite frankly, just a great crime drama. It’s really fantastic since, at its core, it is a detailed character study with a great actor giving his all, even if he’s under layers of prosthetics. Great performances from Farrell and Milioti (who plays a psychotic version of Sofia Falcone) make each and every episode stand out. While it stands as a sequel to The Batman — and it’s easy to wonder where the heck the Caped Crusader is during all of this — it isn’t dependent on it as it can stand on its own as a tightly written and rewarding drama. The Penguin 4K release also takes full advantage of being in UHD as it has a great HDR grade. Gotham looks truly stunning, as we get to see the criminal underbelly of the city, and you can really appreciate the fantastic detail that went into the makeup and prosthetics for the title character. I really enjoyed watching the show on streaming, but I have an even greater appreciation for it after seeing all eight episodes in 4K. The audio also holds its end of the bargain as the Dolby Atmos tracks really enrich the experience. There’s a good amount of bonus content in The Penguin Season 1 4K, although you might’ve seen most of it before. There are Inside Gotham featurettes for each episode that go behind the scenes (these were also released on YouTube), which are fun looks at key moments. There are also around 40 minutes of additional featurettes, which dive into everything from Sofia Falcone to its depiction of Gotham. They’re all quite fun to watch as you go along (the first disc has a trio of non-spoiler ones, while the third disc has six retrospective featurettes apart from the Inside Gotham episodes. I would’ve loved some episode commentary tracks, but there’s already a lot here, so I can’t complain. The Penguin Season 1 4K Review: Final Verdict The Penguin is my favorite superhero show made this past decade, and even if this is the only season we get, it will hold a spot in the hearts of fans for a long time. Colin Farrell’s award-winning performance is excellent, while Cristin Milioti delivers a breakout performance that could be worthy of her own spin-off down the line. As a result, The Penguin Season 1 4K is an easy recommendation for any fan of The Batman and DC. Disclosure: ComingSoon received product from the distributor for our The Penguin Season 1 4K review.",
