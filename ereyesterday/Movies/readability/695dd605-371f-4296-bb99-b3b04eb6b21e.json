  "text": "A new Super Bowl trailer for Marvel Studios’ Thunderbolts* has been released. Thunderbolts* is a new Marvel superhero movie releasing in United States theaters this coming May. Directed by Jake Schreier, it will be the final film of Phase Five of the MCU. Check out the new Super Bowl Thunderbolts* trailer below (watch more trailers and clips): What do we know about Thunderbolts*? Thunderbolts* will see antiheroes from across the MCU be forced to work with one another when they’re assembled together by the American government. The cast of the movie includes Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, David Harbour as Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian, Wyatt Russell as John Walker/U.S. Agent, Olga Kurylenko as Antonia Dreykov/Taskmaster, Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr/Ghost, Lewis Pullman as Bob, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. Geraldine Viswanathan will also appear as a character named Mel in the film, while Wendell Edward Pierce has been tapped to play an undisclosed role. Additionally, Laurence Fishburne and Rachel Weisz are also expected to reprise their respective roles as Bill Foster and Melina Vostokoff from Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) and Black Widow (2021). The script for Thunderbolts* comes from Eric Pearson, Lee Sung Jin, and Joanna Calo. Schreier’s past filmography includes 2012’s Robot \u0026 Frank and 2015’s Paper Towns, while he also directed a number of episodes of Netflix’s Beef Season 1. The reason for the asterisk in the title of the film remains unclear at this time; however, Kevin Feige has previously stated that it is there for a reason and that it will make sense after the movie has been released.  Thunderbolts* will be released in United States theaters on May 2, 2025. Prior to that, Marvel will release Captain America: Brave New World in United States theaters on February 14, 2025. Shortly after Thunderbolts*, The Fantastic Four: First Steps then arrives on July 25, 2025.",
