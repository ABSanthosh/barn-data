  "text": "Noémie Merlant‘s second directorial feature marks a reunion with one of her most iconic collaborators: Her “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” director Céline Sciamma, who co-wrote Merlant’s latest film “The Balconettes.” Merlant once again transforms onscreen in the role of C-list actress Élise, who has recently been cast as Marilyn Monroe in a TV movie. “The Balconettes” centers on a trio of roommates (one of whom is Élise) that “meddle in the lives of their neighbors from their Marseilles balcony during a sweltering heat wave, until a late-night drink spirals into a bloody confrontation,” as the logline reads. The feature co-stars Souheila Yacoub, Sanda Codreanu, and Lucas Bravo, who filmed “The Balconettes” right before Melanie Laurent’s true crime caper “Freedom.” Bravo previously told IndieWire that his turn in “The Balconettes” was a “very demanding role” as he was playing a “sociopath.” Merlant made her feature directorial debut with “Mi Ubita, Mon Amour” in 2020. “The Balconettes” premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival.  The IndieWire review deemed the feature to be a “physically uninhibited and formally unbound rape-revenge horror-comedy,” with critic David Ehrlich writing, “Noémie Merlant has never shied away from an opportunity to redefine how female bodies are depicted on film, and ‘The Portrait of a Lady on Fire’ star’s recent pivot behind the camera has only emboldened her efforts to reject the male gaze by inviting her characters to reclaim its oppressive hyper-sexualization on their own terms. For all of the gravity that Merlant reserves for her film’s treatment of rape, ‘The Balconettes’ refuses to become a po-faced #MeToo drama that defines its characters by the same kind of threats they exist to defy. On the contrary, it leans into the tonal chaos of life on earth, creating an impressively layered genre mishmash that reflects the complex reality of how women are seen in the world, and how they see themselves in return.” The film was later acquired by indie distributor The Forge in October 2024. “It’s such a joy to know that ‘The Balconettes’ is being released in the United States, the country of cinema,” Merlant said in a press statement to IndieWire. “Sharing the film there feels deeply meaningful to me, because so much of my love for storytelling was shaped by American film culture. To see this strange, fearless little movie find its audience in such a historic space for cinema is an emotional milestone. This is a film we made with our hearts and our guts: together, as a team, and in close collaboration with Céline Sciamma. It’s a love cry for creative freedom, for genre-mixing, for bold ideas and joyful chaos. But at its core, it’s a film about sisterhood, and a scream against the patriarchy: against all the forces that try to shame, silence, and control us. It’s a wild ride: violent, funny, tender, and unruly. My hope is that it makes people feel a little more free, and a little less alone.” The Forge CEO Mark Sayre praised Merlant’s singular vision for her sophomore film. “’The Balconettes’ doesn’t just play with genre, it detonates it,” Sayre said. “Noémie [Merlant] has made a film that’s as uncontainable as the women at its center: wild, funny, furious, and alive with risk. We couldn’t look away, and we didn’t want to. Releasing this movie feels less like a business decision and more like a dare. One we’re proud to take.” The Forge Head of Acquisitions Decker Sadowski, who brokered the deal, added, “We’re thrilled to bring The Balconettes to North American audiences. Noémie Merlant has delivered a bold, genre-defying debut that’s as poignant as it is funny. It’s a singular vision that reflects the kind of daring, original storytelling we’re proud to champion at The Forge.” The Forge will also be premiering Māori coming-of-age drama “We Were Dangerous” soon in addition to “The Balconettes.” The Forge will release “The Balconettes” at the IFC Center in New York City and the Landmark’s Nuart Theatre in Los Angeles in theaters Friday, August 22 through Thursday, August 28, followed by a sustained release in additional markets.
