  "text": "The Bold and the Beautiful fans were surprised to see the May 8, 2025, episode of the soap opera being preempted by CBS. Thus, the schedule of the daily soap for the week was altered. The Bold and the Beautiful episodes air on the CBS network on weekdays. It is also one of TV’s most regularly watched soaps. So, here’s everything viewers need to know regarding why the episode of B\u0026B on May 8 was preempted. Why was The Bold and the Beautiful preempted by CBS on May 8? The May 8 episode of The Bold and the Beautiful was preempted by CBS to telecast the news of the election of Cardinal Robert Prevost as the Pope. Cardinal Prevost was appointed as the new Pope on Thursday. He took up the papal name Leo XIV after being selected. Thus, CBS postponed the airing of the May 8 episode of B\u0026B to play news regarding the same. This has led to episodes of the popular daily soap being pushed one day further. Pope Leo XIV became the new head of the Catholic Church after Pope Francis passed away on April 21. While addressing the crowd after getting elected, he said, “Peace be with you. It is the peace of the risen Christ.  A peace that is unarmed and disarming, humble and persevering.  A peace that comes from God, the God who loves us all, unconditionally. We can still hear the faint yet ever courageous voice of Pope Francis as he blessed Rome, the Pope who blessed Rome, who gave his blessing to the world, the whole world, on the morning of Easter.  Allow me to extend that same blessing. God loves us, God loves you all, and evil will not prevail!  All of us are in God’s hands.” (via Vatican News) Meanwhile, the episode of B\u0026B, which was supposed to air on May 8, will now air on May 9, 2025. Moreover, the regular schedule will continue.",
