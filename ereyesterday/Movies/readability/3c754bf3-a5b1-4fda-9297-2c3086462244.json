  "description": "\"There is something going on in that valley...\" Sparke Films \u0026 Rialto Distribution have revealed a first look teaser trailer for an intense action thriller titled Primitive War, which is both a Vietnam War movie and a dinosaur movie all-in-one. Rock on!  \"This ain't no walk in the park.\" Ha ha, nice pun. This actually looks WAY bigger and better than it might seem, definitely not a B-movie being dumped in the bargain bin. Set in Vietnam in 1968. A recon unit known as Vulture Squad is sent to an isolated jungle valley to uncover the fate of a missing Green Beret platoon. They soon discover they are not alone. There are dinosaurs of all kinds hiding out in this primordial valley. And it will take all they've got for them to make it out of there. Starring Anthony Ingruber, Aaron Glenane, Tricia Helfer, Nick Wechsler, Ana Thu Nguyen, and Jake Ryan. Sparke states: \"Dinosaurs in the Vietnam war? What's not to love about that concept?! When I first heard about the books, I loved the ideas and concepts Ethan brought into them.\" This might end up badass. Here's the first teaser trailer (+ poster) for Luke Sparke's movie [因",
