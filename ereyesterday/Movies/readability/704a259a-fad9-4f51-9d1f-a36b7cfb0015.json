  "text": "SPOILER ALERT: Details follow for Season 13, Episode 11 of “The Masked Singer,” “Soundtrack of My Life Night,” which aired April 23 on Fox. Well, I’ll be. Edwin McCain, the singer/songwriter behind the 1990s hit song “I’ll Be,” was the latest celebrity to be revealed on Season 13 of Fox’s “The Masked Singer.” On the show’s Wednesday episode, Lawrence was unmasked as Nessy after performing “Million Reasons,” by Lady Gaga. “Honestly, I’ve done so many different things in my career, like we’ve landed on an aircraft carrier off the coast of Korea and played for the sailors on board,” he told Variety of why he did the show. “We’ve been to Djibouti, Africa and Bahrain, and we’ve played every state in the US, except for Alaska. If life be an adventure, this certainly falls in that category. I was like, of course, I’ll do that.” Popular on Variety Of course, the biggest challenge was moving around in that Nessy costume. “It was about 10,000 degrees in there, but they gave me a vest that had ice packs all over it, which made it made it doable,” he said. “All the staff, all the costumers, and everybody that will work on the on the program were absolute aces. It was way more comfortable than playing a festival gig in Alabama in August.” Most of the songs he performed, like *NSYNC’s “Tearin’ Up My Heart,” were new to him. But maybe he’ll now add them to his setlist on tour. “I might sing that Lady Gaga song,” he said. “That’s a really great song.” For Nessy, Robin Thicke got it right with Edwin McCain. Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg guessed Johnny Rzeznik from Goo Goo Dolls. Rita Ora named Dave Matthews. Ken Jeong went with John Popper from Blues Traveler. “I didn’t figure Robin would know anything about me, honestly,” McCain said. “To be fair. he is a student of music, so he does know. And obviously, being in the position he’s in, he’s heard a lot of stuff over the years. I was trying to sing each song sort of specific to however the song would be best served. So it was different every time. So, yeah, it was pretty impressive he got it, he figured it out.” McCain recently released the new album “Lucky,” his 11th solo release and first collection of new music since 2011. He’ll hit the road in August and September, joining Train on a U.S. tour. Beyond music, McCain’s credits include the Animal Planet series “Flippin’ Ships” and the SiriusXM radio show “Inside Music with Edwin McCain.” Edwin McCain as Nessy joins Matthew Lawrence as Paparazzo, Erika Jayne as Yorkie, Method Man as Stud Muffin, Candace Cameron Bure as Cherry Blossom, James Van Der Beek as Griffin, Flavor Flav as Space Ranger, Sheana Shay as Bat, Aubrey O’Day as Ant, Oscar de la Hoya as Fuzzy Peas and Cedric the Entertainer as Honey Pot as the celebrities unmasked on “The Masked Singer” Season 13. “Soundtrack of My Life Night” brought together the final five contestants standing: Group A’s Coral, Group B’s Pearl and Boogie Woogie and Group C’s Mad Scientist Monster and Nessy. The episode opened with the group singing “More Than a Feeling,” by Boston. Back for Season 13 are host Nick Cannon, alongside panelists Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, Rita Ora and Robin Thicke. Ora was at the desk for a third consecutive season to fill in for Nicole Scherzinger. New this season, a mysterious masked character dubbed “Detective Lucky Duck” will appear throughout the season to give clues and help the panelists “quack” the case of who’s under the masks. At the start of this week’s episode, he said he uncovered something “explosive” about one of the masks. “Turns out, they’ve stolen something very valuable from you, Robin.” Also new: The “Crack the Case” clue cases, in which more clues are shared about the eliminated contestant. For Nessy, the clue was a Celtic knot. “It symbolizes internal love, which is something that heavily influenced my career.” Meanwhile, back is the Golden Ear trophy is back in play for the panelists (whomever has the most correct guesses this season will win). “The Masked Singer” Season 13 themed episodes include a tribute to franchises “Shrek” and “Ghostbusters,” as well as the Grand Ole Opry as it hits its 100th anniversary. Also on tap are a tribute to the Rat Pack and themes such as “Voices of Olympus: Unmasking of the Gods,” “Carnival,” “Boy Bands,” “Decades,” “Lucky 6,” a “Clash of the Masks” and the return of “Soundtrack of My Life.” Masked contestants in Season 13 include Honey Pot, Space Ranger, Cherry Blossom, Coral, Fuzzy Peas, Ant, Paparazzo, Griffin, Boogie Woogie, Pearl, Bat, Yorkie, Stud Muffin, Nessy and Mad Scientist Monster. Here were the performances on Wednesday’s Episode 11, “Soundtrack of My Life Night”: Coral, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Coral Song: “Sk8er Boi,” by Avril Lavigne Panel guesses: Hilary Duff, Ashley Tisdale, Nina Dobrev Who also influenced your life: Definitely my parents, they have been there for me through the great times and the difficult times, and I truly would be nowhere without them.” Coral voiceover: “I mean, the soundtrack to my life is Avril all the way, baby. So I’m here to throw it to my favorite theater boy. And he’s probably yours, too.” Friends and family “co-star and BFF” voiceover: “Coral has come so far since we first joined forces six years ago. I’ll never forget when we first met. It was during a huge audition. And we were both so nervous. We had to do a chemistry read. And part of that was us having to stand really close together and literally just staring into each other’s eyes before the scene. So awkward! But, something really special happened in that moment. We became instant BFFs. And we both got the parts that changed our lives. Together. And that same magic is happening here. I’ve never been more proud seeing her own this stage. And I can’t wait to see her rock out tonight.” Previous songs: “Mad World,” by Tears for Fears; “Accidentally in Love,” by Counting Crows; “Luck Be a Lady,” by Frank Sinatra; “Ain’t It Fun,” by Paramore Previous panel guesses: Bebe Rexha, Carly Rae Jepsen, Sabrina Carpenter, Halsey, Anna Kendrick, Dove Cameron, Hailee Steinfeld, Lili Reinhart, Victoria Justice, Rachel Zegler, Camila Mendes, Selena Gomez, Brittany Snow Nessy, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Song: “Million Reasons,” by Lady Gaga Panel guesses: John Popper, Uncle Kracker, Edwin McCain Why he did this: “I’m so glad I was wearing this mask, so you didn’t see me crying under here. There’s a million reasons I love my daughter. I did all this because either she’d think it was funny or think it was cringy, but either way I’m winning.” Nessy voiceover: “I’ve worked my tail off to get here. And there’s one little lady I have to thank for motivating me. And she’s influenced the soundtrack of my life recently.” Friends and family “Nessy’s daughter” voiceover: “I’m pretty impressed my dad has made it this far. Maybe it was all those high kicks! But sometimes he can be expert-level cringe. I mean, he’s constantly posting on socials, and have you seen his music videos? I almost died when my teacher played one in front of my whole class. And while there’s a million things he does that are eye roll, there’s also a million reasons why he’s the greatest. He makes the best milkshakes. He always helps with homework. And he even taught me how to drive a tractor. So dad, I just want to say, there’s a million reasons why I love you. Good luck out there. Just don’t break a hip, OK?” Previous songs: “Roxanne,” by The Police; “Tearin’ Up My Heart,” by *NSYNC; “Can’t Fight This Feeling,” by REO Speedwagon; “Stargazing,” by Myles Smith Previous panel guesses: Gene Simmons, Dan Reynolds, Daryl Hall, Dave Matthews, Darius Rucker, Pat Monahan, Edwin McCain, Sting Boogie Woogie, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Boogie Woogie Song: “Golden Hour,” by Jvke Panel guesses: Daniel Powter, Charlie Puth, Brandon Flowers On his song choice: “This song reminds me of my incredible, lovely, Boogie Woogie wife. Especially when we got to sing at sunset at the White House.” Boogie Woogie voiceover: “I’m so glad I made it this far, and I wouldn’t have made it here on my own. There’s one person who has helped shape the soundtrack of my life.” Friends and family “Boogie’s wife” voiceover: “I have a case of disco fever watching my hunky husband on that stage. And you can tell, he’s really having so much fun, which is my biggest hope for him. I remember how hard he took the loss of his mother. I had never seen him so low. But he channeled all of his grief into his writing. And he made some of the most inspiring hits because of it. He’s inspired my music too. And while he’d never mention it himself, I’m here to share that his work has helped so many others process their own grief, overcome illness, and some fans have even said he’s saved their lives. He’s a light for so many people. And I’m so lucky I get to stand at his glow. Boogie baby, this is your golden hour. Now go out there and get that Golden Mask trophy!” Previous songs: “I Believe In a Thing Called Love,” by the Darkness; “Radioactive,” by Imagine Dragons; “Something in the Water,” by Carrie Underwood Previous panel guesses: Adam Lambert, Andy Samberg, Mika, Criss Angel, Neil Patrick Harris, Jason Mraz, George Clooney, Ryan Tedder, Gavin DeGraw, Josh Groban Pearl, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Pearl Song: “Your Love,” by The Outfield Panel guesses: Bonnie Tyler, Winona Judd, Brandi Carlile What made you pick that anthem: “It isn’t really just about the song for me, it’s really the whole rock genre. It makes me feel strong. That one is for the Pearls.” Pearl voiceover: “I must say, the soundtrack to my life recently has been love songs. And that’s because I’ve been helping my daughter plan her dream wedding to a really good guy.” Friends and family “Pearl’s son-in-law” voiceover: “There was no scarier moment in my life than asking Pearl for her daughter’s hand in marriage. I even chickened out the first time. She’s one tough oyster to crack. And I get it, Pearl raised her daughter all by herself. She had to be two parents in one. Heck, Pearl can hitch a trailer better than anyone I know. So when she gave me her blessing, I was so relieved. That was a big win for me. And there was no one more proud dancing at our reception than Pearl. Mama Pearl, I believe you’ve got what it takes to win. And I know you miss us, but don’t worry, I’ve got things covered at home.” Previous songs: “Saving All My Love For You,” by Whitney Houston; “(Don’t Fear) The Reaper,” by Blue Oyster Cult; “Here You Come Again,” by Dolly Parton; “Conga,” by Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine Previous panel guesses: Regina King, Shania Twain, Joan Jett, Madonna, Melissa Etheridge, Sheryl Crow, Trisha Yearwood, Kellie Pickler, Carrie Underwood, Faith Hill, Jody Watley, Lisa Lisa, Pat Benatar Mad Scientist Monster, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Mad Scientist Monster Song: “The Scientist,” by Coldplay Panel guesses: Gary LeVox from Rascal Flatts, Kane Brown, Jelly Roll Why this song: “I wanted to do ‘The Scientist’ because it’s a pretty emotional and heartfelt song. Let’s be honest, which is really different than what most people know me for – a party anthem kind of guy.” Mad Scientist Monster voiceover: “The soundtrack of my life is a song that happens to be my wife’s favorite: ‘The Scientist’ by Coldplay. She loves those guys as much as she loves hearing me sing.” Friends and family “Mad Scientist’s wife” voiceover: “I’m so thrilled that my monster has made it this far. But secretly, me and the babies do miss him. He keeps us safe and sound, and that’s important to me. Because growing up, I didn’t have that. I was orphaned as a teenager. And with no family stability, I became my own parent, my own protector. When I met Mad Scientist Monster, I didn’t know how to be loved. Didn’t think I deserved it. But he was patient with me. He knew I was a little broken from my past, and wanted me to rebuild, piece by piece. So I helped him too. I was an audience of one while he worked on his first huge single. And I’ve done everything I can to support his, well our, dream. Honey, I came to life when you came into mine. Now go out there and show your talent to the world.” Previous songs: “Unwell,” by Matchbox Twenty; “I Swear,” by All-4-One; “Love Yourself,” by Justin Bieber; “There’s Nothing Holdin’ Me Back,” by Shawn Mendes Previous panel guesses: Luke Combs, Luke Bryan, Blake Shelton, Alan Jackson, Tim McGraw, Keith Urban, Brad Paisley, Billy Ray Cyrus, Kenny Chesney, Trace Adkins In Season 12, Boyz II Men (as the Buffalo) won the Masked trophy, beating out Mario, as the Wasp, who was this season’s runner-up.

And with no family stability, I became my own parent, my own protector. When I met Mad Scientist Monster, I didn’t know how to be loved. Didn’t think I deserved it. But he was patient with me. He knew I was a little broken from my past, and wanted me to rebuild, piece by piece. So I helped him too. I was an audience of one while he worked on his first huge single. And I’ve done everything I can to support his, well our, dream. Honey, I came to life when you came into mine.
