  "text": "“Nosferatu” (Focus) and “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” (Paramount), two of the biggest hits last Christmas, are both coming to their studios’ streaming platforms less than two months after their theatrical release. That is a radical decrease in the amount of normal time before home subscribers can see a hit film for no extra charge. In a week that saw four different films released no earlier than January 12 make the VOD top 10 lists, Mel Gibson’s “Flight Risk” (Lionsgate) currently is the most popular. At Netflix, the Italian-set rom-com “La Dolce Villa” capitalized on Valentine’s Day to take the #1 spot. With the absence of any same-week streaming charts for all services (Nielsen, the most comprehensive, reports with a four-week delay), IndieWire normally concentrates on top 10 charts for VOD (which usually is the first stage of home availability) and Netflix’s same-day list. But the gravity of these two announcements overshadows our normal coverage. We surveyed the average time before streaming last fall for studio wide releases, and determined it was around 120 days. This was faster than the past, but not a huge difference. Last week, we found that the average window before any home play had reduced to 32 days last year, down seven from 2023. Most of those releases initially were for PVOD, usually with a $19.99 rental price for 48 hours. It has some impact on theatrical, but the general industry sense is that even with that short period (the top 10 releases last year averaged 46 days) coexistence, if uneasy, was working. The additional revenue studios make from VOD is thought to be substantial enough to help ensure production, vital for theaters to survive. Streaming is different. Most moviegoers (including many who rarely go) subscribe to at least one movie streaming service. When “Nosferatu” goes to Peacock (Universal’s streamer) or “Sonic 3” to Paramount+, there is no extra charge, and viewing is unlimited. That’s a much bigger threat to theaters. Decreasing the gap between theater availability and streaming should boost both streamers, but many consumers are going to notice this. Disney+/Hulu and Max (for Warner Bros. films) have to be noticing this. (Sony goes to Netflix, usually with around a four month window, but that too has in some cases been less recently.) The decrease in windows overall is seen on the current VOD charts. Four films released this year — “Den of Thieves 2: Pantera” (Lionsgate) and “Wolf Man” (Universal), then new this week “Flight Risk” and “One of Them Days” (Sony) — are on the lists, all going to PVOD ($19.99 rental) between 18 and 28 days after their theatrical release. They all currently rank below holiday movies (“Sonic 3,” now at $5.99 is #1 at iTunes, which ranks by transactions, “Moana 2” at $24.99 from Disney is #1 at Fandango, calculating by revenue). “Flight Risk” is #3 at Fandango, #5 at iTunes, currently the best among them. “One of Them Days” did debut at #1 at iTunes last week, but has dropped to #6 there, while placing fourth at iTunes. “Wicked” (Universal), #2 at iTunes, seventh at Fandango, and “Pantera” are the other titles on both charts. “Red One” (Amazon MGM), which atypically streamed first (at Prime) belatedly added PVOD, is #8 at Fandango ($14.99 for digital download). ‘La Dolce Villa‘Netflix “La Dolce Villa,” #1 since its premiere during the week, stars Scott Foley who comes to Italy to intervene when his adult daughter tries to buy property. It was directed by Mark Waters, one-time indie director whose studio credits include the 2004 “Mean Girls” and 2003’s “Freaky Friday.” The other new original this week is “Honeymoon Crasher,” a French remake of a Mexican rom-com. It is currently #5. Last week’s #1, “Kinda Pregnant” with Amy Schumer, dropped to #6. Top 10s iTunes ranks films daily by number of transactions, while Fandango at Home lists by revenue. The listings below are for Monday, February 16 (iTunes) and the week of February 9-15 (Fandango). The distributors listed are current rights owners. Prices for all titles are for lowest for either rental or download. iTunes Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (Paramount) – $14.99 Wicked (Universal) – $19.99 Moana 2 (Disney) – $24.99 Anora (Neon)- $5.99 Flight Risk (Lionsgate) – $19.99 One of Them Days (Sony) – $19.99 The Substance (MUBI) – $5.99 Den of Thieves 2: Pantera (Lionsgate) – $19.99 Kraven the Hunter (Sony) – $9.99 Conclave (Focus) – $5.99 Fandango at Home Moana 2 (Disney) – $24.99 Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (Paramount) – $19.99  Flight Risk (Lionsgate) – $19.99 One of The Days (Sony) – $19.99 Kraven the Hunter (Sony) – $9.99 Den of Thieves 2: Pantera (Lionsgate) – $19.99 Wicked (Universal) – $19.99 Red One (Amazon MGM) Venom: The Last Dance (Sony) – $5.99 Wolf Man (Universal) – $19.99 Netflix Movies These are the most-viewed, current rankings on Netflix’s domestic daily chart on February 17. Originals include both Netflix-produced and acquired titles it initially presents in the U.S. Netflix publishes its own worldwide weekly (and individual country) top 10s on Tuesdays based on time viewed, and usually includes films for which it doesn’t have domestic rights.
