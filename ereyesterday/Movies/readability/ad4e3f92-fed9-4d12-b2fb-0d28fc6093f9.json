  "text": "Not only is HBO’s “The Last of Us” adaptation funghi-friendly, but because of star Bella Ramsey, it’s environmentally-friendly as well. Speaking during a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Ramsey shared that in taking the lead for Season 2 of series, they decided to flex their power during contract negotiations and fought for a green rider. Though many celebrities use riders to guarantee a trailer or certain perks, Ramsey instead used it to make sure production would be thinking through the lens of sustainability, ensuring a reduction in food and material waste and the use of electric vehicles. “It covers every department, and the producers have to adhere to certain things and so does the actor,” Ramsey said. “Both parties have to be accountable for being sustainability-conscious throughout the shoot. Making sustainable choices on set should be built into the very fabric of the production because it’s not that difficult.” Though not wanting to treat sustainability as some kind of sacrifice, Ramsey did feel it was important to put themselves out there in this manner to show their sense of values. Not many 21 year-olds show this kind of tenacity, yet doing so wasn’t about proving anything to anyone else, but more about owning their involvement in the show. “I would never consider myself a leader,” they said. “But there’s something that happens when I’m given responsibility where I really like the feeling and I take the responsibility very seriously. I’m very happy to lead a set and have a lot of influence over the tone and dynamic, especially given there’s preconceived ideas about a young person who’s No. 1 on the call sheet.” Ramsey also recently spoke to IndieWire’s Ali Foreman about coming into their own in real life and how that’s reflected in “The Last of Us.” Though they try not to pay attention to the fandom while making the show, they completely recognize the impact they’re making even so early in their career. “It isn’t something that I ever think about when we’re filming,” Ramsey told IndieWire. “Then, afterwards, when people come up and share how Ellie has impacted them and seeing themselves represented on screen, it makes it feel like, ‘Wow, everything that we’ve been doing really means something and is worth it.’” “The Last of Us” Season 2 airs on HBO Sunday nights and stream simultaneously on Max.",
