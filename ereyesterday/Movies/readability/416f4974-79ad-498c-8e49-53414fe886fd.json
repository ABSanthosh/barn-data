And in a typical Grey‘s fashion, after slowly and methodically building the groundwork for Levi’s departure in the Mov. 7 Episode, “Night Moves,” the series threw in a shocking Yasuda surprise at the very end of the episode. Adelaide Kane, Midori Francis cr. Disney/Anne Marie Fox After an unplanned extra night shift, Yasuda fell asleep at the wheel of her beloved van while taking her little sister home after her cancer surgery, resulting in a head-on collision. A promo for next week’s episode, titled “If You Leave,” shows that both survived the accident and are rushed to Grey Sloan where Yasuda starts coding. Her fellow interns try to console a despondent Jules who had just had a sweet hear-to-heart with Mika hours earlier. Grey’s Anatomy has a history of having main characters exit after being hot by a vehicle, most notably Derek Shepherd George O’Malley. Watch on Deadline Things appear pretty straight-forward for Levi, for whom the biggest remaining obstacle is how to tell his Chaplain boyfriend that he has accepted the peds research position in Texas, which had been mulling for quite awhile. In “Night Moves,” Bailey and Webber put up a fight with a competitive offer for an attending general surgeon position, and Levi got a trial run but in the end, he went with his heart which had been set on a career in pediatrics. Not surprising, a tearful Helm was the first to get the news, with the two sharing a hug.",
