  "text": "by July 13, 2025 There are more and more stories being told in film about people growing old. Earlier this summer, Music Box released the lovely little film Familiar Touch, described as a \"coming-of-old-age\" story about a woman who moves into a nursing home. A few years ago, there was a Japanese film titled Plan 75 about the option for anyone after 75 to be terminated so they don't overburden Japanese society – but, of course, not all old people really want to go. I'm also a big fan of the Oscar nominated documentary from Chile titled The Mole Agent, which was recently adapted into the Netflix series A Man on the Inside set inside a retirement home. Another film about aging is this one from Brazil – The Blue Trail, the latest feature directed by Brazilian filmmaker Gabriel Mascaro (also of the films August Winds, Neon Bull, Divine Love). It first premiered at the 2025 Berlin Film Festival, where it won Grand Jury Prize at the end, but I just caught up with at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in Czechia and I'm glad I had a chance to catch it on the big screen. It's gorgeous. The Blue Trail features a screenplay written by Gabriel Mascaro \u0026 Tibério Azul, in collaboration with Murilo Hauser and Heitor Lorega. It's set in a \"near future\" where the Brazilian government has started a program sending elderly to distant housing colonies. Similar to the Plan 75 concept, it's about the facade of building a \"future for everyone\" by getting of old people once they hit a certain age. This is an intriguing idea that low key sci-fi is exploring these days (similar to older stories like Logan's Run) as more and more of the boomer generation gets old. The story follows Tereza, a 77 year old woman living in small town, played with gusto and effortless gravitas by the fantastic Brazilian actress Denise Weinberg. When they come for her, she decides to flee instead, heading out on a mission of her own. Even though she's very tired and doesn't really care much for the future, she still doesn't want to go off to some colony, she prefers her independence and freedom. So off she goes hopping onto boats journeying into the Amazon on an adventure that will change her destiny forever... The film has a surprisingly soft \u0026 charming vibe, even though it's dealing with a rather prickly topic in a place as wild and rough as the jungle. But thanks to Weinberg, it's so warm and endearing. My favorite part about the it is the cinematography, shot by DP Guillermo Garza. It's the best looking film shot on rivers in the South American jungle since Werner Herzog's classic Fitzcarraldo. The film is shot in the classic \"Academy ratio\", 4:3, which at first seems like an odd choice but as it plays out, Garza perfectly frames entrancing moments on the water. It's an intimate film focused entirely on Tereza, which is actually quite refreshing. It doesn't waste time switching to other characters or getting tangled in boring subplots, it's focused on her story in a fairly minimal way. There are some breathtaking shots of Tereza sitting on the boats, watching the horizon, observing nature as it passes by... And it's all so beautiful, captured vibrantly and passionately by Garza. Along the way, Tereza meets a few fascinating characters that lead her in new directions. First is the rough \u0026 tumble boat captain Cadu, played by actor Rodrigo Santoro. He's the one who introduces her to the hallucinogenic snail - which squirts out blue slime that causes people to \"see their future\" when they put in their eyes (kind of like Dune). The other unforgettable and important character is Roberta, starring Miriam Socarras, and meeting her is something you must enjoy discovering in the film. My biggest complaint with The Blue Trail is that it never follows through with her original desire that sets her out on her path of discovery. There's something she really wants to do before she kicks the bucket and she spends half of the film trying to figure out how to do this. Sure, maybe it's about how just living a good life on your own terms is really what matters, and/or maybe she'll figure out how to do this activity after the film ends. But I was really hoping we'd get to see that cathartic moment as the audience... Alas, the story drifts into another realm in the second half, which is still amusing and engaging, but it bothered me that it strays a bit from the original ideas in the first half. This is all vague because I don't want to give away what's going on in any part of it, as you need to watch and follow Tereza on her journey without knowing where it's taking her next. Just like life itself. I would've happily kept watching her riding boats around and slapping people around for another 20 or 30 minutes. Similar to the other recent beloved minimalistic story about an older person, Perfect Days, the film is an enchanting tale of rediscovering the magic and joy of the simple things in life no matter how old you are. And always appreciating the freedom to enjoy living on this planet.
