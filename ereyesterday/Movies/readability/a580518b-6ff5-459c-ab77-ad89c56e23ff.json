  "text": "James Gunn is celebrating the rollout of the trailer for Superman after releasing the preview for the DC Studios film on Thursday, December 19. The DC Studios co-head and filmmaker took to social media to thank everyone for their support. “Krypto really did take us home: With over 250 million views and a million social posts, Superman is officially the most viewed and the most talked about trailer in the history of both DC and Warner Bros,” Gunn posted on X, the microblogging platform formerly known as Twitter. He continued, “This is because of all of you: thank you! We’re incredibly grateful and, most of all, excited to share this movie with you in July. Happy Holidays!” Watch on Deadline Superman stars David Corenswet in the titled role, which is set for release on July 11, 2025. The cast includes Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor, and María Gabriela de Faría as The Engineer. The ensemble includes Skyler Gisondo, Sara Sampaio, Sean Gunn, Edi Gathegi, Anthony Carrigan, Isabel Merced, and Nathan Fillion. RELATED: ‘Superman’: James Gunn On Superhero’s “Complicated” Relationship With Krypto; “He’s Not Nearly The Best Dog” Before the trailer was released to the general public, Deadline was able to screen it on Monday, where the director shared insight into the preview, saying, “We do have a battered Superman at the beginning, and I think that is our country.” Gunn noted that Superman was “a movie about kindness. It was a movie about being good,” adding, “I believe in the goodness of human beings, and I believe that most people in this country despite their ideological beliefs or politics are doing their best to get by and are trying to be good people despite what it might seem like to the other side or what that other side might be, and I think this movie is about that.” RELATED: James Gunn To Film “Pickup Shots” For ‘Superman’ In Order “To Enhance The Film”: “No Reshoots” Previously, Gunn had shared that all DC media from the past influenced his take on the superhero classic. “I think that all previous DC media influenced me,” Gunn said, according to IGN. “I think that obviously the original Donner movie influenced me, but there’s also a lot of things that this isn’t, like I’m just making a Donner-type movie. It’s very different from that. Zack [Snyder] did some excellent stuff. So there’s a lot of ways that influenced me.” RELATED: James Gunn On How ‘Top Gun: Maverick,’ Zack Snyder \u0026 ‘All-Star Superman’ Influenced New Film; Teases Lois \u0026 Clark’s “Complicated Relationship” He continued, “There’s a lot of ways in which the DC animated universe [influenced me], and then there’s a lot of stuff from the comic books – above and beyond anything else, All-Star Superman – that influenced me more than anything. To take that sort of Silver Age feel, that sort of science-fiction approach to it with gadgets, Lex [Luthor] is really a sort of sorcerer in a way. He’s a scientist, but he’s so good at science and I think of him as like a sorcerer.” RELATED: ‘Superman’: James Gunn On Significance Of “Battered” Superhero In Trailer Although filming for Superman wrapped at the end of July, Gunn recently shared on Threads he was going back into production “doing a day and a half of pickup shots,” adding, “No scenes. No reshoots. Just a handful of individual shots to enhance the film.”",
