Heller describes it as \"mysterious, miniature movie.\" A content creator feels obligated to let her internet benefactor visit her workshop. His arrival explores uncomfortable boundaries of a parasocial friendship. Starring AnnaSophia Robb as Shelley \u0026 David Brown as Marky, with Antonio Marziale \u0026 Adrienne Becker.
