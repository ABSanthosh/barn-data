Two video clips from the infamous live stream surfaced on May 11, 2025, showcasing the couple getting into a heated altercation filled with verbal abuse. Moreover, even the law became involved in their conflict. So, here’s everything to know about Amouranth and Lee’s shocking altercation and the reasons behind the same. Here’s what happened to Amouranth and her husband The internet celebrity, whose original name is Kaitlyn Michelle Siragusa, and her husband got into a heated argument on a Kick livestream, which led to her calling the cops on him. A viral clip from the stream allegedly began with Nick Lee accusing Amouranth of cheating on him with Aaron Pogson. He said, “Can we talk about you kissing Black men while we’re married? Oh, we don’t want to talk about that one? Did he ask if you could have an open relationship? Oh, he didn’t?! Did you ask that, okay, maybe I will sleep with Aaron. Did we say that? Oh, okay, we’re going to lie to your chat now?” Lee further alleged that he caught Amouranth and Pogson in a parking lot. Check out the aforementioned video below: Meanwhile, Amouranth vehemently denied the allegations. She asserted, “That is not even true! I was… oh, my god! We can talk about that, sure. I had to go on Tinder dates that I didn’t want to go on, and then you started calling me over at the karaoke bar a lot.” She then hit back by claiming that Lee was in an open relationship. The argument further escalated when Lee expressed his dissatisfaction over their current finances. He claimed that they used to make more money via Kick and OnlyFans in 2022 and 2023 than they do now. Shortly after, Amouranth broke down in tears after he stated, “I feel like I am very justified in being upset that you thought I was going to have you murdered when I saved you… and I still saved you!” The popular streamer tearfully retorted that she was hurt by her husband’s words and accused him of wanting a divorce. The argument then reached a tipping point when Nick Lee violently charged at Amouranth’s desk. The video eventually ended with a police officer showing up on the stream, checking if she was okay. Meanwhile, the couple has not made any official statements addressing the altercation as of this writing.",
