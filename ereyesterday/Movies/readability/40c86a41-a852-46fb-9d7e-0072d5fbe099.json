  "text": "Harrison Ford will no longer be presenting at Sunday night’s Academy Awards, Variety has confirmed. While the Academy was unable to confirm, Entertainment Weekly, which was first to report the news, attributed Ford’s Saturday exit to a shingles diagnosis on Friday. The Mayo Clinic describes shingles as a non-life threatening incurable viral infection that causes “a painful rash” which looks like “a single stripe of blisters that wraps around the left side or the right side of your torso.” Ford’s reps did not return Variety’s request for inquiry regarding the shingles diagnosis. Presenters still slated to walk the stage at Los Angeles’ Dolby Theater on Sunday night for the 97th Academy Awards include Halle Berry, Penélope Cruz, Elle Fanning, Whoopi Goldberg, Scarlett Johansson, John Lithgow, Amy Poehler, June Squibb, Bowen Yang, Emma Stone, Cillian Murphy, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Robert Downey Jr., Dave Bautista, Gal Gadot, Andrew Garfield, Samuel L. Jackson, Margaret Qualley, Alba Rohrwacher, Zoe Saldaña and Rachel Zegler. Miles Teller and Miley Cyrus are the latest to join the ranks as presenters, as confirmed by the Academy on Friday. Popular on Variety Conan O’Brien serves as host for this year’s Academy Awards, which kick off March 4 at 4 p.m. PT and 7 p.m. ET.. Movie fans can watch the show live on ABC or stream it on Hulu, an additional viewing option added for the first time this year. The Academy Awards are executive produced by showrunner Raj Kapoor, Katy Mullan and Rob Pain. Producers include Sarah Levine Hall, Taryn Hurd, Jeff Ross and Mike Sweeney. Hamish Hamilton will serve as director.",
