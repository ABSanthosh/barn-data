Obviously they're timing this for January to get people riled up. Here's the first official trailer (+ poster) for Dan Fogelman's series Paradise, from Hulu's YouTube: Hulu's Paradise is set in a serene community inhabited by some of the world’s most prominent individuals. But this tranquility explodes when a shocking murder occurs, then a high-stakes investigation unfolds. Xavier Collins, head of White House Secret Service, is quickly investigated for the death of the president (played by James Marsden), whom he discovers dead next to his bed. The high-stakes probe takes a turn when a flashback reveals that Brown’s character was let in on top-secret information, and now he’s being coached from the inside on how to answer the questions during his investigation. Paradise is a new series created and showrun by acclaimed screenwriter Dan Fogelman, director of the films Life Itself and Danny Collins previously, and creator of the acclaimed \"This Is Us\" series most recently. The final series writing \u0026 directing credits have not been revealed yet. Made by 20th Century Television. Executive produced by Dan Fogelman, Sterling K. Brown, John Requa, Glenn Ficarra, John Hoberg, Jess Rosenthal, and Steve Beers. Hulu will debut Paradise streaming on Hulu starting January 28th, 2025 early next year. Who's curious?
