That’s why it was near-criminal that the historical drama centering on Fred Hampton and William O’Neal didn’t receive a 4K release when it came out in 2021. Instead, fans had to wait four extra years to finally experience it in full detail at home, but thankfully, the wait was worth it as the Judas and the Black Messiah 4K release is a great one. “FBI informant William O’Neal infiltrates the Illinois Black Panther Party and is tasked with keeping tabs on their charismatic leader, Chairman Fred Hampton. A career thief, O’Neal revels in the danger of manipulating both his comrades and his handler, Special Agent Roy Mitchell. Hampton’s political prowess grows just as he’s falling in love with fellow revolutionary Deborah Johnson. Meanwhile, a battle wages for O’Neal’s soul. Will he align with the forces of good? Or subdue Hampton and The Panthers by any means, as FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover commands?” says the official description. Judas and the Black Messiah received six Academy Awards nominations and won two. While it ridiculously placed both Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield as supporting actors, it was correct in giving the Oscar to Kaluuya, whose performance as Hampton is as good as we’ve seen this century. The underrated Stanfield is his equal throughout — how he’s not leading more great films, I’ll never understand — and it all results in a great look at racial injustice and a stellar FBI story. As mentioned before, the four-year wait for the Judas and the Black Messiah 4K release was worth it. The film looks stellar in ultra high-definition with HDR10 and native 4K resolution. It really allows you to fully appreciate the cinematography by Sean Bobbitt, whose visual style helps push this past a biopic and into a great character study. The audio is also great, as there’s a Dolby Atmos track that allows the music and speeches to really shine. Sadly, there’s nothing new in terms of special features. There are two returning featurettes: “Fred Hampton for the People” is a nine-minute look at Hampton’s legacy, which features the cast and crew discussing the key Black Panther Party member, and “Unexpected Betrayal,” an eight-minute look at O’Neal and his real-life betrayal that eventually led to his suicide. Both are worthwhile watches, although the real standout is the film rather than these bonuses. Judas and the Black Messiah 4K Review: Final Verdict Judas and the Black Messiah is one of the best films made in the past decade, and it’s great that it is finally available in ultra-high definition. Both Kaluuya and Stanfield deliver excellent performances, while director Shaka King shows incredible talent in his direction. Hopefully, we’ll hear more about King’s next film soon as the Judas and the Black Messiah 4K release is an excellent reminder of his talent. Disclosure: ComingSoon received product from the distributor for our Judas and the Black Messiah 4K review.",
