  "text": "AMC Theatres is offering another perk for members of its loyalty group, AMC Stubs. Starting on July 9, Stubs members can buy tickets for 50% off the normal adult evening ticket price on Wednesdays, adding to the discounts already available on Tuesdays. The discount will be available at all AMC locations in the United States, although online ticketing fees and extra charges for premium large formats will still apply. AMC says that 36 million people belong to the Stubs program, which is free to join for the Insider tier. Popular on Variety However, “Certain movies and holiday time periods may be excluded” from 50% off Wednesdays, according to AMC. “At AMC, we’ve gone to great lengths to create the preeminent moviegoing environment at our AMC theatres including our offering more comfortable seating, more premium formats, and better food and beverage offerings. Now, we also are pleased to make moviegoing more affordable, with our new ‘50% Off Wednesdays’ effort. Realistically, we could not afford to have made this change to our ticket pricing strategy until the box office showed true signs of sustained recovery. But in April and now in May, the box office has been booming, and the remainder of 2025 appears poised to continue that upward box office trend,” said AMC chairman and CEO Adam Aron in a statement. Aron said that the introduction of discount Tuesdays has made it one of the best-attended days of the week for AMC. “We’re looking to turn Wednesday into a similarly strong-attendance day for moviegoers at our theaters,” he said. Before the pandemic, theater chains were often resistant to widespread ticket discounts outside of the usual matinee and children’s prices. But with the box office still down 32.5% so far this year from 2019, the country’s largest exhibitor is willing to experiment with additional ways to lure more moviegoers back to multiplexes. Premier july releases include “Jurassic World Rebirth” on July 2 and “Superman” on July 11. AMC’s A-list program is a Stubs upgrade that allows moviegoers to see up to four movies a week for $28 per month.",
