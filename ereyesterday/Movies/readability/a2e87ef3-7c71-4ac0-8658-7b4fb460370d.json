  "text": "Peacock’s new TV and movie releases for January 6-12 2025 include Deal or No Deal Island Season 2 and The Traitors Season 3. Deal or No Deal Island Season 2 makes its way to Peacock on January 8. Hosted by actor Joe Manganiello, this reality game show sees contestants take part in a series of tough challenges. They have to find hidden briefcases worth over $200 million, before facing the banker himself in the ultimate challenge. The winner is the person who has managed to defeat the banker and receives the ultimate cash prize. Then, on January 9, the first three episodes of The Traitors Season 3 drop on Peacock. This game show is hosted by Alan Cumming at an ancient Scottish castle. Here, contestants called “faithfuls” work together in a series of challenges to build a prize fund worth $250,000. They must also contend with some contestants hidden amongst faithfuls, branded “traitors,” whose goal is to eliminate them and claim the prize money for themselves. Also dropping this week on Peacock is Polar Opposites. This Hallmark movie follows Emma, who ends up traveling to South America, with the ultimate goal of reaching Antarctica to see her father. Unable to get on a boat to Antarctica, she stows away on a cruise ship, where she meets the engineer, Andy.
