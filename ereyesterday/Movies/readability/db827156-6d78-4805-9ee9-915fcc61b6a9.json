  "text": "The 27th Shanghai International Film Festival kicked off with a galaxy of Chinese stars present and a heartfelt message of peace from jury president Giuseppe Tornatore. The gala event at the city’s spectacular Grand Theatre opened with an orchestral performance accompanied by a children’s choir. Stars present included the cast of the opening night film, Peter Chan Ho-sun‘s “She’s Got No Name,” led by Zhang Ziyi, Mei Ting, Lei Jiayin, Li Xian and Yang Mi; Ni Ni, Tony Leung Ka-fai, Kara Wai Ying-hung, Zhu Yilong and Wu Lei among many others. The festival was officially declared open by Gong Zheng, the Mayor of Shanghai. Popular on Variety Given the ongoing conflicts around the world, the jury members focused on the connective aspects of cinema. Indian filmmaker Kiran Rao said, “Cinema is like the Tree of Life, eternally nurturing stories and sparking conversations. Its branches stretch across generations, connecting us through images and shared memories.” Tornatore carried the thought further, saying, “As a filmmaker, it is a privilege to enjoy films and learn from them in such a magnificent atmosphere. Exchanging ideas with all colleagues from different countries of the world sends a message of peace and coexistence. Viva Shanghai, viva peace, viva cinema.” Speaking at the event, Zhao Jiaming, Member of the Standing Committee and Director of the Publicity Department of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, outlined the event’s three-pronged approach to revitalizing the film industry through historical reflection and forward-looking innovation. “By allowing the development of cinema to shine anew through the interplay of history and reality, and the integration of art and technology, the festival aims to rejuvenate the film industry,” Zhao said, emphasizing the festival’s role as a vital platform for Shanghai’s film sector and its theme of “Innovation through history.” The festival’s programming will spotlight the birth of cinema while paying tribute to classic films from both China and international markets. The event will also showcase cutting-edge industry developments, creating a bridge between cinema’s storied past and its evolving future. Central to this year’s edition is the concept of “Cinema as a Medium,” which gathers a selection of films from around the world, while creating dedicated platforms for industry dialogue. The initiative aims to “tell compelling Chinese stories and present a diversity of cultural civilizations,” fostering what Zhao called a “global garden of cinema through exchange and mutual learning.” The festival is also prioritizing audience engagement through “people-oriented” initiatives designed to expand access to high-quality film programming. Plans include strengthening integration across multiple sectors — culture, tourism, commerce, sports, and exhibitions — to create comprehensive “film+” offerings for enthusiasts. Wang Xiaozhen, VP of China Media Group, positioned this year’s festival within broader historical context, noting the significance of cinema’s milestone anniversaries as 2025 marks the 130th anniversary of the birth of world cinema and the 120th anniversary of Chinese cinema. A montage celebrating 120 years of Chinese cinema was accompanied by renditions of songs by Jane Zhang. Another montage looked at Shanghai in cinema over the years, including “Mission: Impossible III,” “Empire of the Sun,” “The White Countess” and a plethora of Chinese films including “Perhaps Love.” Wang underscored film’s unique role as an art form that “continues original aspirations while seeking innovation, recording dialogues between civilizations and emotional resonances, and bearing shared pursuits and beautiful visions.” The festival’s programming will examine cinema’s evolution while demonstrating what Wang characterized as “the spirit of integrity and innovation, courage and perseverance in the film industry.” The goal, according to Wang, is to “inject new vitality into the sustained prosperity and development of Chinese cinema.” Shanghai’s positioning as a global film hub received particular emphasis, with Zhao extending an open invitation to industry professionals worldwide. “We sincerely invite friends from the domestic and international film and television industries to come to Shanghai, stay in Shanghai, and realize your dreams in Shanghai,” he said, concluding with, “This is Shanghai, where anything is possible.”",
