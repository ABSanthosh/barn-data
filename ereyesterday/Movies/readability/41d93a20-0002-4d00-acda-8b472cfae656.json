  "text": "Angelenos were treated to a rare performance from Justin Bieber, as the two-time Grammy winner took the stage at SZA and Kendrick Lamar‘s Grand National Tour yesterday. In its second night at Sofi Stadium in Inglewood, the “Peaches” singer surprised audiences as he and the One of Them Days star duetted “Snooze,” off of the latter’s SOS album. The duo effortlessly played off one another as they took turns singing the chorus of the sleeper hit toxic love-themed track, dancing and vibing as SZA threw out an effortless falsetto. The five-time Grammy-winning “Consideration” singer was seen cupping Bieber’s chin, as he then kissed her palm and hand, eventually twirling around as they moved across the stage. As the crowd continued going wild, the two wrapped up the brief performance before disappearing underneath the stage. Watch the moment below: Watch on Deadline Justin Bieber made a surprise appearance with SZA during her and Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Grand National Tour’ stop on Friday at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles pic.twitter.com/1V8y0TGE5W— Deadline (@DEADLINE) May 24, 2025 First touching down in L.A. May 21, the co-headlining tour already featured a surprise appearance by Lizzo, who sang the remix version of “Special” with SZA, the eponymous track off of her 2022 album. With one more night to go later this evening, it’ll be interesting to see who — if anyone — will be brought out. (Might I humbly suggest Doja Cat?) Hotly anticipated since its announcement back in December, fervor around the Grand National Tour — a partnership that cements the long-flourishing creative collaboration between friends SZA and Lamar — only grew following the duo’s performance at the Super Bowl Halftime Show in February. Lamar brought out SZA for “Luther,” a newer track off of his widely acclaimed album GNX, and “All the Stars,” the earworm of a lead single from the Black Panther soundtrack that catapulted SZA from R\u0026B indie darling status to eventual stardom. As for Bieber, the veteran singer-songwriter last went on a world tour in support of Justice, his sixth studio album, which was officially cut short in February 2023 after he canceled his remaining dates following several postponements to prioritize his health. Since then, Bieber has occasionally appeared as a guest for peers’ live shows, with the last being in March 2023, at a Rolling Loud set by Don Toliver during a performance of their song “Private Landing,” also featuring Future. However, Bieber wasn’t on stage to sing, appearing to hype up his collaborator.",
