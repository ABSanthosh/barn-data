  "description": "\"The Devil will do whatever it takes to foil our plans. We must be resolute... and hold back the darkness.\" The shocking true story of the most infamous exorcism in American history. ðŸ˜± XYZ Films has revealed the first teaser trailer for The Ritual, a brand new possession horror thriller releasing in theaters nationwide starting in June. Not to be confused with the creepy forest horror movie also titled The Ritual that Netflix released in 2017. Two priests, one in crisis with his faith and the other confronting a turbulent past, must overcome their differences to perform an extremely risky, dangerous exorcism. Sanctioned by the Church. Condemned by Satan. The Ritual tells the true story of the possession of Emma Schmidt, one of the most documented exorcism in American history. Theophilus Riesinger, a mysterious Capuchin friar, whose last experience with exorcism made him a controversial figure, is assigned to carry out the task. This stars Al Pacino as Father Riesinger, Dan Stevens (!!) as Father Steiger, with Ashley Greene, Abigail Cowen as Emma, and Patricia Heaton. Al Pacino looks wild in this with that gnarly beard. But will this be any good? Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for David [â€¦]",
