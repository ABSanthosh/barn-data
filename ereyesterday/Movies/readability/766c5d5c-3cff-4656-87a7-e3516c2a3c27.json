  "text": "Sean Duffy is entering the real world of Washington D.C., with Donald Trump tapping the Fox Business host and former Representative of Wisconsin to be his nominee as his secretary of transportation. Duffy would replace Pete Buttigieg, who was selected by sitting President Biden to lead the department under his administration. Duffy represents a double-dip into the bin of Fox personalities for Trump. The President-elect had previously announced that “Fox \u0026 Friends Weekend” co-host Pete Hegseth would be appointed secretary of defense. Unlike Hegseth, Duffy has legislative experience, having served as a U.S. Representative from 2011 to 2019. He resigned in 2019 for personal reasons, disclosing that his newborn daughter had been diagnosed with a heart defect. Prior to his 2010 campaign for the House of Representatives, Duffy had been appointed the District Attorney of Ashland County in Wisconsin in 2002. Popular on Variety Duffy first entered the public eye in his late twenties, featured as a star on “The Real World: Boston,” the sixth season of MTV’s landmark reality TV series. He also competed on the first season of “The Challenge” — known in 1998 as “Road Rules: All Stars” — where he met his wife Rachel Campos. In 2022, he joined Fox Business to co-host “The Bottom Line” with Dagen McDowell. In a statement, Trump said that Duffy “will prioritize Excellence, Competence, Competitiveness and Beauty when rebuilding America’s highways, tunnels, bridges and airports. He will ensure our ports and dams serve our Economy without compromising our National Security, and he will make our skies safe again by eliminating DEI for pilots and air traffic controllers.”",
