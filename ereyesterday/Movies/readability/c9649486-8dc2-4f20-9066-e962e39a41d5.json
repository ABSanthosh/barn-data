  "text": "Paris Hilton is one of the celebrities affected by the L.A. wildfires, which affected thousands of residents following a powerful windstorm. On Tuesday, night, Hilton had shared a message on Instagram asking people to pray for California and Los Angeles amid the Pacific Palisades fires. On Wednesday, Hilton said she learned that her home in Malibu had burned down while watching the news on TV. “Heartbroken beyond words. Sitting with my family, watching the news, and seeing our home in Malibu burn to the ground on live TV is something no one should ever have to experience,” Hilton shared on Instagram. “This home was where we built so many precious memories. It’s where Phoenix took his first steps and where we dreamed of building a lifetime of memories with London.” She continued, “While the loss is overwhelming, I’m holding onto gratitude that my family is safe. My heart and prayers are going out to every family affected by these fires. To all the people who have lost their homes, their memories, and their beloved pets. My heart aches for those still in harm’s way or mourning greater losses. The devastation is unimaginable. To know so many are waking up today without the place they called home is truly heartbreaking.” Watch on Deadline Hilton mentioned that her team was contacting local organizations to figure out how to help the people impacted by the fires. The Paris In Love star also shared her gratitude “to the brave firefighters and first responders risking their lives to protect us—you are true heroes.” “Please, everyone, stay safe and follow evacuation orders,” she added. “Let’s protect one another and hold onto hope that these fires will soon be contained. Sending so much love and strength to all of you. We’re in this together, LA. Hug your loved ones a little tighter tonight. You never know when everything could change.”",
