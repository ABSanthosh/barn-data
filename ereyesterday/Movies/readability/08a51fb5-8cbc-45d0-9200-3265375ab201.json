  "description": "\"What do you mean there are living creatures here?\" What in the?! A second trailer has been unveiled for an indie stop-motion animation movie called Junk World, the next film in a trilogy set around the Junk Head universe. Junk World is the new film from filmmaker Takahide Hori, following his first film Junk Head in 2017, about a world where weird cloned humanoid-esque creations live underground. Four years have passed since Junk Head sent the world into a frenzy. Junk World, which depicts the world 1042 years before, invites you once again into an unknown adventure. This funky fun film will hit Japanese theaters in June, though we have no idea when it'll show up anywhere else yet. The film features stop-motion animated puppets and strange creatures galore. Similar to the craziness seen in Phil Tippett's Mad God (2021). This new trailer (here's the other one) focuses more on the story, following a group of government schmucks who come down to the Junk World and discover there's more going on there than they thought. All of these weird creatures are so cool and so much fun that I can't help but be interested in this. Keep an eye out […]",

A second trailer has been unveiled for an indie stop-motion animation movie called Junk World, the next film in a trilogy set around the Junk Head universe. Junk World is the new film from filmmaker Takahide Hori, following his first film Junk Head in 2017, about a world where weird cloned humanoid-esque creations live underground. Four years have passed since Junk Head sent the world into a frenzy. Junk World, which depicts the world 1042 years before, invites you once again into an unknown adventure.

This new trailer (here's the other one) focuses more on the story, following a group of government schmucks who come down to the Junk World and discover there's more going on there than they thought. All of these weird creatures are so cool and so much fun that I can't help but be interested in this. Keep an eye out for it soon. Here's the second official trailer for Takahide Hori's film Junk World, direct from YouTube (via Catsuka): You can rewatch the first official trailer for Takahide Hori's Junk World right here for more funky footage. A long time ago, human beings developed underground due to the decrease of habitats above ground. As a labor force, they created Mulligan, an artificial life form that resembles a human. However, the Mulligans rebelled against the human race by increasing the number of clones of themselves and spreading their power. It's now 230 years after the third cease-fire agreement. Humanity remains above ground, and the underground world on a global scale is ruled by Mulligan. An anomaly occurs in the underground. A team of human \u0026 Mulligan investigators is formed to look into the changes in the underworld. The human team, led by female captain Tris, and the Mulligan team, led by the original clone Dante, both set out for their destination, the underground city of Carp Bar, only to be attacked by the mulligan cult, the \"Gyula cult.\" Their target is Tris, a human female who is considered a rare species. However, Tris is accompanied by a robot named Robin as her escort. \"We will protect you, Tris-sama.\" What are the mysteries and anomalies hidden in the underground world? And what is Robin's decision at the end of the trans-dimensional battle? Junk World, also known as『JUNK WORLD』in Japan, is created and written and animated and directed by Japanese indie animator / filmmaker Takahide Hori, director of the original Junk Head film (2017) previously, plus a few shorts and other projects. He started work on this next Junk World project back in 2022 and it's finally ready for release this year. The film opens first in theaters in Japan starting June 13th, 2025. No other release dates are set yet - stay tuned. For more info + theaters head to the film's official site. Find more posts in: Animation, Foreign Films, To Watch, Trailer",
