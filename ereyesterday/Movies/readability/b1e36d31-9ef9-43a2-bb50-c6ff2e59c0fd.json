As the latest iteration of Netflix’s reality dating series comes to an end, many have wondered if they are still together after the filming wrapped up. So, here are all the details of the pair’s relationship in Single’s Inferno Season 4 as well as their current status. Are Kim A-rin and Kook Dong-ho still together after Single’s Inferno Season 4? While A-rin and Dong-ho haven’t shared much about their relationship after the show, fans believe that the two are still together. The duo’s chemistry in Season 4 convinced fans early on that they had great potential to become ‘endgame.’ But it wasn’t until Episode 7 that fans got to see their pleasant bond as they went to their first ‘paradise’ date. Eventually, Dong-ho and A-rin discovered a lot of similarities between each other. The most surprising one was them being from the same locality. Since the couple’s first (and last) paradise date in the show, Dong-ho showed his appreciation for A-rin’s genuineness. While multiple female contestants pursued the 30-year-old accountant, including Hae-lin and You-jin, he remained faithful to A-rin by choosing her at the end. As per previous seasons, contestants who leave the show as ‘final couples’ date for a few months before breaking up. However, from Dong-ho and A-rin’s post-show interaction, it is clear that they are on good terms. For instance, fans have noticed that he has only engaged with A-rin’s Instagram post, apart from liking Sian’s group photo. Moreover, in a promotional interview for Eyes Magazine, Dong-ho paid a sweet tribute to A-rin. He mentioned how one of his favorite moments from the show was one with the professional model. Dong-ho shared that her excitement and constant banter on their dessert date made his heart skip a beat. The Singles Inferno Season 4 couple was also seen sharing a cute interaction in a TikTok video shared by fans. Additionally, A-rin and Dong-ho started following each other on Instagram after the show ended. Neither of the two have publicly addressed their relationship as of writing. Albeit, Dong-ho and A-rin’s interactions for post-show content have convinced viewers that they could be together.",
