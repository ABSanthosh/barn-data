  "text": "Following Taylor Swift’s recent NYC date with Travis Kelce, fans are looking for clues regarding her response to Matty Healy’s presumed “jab” at The 1975’s Glastonbury set. The latter referred to himself as a “poet” on stage, which Swifties interpret as a reference to her latest album, “The Tortured Poets Department.” Many are now watching for any response from the pop icon following the apparent jab. So, did Swift really respond to Healy’s alleged dig at her? Here’s what fans are speculating on the same. The “Fortnight” singer hasn’t directly addressed The 1975 frontman’s apparent dig at her latest album. However, fans believe her latest “public date” with Travis Kelce on Saturday in New York sends a clear message. For the unversed, during The 1975’s Glastonbury performance on June 27, Matty Healy, who briefly dated Taylor Swift in 2023, made comments that fans interpreted as mocking her breakup album about their relationship. “The best, what do we say, a poet, ladies and gentlemen, is what I am,” Healy told the audience with apparent sarcasm, adding he was a “generational wordsmith” who “bleeds” for his lyrics. Swifties immediately speculated the remarks referenced Swift’s 2024 studio album The Tortured Poets Department, widely believed to chronicle their short-lived 2023 romance. Rather than responding verbally, Swift was photographed the next day in New York with boyfriend Travis Kelce, both wearing coordinated white outfits. Now, fans view the very public, happy appearance as her subtle response. Swifties also think that the “Willow” hitmaker is showing that she has moved on and is thriving in her current relationship. Swift and Kelce reportedly visited San Vicente West Village on June 28. In most photographs, the duo appear to hold hands. The 35-year-old singer wore a pink and white houndstooth Balmain dress. Meanwhile, the NFL star sported an oversized short-sleeve white dress shirt and black pants. (via People) Meanwhile, Taylor Swift’s brief romance with Matty Healy remains a constant topic of discussion among fans. The duo reportedly first met in 2014 at a The 1975 concert. Swift was later spotted wearing the rock band’s merch in Los Angeles. Almost a decade later, reports revealed that the duo have been “hanging out and having a good time. It’s not just platonic.” However, within months of Healy and Swift’s brief romance, the pair called it off in June 2023. A source told People, “She had fun with him, but it was always casual.”",
