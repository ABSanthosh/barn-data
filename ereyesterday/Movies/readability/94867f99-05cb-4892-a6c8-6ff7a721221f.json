  "text": "Coldplay frontman Chris Martin is joining in on the viral kiss cam couple moment. On Saturday, during the first concert since the now-infamous video was taken, Martin jokingly warned the audience that the fan cam was about to begin filming. “We’d like to say hello to some of you in the crowd,” he said in a video shared on X. “How we’re gonna do that is we’re gonna use our cameras and put some of you on the big screen. So please, if you haven’t done your makeup, do your makeup now.” At a Coldplay concert Wednesday night in Foxborough, Mass., a fan cam found Astronomer CEO Andy Bryon with his arms around a woman speculated to be his HR chief, Kristin Cabot. Once spotted, they quickly moved away from each other and hid their faces from the camera. The couple was identified on social media, and the clip of them together has amassed tens of millions of views since it was posted late Wednesday. Popular on Variety In the wake of the incident, Byron stepped down from his role as CEO of Astronomer, a move revealed in a statement on Saturday. “As stated previously, Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding,” read the statement. “Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met. Andy Byron has tendered his resignation, and the Board of Directors has accepted. The Board will begin a search for our next Chief Executive as Cofounder and Chief Product Officer Pete DeJoy continues to serve as interim CEO.”",
