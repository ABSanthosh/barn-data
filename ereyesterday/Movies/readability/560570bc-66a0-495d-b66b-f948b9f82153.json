  "text": "ComingSoon Senior Editor Brandon Schreur participated in a roundtable interview with Cobra Kai creators Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg. They discussed the final batch of Cobra Kai episodes and Johnny Lawrence’s big moment during the final episode. “After a shocking result in the Sekai Taikai, Miyagi-Do, and Cobra Kai must reckon with their pasts while facing an uncertain future both on and off the mat,” the synopsis for Cobra Kai Season 6 Part 3 reads. “Almost 40 years after the events of the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament, it’s all been leading to this.” Cobra Kai Season 6 Part 3 is now streaming on Netflix. Brandon Schreur: I loved the final episode of Cobra Kai. Seeing Johnny fight with Daniel as his sensei, that was such a cool way to end the whole thing. I was just wondering that, when this show first started, did you know that this was how it was all going to end and you wanted Johnny to have that moment? Jon Hurwitz: We knew from the very beginning that we wanted to bring Johnny and Daniel together in the way that we did. We loved the idea of Johnny back on the red mat. Back on that mat, which was so traumatic for him all those years ago. To see him actually fight again and have a victory, this time, but, instead of Sensei Kreese in his corner, it’s Daniel LaRusso, who started as his enemy, became his close friend, and, in that moment, his sensei. That victory, we wanted it to be, “Yes, it’s Johnny’s big moment,” but it’s a moment for both of them. That was something that, as we were writing, we were finding the right balance of the involvement that Daniel would have in that final fight. We knew it was going to be through Johnny embracing not only what he learned through Cobra Kai, but also what he learned through Miyagi-Do over the years. That’s what made him prepared to take on kind of anything that the world was throwing at him. Thanks to Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg for speaking about Cobra Kai.",
