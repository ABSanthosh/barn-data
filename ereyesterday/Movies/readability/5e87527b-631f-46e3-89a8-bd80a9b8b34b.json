Here's the festival promo trailer for Logic's comedy movie Paradise Records, direct from YouTube: Cooper (Logic), a well-meaning record store owner, is trying to keep the doors of Paradise Records open. He's facing foreclosure, the bank won't give him a loan, someone keeps offering to buy the property — and then a robbery. He's not having a great day. Thankfully he's got a motley crew of entertaining employees and a lot of weed to help him figure out how to get himself out of this big mess. Paradise Records is written and directed by American rapper / writer / producer / filmmaker \"Logic\", originally known as Sir Robert Bryson Hall II, making his directorial debut after appearing as an actor in many music videos and working as a composer on video games, in addition to his rap career. It's produced by Liz Destro, Logic, and Jordan Monsanto. The film is premiering at the 2025 Tribeca Film Festival this summer, playing in the Spotlight Narrative section.
