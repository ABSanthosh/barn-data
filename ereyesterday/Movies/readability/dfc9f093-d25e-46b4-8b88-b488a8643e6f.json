Keep an eye out for this. Here's the official UK trailer (+ poster) for Brendan Canty's film Christy, direct from YouTube: 17-year-old Christy (starring Daniel Power) is at a crossroads. Kicked out of his suburban foster home, he moves in with his estranged older brother Shane (Diarmuid Noyes) and his young family. As far as Shane is concerned this is a temporary arrangement, but Christy begins to feel at home on Cork's working-class Northside. As he makes new friends and begins to let the community in, he also reconnects with his past through his seemingly more corrupting extended family, despite his brother Shane's efforts to protect him. Shane wants something better for Christy at any cost â€“ even if it means he has to push him away. As the brothers look to reconcile their turbulent past, their family and the community around them offer hope for Christy's future. Christy is directed by the Irish filmmaker Brendan Canty, making his feature directorial debut after various shorts \u0026 music videos previously. The screenplay is written by Alan O'Gorman. Produced by Marina Brackenbury, Meredith Duff, and Rory Gilmartin. This initially premiered at the 2025 Berlin Film Festival earlier this year. WildCard will debut Canty's Christy film in Irish cinemas starting August 29th, 2025, and also in the UK on September 5th coming soon. No US release date has been set yet. Any good?
