  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: More cuts are expected in the agency world. UTA has begun the process of letting go a number of agents across a variety of areas. Deadline understands that agents in its talent department, production group, unscripted division and endorsements and licensing business are set to leave. It is a similar process to one that recently began at CAA, where that agency, which is now owned by Francois-Henri Pinault’s Artémis after he completed a majority stake acquisition last September, is starting its year-end evaluations that will result in agents being let go. We hear that at UTA this could affect a low-double-digit number of agents, around 10 people.   Watch on Deadline A UTA spokeswoman denied this was a set of layoffs, where the focus is headcount reduction, but instead part of the normal business of running an agency. She said UTA, which employs around 2,200 people, has also added more than 20 agents to the company over the last 12 months. It is different from last year’s layoffs at UTA, where it let go a small number of agents and employees in February and October. We’ll update this as and when we hear confirm names, and it is very possible that a number of these people leaving find new opportunities, which will, of course cover.",
