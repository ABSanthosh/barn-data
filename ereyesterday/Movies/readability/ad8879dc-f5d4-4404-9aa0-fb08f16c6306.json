  "text": "“The Substance” (MUBI) and “Flow” (Janus/Sideshow), two very independent specialized releases, add to their theatrical and awards successes with strong interest on home viewing. “Wicked” (Universal), expecting even greater recognition repeats as #1 at both iTunes (ranking by transactions) and Fandango (by revenue) in its second week out. The studio, which like others rarely announces home video returns, said its first week out had $70 million in rentals and sales. They get 80 percent of this after a small carriage fee deduction, a much higher return than in theaters. This buttresses the claim of how vital PVOD is, even if its often early streaming release (in this case after six weekends, later than usual for Universal) seems to intrude on theatrical play. Netflix, meanwhile, underwent a wholesale turnover this week, with only three films listed last week still on their top 10. “Ad Vitam,” an original French thriller in the Liam Neeson-mold that follows a lone avenger saving a family member in danger, has gotten very little entertainment media attention yet clicked with the streamer’s viewers. It stars Guillaume Canet, the director (not here) and star of “Tell No One” (2006). Popular on IndieWire “The Substance,” after earlier having a decent run as a $19.99 PVOD entry, while also streaming on MUBI, is now available to rent for $5.99. It is #2 at iTunes, #6 at Fandango. Apart from the price cut, the increased attention following star Demi Moore’s Golden Globe win along with steady positive reaction has boosted this. ‘Flow‘ © Janus Films /Courtesy Everett CollectionCourtesy Everett Collection “Flow,” the Latvian animated film that has passed $3 million in theaters and is a leading contender for the Best Animated Feature Oscar, curiously skipped PVOD to go straight to $5.99 rentals. It is #4 at Fandango, an unusually high position for a non-PVOD/$19.99 rental there, and sixth at iTunes (it had initially placed fifth its first days out.) Otherwise the VOD rankings are marked by some price reductions. “Venom: The Last Dance” (Sony) and “Anora” (Neon) both dropped to $9.99, “The Wild Robot” (Universal) and “Conclave” (Focus) to $5.99, boosting all of them (“Anora” the sole one not on both). On Netflix, two early “Despicable Me” films are second and third. Its list, other than #1, consists of studio library totals. No sign yet of any resurgence for “Emilia Pérez.” Though not a movie, Netflix also debuted acclaimed director Hirokazu Kore-Eda’s (“Shoplifters”) new slice-of-life series set in 1970s Japan, “Asura,” with little notice for such an interesting presentation. Top 10s iTunes ranks films daily by number of transactions, while Fandango at Home lists by revenue. The listings below are for Monday, January 13 (iTunes) and the week of January 6-12 (Fandango). The distributors listed are current rights owners. Prices for all titles are for lowest for either rental or download. iTunes 1. Wicked (Universal) – $19.99 2. The Substance (MUBI) – $5.99 3. Gladiator II (Paramount) – $19.99 4. Conclave (Focus) – $5.99 5. Venom: The Last Dance (Sony) – $9.99 6. Flow (Janus/Sideshow) – $5.99 7. The Wild Robot (Universal) – $5.99 8. Anora (Neon) – $9.99 9.

Werewolves (Briarcliff) – $19.99 Netflix Movies These are the most-viewed, current rankings on Netflix’s domestic daily chart on January 13. Originals include both Netflix-produced and acquired titles it initially presents in the U.S. Netflix publishes its own worldwide weekly (and individual country) top 10s on Tuesdays based on time viewed, and usually includes films for which it doesn’t have domestic rights. 1.
