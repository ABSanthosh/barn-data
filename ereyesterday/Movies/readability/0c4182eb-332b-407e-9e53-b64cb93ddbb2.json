  "text": "The Season 4 premiere of “Abbott Elementary” scored just under 9 million total viewers in its first 35 days of viewing across ABC, Hulu and Disney+, according to a combination of data from both Nielsen and Disney. That’s up 321% from the 2.1 million average viewers it reached on the night it aired. Along with quadrupling in total viewers, the Oct. 9 episode reached a 3.5 rating with adults aged 18-49 after 35 days, compared to a 0.4 in Live + Same Day. Compared to the Season 3 finale, which aired May 22, the Season 4 premiere is up 11% in total viewers (9 million vs. 8 million) and 21% in 18-49 rating (3.5 vs. 2.9) when accounting for 35 days of viewership. In both metrics, the return of Season 4 brought “Abbott Elementary” its best performance since its post-Oscars episode on March 10. Created by and starring Quinta Brunson, “Abbott Elementary” follows a group of teachers trying to make it work at an underfunded elementary school. The series also stars Tyler James Williams, Janelle James, Lisa Ann Walter, Chris Perfetti, Sheryl Lee Ralph and William Stanford Davis. It’s been nominated for 24 Emmys and has won four. Popular on Variety “Abbott Elementary” returns Dec. 4 with a one-hour holiday special featuring back-to-back episodes, “Winter Show” and “Winter Break.” At 8 p.m., Barbara (Ralph) is “determined to make Abbott Elementary’s first-ever holiday show a success, despite a few setbacks,” while Jacob’s (Perfetti) brother is in town earlier than expected. Then at 8:30 p.m., Melissa (Walter) hosts the Schemmenti family Christmas Eve dinner and “goes to great lengths to make sure everything is perfect,” while Janine (Brunson) and Gregory (Williams) are visited by an unexpected guest.",
