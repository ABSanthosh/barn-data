  "text": "The reports of Craig Robinson‘s retirement from comedy appear to have been greatly exaggerated. Turns out “The Office” star’s so-called “retirement” is believed to be part of a new brand marketing campaign expected to be unleashed in the coming days — and perhaps for a division of AT\u0026T. Teaser billboards have appeared across Los Angeles in recent weeks announcing, “Craig Robinson is Quitting Comedy,” without any further information. A good indicator that this is part of a teaser campaign, as it is doubtful Robinson would actually spend that kind of outdoor advertising cash to reveal a career change. Those billboards were in AT\u0026T-style blue, furthering the suspicion that this is part of a new campaign for the telco giant. Why is it believed to be AT\u0026T? Robinson has previously starred in AT\u0026T commercials, jokingly calling himself the company’s “Chief Technology Officer” in one AT\u0026T Business Internet ad, alongside his former “The Office” co-star Brian Baumgartner. Another spot featured Robinson and Baumgartner along side more “The Office” alums, including Rainn Wilson, Jenna Fischer, Creed Bratton and Kate Flannery. Popular on Variety AT\u0026T and Robinson’s reps did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The “Craig Robinson is Quitting Comedy” billboards went unreported, but then Robinson last week upped the ante by posting on his Instagram account that he had a “Life update: I’m officially quitting comedy to focus on my true calling. Stay tuned. I’m working on something huge.” That post eventually made its way to the media, and many outlets posted Robinson’s note at face value, without noting that he made is announcement with a wink and a nod. (Yes, Variety is included.) Robinson followed up that post with another video, where he made his true intentions even more clear: “Hey guys, big shout out to all my small business owners. Hey, you guys got any advice for me while I’m trying to get my business afloat? I hit a few bumps in the road and I sure would appreciate you guys’ tips.” We’re guessing AT\u0026T has some internet tips for small business owners that Robinson will be sharing in no time. Meanwhile, here’s another reason it’s pretty clear that Robinson isn’t really quitting comedy: He’s got a full slate of shows booked for the rest of the summer. Robinson is scheduled to appear at the Omaha Funny Bone club later this week, followed by a gig in Los Angeles at the Comedy Store on July 14. Next month, he has dates lined up in Orlando, Seattle, Nashville, Detroit and Toledo. He also has plenty of projects in the works too, including the Netflix animated adventure “In Your Dreams” and “The Bad Guys 2.”",
