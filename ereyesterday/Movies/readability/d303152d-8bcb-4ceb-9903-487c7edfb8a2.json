The film has gone into production, as evidenced by some snapshots shown below of two of its costars filming a scene in New York City last week. Two more of Hoover’s books, Regretting You, and Reminders of Him have been picked up for film adaptations as well, each growing its cast ahead of production. Watch on Deadline It Ends With Us starring Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni was just the beginning of the author’s extension into film and television.

RELATED: A Full Timeline Of Blake Lively \u0026 Justin Baldoni’s ‘It Ends With Us’ Feud In Court, Online \u0026 In The Media To learn where these projects are in the production process and who is behind their adaptations, read on. Reminders of Him Montlake; Universal Pictures Universal will bring Hoover’s most recent novel Reminders of Him to the big screen in 2026. The screenplay was written by Hoover and Lauren Levine, based on Hoover’s novel. Longlegs star Maika Monroe has been tapped to star in the film. Vanessa Caswill, who directed Netflix’s adaptation of Jennifer E. Smith’s Love At First Sight, is attached to direct Reminders of Him. The story follows Kenna Rowan as she returns to town after five years in prison, hoping to reunite with her four-year-old daughter, but the damage has been done, with everyone associated with Kenna’s daughter determined to shut her out. Local bar owner Ledger Ward is one person who doesn’t immediately ice her out, and who provides a connection to her daughter. The two form a bond, which turns into a risky romance as it grows. Verity ‘Verity,’ by Colleen Hoover Hoover’s suspenseful romance novel Verity came out in December 2018, two years after It Ends With Us. First reported by The Hollywood Reporter, the novel is in the hands of Amazon MGM Studios. RELATED: Anne Hathaway To Star In Adaptation Of Colleen Hoover’s ‘Verity’ For Amazon MGM Studios And Michael Showalter Deadline exclusively broke the news that Anne Hathaway will star in the adaptation, with Michael Showalter attached to direct. This marks a reteaming for the pair after The Idea of You. Deadline also exclusively broke the news that Josh Hartnett and Dakota Johnson are set to star alongside Hathaway. Hathaway will portray best-selling author Verity Crawford while Hartnett plays her husband Jeremy. Johnson will play Lowen Ashleigh, the ghostwriter that Jeremy hires to finish a set of his wife’s novels after she got in a gruesome car accident that left her in a coma. Ashleigh, though, starts to suspect that all is not what it seems at the Crawford house. Five new cast additions: Ismael Cruz Cordóva(The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power), Brady Wagner (Broadway’s Merrily We Roll Along), Irina Dvorovenko (And Just Like That…), K.K.

Aeon/GC Images Verity follows writer Lowen Ashleigh, who hasn’t had a lucrative project in a bit when she is asked to finish the very successful series of novels by best-selling author Verity Crawford. Crawford, who has become incapacitated due to a mysterious car accident, is in a coma-like state while her husband Jeremy seeks out someone to see her work through. But as Lowen goes back through Verity’s drafts, outlines and other book prep, she discovers a very sinister draft that suggests Verity’s accident could be masking other tragedies. Allison Williams To Star In Adaptation Of ‘Regretting You’ From ‘It Ends With Us’ Author Colleen Hoover Regretting You ‘Regretting’ by Colleen Hoover Regretting You came out nearly a year after Verity in December 2019. The film will arrive in theaters Oct. 24, 2025. Josh Boone (The Fault in Our Stars) is attached to direct the script written by Susan McMartin (After), which he went on to further adapt. Paramount Pictures’ film adaptation will come from Constantin Film with producers Robert Kulzer for the production company as well as Brunson Green and Anna. Flavia Viotti is also producing. Hoover, Williams, Franco, and Grace are executive producing.  The story follows Morgan Grant and her daughter Clara. Morgan had Clara at a young age, adding motherhood to her identity before she could work towards some dreams. Clara and Morgan’s relationship gets tense, and that tension only increases when Morgan’s husband and Clara’s father die in a tragic accident.
