  "text": "Hollywood’s top agencies are taking a head-on approach with staffers in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris. While Sunset Blvd. is a far cry from 1600 Penn., this year’s presidential election saw the lines between L.A. and D.C.’s biggest names blurred more than ever, with the agencies taking on more responsibility in helping their clients take a stance. Harris relied heavily on star power to build momentum, and both CAA and WME utilized in-house political consultants to serve as liaisons connecting the campaign with their rosters of stars. CAA was closed on Tuesday to allow employees to vote and engage in civic activities, and a source tells Variety that co-chairman Richard Lovett will formally address staffers during the company’s global all-hands meeting on Thursday (which was scheduled prior to the election). Popular on Variety In a Wednesday morning memo to staff obtained by Variety, UTA CEO Jeremy Zimmer wrote, “Last night’s result was a very tough outcome for many, who feel angry, scared, and disenfranchised. While recognizing that a lot of others feel very differently, as the results reflect, discussions about understanding the ‘other’ side are for another time.” “Today, our challenge is to be there for each other, support those among us who feel particularly vulnerable, and as always do our best for our family, friends and clients,” Zimmer continued. “Let’s give comfort and support where it’s needed and continue to aspire for a country that can include more, support more, and solve for the struggles of all Americans.” A source tells Variety that WME leadership addressed the agency regarding the presidential race during an all-company staff meeting earlier this week, and department heads are discussing the election results in their individual meetings today and throughout the week. Verve leadership similarly addressed staffers in an internal memo with the subject line “Moving Forward.” “However you feel today is okay; keep doing your best, and remember: We are creatives. Whether we are agents, aspiring writers, budding producers, or hopeful development executives, we share a passion and belief in storytelling,” the memo said in part. “To pursue a creative life demands optimism in the future: creativity is a steady march toward understanding the world around us, and without belief in what’s to come, there’s nowhere to march. This is non-negotiable: the creative life, the drive to get stories told, is mired in hard news – passes, rejections, losses, missed opportunities, the list goes on. Hope and our communities guide us through those hard moments, and they always will. Regardless of how you feel about the results of today’s election, you will always have hope and your community around you.” The memo continued: “For those of you from divided families, we see you. In a time when our media and access to the truth has never been more divisive, let’s remember that unity and compassion are the greatest weapons against hate. As a company, we stand for hope, and we want to be a part of your community. We stand with you. We stand together. That will never change. We are so incredibly proud of the people you are and the work you’re doing.” Verve’s leadership concluded the message by informing staff that donuts and pizza would be provided in the afternoon.",
