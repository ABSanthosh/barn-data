  "text": "Reteaming once again after collaborating on the 2022 biographical drama “The Silent Twins,” Focus Features has recently acquired a new sci-fi thriller from Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Smoczyńska (“The Lure”) called “Hot Spot.” It marks the second English-language film from the director with Focus picking it up for global distribution, excluding Poland, Greece, and France. Shot in Greece and featuring an original script from Robert Bolesto, the official synopsis for “Hot Spot” reads, “Set in a near future society ruled by sentient A.I., a private eye investigates a murder case only to discover a rebel group capable of undermining the digital overlord.” Of Smoczyńska, Focus Features President of Production and Acquisitions Kiska Higgs said “Agnieszka is a singular visionary whose work — be it about vampire mermaids, silent twins or a tech-ruled society — is both visually astounding and thematically prophetic, and we can’t wait to share her latest with the world.”  Smoczyńska added, “I’m honored to work with Focus Features. Their remarkable achievements in film are matched only by their unwavering respect and support for directors. With ‘Hot Spot,’ my goal is to create an immersive cinematic experience that captures the essence of today’s world, where advanced technology feels like magic, and love is intricately tied to fear.” The film stars Andrzej Konopka (“The Lure”), BAFTA nominee Noomi Rapace (“The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo”), and Reika Kirishima (“Drive My Car”), and is produced by Smoczyńska’s longtime producing partner, Klaudia Śmieja-Rostworowska, as well as Bogna Szewczyk-Skupień on behalf of the Polish production company Madants. Co-producers on “Hot Spot” include Neda Film’s Amanda Livanou, Film i Väst’s Kristina Börjeson, Zentropa’s Lizette Jonjic, Beata Ryczkowska and Filip Bałdyga for Canal+ Polska, and Adam Gudell from Moderator Inwestycje. Gregory Jankilevitsch, Marcin Czernik, Christos V. Konstantakopulos also serve as executive producers. Michelle Momplaisir will oversee the project on behalf of Focus Features. Iddo Arad, Focus Features’ Senior Vice President of Business Affairs, brokered the acquisition with Przybecki \u0026 Partners negotiating on behalf of the producers. Financing for the film was put together by Mid March Media, Madants, and New Europe Film Sales, with Marcin Łuczaj and Jan Naszewski also executive producing and co-financing from the Polish Film Institute and the Hellenic Film \u0026 Audiovisual Center — Creative Greece.",
