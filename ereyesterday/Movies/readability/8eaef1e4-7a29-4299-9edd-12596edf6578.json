  "text": "Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg aren’t too crazy about the idea of remaking “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.” The duo who co-created series “The Studio” said while in the Criterion Closet that they are constantly asked to revisit Stanley Kramer’s 1963 feature for a reboot. “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World” starred Mickey Rooney, Sid Caesar, Ethel Merman, and more, and centered on a group of motorists who witness a car crash in the California desert that leads them on a rat race to find a hidden stash of loot. “I feel like we’ve been asked to remake this movie a lot. This has come around several times,” Goldberg said of the film, to which Rogen replied, “Every three years we get a request to remake ‘It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.’ […] It actually has amazing physical comedy in it.” However, Goldberg has not watched it before…and doesn’t plan to, despite Rogen putting the disc in his bag. “No [I haven’t watched it] and I never will,” Goldberg said when Rogen asked him to. Also during their visit, Rogen revealed that their feature “This Is the End” is his version of Albert Brooks’ “Defending Your Life.” Rogen deemed Brooks “one of the greatest of all time,” and cited how “This Is the End” was an homage. “Me and Evan explicitly ripped off the ending for this movie when we were making our movie ‘This Is the End,'” he said of the ensemble comedy. “We did some work to change it but it is essentially the same ending.” Rogen and Goldberg recently told IndieWire that they wanted to cast an array of stars for Hollywood satire series “The Studio.” “Not only are they famous people, but the role they occupy in Hollywood is very specific for each person,” co-director and actor Rogen said. “We didn’t want the audience to have to suspend any disbelief when it came to who is famous and who a studio would be excited about working with. Who would you bend over backwards to work with, and who would you be afraid of? Who would you want to like you?”",
