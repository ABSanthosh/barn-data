  "text": "Scarlett Johansson received a special welcome to “Jurassic World” by former franchise lead Bryce Dallas Howard. Johansson, who stars in the latest installment “Jurassic World Rebirth,” told People that Howard was so supportive of her casting. “When I first got cast, Bryce Dallas Howard reached out to me and was so excited,” Johansson said. “She wrote me a whole long email about her experience and how wonderful the fans were and how that was part of the excitement, joining the ‘Jurassic’ family and having these fans for life.” Johansson has previously voiced that it was one of her career goals to join the franchise for years. Howard starred in “Jurassic World” (2015), “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” (2018), and “Jurassic World Dominion” (2022). Howard told ScreenRant that she might even star in another installment later down the road. “For myself as a fan, I am so excited for ‘Jurassic World Rebirth.’ I’m going to be there in the theater opening day, and they have an amazing cast,” Howard said. “I mean, Mahershala Ali, Scarlett Johansson, Jonathan Bailey. It’s going to be absolutely fantastic. I’m excited. And then maybe in 20 years or something like that, if they ever asked, of course, I would be back in a heartbeat.” Of course, there may have to be some changes to Howard’s character. After the viral high heels controversy for her character Claire’s wardrobe when running from dinosaurs, Howard also came clean about some difficulties on set. Howard claimed that it wasn’t until Colin Trevorrow directed 2022’s “Jurassic World: Dominion” that she was allowed to use her “natural body” on set; Howard formerly had been repeatedly asked by the studio to “lose weight” for the role. “On the third movie, it was actually because there were so many women cast, it was something that Colin [Trevorrow, director] felt very strongly about in terms of protecting me because the conversation came up again, ‘We need to ask Bryce to lose weight,'” she said. (Trevorrow helmed “Jurassic World” and “Jurassic World: Dominion,” and previously penned the sequel “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,” which was directed by J.A. Bayona.) Howard also credited co-star Chris Pratt for helping her negotiate her trilogy salary back in 2014. Reports circulated in 2018 that Howard was making $8 million compared to Pratt’s $10 million for “Fallen Kingdom.” Howard later clarified the details. “The reports were so interesting because I was paid so much less than the reports even said, so much less,” Howard told Insider. “When I started negotiating for ‘Jurassic,’ it was 2014, and it was a different world, and I was at a great disadvantage. And, unfortunately, you have to sign up for three movies, and so your deals are set.” Pratt later tried to remedy the situation by confirming she had pay parity on all other “Jurassic World” properties. “What I will say is that Chris and I have discussed it, and whenever there was an opportunity to move the needle on stuff that hadn’t been already negotiated, like a game or a ride, he literally told me, ‘You guys don’t even have to do anything. I’m going to do all the negotiating. We’re going to be paid the same and you don’t have to think about this, Bryce,’” Howard said of her “Jurassic World: Dominion” co-lead. “I love him so much for doing that. I really do, because I’ve been paid more for those kinds of things than I ever was for the movie.”",
