  "text": "Agatha All Along drove solid audiences for its final two episodes on Wednesday. After one day of streaming, Episode 8 drove 4.6M views, which is up 48% from the premiere, and Episode 9 saw a 26% increase from the premiere with 3.9M views, according to Disney. Disney, like Netflix, defines views as total stream time divided by runtime. It’s likely that the finale’s viewership decrease is due in part to the fact that the two episodes dropped on Disney+ at once, instead of the usual one. Episode 8 was up from the prior episode, which got 4.2M views in one day. So, overall there’s an indication that interest remains strong and Episode 9 could recover those views in the coming days. No data was made available for the premiere episode’s one-day performance. Instead, Disney did reveal that the first episode managed about 9.3M views in 7 days. Watch on Deadline The series broke through on the Nielsen streaming charts in the first two weeks after it premiered, before falling off the list with the debut of Episode 4. According to Nielsen, viewership went down in the second week, with 365M minutes viewed after cracking 400M the week prior. That’s likely because there were two episodes released in the series’ premiere week, so there was more overall runtime available to watch. Only one new episodes released weekly from there, and episodes have been on the shorter side, which puts the series at an overall disadvantage on the Nielsen charts. Disney+ also doesn’t report viewership for every series, so it’s difficult to compare Agatha All Along‘s performance to anything else. Disney released five-day tallies for The Acolyte and Ahsoka, while Percy Jackson and the Olympians got a six-day report. Last October, the company said that Loki Season 2 had racked up 10.9M views in its first three days on the platform, but Loki has remained one of the streamer’s strongest performing live-action Marvel series to date. Disney never released data for Agatha’s predecessor WandaVision, though that series was also quite popular and did break onto the Nielsen streaming charts. In Agatha All Along, the infamous Agatha Harkness finds herself down and out of power after the suspicious goth Teen helps break her free from a distorted spell. Her interest is piqued when he begs her to take him on the legendary Witches’ Road, a magical gauntlet of trials that, if survived, rewards a witch with what they’re missing. Together, Agatha and this mysterious Teen pull together a desperate coven and set off down, down, down The Road.",
