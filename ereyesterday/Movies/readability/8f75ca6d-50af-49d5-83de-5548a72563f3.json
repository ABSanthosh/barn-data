  "text": "Zoe Saldaña hopes to see Star Trek 4 get finished up at some point, and recently lamented the fact that they didn’t make the movie a bit earlier. What did Zoe Saldaña say about Star Trek 4? Speaking to Deadline recently, Saldaña said that she wishes the team behind the film were able to have made the movie “sooner rather than later” due to how much older they are, joking that everyone is now filled with gray hair. “I wish we were able to do it sooner rather than later,” said Saldaña. “I feel like a lot of us have a full head of gray hair, so we need to do this quickly, if this is the same cast that’s going to reprise it again.” As far as what she hopes to see in the upcoming movie, Saldana said that the relationship between Uhura and Spock (played by Zachary Quinto) would make the most sense to explore in any future project. “It’s been a minute since I reconnected with Star Trek and all the characters’ journeys,” Saldaña said. “But Uhura and Spock were always sort of drawn to each other, it just makes sense to see what is the next step in their relationship and their work relationship as well.” The last we heard from the fourth entry in the sci-fi film was that Steve Yockey, the creator of the Max drama series The Flight Attendant, had joined the film as its new writer. It has already been nearly five years since Paramount Pictures confirmed the development of Star Trek 4. Since then, the project has undergone multiple creative changes including director changes. Last year, fans began doubting if Star Trek 4 would ever get made after Paramount decided to remove it from their 2023 theatrical release schedule. In early 2022, during Paramount’s Investors Day Presentation, producer J.J. Abrams confirmed that Star Trek 4 was indeed in active development with the original cast expected to return including Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, John Cho, and Simon Pegg. As of the now, the project currently has no director attached to it yet after WandaVision’s Matt Shakman exited the movie due to scheduling conflicts with Marvel Studios’ Fantastic Four.
