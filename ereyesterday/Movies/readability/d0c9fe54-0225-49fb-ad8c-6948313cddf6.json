  "description": "\"All that matters now... is how we react.\" Magnolia Pictures has unveiled an official trailer for an intense post-apocalyptic survival thriller called 40 Acres. The film marks the feature directorial debut of Canadian filmmaker R.T. Thorne, known for his many music videos previously. It premiered at the 2024 Toronto Film Festival last year and arrives to watch in the US in theaters starting in July this summer. Catch it on the big screen! After a series of plagues and wars leaves society in ruins, the Freemans are surviving — even thriving — on a farm in the middle of nowhere... so long as they repel the occasional raiding party. But what good is surviving the end of the world if it means snuffing out your own humanity? In a post-apocalyptic world with food scarcity, a Black family of Canadian farmers descended from American Civil War migrants defend their homestead against vicious cannibals trying to acquire their resources. The film stars Danielle Deadwyler, Michael Greyeyes, Kataem O'Connor, Milcania Diaz-Rojas, and many others. This looks much more interesting and unsettling than expected, and the reviews quoted in here hint that it really is worth a watch. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) […]",

This looks much more interesting and unsettling than expected, and the reviews quoted in here hint that it really is worth a watch. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for R.T. Thorne's survival thriller 40 Acres, direct from YouTube: After a series of plagues and wars leaves society in ruins, the Freemans are surviving — even thriving — on a farm in the middle of nowhere... so long as they repel the occasional raiding party. Former soldier Hailey (Danielle Deadwyler) and her partner Galen (Michael Greyeyes) fled the collapse along with their children, training them to fight (and, yes, kill). But now Hailey’s eldest Emanuel (Kataem O’Connor) is a young man, and when he meets a young woman (Milcania Diaz-Rojas) in the forest beyond the fence, his need for human contact could place the whole family in jeopardy. 40 Acres is directed by Canadian indie filmmaker R.T. Thorne, making his first feature film after directing episodes of the series \"Utopia Falls\", \"Kung Fu\", \"The Porter\", and \"The Lake\", plus tons of other music videos as well. The screenplay is by R.T. Thorne \u0026 Glenn Taylor; from a story by R.T. Thorne \u0026 Lora Campbell. Produced by Jennifer Holness. This initially premiered at the 2024 Toronto Film Festival last year. Magnolia Pics will release Thorne's 40 Acres film in select US theaters starting July 2nd, 2025 this summer.
