  "text": "Greg Gumbel, a sports broadcaster for CBS for more than 20 years who covered the NFL and college basketball, died Friday of cancer. He was 78. CBS Sports shared a statement from his wife Marcy and daughter Michelle Gumbel, who said, “It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of our beloved husband and father, Greg Gumbel. He passed away peacefully surrounded by much love after a courageous battle with cancer. Greg approached his illness like one would expect he would, with stoicism, grace, and positivity. He leaves behind a legacy of love, inspiration and dedication to over 50 extraordinary years in the sports broadcast industry; and his iconic voice will never be forgotten. Greg’s memory will forever be treasured by his family, dearest friends, colleagues and all who loved him.” The older brother of TV newsman Bryant Gumbel, Greg Gumbel started out at a local Chicago station before joining ESPN in 1979, the year it launched. He anchored “SportsCenter” and did play-by-play for NBA games. He earned a local Emmy Award for hosting programming for the Madison Square Garden Network. In 1989, he moved to CBS Sports, where he announced NFL and college basketball games and hosted “The NFL Today.” Popular on Variety Gumbel moved briefly to NBC, then returned to CBS and became part of the net’s March Madness coverage and announced NFL games. Earlier this year, he stepped away from his March Madness coverage at CBS. Born in New Orleans, he grew up in Chicago and graduated from Loras College. David Berson, president of CBS Sports, said in a statement, “The CBS Sports family is devastated by the passing of Greg Gumbel. There has never been a finer gentleman in all of television. He was beloved and respected by those of us who had the honor to call him a friend and colleague. A tremendous broadcaster and gifted storyteller, Greg led one of the most remarkable and groundbreaking sports broadcasting careers of all time. He was a familiar and welcoming voice for fans across many sports, including the NFL and March Madness, highlighted by the Super Bowl and Final Four. Greg broke barriers and set the standard for others to follow. It is an extremely sad day for all of us at CBS Sports and the entire sports community. We will miss Greg dearly, and send our deepest condolences to his wife Marcy, daughter Michelle, and his entire family.” His friend and former co-worker, producer Dan Forer, wrote on X, “The holidays are supposed to be filled with joy, but they are often mixed with sorrow. I just learned that my dear friend Greg Gumbel has passed. Greg was the best announcer a young producer/director could have… In addition to being a true professional he was a kind, magnificent man. May his memory be a treasured blessing for his family and friends.”",
