  "text": "Sam Mendes’ upcoming The Beatles movie has reportedly found its Yoko Ono, according to a new report from The InSneider’s Jeff Sneider. Who is rumored to be playing Yoko Ono in The Beatles movies? According to Sneider, Anna Sawai (Shogun) is the current “clear frontrunner” to play the role of the Japanese multimedia artist and singer. While nothing is concrete as of yet, Sawai is being looked at by Sony and Sam Mendes to take on the role. Ono and John Lennon’s relationship is extremely famous, with the pair originally meeting in 1966, and later going onto marry in 1969. Together, the pair released several albums of music under many names, including the Plastic Ono Band. Following Lennon’s death in 1980, Ono worked to preserve his legacy in a variety of ways, including funding the Strawberry Fields memorial in Manhattan’s Central Park, the Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland, and a museum dedicated to Lennon in Saitama, Japan. Mendes’ upcoming Beatles movie hasn’t officially confirmed its full cast just yet, but it has been heavily rumored that the main four stars will be Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney, Joseph Quinn as George Harrison, Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr, and Harry Dickinson as John Lennon. In February 2024, Mendes and Sony Pictures Entertainment announced plans to make four Beatles’ films. Each film will follow a different member of the band’s point of view. Mendes plans to direct all four movies. No writers have officially been announced for the movies. This marks the first time the Beatles and Apple Corps Ltd. have granted the full rights to their life story and music catalogue. Mendes will produce alongside Neal Street Productions partner Pippa Harris and Neal Street’s Julie Pastor. Jeff Jones will executive produce for Apple Corps Ltd. Filming is expected to begin in 2025 in the UK. All four movies are projected to release in 2027. (Source: The InSneider)",
