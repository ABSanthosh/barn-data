  "text": "With final Oscar balloting closed on February 18, we’re continuing with our eighth annual series of interviews with Academy voters from different branches for their unfiltered takes on what got picked, overlooked, and overvalued in the 2025 award season. Voter’s picks in bold. Interview edited for brevity. Best Picture I voted for “Emelia Pérez,” the most interesting, innovative, creative picture of the year. I went to a screening early on, so I didn’t have expectations, except that I liked [Jacques Audiard’s] other films. I love the music. I’m sad about all the stuff about Karla Sofía [Gascón]. Am I not going to look at a Picasso painting ever again? He was a shit. Am I not going to watch a Woody Allen film? It’s a slippery slope when you start with the personality of the people in the movie. Who’s perfect? It has to be about if the content of the movie is egregious, or whatever. The next one was “Anora,” which was clever and funny. I was so happy to be laughing. All the performances were terrific. And it took you into this crazy world. And I’ve liked his [Sean Baker] other films, too. And then “A Complete Unknown.” And then the Brazilian art film “I’m Still Here.” And then “Nickel Boys,” which I didn’t love, actually, but I like that filmmaker [RaMell Ross], and I appreciate what he tried to do. I don’t think he succeeded, but it was a good effort. So then I went for “Conclave,” which I enjoyed, and “The Brutalist,” which I didn’t, and “Wicked.” I hated “The Substance.” I thought I had to put all 10 down, otherwise it would affect the outcome. Best Actor Timothée Chalamet was fabulous, brilliant. To be able to act, sing, and play the guitar, that was a trifecta. I didn’t vote for Adrien Brody because I didn’t love “The Brutalist.” It was pretentious and over-the-top. The first half was OK. The second half? Thank God I could watch it in the comfort of my home and take a break and come back the next night. Supporting Actor Edward Norton, oh, my God. I didn’t even know it was him for the first five minutes [of “A Complete Unknown”]. I thought he was extraordinary, too. Also, it’s another person that we know [Pete Seeger], and for us, our generation, we have that context. But he was just so touching. Best Actress Karla Sofía GascónGetty Images for Palm Springs In Karla Sofía Gascón. It’s fucking tragic she won’t win. It was an extraordinary performance. Better that wins than fucking Demi Moore. I just so hated [“The Substance”]. And Cynthia Erivo was actually too old for “Wicked.” Supporting Actress Zoe Saldaña was fantastic. Monica Barbaro was such a nothing role. Isabella Rossellini was great, but she was barely there. I get annoyed when they put up people that are barely in the movie. It’s a bit unfair. Adapted Screenplay Of course, “Emilia Pérez.” Original Screenplay “Anora.” Animated Feature “Flow,” because it was beautiful. Animated Short “Beautiful Men,” where a guy was going for a hair transplant. “Yuck!” was very cute. Cinematography I went with “Emilia Pérez” again. It looked great and was part of an outstanding film. Best Costume Design “A Complete Unknown.” I don’t go for the splashier stuff. It’s hard to capture a period, which [Arianne Phillips] did so perfectly. In a way, the costumes didn’t stand out, which was perfectly appropriate for that film. But they were completely accurate, and the whole thing was seamless. And particularly when you’re talking about a real person [Bob Dylan], it’s tricky to get right. I didn’t like the costumes on “Wicked.” It’s too much, and there’s nothing witty about it. I assume that will win. Director Jacques Audiard for “Emilia Pérez,” just for the inventiveness of it. “A Complete Unknown” and “Anora” were definitely close. Documentary Feature I voted for “No Other Land” because I’m so upset. I’m Jewish, and I want that film to be seen by as many people as possible. I don’t think it’s the best filmmaking; probably, “Porcelain War” is a better-made film. I don’t how they did that animation, but it was gorgeous. It was a real toss-up between those two. I had to vote for “No Other Land” for political reasons. I don’t know how you can see that film and not have compassion for those people. That scene where they destroy the school? What the fuck! They want to destroy them in every way. ‘No Other Land’ Editing “Emilia Pérez” again. International Feature Film “Emilia Pérez.” It’s weirdly unfair when they’re in both categories [as “Emilia Pérez” is also nominated for Best Picture], because I feel the other films don’t have a chance. You should be in one category or the other. “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” is good; “I’m Still Here” is good. Live Action Short “I Am Not a Robot” is very relatable. Makeup and Hairstyling “Emilia Pérez.” I’m not voting for that horrible “Substance,” which will probably win. I felt traumatized by that film. I felt that I had spent two hours that I will never recover. Original Score. “Emilia Pérez” again. Original Song “El Mal” from “Emilia Pérez.” Production Design “The Brutalist,” because for $10 million they did an amazing job. That aspect of it, I completely appreciated. Sound “A Complete Unknown.” He was singing live; it must have been quite a headache for everyone. Visual Effects “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.”",
