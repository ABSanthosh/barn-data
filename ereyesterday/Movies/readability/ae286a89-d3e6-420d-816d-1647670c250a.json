  "text": "S.W.A.T. has ran out of lives. CBS has canceled the police drama starring Shemar Moore, now in its eighth season. If you are having a case of deja vu, that is because, after a string of early renewals, S.W.A.T. was dramatically canceled in May 2023 after six seasons only for CBS to reverse the decision days later with a pickup of what was announced at the time as a seventh and final season. Flash-forward to May 2024 when S.W.A.T. was surprisingly renewed for an eighth season. Don’t expect another miraculous reprieve; this time the decision is believed to be final — and permanent. The last two years, S.W.A.T. lead studio Sony Pictures Television was able to propose financial terms that were appealing to CBS, sealing 11th hour pickups. This time, I hear CBS did not engage in renewal talks, opting instead to outright end the series. This is the third high-profile drama cancellation at the network this week, following the axing of FBI: Most Wanted and FBI: International. All three come from outside studios, Sony TV and Universal Television. This leaves Universal TV’s Equalizer as the only drama series left on the bubble, along with midseason entry Watson, from CBS Studios, which is still in its first weeks on the air but is looking promising for renewal. Watch on Deadline As Deadline reported last month, given its history, S.W.A.T. was an obvious candidate for cancellation as it is lower rated than the other dramas on the bubble this year — including the FBI spinoffs. But it has still been a sturdy performer tasked with the thankless job of keeping the lights on Friday. “It’s heartbreaking news, primarily because it’s been such an immense pleasure working with this cast and crew to put out a show that we’ve always been proud of,” S.W.A.T. executive producer/showrunner Andrew Dettmann said. “They are truly an extraordinary group of people who have all worked so hard and have been so dedicated for all these eight seasons, overcoming countless challenges. I can’t give them enough credit. I feel so privileged to have been a part of the S.W.A.T. family.” S.W.A.T. is a rare broadcast drama filming in Los Angeles. Following the cancellation, executive producer and former showrunner Shawn Ryan spoke of the series’ crew that will now be out of work. “It’s been an extraordinary privilege to work on S.W.A.T. for eight seasons and tell the stories of Hondo and 20-Squad,” he said. “I thank our fans, Shemar Moore, the rest of our cast, our producers, Sony Pictures Television, CBS Studios and CBS for the opportunity. Most of all I want to thank our tireless, dedicated crew who made our writers, directors and cast always look good. My greatest concern right now is for them.” Speaking with Deadline in January, Ryan shared concerns over the fate of S.W.A.T. in light of the pending ownership change at CBS. “The show I think is beloved in the executive ranks at CBS, the show is beloved by our audience,” he said at the rime. “But we also understand that a corporate change is happening in that world. I don’t know what the plans are. I don’t know what the criteria for renewal is going to be. It seems like it could be much different than years past.” He referred to the pending acquisition of CBS parent Paramount Global by Skydance, which is slated to close in the first half of the year. All CBS drama series given early renewals earlier this season for 2025-26 are produced by CBS Studios. Additionally, Universal TV’s FBI is in the first year of a three-season pickup.",
