Next up, Variety has learned that Warner Bros. Discovery true crime network Investigation Discovery is readying its own take on the story, which has dominated headlines in recent days. The project, with the working title “Who Is Luigi Mangione?” is set to premiere in February. TV host, reporter and Law \u0026 Crime founder Dan Abrams is behind the hour-long special, which ID confirmed, adding that it would delve “into the lingering questions surrounding Mangione’s arrest and explores how a young man of such wealth and privilege could seemingly commit such a heinous crime” while aiming to “explore the psychology behind the alleged assassin.” Abrams is CEO and Founder of Abrams Media, chief legal affairs correspondent for ABC News, host of NewsNation’s “Dan Abrams Live” and Reelz’s “On Patrol: Live,” and also has a show on SiriusXM. The ID special will feature him and “other experts, industry insiders, and people close to Mangione,” ID added, and “will examine his mental state and investigate the theories surrounding the events that led to his arrest.” Popular on Variety This reps the third Mangione-related project to be revealed on Monday.
