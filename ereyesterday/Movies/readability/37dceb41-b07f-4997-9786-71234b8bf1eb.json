  "text": "On Monday, November 9, Luigi Mangione was arrested as a suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO, Brian Thompson. This has led many people to wonder who Luigi Mangione is and what background hails from. Notably, Thompson was fatally shot in New York City while heading toward a meeting with the investors. Here are all the available details about Mangione and his suspected connection to the shooting. Who is Luigi Mangione? The authorities apprehended Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the Brian Thompson murder case, at a McDonald’s restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania. The arrest happened after someone recognized him. The police reportedly found, among other things, a black 3D-printed pistol with a loaded Glock magazine a 3D-printed black silencer, and several fake IDs on Mangione’s person. Mangione belongs to an affluent family from Baltimore, Maryland. He grew up there and also reportedly has connections to California. Mangione’s last known address before his arrest was in Honolulu, Hawaii. He seemingly didn’t have any reports of arrest in New York and other states. According to the police, Luigi Mangione might have received schooling at a college in Pennsylvania, something that social media handles attributed to him appear to corroborate. A Gilman School graduate, he reportedly attended the University of Pennsylvania, earning Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in computer and information science in 2020. Moreover, the LinkedIn page attributed to Mangione claims that he is a data engineer working for TrueCar, Inc. He served as an intern at UI Programming and was the founder of UPGRade, the purported first-ever video game development club. According to Freddie Leatherbury, a former classmate of Mangione, the latter “had everything going for him.” Meanwhile, another friend dubbed him as a “super normal” and “smart person.” (via BBC) The police claim that the three-page, handwritten document they discovered on Mangione sheds light on why he might have taken such a drastic action. An officer reportedly informed The New York Times that Mangione wrote in the document, “These parasites had it coming.” He also wrote, “I do apologize for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done.” Further, multiple outlets reported that Luigi Mangione was struggling with issues with his back and underwent surgery. It’s unclear whether his experience of directly dealing with the US healthcare system has anything to do with his purported actions.",
