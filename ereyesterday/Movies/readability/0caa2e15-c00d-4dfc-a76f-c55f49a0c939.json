  "text": "Sony Music Labels has made its first foray into animated character content with the acquisition of full rights to “Spookiz,” the globally popular non-verbal animation series that has amassed 6.1 million YouTube subscribers and over 3.1 billion total views. The deal marks a significant strategic shift for the Tokyo-based music company, which has primarily focused on recording business throughout its history. “Spookiz” centers on five adorable monsters who come to life at an elementary school in the middle of the night. The characters include Cula (a boastful Dracula), Frankie (a kindhearted Frankenstein obsessed with food), Kebbi (an energetic Goblin), Kongkong (a slightly devious Chinese Ghost), and Zizi (a charming zombie with a smell). Popular on Variety The short-form content, featuring 1-3 minute episodes, has built a substantial international fanbase across the U.S., Asia (including the Philippines, Singapore, India, and Japan), Latin America (Brazil and Mexico), and Europe (particularly the U.K.). The company plans to leverage its music industry expertise to create new “Spookiz” content that incorporates musical elements, targeting a broader age demographic. Sony Music Labels will produce new animations and launch a new season while developing additional characters. The acquisition includes a partnership with Keyring Co., Ltd., the South Korea-based animation studio behind the original content, known for its creative prowess and production capabilities. Sony Music Labels aims to enhance the property’s global reach through what it calls “innovative marketing” and content “filled with originality.” The company’s strategy involves treating the animated characters similarly to how it develops musical artists, creating “heartfelt activities through animation, music, and other mediums.” “Sony Music Labels is embarking on a new challenge,” said representative director and president Manabu Tsujino. “As a record company, Sony Music Labels has acquired the globally beloved ‘Spookiz.’ Building on the expertise cultivated in the music business and with the support of creators and partners, Sony Music Labels will aim to transform these monsters into stars, much like the way artists are developed.” The “Spookiz” brand maintains active social media presence across multiple platforms, including Instagram, TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), and Facebook, in addition to its primary YouTube distribution channel and official website at spookizworld.com.",
