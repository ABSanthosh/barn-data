  "text": "Andor Season 2 is about to drop its last three episodes. It is expected to be a rollercoaster of emotions, closing Cassian Andor’s journey in the rebellion. With the second season coming to an end, fans are curious about the series’ next installments. So, is Andor canceled or renewed for a Season 3? Here is everything you need to know about the potential next season of the sci-fi fantasy drama. Is Andor Season 3 canceled by Disney+? No, Andor Season 3 has not been canceled by Disney+. However, it won’t be renewed either. Season 2 will air its final three episodes on May 13, 2025. There has been curiosity regarding an extra number of episodes due to streaming platforms’ trend of splitting well-known shows’ seasons into parts. However, Andor Season 2 is not following this release pattern. Further, fans were looking to the Star Wars series’ next chapters. Sadly, Andor won’t be renewed for more seasons, but it has not been canceled by the streaming platform either. The series will come to a conclusive end with the second installment. For the unversed, Andor was originally planned as a five-season arc by creator Tony Gilroy. He wanted every chapter to cover one year of Cassian Andor’s life. The events would eventually lead to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, ending the rebels’ journey with a sacrifice. However, during the production of Season 1, Gilroy began feeling overwhelmed with the idea of more seasons. Soon, he and lead actor Diego Luna concluded that the two parts would be enough. In an interview with Empire Magazine, Gilroy recalled feeling pressured by his original plans. He stated, “Oh my God, we are going to have to come up with another 12 hours of story? So I was already panicked. We already said we were going to do five years [of timeline], that was the concept. How do you get out of that?” Further, Luna felt emotional for his journey in Andor as he told Deadline, “I said goodbye to this character when we wrapped… I’m going to miss this family.” While Andor is ending, it will be exciting to see if the show’s story will be explored in future spin-offs of the Star Wars Universe.",
