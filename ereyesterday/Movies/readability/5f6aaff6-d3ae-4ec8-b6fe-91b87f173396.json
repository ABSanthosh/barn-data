He also faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm. Carwyle’s arrangement is set for May 8, with his bail set at $150,000. If convicted, Carwyle could serve three years in state prison. Popular on Variety According to the Los Angeles DA, Carwyle was accused of harassing Aniston from March 1, 2023, to May 5 of this year, repeatedly sending her unsolicited emails, voicemails and social media messages. The DA reports that on May 5 at approximately 12:20 p.m., Carwyle crashed his car into the front gate of Aniston’s Bel Air residence and stopped in her driveway. He was apprehended by a security guard before police arrived on the scene. “I want to thank law enforcement and our Stalking and Threat Assessment Team, particularly Deputy District Attorney Sam Hulefeld, for their outstanding work in this case,” Hochman continued. “By working together, we are ensuring that dangerous individuals are taken off our streets.”",
