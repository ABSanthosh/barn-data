  "text": "With last year’s ceremony taking place in the shadow of the 2023 strikes and this year’s function in the aftermath of the Southern California wildfires, the 2025 WGA Awards have a lot of work to do when it comes to lifting the spirits of the entertainment industry. Thankfully, good writing always has. As is tradition, events for the east and west coast branches of the Writer’s Guild are held concurrently today at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles and the Edison Ballroom in New York City. LA’s affair is hosted by actor/comedian Joel Kim Booster and kicks off at 4:30pm PT. For those who want to tune in at home, you can watch the west coast soiree via livestream at that time. While under normal circumstances, tonight’s results wouldn’t necessarily carry much water when it comes to the Oscars, this year’s awards race continues to keep everyone on their toes. Many screenplays that are nominated at the 97th Academy Awards, including “Sing Sing,” “Conclave,” “Emilia Pérez,” “September 5,” and “The Brutalist,” were in fact not eligible for nomination with the WGA as they were written by non-members. A similar circumstance arose last year in that Justine Triet and Arthur Harari took home the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (“Anatomy of a Fall”), but were not considered for the same prize by the WGA. However, last year’s WGA Award winner for Adapted Screenplay, Cord Jefferson (“American Fiction”), did go on to win in the same category at the Oscars. This year, Sean Baker looks to pull off a trifecta with “Anora” after scoring both Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Theatrical Feature Film at the DGA Awards and the Darryl F. Zanuck Award for Outstanding Producer of Theatrical Motion Pictures at the PGA Awards (an honor he shared with his wife, producer Samantha Quan). Meanwhile in television and streaming, new shows like “Shōgun” and “Fallout” aim to make a mark, while returning series like “Hacks” and “Abbott Elementary” each wish to beat out “The Bear.” David Lynch will also be receiving a posthumous Screen Laurel Award, while “Breaking Bad” creator Vince Gilligan will be accepting the Paddy Chayefsky Laurel Award for Television. Keep reading below for a list of nominees and follow along live to find out who wins.
