  "text": "Amazon MGM Studios has signed a wide-ranging deal with Dallas Jenkins’ 5\u00262 Studios, giving the studio exclusive US streaming rights to the first five seasons and future of faith-based series The Chosen and new unscripted series The Chosen in The Wild With Bear Grylls for Prime Video. The pact also includes theatrical distribution and streaming rights to new releases, The Chosen‘s final two season six and seven seasons, which follows the New Testament stories about the crucifixion and the resurrection. On top of all of this, Amazon MGM Studios has inked a first-look series and feature deal with 5\u00262 Studios. Season 5 of The Chosen will hit theaters on March 28 during Holy week and drop on Prime Video this June. The series will be available on Prime Video in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Sub-Saharan Africa, UK, and Latin America at a later date this year. Jenkins writes, directs and produces The Chosen via 5\u00262 Studios. The Chosen follows the life of Jesus Christ against the backdrop of Roman oppression in first-century Israel where the prophet is betrayed by friends and powerful leaders are plotting his death.   Today’s news was announced via 5\u00262 Studios’ live stream on YouTube, featuring a conversation with Vernon Sanders, head of television, Amazon MGM Studios; Traci Blackwell, development executive, Amazon MGM Studios; and Jenkins, Chairman and Chief Creative Officer of 5\u00262 Studios and creator/EP of The Chosen and The Chosen In The Wild with Bear Grylls.  Watch on Deadline The Chosen in The Wild With Bear Grylls is a six-episode unscripted series from 5\u00262 Studios distributed worldwide by Lionsgate along with The Chosen. From Judas to Jesus, faith-based author and survivalist Grylls takes the cast of The Chosen, as well as Jenkins, on their own adventures into the wilderness. The series follows as Grylls pushes The Chosen ensemble to their ultimate limits, while discovering their personal journeys. “The Chosen has had renowned success captivating audiences across generations, and we are looking forward to collaborating with Dallas and 5\u00262 Studios on a larger scale,” said Sanders. “As we look ahead, we see massive opportunities to develop additional faith-inspired content for our global Prime Video customers.”  Courtesy of Lionsgate and Prime Video CAA represented 5\u00262 Studios on the deal, together with Andrew Kramer of Willkie Farr \u0026 Gallagher, LLP. Lionsgate hammered out the wide-ranging deal. The 5\u00262 Studios deal is similar to other Lionsgate third-party deals ala the one the Santa Monica, CA studio negotiated for Hulu to take U.S. streaming rights on Schitt’s Creek. At the time in 2022, that multi-year deal was the latest in a string of nine-figure library transactions in the streaming sector, with shows like The Office, Friends and Seinfeld switching domestic homes. Recently, Prime Video closed a multi-year agreement for Lionsgate movies giving the streamer an exclusive early window to the studio’s pics after their exclusive first-run window on Starz. The deal commences with Lionsgate’s 2026 theatrical releases and also includes the studio’s 2025 slate and a commitment for licensing library movies and TV.",
