Richards and Moore will depart imminently and, interestingly, Lionsgate will not actively pursue replacements. Instead, film studio head Adam Fogelson will take a more active role in the department with the existing leadership, according to a company insider. That means Amanda Kozlowski (Executive VP Strategy \u0026 Chief of Staff), Jack Teed (Executive VP Global Creative Advertising) and Nasim Cambron (Executive VP Worldwide Publicity) will combine to report to Fogelson. Popular on Variety “In looking at our slate ahead, we have decided to reapproach our marketing group to meet the needs of a rapidly changing market. As we redefine the way we explore our campaigns, JP Richards and Keri Moore will be transitioning from their roles at the studio,” Fogelson said. “Transitions are never easy, especially when they involve longtime friends and colleagues, but I am beyond grateful for their creativity, partnership, and immense talent, and they have my full love and support as they take the next step in their careers.” The decision is jarring, given Lionsgate will need to stick the landing on several movies this fall, including Francis Lawrence’s Stephen King adaptation “The Long Walk,” a threequeel to the studio’s resuscitated magic franchise “Now You See Me, Now You Don’t,” and the highly-anticipated film version of the best-selling book “The Housemaid.” “The last three years have been some of the most deeply rewarding of my life. I got to reunite with my mentor and friend Adam, dive into the heart of the work with the fearless Keri, and create alongside the most innovative, forward-thinking, generation-defying, TikTok-genius, and above all, genuinely kind team in the business. We dreamed big, pushed boundaries, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I can’t wait to see what they do next!,” said Richards. “There is literally no one other than Adam Fogelson that I would have agreed to traverse the entirety of Los Angeles for each day. It has been a wild and remarkable few years. Amongst returning to post pandemic worldwide theatrical releases — John Wick: Chapter 4 —navigating the strikes — Saw X and The Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds \u0026 Snakes, and a continually changing marketplace — Den of Thieves 2: Pantera, just to name a few, I am so proud of the team that JP and I brought together. They are some of the smartest, kindest, and hardest-working people you will ever meet. We are leaving them in excellent hands with a remarkable go-forward slate. Having seen much of what the team has in store for audiences, there’s a lot to look forward to and I am excited to cheer them on from well east of the 405,” said Moore.",
