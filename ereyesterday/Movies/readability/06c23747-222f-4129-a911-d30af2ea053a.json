  "text": "Oscar nominated DP Mandy Walker has been elected the 48th president of the American Society of Cinematographers. She will be the first woman to lead the century-old honorary society, which was founded in 1919. In 2023, Walker became the first woman to win the top ASC Award for cinematography in a feature film and just the third to receive an Academy Award nomination, both on the strength of her lensing of Baz Luhrmann’s “Elvis.” The Australian cinematographer’s credits include Luhrmann’s “Australia” and films including “Hidden Figures,””The Mountain Between Us,” “Lantana,” “Tracks,” “Snow White” and “Mulan.” “It is a great honor to be the president of the ASC, and an even bigger privilege to be the first woman to hold the position,” said Walker. “I am so humbled to take on the responsibility of representing a society that has carved out an inspiring, inclusive space to meet and support other cinematographers. I am proud of our century-old legacy to advance the art and science of cinematography, and I’m excited for the future of our organization. Popular on Variety “I am intent on making sure our members have the space to grow, the opportunities to educate and learn from one another, and the support of their fellow filmmakers to carve out the best career they can,” added Walker. “We will continue to lead efforts in raising awareness about the importance of representation behind the camera.” She succeeds Shelly Johnson, who reached his term limit and passed the role to Walker with a “warm heart.” Also elected as board officers are vice presidents Eric Steelberg, John Simmons, and Patrick Cady; treasurer Charles Minsky; secretary Dejan Georgevich; and sergeant-at-arms Charlie Lieberman. The members of the ASC Board, elected by the organization’s active membership, also include Natasha Braier, Alice Brooks, Russell Carpenter, Richard Crudo, Karl-Walter Lindenlaub, Tommy Maddox-Upshaw, Erik Messerschmidt, M. David Mullen, Cynthia Pusheck and Amy Vincent. Alternate Board Members include Chris Chomyn, Ernest Dickerson, Polly Morgan and Wally Pfister. Beyond feature films, Walker has worked on commercial projects, including Luhrmann’s Chanel No. 5 campaign featuring Nicole Kidman and Gisele Bündchen. She is a member of the Australian Cinematographer Society and has served as a governor for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Walker has been recognized with accolades including the ACS Cinematographer of the Year Milli Award, multiple Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards, and the Order of Australia Medal.",
