  "text": "The discourse around Love Island USA keeps on growing as viewers get to know the Islanders day by day. As audiences continue to stream the Peacock dating series and new fans join, the streamer issued a “friendly reminder” to be kind to the Islanders. “We appreciate the fans, the passion for the series, and the amazing group of Islanders who are sharing their summer with us,” reads the statement on social media. “Please just remember they’re real people — so let’s be kind and spread the love!” The message comes after growing negativity on social media following the exit of Jeremiah Brown and Hannah Fields at the hands of their fellow Islanders. The boys voted out Jeremiah, and the girls voted out Hannah following a public vote that left both vulnerable and at risk of being dumped. Watch on Deadline RELATED: All Of Ariana Madix’s Outfits As Host Of ‘Love Island USA’ Season 7 Viewers of the dating series have taken to social media to vent about the decision, and many have singled out Ace Greene as the culprit of Jeremiah’s dumping. Some believe Ace was jealous of Jeremiah and wanted him out of the competition to have an easier path to win Season 7.
