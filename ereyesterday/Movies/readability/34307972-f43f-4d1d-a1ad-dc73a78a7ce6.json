Welling was taken into custody by Yreka police in an Arby’s parking lot just after midnight Jan. 26 in the northern California city. He was booked for driving under the influence with a blood alcohol level at or above 0.08%, according to TMZ, which first reported his arrest. He was released from custody a couple hours later, according to sheriff’s department records. No further details are known at this time. Welling also is known for his portrayal of L.A.P.D. Lieutenant Marcus Pierce in Lucifer. His other series credits include Professionals, Batwoman and Judging Amy, and films including Draft Day, Parkland, Cheaper by the Dozen and Cheaper by the Dozen 2, and The Fog.
