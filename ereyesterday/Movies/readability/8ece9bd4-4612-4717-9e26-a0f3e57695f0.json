Based on the Australian film Five First Dates, the Prarthana Mohan-directed film stars Simone Ashley (Bridgerton, Sex Education) and Hero Fiennes Tiffin (After, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare) as two former flames who reignite at Pia’s younger sister Sonal’s (Anoushka Chadha) wedding. Pia refuses to get married because she wants to expand her photography aspirations as her studio, the Ninth Mandala, struggles to make ends meet. Her best friend Jay, (Luke Fetherston) who is gay, supports her through the wedding chaos and some fierce fights with her family as they all try to set her up on five dates ahead of the wedding so that she has a shot at bringing a plus one. As for the needle drops in the film, yes that is a certain Ted Lasso star singing a very famous radio hit at one point.
