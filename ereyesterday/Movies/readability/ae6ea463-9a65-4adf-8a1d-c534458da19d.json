Talking to Amy Poehler on her “Good Hang” podcast, Black detailed what his act would’ve been if he auditioned for “Saturday Night Live.” “I had an idea in mind that I never went and followed through with,” Black said. “I don’t wanna repeat it because now it really sounds stupid in my mind. But my audition was gonna be, basically I was gonna be a superhero that I created.” Popular on Variety He explained that his audition would’ve been a parody of the classic Marvel hero, the Hulk, mixed with a “performance art dance.” “I don’t remember what it was called,” he said. “But it was like a combination of the Hulk and…maybe it was just the Hulk. I was gonna come in as the Hulk and just jump around and do this weird slow motion kind of performance art dance where I would crush things with my foot and then do a mimed, the earth is cracking.” Black said that he “practiced it in the mirror in my living room a few times,” but felt he “was not gonna get in” and “never pulled the trigger” on auditioning. Poehler reassured Black that he “could’ve been a cast member,” but the “Kung Fu Panda” star said the demanding schedule of “SNL” wouldn’t have worked for him. “I don’t think I could handle it week-in and week-out,” Black explained. “Once every 20 years is more my speed for that gig.”",
