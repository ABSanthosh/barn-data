An unsettling, fascinating film to get caught up in following Hamid's journey. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Jonathan Millet's thriller Ghost Trail, direct from YouTube: Justice knows no border for Hamid (Adam Bessa), who has taken refuge in France after being detained and tortured by the Assad regime in Syria. Exiled and undercover, the mild-mannered literature professor now works as part of a secret group pursuing Assad's enforcers, who have fled Syria and assumed new identities in Europe – including the guard responsible for inflicting unspeakable abuse upon him. Covertly communicating their life-or-death decrees through a multiplayer video game, the undercover cell operates in broad daylight but wrestles with how far they can push their retribution in a land that only faintly recalls Assad’s atrocities. With his mother now living in a refugee camp in Beirut, Hamid puts on a brave face and extols his new life, but the cracks begin to show as he becomes consumed by the hunt. Hot on the trail of a man at his local university (Tawfeek Barhom) who bears a striking resemblance to his torturer, Hamid is sure that he’s identified the culprit, but can he convince his compatriots his intuition is certain? Ghost Trail, also known as Les Fantômes in French, is directed by the French filmmaker Jonathan Millet, director of the films Tell Me About the Stars, The Wake, and La disparition, plus many other short films as well. The screenplay is written by Jonathan Millet and Florence Rochat. Produced by Pauline Seigland. This initially premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival last year, playing in the Critics' Week sidebar. It also played at London, Stockholm, and Chicago Film Festivals last fall. Music Box Films will debut Millet's Ghost Trail film in select US theaters starting on May 30th, 2025. For more info visit the official site. Intrigued?
