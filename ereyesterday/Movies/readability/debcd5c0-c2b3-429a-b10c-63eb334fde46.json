  "description": "\"Show the bastards you're better than them.\" \"I've been ready for years.\" True Brit has revealed an official trailer for a sports movie called Giant, about a famous British-Yemeni boxing champion. No release date is set yet - expected sometime later in the year. Inspired by the real-life story of Prince Naseem \"Naz\" Hamed, a British-Yemeni boxer, and his journey from humble beginnings to becoming a champion and his training under Brendan Ingle – who played a crucial role in his success. About their rise to the top of professional boxing.

The cast includes Ali Saleh, Katherine Dow Blyton, Samir Arrian, Rocco Haynes, Austin Haynes, and Elliot Benn. Looks solid!

About his rise and what happens when you get to the top - Brosnan \u0026 El-Masry look great in it. Here's the first official trailer for Rowan Athale's boxing movie Giant, direct from YouTube: Giant is a sports movie based on the remarkable real-life story of legendary British-Yemeni boxing champ Prince Naseem \"Naz\" Hamed (Amir El-Masry). Charting his inspiring rags-to-riches underdog tale from his humble beginnings in Sheffield to becoming champion of the world and a global sporting icon in the 1990s, the movie explores the unlikely and tender relationship between Naz and his Irish boxing trainer Brendan Ingle; and the instrumental role that Ingle played on his road to success. With exhilarating and visceral scenes in the ring, coupled with deeply moving and intimate moments behind the curtain. Giant is written and directed by the British-Indian filmmaker Rowan Athale, director of the films Wasteland and Strange But True previously, and a writer on the \"Gangs of London\" series. Produced by Stuart Ford, Mark Lane, Kevin Sampson, Ross Williams. This hasn't premiered at any festivals or elsewhere, as far as we know. True Brit will debut Athale's Giant movie in theaters later in 2025 - stay tuned for more news. Who's down? Find more posts in: To Watch, Trailer prev next",
