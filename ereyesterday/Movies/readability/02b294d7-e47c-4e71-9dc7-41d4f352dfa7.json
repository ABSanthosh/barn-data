  "text": "Adin Ross is making headlines after his decision to cancel a lucrative streaming deal with viral sensation Joseph “Lieutenant Dan” Malinowski. The Kick deal, initially promised to Malinowski following his survival of Hurricane Milton, has now been redirected to another Tampa-based streamer. Ross’s unexpected move has sparked widespread discussion among fans. Here’s what we know about the situation and the reasons behind this sudden change. Adin Ross cancels $100,000 Kick deal for Lt. Dan Adin Ross has canceled the $100,000 Kick streaming deal he initially offered to Joseph Malinowski, known as “Lieutenant Dan” (via NBC News). Instead, Ross has decided to give the deal to another Tampa-based streamer, Terrence Concannon, also known as Tampa Terrence. Despite withdrawing the Kick deal, Ross will still follow through on his promise to provide Malinowski with a new boat. Malinowski gained internet fame after riding out two major hurricanes, Helene and Milton, on his small sailboat, sparking widespread concern for his safety. TikTok creator Terrence Concannon documented his story, helping him gain viral attention. Ross had offered Malinowski both the Kick deal and a boat after his survival story resonated with viewers. Ross explained his decision to retract the Kick offer during a livestream. He stated that Terrence would use the deal to create content focused on helping those in need, including hurricane relief efforts. Despite this, Ross emphasized that he still wanted to support Malinowski by giving him the boat. He also encouraged Malinowski to stay sober. Lt. Dan, however, claimed in a livestream that he rejected the Kick offer, rather than it being rescinded. He also accused Concannon of withholding funds from the GoFundMe campaign set up for him. Concannon denied this, explaining that Malinowski lacked a valid ID to access the funds. As Ross shifts focus to supporting Terrence’s efforts in Tampa, the decision leaves Malinowski with a new boat but without the streaming deal. Both figures remain active online, continuing to engage with their respective followers.",
