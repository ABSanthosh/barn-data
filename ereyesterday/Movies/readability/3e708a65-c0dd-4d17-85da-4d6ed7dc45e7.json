  "text": "Severance Season 2 will delve deeper into corporate culture and the concept of a work-life balance. The sophomore season of Dan Erickson’s thriller series, which centers around a surgical procedure that separates the work self from the off-hours self, has taken a long while to complete with the dual strikes in Hollywood. Read on for the full Severance Season 2 release schedule: When does Severance Season 2 premiere? The second season of Severance debuts Jan. 17 on Apple TV+. How many episodes are in Severance Season 2? Season 2 of Severance will contain 10 episodes. This is one more than Season 1’s count of nine. Watch on Deadline Are new episodes of Severance released weekly or all at once? What time are they streaming on Apple TV+? New episodes are targeted to roll out on Fridays after the first one premiered. Each episode will become available to stream Thursday nights as has been proven by the earlier-than-planned release of episodes Thursday evenings (6 p.m. PT and 9 p.m. ET) so far. L-R: Britt Lower, Adam Scott, John Turturro and Dylan Cherry in ‘Severance’ Season 2 Courtesy of Apple TV+ Here’s the full Severance Season 2 release schedule: Friday, Jan. 17: Episode 1 – “Hello, Ms. Cobel” Friday, Jan. 24: Episode 2 – “Goodbye, Mrs. Selvig” Friday, Jan. 31: Episode 3 – “Who Is Alive?” Friday, Feb. 7: Episode 4 – “Woe’s Hollow” Friday, Feb. 14: Episode 5 – “Trojan’s Horse” Friday, Feb. 21: Episode 6 = “Attila” Friday, Feb. 28: Episode 7 Friday, Mar. 7: Episode 8 Friday, Mar. 14: Episode 9 Friday, Mar. 21: Episode 10 What is Severance Season 2 about? Season 2 will continue Mark and the team’s quest to fully unravel the mystery of what it is they actually do at Lumon. They sort macrodata, but beyond that, they don’t actually know what it is they sort and what the outcome of their work is. This could ultimately bridge the “severance” procedure around which the story is centered, because the operation separates work and personal lives. RELATED: ‘Severance’ Season 2 Trailer: Adam Scott’s Mark Gets To The Heart Of Lumon Industries As Innie And Outie Worlds Merge What happened in Severance Season 1? Season 1 had several big reveals that will likely come into play in Season 2. Towards the end of Season 1, Mark S. (Adam Scott) made the connection between his work self and out-of-work self that his supposedly dead wife Gemma (Dichen Lachman) is actually alive. Her severed self worked as the Wellness counselor at Lumon in Season 1. Another discovery that took place during the Overtime Contingency initiated by Mark, Dylan (Zach Cherry), Helly (Britt Lower) and Irving (John Turturro) was that Helly is actually an Eagan, or a member of the founding family behind Lumon. Kier Eagan established the company, and Helly, who goes by Helena when not in her severed self, is the daughter of Jame Eagan, current CEO of the company. Who is in Severance Season 2? Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, John Turturro, Zach Cherry, Jen Tullock, Michael Chernus, Dichen Lachman, Christopher Walken and Patricia Arquette will return to their roles from the first season. Those boarding the series for Season 2 include Alia Shawkat (Search Party), Robby Benson (Beauty and the Beast), Stefano Carannante (Mirabilia), Ólafur Darri Ólafsson (The Tourist), Gwendoline Christie (Game of Thrones), Bob Balaban (The Chair), Merritt Wever (Godless) and John Noble (Fringe).
