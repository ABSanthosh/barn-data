This curiosity only grew following the release of Disney+’s Daredevil: Born Again, which showcases more of the Man Without Fear’s impressive feats. In all of his MCU appearances, Murdock has displayed incredible proficiency in fighting criminals and detecting things or problems, regular humans wouldn’t notice. So, is Matt Murdock a superhuman in Daredevil: Born Again? How do his powers work? Here are all your answers. Is Matt Murdock a superhuman in Daredevil: Born Again? Matt Murdock is, in a way, a superhuman in Daredevil: Born Again. The chemicals from a truck accident that blinded him when he was a boy, as seen in the flashbacks of Netflix’s Daredevil, did not just make him permanently blind, but also enhanced his other senses like taste, touch, and smell, beyond human levels. Murdock initially had difficulty controlling his enhanced senses. However, he managed to hone them with the help of his sensei, Stick, who also taught him various forms of martial arts. By the time he became an adult and pursued his vigilante career, Murdock had developed a “radar sense.” This is basically his second sight and the primary component in his arsenal, that allows him to function as the vigilante, Daredevil. How do Daredevil’s powers work? Daredevil’s main ability is his radar sense, which complements his skill as a martial artist and hand-to-hand combatant. With the help of his “radar sense,” he can track down how close or far away a person is. The ability also allows Daredevil to sense changes in heartbeat, helping him understand when a person is lying or dying. He can also perceive changes in air quality and smells. Moreover, the radar sense allows Daredevil to use the sounds surrounding him to spatially map out his environment. Additionally, this ability rivals, if not surpasses Spider-Man’s Spider-Sense, as it allows Daredevil to quickly respond to danger when not looking. His cameo appearance in Spider-Man: No Way Home demonstrates this ability, wherein he quickly catches a brick flung at Peter Parker’s home, just a few seconds before the latter himself can catch it.",
