  "text": "Somewhere in a cinematic landscape that includes Yorgos Lanthimos and Lucile Hadžihalilović lies Helena Ganjalyan and Bartosz Szpak’s “Glorious Summer,” a sun-soaked allegory filled with dread in which the customs of a curiously cloistered culture begin to be questioned. The Polish filmmakers go out of their way not to specify where in the world they are as they tell of three young women under surveillance who start to develop their own judgment inside a dilapidated mansion that’s the only home they’ve ever known, but they’ve made a beguiling debut feature that looks to put them on the map in other respects. Appealing primarily to dedicated cinephiles, “Glorious Summer” doesn’t have much in the way of a plot, nor too many other identifying details that could make it easier to describe when the three women at the center are never named. Yet Ganjalyan and Szpak do keep up a consistently intriguing air of mystery as they settle into an idyllic estate where no one but the three young women is present, commanded around by a Siri-like voice that’s meant to guide them as well as keep them in line. A loudspeaker blares, “This is your place, take care of it. It keeps you safe,” in a calm feminine voice, gradually mixing up Swedish, Italian, English and Arabic for other instruction. From an outsider’s perspective, the gentle directions and light blending of cultures would seem to be a bid to make the women more worldly, but gradually appears intended to have the opposite effect when it blurs any thought of what the outside might look and sound like. Popular on Variety The women are made to fear what lies just outside the gates simply by being made to feel so comfortable inside them. When “Glorious Summer” is so easy on the eyes with its eternally radiant glow and orderly compositions, a lack of curiosity about their surroundings doesn’t seem so peculiar. They can’t want anything they don’t know about in the first place, and given the supplies in a bountiful basement for their most immediate needs, they jump rope and spray each other with toy squirt guns for fun to bide their time. But it is unsettling that they also spend part of their days practicing for their death, randomly lying face flat on the ground and expecting to be resuscitated by one of the others. It turns out to be a part of the preparation for a once-a-year event called “Glorious Summer” in which one day is made to stand out for the trio in order to appreciate the rest of the calendar year. Ganjalyan and Szpak would risk overcomplicating matters to go into any deeper specifics, but in wisely offering nothing about the event’s origins or the exact nature of how it unfolds, the occasion is easily understood as a test of the young women’s resolve when they approach it with only the context they’ve been able to create for themselves. Their level of participation in it becomes the dramatic thrust of the film rather than the end result, and while the three women are anonymous in a literal sense, they are marked by their distinctly different attitudes toward what’s to come. A sense of authority might clue one into the fact that the film’s co-director Ganjalyan plays the de facto leader of the group, the most strident of the bunch who appears to have a slight distrust of what she’s told over the loudspeaker and her skepticism is shared by the resolutely stone-faced Magdalena Fejdasz-Hanczewska, who dutifully abides daily instructions, but only out of resignation than any belief in the system. Both stand in stark contrast to the naif played by Daniela Komędera, who enjoys any prompts for activities and appears glad to be relieved of any opportunity to have to think for herself. Ganjalyan and Szpak’s lean into the ethereal prevents “Glorious Summer” from ever feeling didactic as an awakening occurs, outlining a society through its three leads that’s become so accustomed to personalized information feeds that it’s easier to accept than to challenge reality that’s been curated for them. “Glorious Summer” does stumble a bit when a fourth woman (Weronika Human) comes to the compound, opening the door to more questions than Ganjalyan and Szpak have the time or interest to satisfactorily answer. By then, they have inadvertently supported the film’s point by casting a spell where emotion has superseded logic. “Glorious Summer” ably demonstrates the power of illusions, and its filmmakers impress not only in conjuring them strongly, but in sharply piercing them as well.",
