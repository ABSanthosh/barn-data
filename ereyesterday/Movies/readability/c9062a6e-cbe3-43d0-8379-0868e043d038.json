The cast includes Iris Apatow, Patrick J. Adams, Amrit Kaur, and Jaouhar Ben Ayed. I've seen this one and it's pretty good. Don't write it off! It's always nice to see something a bit different these days, and the terrific cast in here is the cherry on top. Here's the trailer (+ poster) for José Avelino Gilles Corbett Lourenço's film Young Werther, on YouTube: Patrick J. Adams, Douglas Booth and Alison Pill star in this romantic comedy based on the classic smash hit novel of tragic romance. While on a simple errand to Toronto, a carefree and charming young writer named Werther stumbles across the love of his life only to discover that the young woman is engaged. Despite the urgings of his hypochondriac best friend, Werther turns his world upside down in a desperate, misguided and hilarious quest to win her heart. Young Werther is written and directed by the Canadian filmmaker José Avelino Gilles Corbett Lourenço, making his feature directorial debut after a few other short films previously. Based on the classic 1774 romance novel The Sorrows of Young Werther written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Produced by Matt Code and Wildling Pictures. This initially premiered at the 2024 Toronto Film Festival this fall playing in the Special Presentations section. Lionsgate will debut Young Werther in select US theaters + on VOD starting December 13th, 2024 coming soon. Is anyone into this? Find more posts: To Watch, Trailer prev next",
