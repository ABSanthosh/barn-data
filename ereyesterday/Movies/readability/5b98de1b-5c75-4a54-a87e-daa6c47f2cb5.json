Faced with two downed motorcyclists, guns, and a briefcase - Duggen is completely torn. She is forced to pick between three choices: commit the perfect crime, call the police, or drive away. Sew Torn is written and directed by up-and-coming filmmaker Freddy Macdonald (aka Fred), making his feature directorial debut after many other shorts. Produced by Fred Macdonald, Barry Navidi, Sebastian Klinger, Diamantis Zavitsanos, Socratis Zavitsanos, Timothy Ross, Alexander Stratigenas. This premiered at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival last year.
