  "text": "Eminem made brief remarks at a Kamala Harris rally in Detroit this evening, as he talked of fears that people have of retribution for expressing their opinion and his belief that she would protect freedom of speech. On stage to introduce former President Barack Obama, Eminem told the could that he was at the event “for a couple of important reasons.” “As most of you know, the city of Detroit and the home state of Michigan mean a lot to me,” he said. “And going into this election, the spotlight is on us more than ever, and I think it’s important to use your voice. So I’m encouraging everybody to get out and vote please.” He added, “I also think people shouldn’t be afraid to express their opinions, and I don’t think anyone wants an America where people are worried about retribution, of what people will do if you make your opinion known.” Watch on Deadline “I think Vice President Harris supports a future for this country where these freedoms and many others will be protected and upheld.” The Harris campaign has been tapping celebrities for campaign appearances, with Bruce Springsteen scheduled to perform at an Atlanta rally on Thursday and a Philadelphia event on Monday. Earlier in the day, actor Bradley Whitford appeared at an event with Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz. Earlier this month, Julia Roberts campaigned for Harris in Georgia.",
