  "text": "Conan O’Brien is set for the role of Smarty Pants in Toy Story 5, Disney and Pixar announced on Monday, during the Consumer Products section of Disney’s Licensing Expo presentation. “Isn’t that crazy? Legendary franchise,” said O’Brien in a video Instagram message celebrating the news. “These films are amazing. I can’t believe this!” Admittedly, O’Brien said, he asked initially for the role of Woody and was told it was promised to Tom Hanks. “And I was like, ‘Uh, you kinda been there and done that. You know? You’e in a bit of a rut, don’t you think?’ And they said, ‘No, Tom Hanks, it’s his role,'” Conan shared. He joked that he then went after the role of Buzz Lightyear, only to be told he lost it to Tim Allen. “And I went, ‘Guys, you gotta think outside the box,'” O’Brien deadpanned. “But anyway, then they showed me this new character, Smarty Pants. It’s the best character of them all. I far prefer this character. I don’t even wanna play Woody or Buzz anymore, even if they beg me. I’m Smarty Pants; I love this!” Watch on Deadline No further details on O’Brien’s character were provided. Check out his post below. In the new film, slated for release on June 19, 2026, it’s Toy meets Tech when Buzz, Woody, Jessie and the rest of the gang’s jobs are challenged after being introduced to what kids are obsessed with today—electronics! The film hails from writer-director Andrew Stanton, the two-time Oscar winner behind WALL-E and Finding Nemo. McKenna Harris is co-directing, with Jessica Choi producing and Pete Docter exec producing. Others newcomers to feature in the voice cast, as previously announced, include Ernie Hudson, who takes over the late Carl Weathers’s role of action figure Combat Carl, and Anna Faris in an undisclosed part. Joan Cusack is expected to be among the other returning cast members, reprising her role as Jessie. Veteran late-night host O’Brien hosted this year’s Oscars to critical acclaim and has already been set to return for next year’s ceremony. Currently, he can be seen hosting Conan O’Brien Must Go, a travel show he created for HBO Max, which is heading into its third season. Next up, O’Brien will be seen playing a supporting role in Mary Bronstein’s comedy If I Had Legs I’d Kick You, which garnered critical acclaim in its world premiere at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. The comic is repped by WME, Pariah, Brecheen Feldman Breimer, and Glaser Weil Fink Jacobs.",
