  "text": "Hollywood is joining the fight. On Saturday, cities across America marched against the Trump administration, participating in what has become known as the “No Kings” protests. With an acute focus on fighting back against Donald Trump‘s aggressive deportation raids, the movement coincides with the president’s controversial military parade in Washington meant to celebrate the Army’s 250th anniversary. The date also happens to land on Trump’s birthday. Along with thousands of U.S. citizens, industry leaders also stepped out to protest. Popular on Variety Jimmy Kimmel joined the “No Kings” rally in the South Bay of Los Angeles. He shared a photo on Instagram of himself and his parents at the protest, writing, “A huge, inspiring and yes – peaceful – turnout in the South Bay. I met many people who love this country and still believe it to be a force for good. I am grateful to see so many Americans take action to stand up for our friends and neighbors, most of all, my parents. I know how fortunate I am to have been born into a family that taught me to care about others and that the most important words ever spoken are ‘Love one another.’ It really is as simple as that.” Kerry Washington also took to Instagram to support the “No Kings” movement. Posting pictures of herself with fellow posters, she wrote, “#NoKings, just some QUEENS I found marching, speaking up, and fighting for Democracy.” Eight-time Oscar nominee Glenn Close, who joined the protests in Bozeman, Mont., shared a lengthy Instagram video explaining her thoughts about the day. She opened by saying she was “outraged” by the killings of Minnesota lawmakers Rep. Melissa Hortman and Sen. John Hoffman, which took place early Saturday, adding that her “heart goes out” to their families. She continued, “One could’ve thought, at a day when millions of people are willing to go into the street and peacefully demonstrate for the America that we know and love, for the America that our families have gone to war for over generations, that this would happen. That the underbelly of violence and conspiracy and all the weapons that are hiding in so many cellars across the country, finally, they’ll think they can come out and take matters into their own hands and make it harder for us to regain our democracy. But we must not, not, not be afraid. We must not.” “The White Lotus” star Natasha Rothwell shared a photo of herself holding a protest sign with a short but poignant message: “You Are Trash.” Ayo Edebiri shared a photo on her Instagram Stories of a protest sign that read, “I love you \u0026 I have your back! Stay brave!” Mary Elizabeth Ellis, who plays the Waitress on “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” shared a photo of the Los Angeles protests on Instagram and wrote, “Felt great to peacefully protest this administration in the streets today with fellow Los Angelenos. LA always shows up.” See some more celebrities participating in the “No Kings” protests below.",
