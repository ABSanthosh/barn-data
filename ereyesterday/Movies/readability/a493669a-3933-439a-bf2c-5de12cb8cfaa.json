  "text": "2018’s Batman Ninja was a unique time travel story that saw the Caped Crusader transported back into feudal Japan, where Joker and other Gotham baddies had become feudal lords. Seven years later, we’ve received a sequel that sees Batman return to the current time, although history has been significantly altered. The recently released Batman Ninja vs. Yakuza League 4K is a fun entry in the Batman canon and one worth checking out for DC fans. “In this sequel to Batman Ninja, the Batman family has returned to the present to discover that Japan has disappeared, and a giant island – Hinomoto – is now in the sky over Gotham City. At the top sit the Yakuza, a group of superpowered individuals who reign without honor or humanity and look suspiciously like the Justice League. Now, it’s up to Batman and his allies to save Gotham!” says the official description. Much like its predecessor, the new Batman movie is a collaboration between Warner Bros. and Japanese studios Kamikaze Douga and YamatoWorks. This gives it a very different look and style compared to most Warner Bros. Animation titles, and there are sections of the sequel that look especially gorgeous in ultra high definition. It’s a gorgeous-looking film, but there is a known audio issue in the Batman Ninja vs. Yakuza League 4K release — both audio tracks are in DD 5.1 rather than DTS HD, as the case says (it is possible to get a replacement, though some might want to wait for a new printing). As for the film itself, the real highlight is the vivid and fun action scenes. It’s particularly fun getting to see the reworked versions of the Justice League (you can see them in the trailer above), who are now Yakuza members and have gotten some entertaining redesigns. I particularly love the new version of Green Lantern Jessica Cruz, and Superman looks genuinely badass. It all combines in a really fun action movie that you’ll want to go back to in the future. The Batman Ninja vs. Yakuza League 4K disc includes two bonus features that give a look at how the film was made. First is a 7-minute feature titled “Bringing the League to Japan,” which goes into how the Justice League was reimagined into anime characters with insight from character designer Takashi Okazaki. Meanwhile, both of the film’s directors delve into the creative process in the 9-minute “Anime Action: Choreographing the Fights” featurette. They’re both nice additions, and I’m glad the Japanese crew was interviewed for the release. Batman Ninja vs. Yakuza League 4K Review: Final Verdict Batman Ninja vs. Yakuza League is an extremely fun movie that provides a fresh look at the Dark Knight and the Justice League. Featuring some of the best action in recent DC animated movies, it’s a gorgeous-looking movie that deserves to be watched at its best quality. Just be careful about the aforementioned audio issue, especially if you’ve got a great home theater setup or are an audiophile. Disclosure: ComingSoon received product from the distributor for our Batman Ninja vs. Yakuza League 4K review.",
