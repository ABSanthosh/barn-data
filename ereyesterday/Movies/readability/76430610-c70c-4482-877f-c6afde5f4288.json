With guests including Abby Rubenfeld, Gary Panter Wayne White, Natasha Lyonne, John Moody, S. Epatha Merkerson, Laurence Fishburne, Debi Mazar, David Arquette, Judd Apatow, and many others.

I'm sold on this - I will be watching. Here's the official trailer for Matt Wolf's doc Pee-wee as Himself, direct from HBO's YouTube: Driven by a soul-baring interview with Paul Reubens – the man behind the iconic character Pee-wee Herman – Matt Wolf's two-part documentary Pee-wee as Himself is the definitive portrait of the comedic performer, and a window into his never-before-discussed personal life. Determined to correct the record and tell the factual story of his life, Reubens excavates his kaleidoscopic influences, origins in the circus and avant-garde performance theater, and career choices, while reflecting on the reasoning behind, and the consequences of, severing his beloved alter ego from his authentic self. Pee-wee as Himself is directed by the American doc filmmaker Matt Wolf, director of the docs Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell, Teenage, Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project, and Spaceship Earth previously. It's exec produced by Matt Wolf, Candace Tomarken, Josh \u0026 Benny Safdie, Sara Rodriguez, Paul Reubens, Kyle Martin, Lisa Heller, Eli Bush, Ronald Bronstein, Nancy Abraham. Made by Elara Pictures \u0026 HBO Documentary Films. HBO debuts Pee-wee as Himself streaming on Max starting on May 23rd, 2025 this summer. Intrigued?
