  "text": "Posted in: Movies, Sony, Trailer | Tagged: I Know What You Did Last SummerThe first trailer for the I Know What You Did Last Summer sequel was released today. The horror film hits theaters on July 18.Article Summary First trailer for I Know What You Did Last Summer sequel out now, movie in theaters July 18. Lola Tung and Freddie Prinze Jr. join the cast in this new horror film directed by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson. Robinson's previous work on Netflix's Do Revenge makes her a promising director for this reboot. The film faces stiff competition with releases like Jurassic World: Rebirth and The Fantastic Four. I Know What You Did Last Summer has released its first poster, and they went the simple route. Hey- it is not a stack of heads with a light behind it, so I will take it. Starring in the Sony reboot are Lola Tung, Nicholas Alexander Chavez, Austin Nichols, Chase Sui Wonders, Madelyn Cline, Sarah Pidgeon, Tyriq Withers, Jonah Haur-King, and also returning Freddie Prinze Jr. and Jennifer Love Hewitt. Jennifer Kaytin Robinson will be directing, with Sony releasing the film on July 18th. I Know What You Did Last Summer Has A Terrible Release Date When five friends inadvertently cause a deadly car accident, they cover up their involvement and make a pact to keep it a secret rather than face the consequences. A year later, their past comes back to haunt them and they're forced to confront a horrifying truth: someone knows what they did last summer…and is hell-bent on revenge. As one by one the friends are stalked by a killer, they discover this has happened before, and they turn to two survivors of the legendary Southport Massacre of 1997 for help. Directed by: Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, Story by: Leah McKendrick \u0026 Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, Screenplay by: Sam Lansky \u0026 Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, Produced by: Neal H. Moritz, Executive Producers: Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, Jackie Shenoo, Karina Rahardja. Credit Sony Pictures I am interested in this right now because of Robinson, who directed the excellent Do Revenge for Netflix last year. Her pitch for this apparently blew Sony away, which piques my interest. The amount of '90s flair Robinson could inject into such a modern film with Do Revenge makes her an intriguing choice to revive I Know What You Did Last Summer. I really am not sure why they are bothering with this one, as I can't believe there are that many people who hold this in high regard. For now, it feels very much of its time and not something that needs a sequel, remake, requel, or whatever they will call this. But who knows? I'll reserve judgment until I see it. The release date is doing it no favors, as it opens around Jurassic World: Rebirth, Superman, and The Fantastic Four: First Steps. Oof. I Know What You Did Last Summer opens in theaters on July 18.
