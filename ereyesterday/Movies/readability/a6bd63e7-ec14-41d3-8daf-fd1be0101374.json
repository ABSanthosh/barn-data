  "text": "Phil Robertson, the patriarch of TV’s “Duck Dynasty” reality show, has died. He was 79. In December, Robertson’s family said on the “Unashamed With the Robertson Family” that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. His daughter-in-law Korie Robertson posted the news to Facebook Sunday, writing, “We celebrate today that our father, husband, and grandfather, Phil Robertson, is now with the Lord. He reminded us often of the words of Paul, ‘you do not grieve like those who have no hope. For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.’ Thank you for the love and prayers of so many whose lives have been impacted by his life saved by grace, his bold faith, and by his desire to tell everyone who would listen the Good News of Jesus. We are grateful for his life on earth and will continue the legacy of love for God and love for others until we see him again. Popular on Variety We know so many of you love him and have been impacted by his life. We’re having a private service for now, but we’ll share details soon about a public celebration of his life.” Robertson worked as a teacher and commercial fisherman before inventing the Duck Commander call, which turned into a multi-million dollar business now headed by his son Willie Robertson. “Duck Dynasty” aired on A\u0026E from 2012 to 2017. By 2013 it became the most-watched nonfiction cable series in history. Presented in a sitcom-style format, it revolved around the Duck Commander business run by brothers Phil and Si, the bearded elders of the clan, and Phil’s sons Jase, Willie and Jep, as well as their co-workers and children. Phil Robertson was suspended from the show in 2013 after saying that homosexuality was a sin, but his suspension was lifted after nine days. A new version of the show, “Duck Dynasty: Revival,” starring Korie and Willie Robertson, will air on A\u0026E this summer. Phil Robertson will not appear in the show. A film about Robertson’s life, “The Blind – The True Story of the Robertson Family,” was released in theaters in 2023.",
