  "text": "Paul McCartney is petitioning for late English blues-rock singer Joe Cocker to be inducted into the Rock Hall of Fame this year. In a letter dated Feb. 25, and addressed to “rock and rollers,” McCartney described Cocker, who died in 2014 at age 70, as a “great man and a fine singer” with a unique style. “He sang one of our songs, ‘With A Little Help From My Friends,’ a version produced by Denny Cordell, which was very imaginative,” McCartney wrote. Indeed, the Sheffield-born singer’s 1968 interpretation of the Beatles’ “With a Little Help From My Friends” put a electric spin on the classic, as memorably parodied by John Belushi on “Saturday Night Live.” Popular on Variety “And while [Cocker] may not have ever lobbied to be in the Hall of Fame,” McCartney continued, “I know he would be extremely happy and grateful to find himself where he deserves to be amongst such illustrious company.” In 2024, McCartney advocated for the induction of Foreigner into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in addition to support from Peter Frampton, Cher and Oasis. The campaign did pay off in their favor: Foreigner earned their induction alongside Dionne Warwick, Cher, Mary J. Blige and the Dave Matthews Band in a ceremony that included performances from Dua Lipa, Jelly Roll and more. McCartney was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo act in 1999 by Neil Young. The Beatles were inducted as a group in 1988, their first year of eligibility. (Of course, each member of the band was inducted individually between 1994 and 2015.) Cocker, who has been eligible for the honor since 1994, is a first-time nominee along with Chubby Checker, Maná, Phish, Outkast, Billy Idol, the Black Crowes and Bad Company. Repeats include nominees Mariah Carey, Oasis, the White Stripes, Cyndi Lauper, Joy Division/New Order and Soundgarden. The induction ceremony will take place in Los Angeles this year, on a fall date that has yet to be announced. Read McCartney’s letter to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame below.",
