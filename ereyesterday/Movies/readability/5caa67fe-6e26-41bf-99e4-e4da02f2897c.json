  "text": "The first bow of “Étoile” is also its last. Prime Video has canceled the ballet series from “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” creators Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, despite the streamer initially greenlighting the production with a two-season commitment. The final pirouette comes roughly six weeks after the series first debuted in late April and earned generally positive notices from critics. All eight episodes were dropped simultaneously on Prime Video. That binge-release model of premiering all episodes at once has become a bit of a rarity for Amazon’s original programming. “Étoile,” which starred Luke Kirby and Charlotte Gainsbourg as ballet company directors teaming to save each other’s storied institutions, was ordered to series in 2023, about one month before the series finale of Sherman-Palladino and Palladino’s “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” premiered on Amazon’s streamer. “Maisel” was also initially picked up for two seasons back in 2017, though that commitment came after a pilot was produced. Popular on Variety The ballet series was greenlit by the prior administration at Amazon MGM Studios, headed by Jennifer Salke. Salke stepped down from her role after seven years back in March, one month before “Étoile” premiered. In an April interview with Variety previewing the series, Sherman-Palladino and Palladino were tentative about the prospect of Season 2, despite the streamer’s initial commitment, saying that more episodes were “pending.” Sherman-Palladino and Palladino served as writers, directors and executive producers on “Étoile,” with Dhana Rivera Gilbert also executive producing and Scott Ellis co-executive producing. It was a product of Sherman-Palladino and Palladino’s overall deal at Amazon Studios, which the pair signed in 2019.",
