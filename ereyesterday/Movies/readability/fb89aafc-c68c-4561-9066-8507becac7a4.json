  "text": "“Crazy Rich Asians” fans have been waiting patiently for a sequel to the hit film since its 2018 release. With follow-ups to the original novel by Kevin Kwan already ripe for adaptation — 2015’s “China Rich Girlfriend,” 2017’s “Rich People Problems” and 2024’s “Lies and Weddings” — and the massive return on its investment Warner Bros. enjoyed, it even feels inevitable. In 2022, it was reported that the sequel was officially on the way after replacing original co-writers Adele Lim and Peter Chiarelli. But it’s seven years later… and nothing. Earlier this year, however, it was reported that a television series was in development for HBO Max with Lim back on board as the showrunner and director John M. Chu as executive producer. Lim has become a Hollywood powerhouse since her “Crazy Rich” success, writing the Oscar-nominated “Raya and the Last Dragon” and moving into the directing sphere with the acclaimed “Joy Ride” and the upcoming “Princess Diaries” sequel. Chu, of course, directed something called “Wicked” last year — and that apparently has a sequel coming out this November. Now, Henry Golding has addressed the “Crazy Rich Asians” series development, the first indication of the original casts’ participation. “Something’s being made,” Golding told Andy Cohn on “Watch What Happens Live.” “I think we’re actually going to do a series. That’s what they’re trying to give us. Aiming for like first quarter, even, next year.” This also is the first establishment of a potential timeline for the series. Golding revealed that there’s already stories written for the show, though he himself has not yet seen them. “There are scripts hanging around but they haven’t been passed on yet. I haven’t read anything, but I hear it’s promising,” he said. Whether or not the rest of the cast would return for the series is unclear. Since its release, Michelle Yeoh appeared in “Everything Everywhere All at Once” and won an Oscar, in addition to also playing a pivotal role in “Wicked.” Constance Wu voiced Daphne in “Velma,” appeared with Bill Murray in “The Friend,” has had several prominent stage roles, and released a best-selling autobiography. Awkwafina has been very, very busy, appearing in three films in 2024 alone. Golding will appear with Charlize Theron and Uma Thurman in Netflix’s “The Old Guard 2,” which drops on the platform July 2, the same day the finale of his Hulu series “Nine Perfect Strangers” drops.",
