  "text": "One of the great things about Aminah Nieves, a breakout star if ever there was one for her turn as Native American boarding school survivor Teonna in Taylor Sheridan’s “1923,” is that she never forgets the people who were with her on her journey. Watch her speech above. In her speech at IndieWire Honors June 5, where she won the Breakthrough Award, she took time to acknowledge her Taino and Coahuiltecan heritage, and to thank her parents, her agent, Mo Brings Plenty and the other Indigenous advisors on the Paramount+ show, series director Ben Richardson, Sheridan himself, and of course, IndieWire. “To the entire team here at IndieWire, thank you for acknowledging and recognizing the importance of amplifying stories like Teonna’s,” she said. “While Teonna’s story may feel very distant and of the past, the boarding school crisis and its aftermath is still prevalent and affects Indian country to this day. I stand here before you in deep, deep prayer for liberation, and for all suffering beings, because may we all be free.” She saved her most touching words for her late “1923” co-star Cole Brings Plenty, who played her beloved traveling companion Pete who helped her on her journey after escaping from the boarding school in the first season. Before Season 2 could begin filming, the 27-year-old actor, a nephew of Mo Brings Plenty, died suddenly. Choking up with emotion, Nieves talked about how the spirit of Cole, nicknamed Coco, was still present even throughout the filming of Season 2. “To Coco, to my brother Cole Brings Plenty: The very essence of you reverberated off the waters and trees every single day on the set,” she said. “You carried us home, the only way you know how to, fully in love and with deep belly laughs. Until I see you again… Let his story, let Coco’s story be a reminder, to all, of the continued injustices throughout Indian country and across the globe. Thank you again, IndieWire.” Nieves will next be seen in Kathryn Bigelow’s untitled White House thriller. Watch the video of Nieves’ speech above to hear all of her IndieWire Honors remarks.",
