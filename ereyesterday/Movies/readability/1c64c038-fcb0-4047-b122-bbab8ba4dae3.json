Universal's big game spot delivers exciting new footage and anticipation. Dean DeBlois directs this visionary reimagining of the beloved franchise. How To Train Your Dragon hits theaters June 13, 2025. While Universal might have dropped the ball with¬†Jurassic World Rebirth big game spot, the big game spot for the live-action remake of¬†How To Train Your Dragon is here with some new footage. This a movie that has a lot of skeptism against it for plenty of reasons. There are a lot of things it needs to make work in live-action that seem like it would only work in animation. We've got a look at the dragons, and they look pretty good, but the dragon riding is another thing they have to make look incredible, or this film isn't going to work. Well, Universal decided now was the time to finally show us some of that dragon riding and it does look pretty good so far. That musical drop is going to get me every single time anyway so I don't know why I'm even bothering to act like I won't be a blubbering mess of a human being during this film. How to Train Your Dragon:¬†Summary, Cast List, Release Date From three-time Oscar¬Æ nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation's acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. On the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. With the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village's quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. As an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup's friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. The film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones). How to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar¬Æ nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX¬Æ Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX¬Æ technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. Inspired by Cressida Cowell's New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation's How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award¬Æ nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny. How To Train Your Dragon will be released in theaters on June 13, 2025. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!
