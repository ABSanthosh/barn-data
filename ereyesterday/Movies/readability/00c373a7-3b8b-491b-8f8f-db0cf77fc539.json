  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Former The Real Housewives of Atlanta stars Sanya Richards-Ross and Marlo Hampton are set to co-host The Real Close Friends podcast for Audioboom. Olympian Richards-Ross and former RHOA co-star Hampton have partnered to launch a new podcast starting October 31. The duo will discuss celebrity news, viral moments, memes, fashion, and sports, giving authentic and often contradictory perspectives on the latest hot topics. “On The Real Close Friends podcast, we will share authentic conversations and the sisterhood that we’ve built over the years,” says Richards-Ross. “Our fans have only seen snippets of our friendship on TV, but this podcast allows us to give them an up close and personal of our chats about pop culture moments, trends, and our personal lives. I’m thrilled to be on this journey with Marlo, so many people don’t know that she truly is one of my closest friends.” Hampton added, “Working with Sanya always feels like home. We’ve been through so much together, and now we get to share our unfiltered opinions, experiences, and advice with our listeners. The Real Close Friends is all about the tea that we exchange in our DMs and private messages, and we can’t wait for everyone to tune in and be part of the conversation.” Watch on Deadline Tye Perry and Justin Perry created The Real Close Friends podcast, which will be produced by Driven by LMG and GEN/US studios. “We’re thrilled to welcome Marlo and Sanya to the Audioboom Creator Network,” says Brendan Regan, Audioboom’s Chief Content Officer. “The Real Close Friends will have unique access to market-leading technology, distribution and commercial services that will help deliver incredible value and opportunity.” Richards-Ross and Hampton both exited The Real Housewives of Atlanta after wrapping Season 15. Richards-Ross left the reality series following two seasons, while Hampton announced she was leaving after being a main housewife for two seasons and a “friend of” since Season 4. Among many of their endeavors, Richards-Ross has been an NBC Sports analyst, and Hampton is the owner of Lé Archive, a showroom in Atlanta that gives stylists access to her clothing and accessories archive.",
