  "text": "The calamitous weather of recent years has taken many lives, caused billions of dollars’ worth of damage and is changing the climate and economies of countries all over the glove. But the Steve Miller Band’s 2025 North American tour may be the first to be canceled due to the general trend of climate change-inducted weather disasters, rather than any single event. The band has canceled all 31 scheduled dates of its American tour, which was slated to begin Aug. 15 in Bethel, NY and traverse the entire country before concluding in Anaheim, Calif. on Nov. 8. Popular on Variety The band made the announcement in a straightforward tone familiar to fans of the 81-year-old veteran singer, songwriter and guitarist and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member, whose career stretches back to the mid-1960s and has released such classic rock anthems as “The Joker,” “Fly Like an Eagle,” “Jet Airliner,” “Take the Money and Run” and many more. “Dear Steve Miller Band fans,” it reads in full.   “You make music with your instincts You live life by your instincts Always trust your instincts… The Steve Miller Band has cancelled all of our upcoming tour ates. The combination of extreme heat, unpredictable flooding, tornadoes, hurricanes and massive forest fires make these risks for you our audience, the band and the crew unacceptable. So … You can blame it on the weather… The tour is cancelled. Don’t know where, don’t know when… We hope to see you all again.”    Miller’s career received a boost from his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2016, and he has been reissuing select items from his catalog since moving it all over to Universal Music Group the following year.",
