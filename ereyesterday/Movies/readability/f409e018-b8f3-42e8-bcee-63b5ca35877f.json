  "text": "Lady Whistledown is back and ready to meet another season’s diamond in Regency era London. With filming on Season 4 of Bridgerton underway, the cast of the Netflix series, new and original, reunited for a table read and some behind-the-scenes photos out of their bodices and tailcoats. “Rejoice for it is the season of joy and merriment!” the Shondaland series captioned the Instagram photos as a Christmas present for fans. After Luke Thompson‘s Benedict Bridgerton was unveiled as the focus of the upcoming fourth season, and Yerin Ha was cast as his love interest Sophie Baek, the onscreen couple posed together in their casual offscreen clothes. Watch on Deadline In addition to Lady Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell), daughters Francesca (Hannah Dodd) and Hyacinth (Florence Hunt), the table read also included familiar faces like Lady Agatha Danbury (Adjoa Andoh), Lady Portia Featherington (Polly Walker) and more. New faces Lady Araminta Gun (Katie Leung) and Posy Li (Isabella Wei) were in attendance as well Filming began on Season 4 in September on a newly constructed backlot at the UK’s Shepperton Studios, when the cast added Leung, Wei and Michelle Mao as Rosamund Li. At the time, Emma Naomi and Hugh Sachs were also promoted to series regulars as Alice Mondrich and Brimsley. The fourth season of Shonda Rhimes‘ Bridgerton turns its focus to bohemian second son Benedict. Despite his elder and younger brothers both being happily married, Benedict is loath to settle down — until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother’s masquerade ball.",
