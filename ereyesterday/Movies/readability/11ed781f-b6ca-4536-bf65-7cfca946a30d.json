  "description": "\"This is some nasty business you got yourself into, 'Liv.\" Gravitas has unveiled an official trailer for an indie horror psychological thriller film called Inhabitants, marking the feature directorial debut of filmmaker Matt McClung. Now set for release in February for anyone curious about it. A young woman moves in with her lapsed Catholic boyfriend, going against the wishes of their respective family members. But Francis soon ends up suffering from night terrors - whispering in his sleep to a figure Olivia cannot see and sleepwalking to strange corners of the house. Her investigation leads to a terrifying and perverse discovery; they are being haunted by the ghost of Francis's childhood youth minister - an entity who is enraged by their cohabitation and has come to punish them for their sins.

This doesn't seem particularly interesting unless you're really into Catholic horror \u0026 also need to free yourself from your sins. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Matt McClung's horror film Inhabitants, direct from YouTube: Olivia Burton (starring Anna Jacoby-Heron) moves to California with her boyfriend Francis, against the wishes of their respective family members. Francis's mother, Lillian, is a devout Catholic who disapproves of her son’s cohabitation and makes her feelings known in the form of violent, religious-themed postcards. Despite these objections, the young lovers settle into their exciting life together. Their bliss is interrupted, however, after a freak accident leaves Francis physically \u0026 mentally wounded. Soon, he's suffering from night terrors - whispering in his sleep to a figure Olivia cannot see and sleepwalking to strange corners of the house. These episodes frighten Olivia and also suggest that Francis may be hiding something from her. Inhabitants is written and directed by American indie filmmaker Matt McClung, now making his feature directorial debut after many other short films previously. Produced by Thomas Rennier. Gravitas will debut McClung's Inhabitants film direct-to-VOD starting on February 14th, 2025 this winter. Anyone curious? Find more posts in: Horror, Indies, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
