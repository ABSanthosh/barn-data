  "text": "SPOILER ALERT: The following reveals major plot points from NBC‘s Chicago Med‘s Season 10 finale “Don’t You Cry.” Tonight’s episode of NBC’s Chicago Med has one of the most jaw-dropping endings to a season in recent One Chicago history. Okay, this might be a little hyperbole, but the final beats of the Season 10 finale reveal a hook-up that fans have longed for, but was thought to have been abandoned as a storyline. Okay, if you’ve read this far, you want the news spoiled. Dr. Hannah Asher (Jessy Schram) has been undergoing tests, hoping that she could serve as her sister Lizzie’s (Erin Anderson) surrogate. Dr. Dean Archer (Steven Weber) reacts less than positively to the news. “You don’t owe her this level of personal sacrifice,” he tells her in “The Stories We Tell Ourselves.” And she snaps back, “Look, I didn’t ask you for your analysis. So if you’re not going to be supportive, stay out of it.” Watch on Deadline Burn! Mouth agape, Archer is left speechless. Last week’s episode, aptly titled “Baby Mine,” opens with Dr. Mitchell Ripley (Luke Mitchell), Asher’s ex, holding an adorable baby in his arms. Later, Archer bumps into Asher in the ER, and he’s apologetic for what he said to her about the surrogacy plans. Asher tells Archer she’s been undergoing further tests, and she promises to share her results later that day. I know this is all from last week, but bear with me here. Eventually, Asher learns she has not been approved to be a surrogate, and she is heartbroken. (l-r) Luke Mitchell as Dr. Mitch Ripley, Jessy Schram as Dr. Hannah Asher Series executive producer and showrunner Allen MacDonald leads viewers to believe something serious is happening with Asher’s health. However, in the final seconds of the episode, it is revealed that she is pregnant. Flashing back to the start of the episode where Ripley is cradling the infant, of course, your mind goes to Asher being pregnant with Ripley, since they dated for some time. At the end of tonight’s season finale, Asher heads over to someone’s house, presumably the father of her baby. Ripley has a knock at his door shortly after, which he opens to find someone who is not his ex. It’s Sadie (Holly Curran), the woman he saved from the well earlier this season. You see, the door Asher knocked on was Archer’s!! Somewhere behind the scenes, Asher and Archer have hooked up at least once, and she is pregnant with his baby. The two had previously been teased as a potential couple; however, as Asher grew closer to newbie Ripley, that potential fizzled out. Since her split with Ripley, at some point, Asher and Archer gave in to their feelings. Bing, bam, boom, they are expecting. I emailed MacDonald some questions about the episode, enquiring whether Gaffney would welcome a new baby in nine months, but he was tight-lipped. “I’m going to let the episode speak for itself.” Before moving away from this trio, let’s go back to Ripley reuniting with Sadie. Could fans expect something romantic to blossom between them? MacDonald teases, “I think it was pretty clear in Episode 15 (“Down in a Hole”) that Ripley and Sadie connected on a deep level: they share a moment where they both acknowledge feeling completely alone in the world. Plus, they both helped each other through a fairly horrific situation with humor and humanity. I think they left an indelible mark on each other afterward. I think they’ve been thinking about each other and asking themselves: was that connection real, or was it just simply trauma bonding, and do they actually have very little in common? I think Sadie’s knocking on Ripley’s door to find out. We’ll see how it goes in the fall.” When asked if love could be in the air in Season 11, he said, “Yes, I agree that it’s time for a little more romance on Chicago Med next season. Our co-executive producer Lauren MacKenzie is especially motivated to make that happen and “loves a slow burn” — so more romance means more torture for the audience, LOL.” He really does enjoy the torture. Another big storyline from this season involves Ms. Sharon Goodwin (S. Epatha Merkerson), who has been dealing with PTSD, striking nurses, a bumpy relationship, and layoffs, to name just a few things. Sadly, her love affair with Dr. Dennis Washington (John Earl Jelks) has concluded, and they will no longer work under the same roof. As Gaffney is undergoing budget cuts, Dr. Washington was offered a new title, though it was below the one he had. He was highly offended when Ms. Goodwin relayed the news and wondered if his beloved had fought for him to keep his title and pay. She was only the messenger, and he came to realize that later. He turned in his resignation to her, which she accepted. In an honest conversation, Ms. Goodwin admits she’s still not over the disrespect she felt when she learned Dr. Washington’s daughter had no idea they were in a relationship, much less that they were living together. (l-r) Jocelyn Hudon as Lizzy Novak, Luke Mitchell as Dr. Mitch Ripley, Marlyne Barrett as Maggie Lockwood, Hanako Greensmith as Violet Mikami George Burns Jr/NBC She reveals how important respect is to her and why she is ready to move on. Before the episode goes dark, she is seen in an incredibly touching moment with her ex-husband. MacDonald commented on her journey, “I think Goodwin was happy when Season 10 began, but the trauma of being held hostage and getting stabbed by Cassidy reset the board of her life. She buried that trauma… compartmentalized so she could move forward. Goodwin basically went on autopilot… but there were cracks throughout Season 10… especially in her relationship with Dr. Dennis Washington. I wanted Goodwin’s story to bookend the Season 10 Finale so we could see that crack get blown open by her visit with an imprisoned Cassidy (Tiff Abreu) in the opening scene all the way to the final scene of her visiting Bert (Gregory Allen Williams) at his Memory Care Facility.” He continued, “She made some hard decisions tonight, and I think the pain of that compelled her to see him… because for Goodwin, Bert is still ‘home’. They have their own rocky history, of course, but they spent a majority of their lives together… raised three children. So, to answer your question, I think Goodwin is happy in that final scene. Sure, she’s sad too, but she also tells Bert she’s hopeful because she’s ready to live the future she almost didn’t have in a way that is absolutely true to who she is. And in Season 11, I’d love to see her go down some roads she never expected to walk. I think Goodwin is ready to let life surprise her, and I think the audience will love going on that ride with her.”",

She buried that trauma… compartmentalized so she could move forward. Goodwin basically went on autopilot… but there were cracks throughout Season 10… especially in her relationship with Dr. Dennis Washington. I wanted Goodwin’s story to bookend the Season 10 Finale so we could see that crack get blown open by her visit with an imprisoned Cassidy (Tiff Abreu) in the opening scene all the way to the final scene of her visiting Bert (Gregory Allen Williams) at his Memory Care Facility.”\n\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tHe continued, “She made some hard decisions tonight, and I think the pain of that compelled her to see him… because for Goodwin, Bert is still ‘home’. They have their own rocky history, of course, but they spent a majority of their lives together… raised three children. So, to answer your question, I think Goodwin is happy in that final scene. Sure, she’s sad too, but she also tells Bert she’s hopeful because she’s ready to live the future she almost didn’t have in a way that is absolutely true to who she is. And in Season 11, I’d love to see her go down some roads she never expected to walk. I think Goodwin is ready to let life surprise her, and I think the audience will love going on that ride with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
