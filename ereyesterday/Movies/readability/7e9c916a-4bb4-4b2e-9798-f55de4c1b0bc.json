With fight coordination from Phil Tan (known for Bloodsport 2, Martial Law, Showdown in Little Tokyo, Lethal Weapon 4). Looks like a good time - fights better kick ass. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Lexi Alexander's film Absolute Dominion, direct from YouTube: In the year 2063, the world faces catastrophe as zealots \u0026 extremists wage a global holy war, crumbling cities and dismantling entire countries in the name of spiritual superiority. Desperate for a solution to save humanity from itself, the world's governing bodies vote to establish a radical new form of diplomacy called The Battle of Absolute Dominion, a fierce martial-arts tournament featuring the best fighters in the world to determine a champion whose faith will govern humanity \u0026 restore peace for the future. Absolute Dominion is written and directed by German-Palestinian action filmmaker Lexi Alexander, director of the films Green Street Hooligans, Punisher: War Zone, and Lifted previously, plus TV work including episodes of \"Limitless\", \"American Gothic\", \"S.W.A.T.\", \"L.A.'s Finest\". Produced by Lexi Alexander, John McKeown, Scott Putman. It was filmed mostly in an old casino outside of Las Vegas, NV. Giant Pictures will release Absolute Dominion direct-to-VOD to watch starting May 9th, 2025 coming soon. Any good? Who's down? Find more posts in: Indies, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
