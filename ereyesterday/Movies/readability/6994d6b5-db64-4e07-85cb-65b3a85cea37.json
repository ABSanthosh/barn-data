  "text": "We all remember when Will Ferrell played the iconic character of Buddy in Elf who ventured from the North Pole to New York City to find his biological father. With no Elf sequel anytime soon, it’s only natural to wonder how Buddy is doing right now. Well, the SNL alum gave us a hilarious picture at an NHL game when he appeared among the crowd drinking and smoking in his Buddy the Elf costume. Buddy’s final scene in Elf was when he, his wife Jovie, and his baby girl visited Papa Elf in the North Pole. This year, however, gives us an Adult Swim version that looks like the once-happy Elf has had better Christmases. According to EW, Will Ferrell was in the stands watching the L.A. Kings play the Philadelphia Flyers dressed as Buddy the Elf. Only, the iconic face in the crowd hilariously looked a little unhappy while smoking and drinking at the Crypto.com Arena. To see it to believe it, here’s an Instagram video of Ferrell donning the elf costume again in his disgruntled fashion below: With Will Ferrell known for being an avid L.A. Kings fan, it’s no wonder he looked amusingly unsatisfied if his favorite hockey team was falling behind. Fortunately, the magic of Buddy had a positive influence on the ice as the Kings eventually beat the Flyers. Will Ferrell’s 2025 film projects Will Ferrell has plenty of film projects for fans to look forward to for the upcoming year. He’ll be fighting with Reese Witherspoon for the best wedding in You’re Cordially Invited. You can see the two comedy stars attempt to share the same wedding venue on Amazon Prime on January 30th. Currently in pre-production, Street Justice has Will Ferrell as a vigilante who distributes his own brand of justice. There’s also the upcoming Gus Van Sant movie Prince of Fashion about a father taking his son to Men’s Fashion Week. To see Will Ferrell as a happy Buddy, Elf is available to see on HBO Max and Hulu.",
