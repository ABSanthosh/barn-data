For those who want to solve today’s Connections, we have crafted your essential roadmap with hints and answers. Whether you’re a veteran or discovering the addictive allure of this puzzle for the first time, brace yourself for a mental workout that celebrates clever deduction and rewards those who think beyond the obvious. So, here’s everything you need to know about the July 5 edition of The New York Times’ popular game. Connections hint for July 5 Before going to the hints, check out the words for July 5’s NYT Connections: SCHEME, LONG, RACKET, FOLD, STING, STIR, ITCH, SHORT, BEAT, HUSTLE, BLEND, PINE, BUCKET, BURN, LAUNDRY, and TO-DO. Players need to sort the 16 words into four themed groups. Every player gets four guesses to identify each group’s common theme. The yellow group of words is the easiest to solve, and the purple is the most difficult. Players get four guesses to identify each group’s common theme. Before we reveal the answers, here are all the hints for the four categories of July 5’s NYT Connections: The Yellow Category refers to deceptive methods designed to swindle money from unsuspecting victims. The Green Category contains essential verbs related to the work of turning ingredients into baked delights. The Blue Category captures the intense desires and profound wants of humans. The Purple Category mentions words related to arrangements or curated assemblages of related items. What are the Connections answers for today, July 5? If the hints for the July 5 Connections didn’t help you decipher the pattern, we reveal the answers below. Yellow: Scheme Words: HUSTLE, RACKET, SCHEME, STING Green: Baking procedures Words: BEAT, BLEND, FOLD, STIR Blue: Yearning Words: BURN, ITCH, LONG, PINE Purple: Lists of some sorts Words: BUCKET, LAUNDRY, SHORT, TO-DO If the July 5 NYT Connections puzzle proves challenging, consider starting by identifying three words that clearly belong together within each potential category.
