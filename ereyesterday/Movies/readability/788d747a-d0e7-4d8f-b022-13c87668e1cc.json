The award ceremony took place at the Bridgestone Arena of Nashville on November 20, 2024. Additionally, the night was also a memorable one for Stapleton, as he bagged numerous awards and also opened the night alongside “Circles” singer, Post Malone. Chris Stapleton apologizes to wife Morgane at 2024 CMA awards “White Horse” hitmaker Chris Stapleton gave an apology to his wife, Morgane Stapleton during the award ceremony. According to a report by Taste of Country, this happened after the singer missed out on thanking his wife in his acceptance speech, which he gave after bagging the award for Single of the Year for “White Horse.” Stapleton went on to clinch a total of 3 awards at the auspicious event. However, when it came to thanking his friends and family while receiving the Song of the Year award for the same song, Chris Stapleton had a special mention for his wife. As reported by the outlet, he grabbed the mic and asserted, “I really am taken aback. Thank you so much for this. I owe my wife an apology. That last award also belonged to her. It just happened so fast … all my music, I really owe a lot to her, so I thank her for her support.” Morgane is a key contributor in the songwriting process of the song “White Horse,” which is part of her husband’s 2023 album, Higher. ComingSoon stated earlier that the couple tied the knot in October 2007. While talking in an interview with Paste Magazine in 2015, Morgane revealed how she pursued Chris Stapleton and said, “I kinda did stalk him. I was friends with his song-plugger and I would go hang out in her office, like, every day.”",
