  "description": "\"Under paid. Under staffed. Over worked. Welcome to the KRANK.\" ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Apple TV has unveiled an official trailer for a new hospital series called Berlin ER, set at an overcrowded hospital in the bustling German city of Berlin. The original title is Krank Berlin, since the word \"krank\" in German means sick (making the series name technically Sick Berlin in German). Dr. Parker, a medic, moves from Munich to Berlin after a personal crisis. She works in the chaotic ER inside Berlin's most overcrowded hospital, seeking a fresh start amidst the intense medical environment. But the increasingly merciless health system forces the strained team to put aside all their differences \u0026 save lives together. \"The waiting room is overcrowded. The staff is overtired. The equipment is outdated. And it's her first day at work.\" The series stars Haley Louise Jones as Dr. Parker, with Slavko PopadiÄ‡, Åžafak ÅžengÃ¼l, Aram Tafreshian, Samirah Breuer, Bernhard SchÃ¼tz, Peter Lohmeyer, and Benjamin Radjaipour. This looks hip and spunky and definitely not like any of the American hospital shows - much more wild and edgy. Just like Berlin! Jump into the \"sick\" below.
