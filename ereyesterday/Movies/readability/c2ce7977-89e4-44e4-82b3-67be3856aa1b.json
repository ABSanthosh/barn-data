  "text": "Lisa has teamed up with Doja Cat and Raye on “Born Again,” the latest single off her upcoming album “Alter Ego” out Feb. 28. On “Born Again,” the Blackpink member leads the trio across the disco-tinged tune that folds in bits of electro-pop. Lisa and Raye trade off on the first verse and chorus before passing the baton to Doja, who drops a verse as the song rides out. “Born Again” is just a taste of what to expect on “Alter Ego,” which she announced in November and showcases five different characters (Roxi, Kiki, Vixi, Sunni and Speedi) representing a unique personality. Lisa has already released three singles from the project including “New Woman” featuring Rosalía, “Moonlit Floor (Kiss Me)” and “Rockstar,” the latter of which was the first to arrive in June 2024. “Alter Ego” marks her full-length debut as a solo artist after nearly a decade in Blackpink alongside Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé and Lisa. She previously put out her “Lalisa” single album in Sept. 2021 featuring the title track as well as “Money.” Popular on Variety In addition to her solo debut, Lisa is gearing up for her acting debut as part of the cast of “The White Lotus” Season 3. She becomes the second Blackpink member to appear in an HBO series, as Jenni made her own acting debut in the drama “The Idol,” which premiered in June 2023. The first episode of the new season of “White Lotus” premieres on Feb. 16. Check out the video for “Born Again” below:",
