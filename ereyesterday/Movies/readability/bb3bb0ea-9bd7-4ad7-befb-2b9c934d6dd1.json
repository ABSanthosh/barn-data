The dark comedy series has been loved for its dynamic duo, Deborah and Ava, their amazing performances, fresh storyline, and unexpected twists. The current season received a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 97%. With the series having concluded, many are eager to know whether additional episodes or an outing could be expected. Here’s all you need to know. Hacks Season 4 Episode 11 release date and time explained There isn’t a Hacks Season 4 Episode 11 release date and time. This is because Season 4 ended with Episode 10, titled “Heaven,” which premiered on May 29. The dark comedy series centers around the unconventional bond between Deborah, a legendary comedian, and Ava, a controversial writer. Their interesting love-hate relationship pushes their boundaries, allowing them to become their best versions. At times, they also remain at odds but indirectly help each other navigate life challenges. Has Hacks Season 4 ended? Yes, Hacks Season 4 has finished. At the time of writing, Season 5 hasn’t been renewed. Generally, a series renewal depends on multiple factors, including financial viability, viewership, streaming performance, cast availability, rights, and much more. If the series manages to meet most of these expectations, then a renewal is likely. In Hacks’ case, it remains to be seen if the creators have any plans for Season 5. Where to watch previous Hacks Season 4 episodes You can watch Hacks Season 4 via Max. Max is an over-the-top streaming service that picks content from numerous libraries like Warner Bros., Discovery, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Animal Planet, HBO, CNN, and others. It doesn’t offer a free trial, so users are required to purchase a subscription plan starting at $9.99/month. The series’ synopsis reads: “Explore a dark mentorship that forms between Deborah Vance, a legendary Las Vegas comedian, and an entitled, outcast 25-year-old.”",
