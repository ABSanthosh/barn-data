We first learned about the project and a TV show back in February, and in April, we learned about a potential director, but nothing was confirmed. Things have been pretty quiet ever since, but now we have some potential writer announcements. Much like the director reports, no one at Legendary or Hasbro is confirming anything at this time, but Deadline is saying that Noah Gardner and Aidan Fitzgerald have signed on to write the script for the live-action film.¬†They have previously worked on a¬†Power Rangers¬†film that ended up not happening, and they wrote the¬†Aquaman¬†spin-off film,¬†The Trench.
