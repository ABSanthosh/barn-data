  "text": "Billboard Music Awards Presented by Marriott Bonvoy Amid her first Golden Globe nod in more than 15 years, Miley Cyrus is enjoying the glow of Pamela Anderson‘s big screen comeback. Following her nomination for Best Original Song, the artist thanked Anderson and director Gia Coppola for having her contribute to The Last Showgirl with her track ‘Beautiful That Way‘, co-written by Andrew Wyatt and Lykke Li. “It’s an honor to be nominated for Best Original Song alongside my friends and collaborators Andrew Wyatt and Lykke Li at the Golden Globes \u0026 Critics Choice Awards,” she wrote on Instagram. “Pamela is graciously sharing her moment with us. I am continuing to root for her, it’s so fun to watch her shine,” added Cyrus. “Thank you Gia Coppola for inviting me to be a part of your gem The Last Showgirl.” In The Last Showgirl, Anderson stars as Shelley, a Vegas dancer who finds herself at a frightening crossroads when her show is cancelled after a 38-year run and she is told she’s too old to join a new show. Meanwhile, she tries to reconnect with her daughter Hannah (Billie Lourd), while maintaining the other relationships in her life and plotting her future. Pamela Anderson in The Last Showgirl Roadside Attractions During a conversation last month at Deadline’s Sound \u0026 Screen Film music showcase, Wyatt and Li discussed writing the song with Cyrus, noting that her experience as a former child star and current pop star gave her a relevant perspective of the film. “It felt very much something that she could speak to because even though she’s so young, she still has all this experience and these layers to her voice,” said Wyatt. “This is about people who’ve been through quite a lot of phases in their life.” Also starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Kiernan Shipka, Dave Bautista, Brenda Song and Jason Schwartzman, The Last Showgirl is produced by Schwartzman and Natalie Farrey.",
