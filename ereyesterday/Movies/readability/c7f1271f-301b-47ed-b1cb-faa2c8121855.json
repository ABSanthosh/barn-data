  "description": "\"Our son was rapidly sucked into it.\" Greenwich Ent. has revealed an official trailer for AUM: The Cult at the End of the World, a documentary film about the dangerous, psychotic doomsday day cult in Japan known as Aum Shinrikyo. This first premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival a few years ago, and is finally getting released in the US this spring. The shocking story of Aum Shinrikyo (today known as Aleph), the doomsday cult that unleashed a deadly nerve gas in Tokyo’s subway system in March of 1995. Founded by disillusioned yoga teacher Shoko Asahara, Aum transformed into a terrorist organization while Japan’s police and media turned a blind eye. Featuring rare archival footage and an interview with one of Asahara’s former high-ranking disciples. This film is an exploration of Aum Shinrikyo, and its leader Shoko Asahara, who were responsible for attack, involves the participation of those who lived through the horror in the 90s as it unfolded. I'm glad I watched this at Sundance a few years ago, it's fascinating and seriously disquieting understanding how they got away with all of this.

I'm glad I watched this at Sundance a few years ago, it's fascinating and seriously disquieting understanding how they got away with all of this. Another film showing how evil \"religious\" cults always are. Here's the US trailer for Braun \u0026 Yanagimoto's AUM: The Cult at the End of the World, on YouTube: In March 1995 the world was horrified when the release of a deadly nerve gas inside of Tokyo's crowded subway system killed thirteen people and injured thousands more. The revelation that came next was even more unbelievable: The attack was the work of a doomsday cult. The documentary AUM: The Cult at the End of the World traces the shocking evolution of a spiritual group into a terrorist organization, using a wealth of historical footage as well as in-depth interviews with the courageous few who were willing to take on the cult when Japan’s police and mass media were looking the other way. AUM: The Cult at the End of the World is co-directed by filmmakers Ben Braun (also a sales exec at Submarine Ent) \u0026 Chiaki Yanagimoto, both making their feature directorial debut with this film. Produced by Rick Brookwell, Ben Braun, Dan Braun, Josh Braun, and Chiaki Yanagimoto. This initially premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival a few years ago. Greenwich Ent. will debut the doc AUM: The Cult at the End of the World in select US theaters on March 19th, 2025, then on VOD starting on March 28th. Anyone want to find out more?
