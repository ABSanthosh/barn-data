In the years since Amazon Prime Day first cropped up in 2015, other retailers have slowly begun piggy-backing off the behemoth retailer’s deals event with their own summer savings. Basically, what was once a two-day deals event has evolved into a week-long (even month’s worth) sales event that cuts a swath through every commerce category, and now rivals some of the biggest deals days throughout the year such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Amazon Prime Day 2025 runs through July 8-11 this year (yes, a full four days), but retailers like Walmart and Target are hopping on the deals train to offer shopping events of their own. Even better: while most Prime Day deals are reserved for Amazon Prime members, some of this year’s Amazon alternative sales don’t require any membership or subscription sign-up. Below, check out all the best Prime Day alternative deals happening now. Walmart Summer Savings Event Walmart has the most competitive Prime Day alternative sale, with its Summer Savings Event running from July 8 through July 13. That’s an extra two days longer than Amazon. What’s more: this year’s Walmart deals are available online and in store (our suggestion: order online for fast and convenient in-store pickup). Walmart says to expect the best deals on electronics, home goods, fashion, toys and beauty, with discounts on brand names like Samsung, Vizio, Dyson, Timex and more. Current flash deals include up to 40% off air purifiers and home appliances, 30% off mattresses and bedding and up to 50% off luggage sets. Walmart+ members can start saving early with exclusive early access beginning Monday, July 7 at 7 p.m. ET — a full night before the event opens to everyone. Walmart+ members often have exclusive discounts and deals that aren’t available to regular shoppers, in addition to year-long savings on gas, food and entertainment. Not a Walmart+ member? An annual subscription usually costs $98 but you can get a 30-day free trial right now to test out the service here. Target Circle Week Target is launching Target Circle Week as their Prime Day alternative sale, running from July 6-12. Top deals this year include 40% off bedding, up to 40% off electronics and gaming, 30% off men’s and women’s fashion and a “buy one, get one 30% off” deal for select skincare, suncare and haircare products. It’s also a great time to stock up on physical media, with a “buy two, get one free” deal on books, movies and music, including limited-edition Target vinyl. Similar to Walmart+, Target Circle 360 members will get early access to the Circle Week deals, with the savings unlocking for them on July 5. Not a Target Circle 360 member? Sign up now and take $50 off your first same-day delivery order. You’ll get free shipping, an extra 30 days to return items, and members-only perks like a free gift or exclusive discount every month. An annual membership to Target Circle 360 costs $99/month but you can test it out with no commitment with a 14-day free trial here. Nordstrom Anniversary Sale Nordstrom’s anniversary sale is the retailer’s biggest deals event of the year. This year’s sale kicks off July 12 and turns through August 3, but they will likely unveil their sale preview at least a week ahead of time so you can save everything you want to your cart ahead of time. Nordstrom cardmembers can shop Early Access from July 8 to 11, depending on their Nordy Club status. In addition to popular brands like Vince, UGG, Nike, Free People and Sam Edelman, all “at a better value than ever before,” per a press release, Nordstrom says they are also adding more than 65 new brands to the sale this year. That includes 30-50% off brands like Madewell, Frame, Vince and Farm Rio for women, and AG, Faherty, BOSS, Travis Matthew and Theory for men. Nordstrom will also discount brands like Alice \u0026 Olivia, Sperry, Rothy’s and more for the first time as part of its Anniversary Sale. And shoppers can save on beauty brands like Armani Beauty, Augustinus Bader, Bobbi Brown, Charlotte Tilbury, Clé de Peau Beauté, La Mer, MAC Cosmetics, Sisley Paris, Westman Atelier, YSL Beauty, and more. Best Buy Fourth of July Sale Best Buy has thrown a “Black Friday in July” sale in the past but the retailer has yet to announce whether it’s offering a Prime Day alternative sale this year. For now, you can shop Best Buy’s Fourth of July sale, with half off select TVs, audio gear, PCs, cell phones and appliances. We spotted discounts on brands like Apple, Sony, LG, JBL, Samsung and more. You can also shop the Best Buy Outlet for clearance, open-box, refurbished and pre-owned items at even greater discounts. Wayfair Clearance Event Wayfair is also throwing a Fourth of July event, with a massive 70% off savings on select home furniture, accessories, decor and bedding. Save an additional 10% off your cart when you sign up for the Wayfair email list (the site has confirmed that the discounts are stackable). We’ve spotted discounts on sofas, bedroom furniture, patio furniture, lighting, dining tables, desks and more. Since this is a clearance event, items are selling quickly so we recommend adding to cart while they are still in stock.",
