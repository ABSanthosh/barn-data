Here's what you need to know...We know what you're thinking. After a Q4 2024 earnings report that gave the streaming service a whole lot to crow about (like the largest-ever quarterly increase in subscribers at 18.9 million, with now 301.63 million global viewers), what better way for Netflix to celebrate than with – a price increase? That's right, the U.S. and other markets will see price increases – including the first increase to hit the ad-supported plan. Here's how the new numbers are shaping up: Netflix's Standard Plan Without Ads: That's looking at an increase from $15.49 to $17.99 per month – a jump of $2.50. Netflix's Ad-Supported Tier: That's looking at an increase from $6.99 to $7.99 per month – a jump of $1.00. Netflix's Premium Tier (with 4 simultaneous streams): That's looking at an increase from $22.99 to $24.99 per month – a jump of $2.00. Adding Extra Member to Primary Account: A big thing now that Netflix rolled out its password sharing crackdown, that's looking at an increase from $7.99 to $8.99 per month – a jump of $1.00.
