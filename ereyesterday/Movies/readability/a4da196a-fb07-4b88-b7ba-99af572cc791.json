Other Paramount channels in danger of being removed from YouTube TV include CBS Sports Network, Paramount Network, CMT, Nick Jr., Smithsonian Channel, TV Land and VH1. In addition, the dispute threatens to pull Paramount+ and BET+ from YouTube TV Primetime Channels. CBS stations nationwide would be dropped from YouTube TV if the two sides can’t reach a deal. In addition, 10 other local stations that are part of the CBS News and Stations division could go dark in Atlanta (WUPA), Boston (WSBK), Dallas-Fort Worth (KTXA), New York (WLNY), Philadelphia (WPSG), Pittsburgh (WPCW), Sacramento (KMAX), San Francisco (KPYX), Seattle (KSTW) and Tampa Bay (WTOG). “YouTube TV is attempting to pressure Paramount to agree to one-sided terms, and these non-market demands may lead to an avoidable loss of Paramount’s networks on YouTube TV, in addition to the removal of Paramount+ and BET+ from YouTube’s Primetime Channels, on February 13,” a Paramount spokesperson said. Popular on Variety In a blog post, YouTube said in part, “We’ve been working hard to reach a fair agreement with Paramount that allows us to keep their channels, including CBS and CBS Sports, on YouTube TV without passing on additional costs to our subscribers. Unfortunately, despite our good faith negotiations, we haven’t been successful yet.” It continued, “Paramount is an important partner for us and as you can imagine, this is not the outcome that we want. We’re still in active conversations with Paramount and are hopeful we can come to an agreement to keep their content available on YouTube TV.” YouTube said that if it can’t reach an agreement with Paramount “and their content is unavailable for an extended period of time,” YouTube TV subscribers will be able to claim an $8 credit at tv.youtube.com. The company noted that users can watch Paramount shows and movies by signing up for Paramount+, which starts at $7.99/month. The carriage dispute has flared up after YouTube TV hiked its baseline price by $10/month effective Jan. 13, 2025 — rising from $72.99 to $82.99 per month. According to the Paramount rep, “We have made a series of fair offers to continue our long-standing relationship with Google’s YouTube TV, providing subscribers access to the full array of Paramount’s entertainment, news and sports programming,” a Paramount rep said in a statement. “Paramount has become an essential partner with a leading portfolio of channels among YouTube TV households, including CBS — America’s most-watched network — and hit franchises like Paramount Network’s Yellowstone, the top entertainment show on cable.” Paramount claimed it has a “long track record of successfully and amicably renewing partnerships with every major distributor” and that it will “continue our efforts to reach a new agreement with YouTube TV.” YouTube TV, which was launched in February 2017, has more than 8 million subscribers, according to Google. That makes it the biggest internet-delivered pay-TV service in the U.S.",
