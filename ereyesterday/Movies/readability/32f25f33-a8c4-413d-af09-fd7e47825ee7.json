  "text": "Netflix If you need your movies and TV shows to come with a hefty slice of existential dread, then \"Carol \u0026 The End of the World\" has you covered. The Netflix animated series, which was released in December 2023 and comprises 10 episodes, is an unsung gem that packs a hefty emotional punch. Created by Dan Guterman, the miniseries, at its very heart, has a simple but endearing message: What is wrong with embracing the mundane and monotony of life? Starring comedian and actor Martha Kelly, \"Carol \u0026 The End of The World\" tackles an end-of-the-world storyline like few other projects do. The miniseries is not about a young wide-eyed protagonist working with a group of scientist do-gooders to save the planet. Nor is it about a character that tries to suddenly cross off their bucket list by doing everything and anything as Earth's clock begins ticking.  When the planet Keppler begins making a hurtling beeline right for Earth, it's estimated that everyone on the planet has less than a year left before everything goes boom. While most folks use the opportunity of Armageddon to party, travel, and accomplish their wildest dreams, Carol, a 42-year-old secretary, falls into a sad and pensive state because, well ... what's wrong with having a clear-cut daily routine? Carol \u0026 The End of the World boasts stellar reviews Netflix Simply put, critics and general audiences absolutely loved \"Carol \u0026 The End of the World.\" If you're the type of viewer that needs to check out a show's reviews before watching it (no judgement here, everyone does it), just know that the Netflix series absolutely crushed it on Rotten Tomatoes and has a perfect 100% with critics at the time of writing. Just glancing through the comments under the show's trailer on YouTube shows how beloved it is —nothing but positive comments (trust us, we tried finding a negative one). The internet ain't exactly a nice place, and fandoms love coming in hot with the nitpicks, yet \"Carol \u0026 The End of the World\" seems to have garnered nothing but immense praise and admiration. Shortly after the show's release, fans online immediately gravitated toward the poignant existential themes present in Carol's story. Even with certain fiery doom approaching, life does not have to be about going on some metaphorical grand quest. As one Redditor aptly put it for their review of the series: \"We don't know why we are here. We only have each other. And we don't have to live large to live well.\" Over on IMDb, one reviewer wrote that the series was a \"masterpiece with rare imperfections.\" So, if you want a heartwarming tragicomedy that is going to make you cry, laugh, and ask thought-provoking (and maybe even scary) questions, watch \"Carol \u0026 The End of the World.\"  After you're through with the show and if you want to keep the tears rolling, here's an animated Netflix movie that'll make you cry your eyes out.",
