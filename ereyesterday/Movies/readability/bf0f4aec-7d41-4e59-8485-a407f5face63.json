  "text": "Saban Films has released the official Into the Deep trailer for the upcoming survival thriller, featuring Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss. This marks Dreyfuss’ latest shark project, five decades since the theatrical release of the classic Steven Spielberg thriller Jaws. The film is scheduled to make its debut on January 24, 2025 in select theaters, and on digital platforms. It will be debuting in the same month as several high-profile movies such as: the Robbie Williams musical biopic Better Man; the Pamela Anderson drama The Last Showgirl; the Wolf Man remake starring Christopher Abbott; the action thriller sequel Den of Thieves: Pantera with Gerard Butler; and the historical drama September 5 starring Peter Sarsgaard. Check out the Into the Deep trailer below (watch more trailers): What is Into the Deep about? “This action packed thriller follows modern day pirates on the hunt for sunken drugs kidnap a boat of tourists and force them to dive into shark infested waters to retrieve the contraband!,” reads the film’s official synopsis. Into the Deep is directed by Christian Sesma from a screenplay co-written by Chad Law and Josh Ridgway. Besides Dreyfuss, the cast also includes Callum McGowan, Scout Taylor Compton, and Jon Seda with Stuart Townsend and Dreyfuss. The creative team also consist of director of photography Niccolo De La Fere, editor Eric Potter, composer Andy Fosberry, and stunt coordinator Jakkrit Kanokpodjananon, with Chad Law and Daemon Hillin also serving as producers. In addition, it has also received an R-rating from Motion Picture Association for “bloody violence and language.”",
