  "text": "Netflix will no longer make games for “Netflix Stories,” its catalog of interactive fiction games mainly based on romance and dating-focused series. The streamer confirmed that its new gaming strategy will now stick to mobile titles across party games, narrative games, kids games and mainstream games, as well as more games that can be played on TV. As part of the reorg, an undetermined number of staffers have been laid off from the division. Netflix had invested quite a bit previously on its “Stories” franchise, which served as the home for a set of interactive fiction games based on Netflix series like “Virgin River,” “Love is Blind,” “Emily in Paris,” “Outer Banks” and “Perfect Match.” Most recently, a “Sweet Magnolias” game was released in February, but a previously announced game centered on the “Ginny \u0026 Georgia” TV series will no longer be released. That shift in strategy comes following the arrival of Alain Tascan, who joined Netflix last summer as president of games. As part of Tascan’s new focus, the streamer has opted to discontinue plans for additional games for Netflix Stories. Previously release games in the franchise can still be played, however, as the titles will still continue to live on the Netflix app. Popular on Variety Tascan didn’t mention the sunsetting of Netflix Stories earlier this month, however, as he met with reporters March 19 at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. There, he discussed the streamer’s gaming strategy, noting, “We have to match the overall mission of Netflix — otherwise we’re just a distraction.” Netflix has continued to evolve its gaming strategy; in October it shut down its Team Blue studio, which had been developing a triple-A shooter title. But Tascan said that move does not indicate a change in Netflix’s level of ambition in the gaming space. “I want to make that super clear, because some people read that we’re reducing – that’s not at all the case,” Tascan told Variety regarding Team Blue’s shutdown. At GDC, Tascan showcased “Spirit Crossing,” an upcoming Studio Ghibli-esque fantastical life-sim game from Netflix’s Spry Fox studio, set as a massive multiplayer online offering. He also outlined plans to incentivize players of games based on Netflix IP, like its “Squid Game” mobile game, and how Netflix is looking at other ways to blend linear and interactive storytelling across franchises like “Bridgerton.”  The “Netflix Stories” app had been a popular destination ever since the streamer launched its mobile gaming business in 2021, and in 2024, Netflix brass laid out a plan to release one new title in the franchise each month. Recent additions had included last year’s “Netflix Stories: A Perfect Couple” was a nine-chapter story with four different potential endings. The title blended elements of the Netflix limited series adaptation of “The Perfect Couple.” Another one, “Netflix Stories: A Virgin River Christmas,” was a four-chapter story that took players to the town of Virgin River at Christmastime and featured show characters Mel, Jack, Preacher, Hope and Doc interacting with the player through holiday activities.",
