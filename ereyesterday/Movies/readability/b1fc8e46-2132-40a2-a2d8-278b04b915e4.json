The celebrated athlete has long been admired for her incredible achievements as an Olympic gymnast, but her personal life often sparks as much interest among fans. So, here’s a closer look at who Raisman’s current boyfriend is and details of her past relationships. Who is Aly Raisman’s boyfriend? Aly Raisman is currently single and is not in a relationship as of 2025. In an interview with PopSugar in June 2024, Raisman shared her thoughts on reaching the age of 30. She also commented on how societal expectations regarding relationships are. “When I was younger, I thought that by age 30, I would be married with kids. Well, I just turned 30, and I’m single.” Raisman added, “It’s wonderful if you’ve found your soulmate by the age of 30, but why shouldn’t it be just as celebrated and hopeful to be single and still figuring out who you are? I think the most important relationship we will have in life is with ourselves, and we should allow for the time and space for that to develop and flourish. The former gymnast further highlighted the significance of self-discovery and the enduring value of being single. At present, Raisman is concentrating on her personal development and various professional pursuits. Among them is her role as an ESPN gymnastics analyst. Also, she has authored an autobiography titled Fierce as well as a children’s book, From My Head to My Toes. Aly Raisman’s relationship history While Aly Raisman has largely been private about her personal life, she has been linked to a few popular names in the past. Raisman was speculated to have been in a relationship with her school best friend, Jamie McGill, in 2012. It was when he invited her to be his prom date at Needham High School in 2012. Despite the rumors of their romantic involvement that year, she later clarified that they were close friends. (via US Weekly) Subsequently, Raisman’s most notable relationship was with former NFL player and Bachelor Nation star Colton Underwood, which garnered significant media attention. As per People, their common friends introduced them, and they started dating in late 2016. They attended various events together before their separation in June 2017. Underwood even shared details of their split in his book, The First Time. In November 2020, dating rumors again surrounded Aly Raisman when she was reported to be dating actor Chris Evans.
