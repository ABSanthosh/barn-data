  "text": "Travis Kelce is stepping into the acting world and recently recalled a predicament he was put in while guest-hosting Saturday Night Live in 2023. The Kansas City Chiefs star admitted that the table reading for the NBC late-night sketch show was the “hardest” part of doing that show because he “can’t really read that well.” “The writers’ rooms were fun because you’re just getting pitched ideas,” Kelce said on Bussin’ with the Boys podcast. “The table reading, for a guy that can’t really read that well, it was kind of a fucked situation.” He continued, “I felt like I was just trying to get through the reading instead of actually acting it out and giving it a voice and giving it a character and things like that. I was just focused on, ‘Don’t fucking skip this line.'” Watch on Deadline The Super Bowl champion noted that “the table read was the hardest fucking part.” Elsewhere in the interview, Kelce said that doing the comedy came easy for him saying, “The silly stuff, the funny stuff, the comedy, I just feel so much more comfortable.” “There was still a sense of like, ‘I need to be a professional here,'” he added. “I want to take advantage of this, but I want to have fun doing it, but I don’t want to look like a loser doing this. I want to make them respect my approach and how I’m like taking it serious. But it was just a fun roller coaster, man.” During his SNL guest-hosting debut, Kelce poked fun at himself and his reality show past during the show’s monologue. Kelce’s brother Jason also made a cameo during one of the sketches. The NFL star would make a surprise cameo later on that same year in an NFL parody over their excessive coverage of Taylor Swift attending the Chiefs’ games. Kelce has continued his acting work, making a cameo next to Adam Sandler in Happy Gilmore 2 and starring in the FX series Grotesquerie.",
