Check out the Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc trailer below (watch more trailers): — チェンソーマン【公式】 (@CHAINSAWMAN_PR) March 23, 2025 What is Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc about? “Denji became Chainsaw Man a boy with a devil’s heart, and is now part of Special Division 4’s devil hunters,” reads the synopsis. “After a date with Makima, the woman of his dreams, Denji takes shelter from the rain. There he meets Reze, a girl who works in a café.” Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc is directed by Tatsuya Yoshihara from a screenplay written by Hiroshi Seko, based on Tatsuki Fujimoto’s hit manga series of the same name. Yoshihara previously directed two episodes of Season 1. The voice cast includes Kikunosuke Toya as Denji, Reina Ueda as Reze, Fairouz Ai as Power, Tomori Kusunoki as Makina, Shogo Sakata as Aki, Shiori Izawa as Pochita, Karin Takahashi as Kobeni Higashiyama, Natsuki Hanee as Beam, Maaya Uchida as Angel Devil, and more. “In the series, Denji is a teenage boy living with a Chainsaw Devil named Pochita,” reads the logline. “Due to the debt his father left behind, he has been living a rock-bottom life while repaying his debt by harvesting devil corpses with Pochita. One day, Denji is betrayed and killed. As his consciousness fades, he makes a contract with Pochita and gets revived as “Chainsaw Man” — a man with a devil’s heart.” The first season of Chainsaw Man is available for streaming on Crunchyroll.",
