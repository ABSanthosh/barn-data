  "text": "Colman Domingo is gearing up for another season of “Euphoria.” Speaking to Variety hours after scoring a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in “Sing Sing,” Domingo revealed he’s spoken to creator Sam Levinson about the new season — and he’s a big fan of the direction he’s taking the series. “I have not seen a script, but I have heard about some scripts, and what I’ve heard is fantastic,” Domingo said. “It’s characters that we know and we’re on the journey with, and we’re fighting for them as they’re fighting for their own spaces in the world. They’re all having breakthroughs in many ways. That’s what I found out.” He continued, “I think it’s some of the most gorgeous writing that Sam has ever done. It’s just from what I heard too, because I’ve heard from my friend Sam himself. He’s like, ‘Let me just tell you a little bit about it.’ From what he told me, it took my breath away.” Popular on Variety Fans have been awaiting news about the HBO drama for quite some time — it’s been nearly three years since the second season premiered. Production on the endlessly delayed third season is set to begin in January and will feature a time jump when the main cast returns to film. Domingo is confident that fans’ patience will be rewarded with a quality return for the series: “I think it’s going to be an incredible, incredible Season 3, well worth the wait. We will deliver, I promise you that.” The actor previously opened up to Variety on the status of “Euphoria” in a November cover story. “Apparently I will be back for Season 3,” he said, adding that he was unsure of when production would begin. “I’ve heard it’s January. I’ve heard as much as you’ve heard, so we’ll see. But allegedly — that’s a great word to use, ‘allegedly’ — Ali is back. From what I’ve heard.” The series has received 25 Emmy nominations, with nine wins. Among the wins are two for Zendaya for outstanding lead actress in a drama series and one for Domingo for outstanding guest actor in a drama series.",
