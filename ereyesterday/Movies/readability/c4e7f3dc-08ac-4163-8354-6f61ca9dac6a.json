  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Josh Segarra (Abbott Elementary, Scream 6) has joined the cast of Fox‘s medical comedy Best Medicine, starring opposite Josh Charles and Abigail Spencer. The series, based on the popular British series Doc Martin, will go into production this summer in upstate New York. Best Medicine is a one-hour comedy series that centers on Martin Best (Charles), a brilliant surgeon who abruptly leaves his illustrious career in Boston to become the general practitioner in a quaint East Coast fishing village where he spent summers as a child. Unfortunately, Martin’s blunt and borderline rude bedside manner rubs the quirky, needy locals the wrong way, especially local school teacher Louisa Glasson (Spencer); however, tenacity is the creed of everyone in their small village, and the people who live there may be exactly what the doctor ordered. Although Martin can expertly address any medical ailment or mystery in this idiosyncratic town, he’s really just desperate to be left the hell alone. Instead, he keeps getting dragged right smack into the middle of their personal chaos, feuds and fantasies. What the locals don’t know is that Martin’s terse demeanor masks a debilitating new phobia and deep-seated psychological issues that prevent him from experiencing true intimacy with anyone. But tenacity is the creed of everyone in their small village, and the people who live there may be exactly what the doctor ordered. Watch on Deadline In a series regular role, Segarra will play Sheriff Mark Mylow, the lovable, open-hearted lawman who may not be the sharpest tool in the shed but knows this town like the back of his hand. Heartbroken over the breakup of his long-term girlfriend, Louisa, he is excited to befriend Martin. But as Martin and Louisa grow closer, an awkward love triangle emerges. Best Medicine is produced by Fox Entertainment Studios and executive-produced by Ben Silverman (The Office, U.S.), Rodney Ferrell (Stick), Howard T. Owens (Stick), Liz Tuccillo (Sex and the City), Mark Crowdy (Doc Martin) and Philippa Braithwaite (Doc Martin). The series is distributed worldwide by Fox Entertainment Global. All3Media International’s Doc Martin was produced in the UK by Buffalo Pictures in association with Homerun Film Productions, and brought to American audiences by Propagate Content. Segarra can currently be seen starring in the new Netflix limited series Sirens, alongside Meghann Fahy, Julianne Moore, and Kevin Bacon.  Segarra plays Raymond, the proud manager of a restaurant franchise in Buffalo, New York, and the longtime, on-again, off-again toxic boyfriend of Devon (Fahy). He also stars in the award-winning ABC series Abbott Elementary. Appearing alongside Quinta Brunson, Segarra plays Manny, an employee of the school district. Additionally, he can be seen in Friendship, as in the feature film The Threesome, which premiered at the 2025 South by Southwest Film Festival and stars Zoey Deutch. In 2023, Segarra joined the Scream franchise in the newest installment, Scream 6, starring opposite Courtney Cox, Jenna Ortega and Melissa Barrera. He also starred in the Apple TV+ comedy, The Big Door Prize, and Season 2 of the Starz series Heels as Brooks Rizzo. He also played scene-stealing Lance in the third season of HBO Max’s comedy series The Other Two. Prior, he joined the Marvel universe and starred in the hit series She-Hulk, alongside Tatiana Maslany, and starred alongside RuPaul in the Netflix scripted dramedy AJ and the Queen, created by RuPaul and Michael Patrick King. Additional credits include CW’s Arrow as Adrian Chase/Prometheus, Fox’s The Moodys opposite Denis Leary and Elizabeth Perkins. Segarra is repped by CAA, Andrew Tetenbaum at ATA, and Jackoway Tyerman.",
