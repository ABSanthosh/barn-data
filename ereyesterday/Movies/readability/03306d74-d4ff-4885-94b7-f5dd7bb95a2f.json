  "description": "\"You cannot understand the damage you've done.\" Vertical has revealed an official trailer for an indie film called Mind Wave, a tech conspiracy thriller from Chinese-Canadian filmmaker Leon Lee. Set for a VOD release later this week - ready to watch right away if you're intrigued.

Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Leon Lee's thriller Mind Wave, direct from YouTube: A Chinese-Canadian cybersecurity expert (starring Harry Han) is wrongfully accused of a devastating attack on China's internet. As he fights to clear his name, his wife mysteriously vanishes, leaving behind a trail of cryptic clues that point to a deeper conspiracy. Mind Wave is directed by the Chinese-Canadian filmmaker Leon Lee, director of the films Human Harvest, The Bleeding Edge, Avenues of Escape, Letter from Masanjia, Room 0533, and Unsilenced previously. The screenplay is written by Michael Fine and Leon Lee. It's also produced by Leon Lee; co-produced by Jacey Shi and Matt Villeneuve. This hasn't premiered at any film festivals or elsewhere, as far as we know. Flying Cloud / Vertical will debut Leon Lee's Mind Wave film direct-to-VOD to watch starting on December 6th, 2024 this month. Anyone curious about this one?
