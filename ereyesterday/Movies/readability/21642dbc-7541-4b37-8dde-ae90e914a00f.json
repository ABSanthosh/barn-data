The Poetic Justice star and the R\u0026B singer were among many artists who attended the 1,500th performance of Cabaret. Following this, several fans have speculated if the two are romantically involved. So, here’s everything to know about the dating rumors surrounding Jackson and Maxwell, as well as the truth behind the same. Is Janet Jackson dating Maxwell? Fans think that the two musicians are dating, as they were spotted walking together to the Playhouse Theatre in London. However, they are not in a relationship and have been friends for several years. At the recent Cabaret performance, Janet Jackson and Maxwell wore color-coordinated suits, with the former sporting a white pantsuit with a tight bun hairstyle. Moreover, the “Fortunate” hitmaker looked dashing in a black striped suit and a slick hairdo. Despite the rumors after Maxwell and Janet Jackson’s outing, a source confirmed to TMZ that the pair are just friends. Over the years, the duo has maintained a deep camaraderie and attended several events together. The 52-year-old singer-songwriter had also reportedly shown up at Jackson’s performance in Brooklyn during her Together Again tour in July 2024. Notably, Jackson and Maxwell have not explicitly commented on the nature of their relationship. However, the “Velvet Rope” songstress revealed in an interview with The Guardian that she is single. In the 2024 chat, Jackson shared, “I’m single, so I pray to God that I might have different lenses on these eyes than I did before.” The Oscar-nominated actress further explained, “I know that if someone were to come along … even if I didn’t recognize it, I guarantee you my friends would shake the s–t out of me and say, ‘What are you doing?!'” She added, “But I think I’m seeing it through different lenses now. I think I am breaking that pattern.” Janet Jackson was previously married to Wissam Al Mana, with whom she shares a son, Eissa. The former pair tied the knot in 2012 and parted ways in 2017. Jackson’s former spouses also include René Elizondo Jr. and James DeBarge.",
