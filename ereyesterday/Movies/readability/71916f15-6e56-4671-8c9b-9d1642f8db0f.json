  "text": "Opening day The Odyssey tickets went on sale for select IMAX showings earlier this week, and after selling out in minutes, tickets are already popping up on eBay. How much are opening day The Odyssey tickets selling for on eBay? So far, a handful of tickets for the opening weekend showing of The Odyssey have already sold for some outrageous prices online. On eBay, a pair of tickets for the film’s showing on Sunday, July 19, 2026, has sold for $349. A pair of tickets for the film at Los Angeles’ Chinese Theatre has also sold for $300, and a pair of tickets for a Ft. Lauderdale showing has also been sold for $200. While the excitement for The Odyssey is high enough to warrant people selling tickets on sites like eBay, some fans have exercised caution. Some online are mentioning that many AMC theaters check IDs ahead of some ticket-taking, making the practice of buying tickets on third-party sites not a guarantee of anything. The Odyssey features an absolutely star-studded cast that includes Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, Matt Damon, Anne Hathaway, Mia Goth, Benny Safdie, Jon Bernthal, Lupita Nyong’o, Charlize Theron, Elliot Page, Himesh Patel, Bill Irwin, Samantha Morton, Jesse Garcia, Will Yun Lee, Corey Hawkins, Josh Stewart, Jimmy Gonzales, Maurice Compte, and many more. “Christopher Nolan’s next film The Odyssey is a mythic action epic shot across the world using brand new IMAX film technology,” Universal said about the upcoming film. “The film brings Homer’s foundational saga to IMAX film screens for the first time and opens in theaters everywhere on July 17, 2026.” The Odyssey is one of two ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer, a Greek poet who is also credited as the author of the Iliad and who is often seen as one of the most influential and important authors in human history. The Odyssey follows the story of the Greek hero Odysseus, king of Ithaca, as he journeys home after the Trojan War. Presumed dead, Odysseus’ wife Penelope and son Telemachus contend with various suitors who compete for Penelope’s hand in Odysseus’ absence. The Odyssey is thought to have been written sometime in the 8th or 7th century BC and is one of the most important works in literary history.",
