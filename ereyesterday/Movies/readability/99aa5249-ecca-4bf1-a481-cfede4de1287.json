  "text": "During an interview with Parade, actresses Sarah Michelle Gellar and Alyson Hannigan addressed the “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” reboot — which was confirmed to be in the works for Hulu earlier this year — but the stars remained mum on details. “I know never to say never, but I’m excited to hear what Sarah says it’s like,” Hannigan said. “That seems fair,” Gellar laughed. Gellar did confirm that the series would pay tribute to the late actress Michelle Trachtenberg, who played her younger sister Dawn Summers seasons 5 through 7. “We’ll be able to do something,” Gellar said. “We’ll do what’s appropriate.” “I’m sure it will be handled with utter grace,” Hannigan added. Gellar, who has reteamed with Hannigan for an awareness campaign surrounding meningitis vaccination, Ask2BSure, said that she and her former co-star share an easy rapport on set. “We still finish each other’s sentences. You know when I’m lost, and I know when you are,” she said. “I think our … work habits are very similar, so when you approach things the same way, it just evolves.” “Even shooting, I feel like we just had this … unspoken dialogue,” Hannigan said. Last month, Deadline reported that Ryan Kiera Armstrong would star alongside former cast members in the reboot’s pilot — which so far is all that has been ordered. But Gellar was publicly resistant to the idea of a “Buffy” reboot for many years, saying in 2022, “I am very proud of the show that we created and it doesn’t need to be done … We wrapped that up.” But Gellar flipped on the idea after hearing Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao’s plan for the series’ continuation. “The passion that [she] came to me with, what she wanted to do with the show and the character, and why ‘Buffy’ is needed now — it was the first time where I thought, ‘OK, there’s a reason,’” Gellar told Elite Daily. In the same interview, she said the revival had been in the work for four years. “We won’t do it unless it’s 100 percent right and there’s 100 percent a reason,” she added. One place fans will not see Gellar is in the “I Know What You Did Last Summer” sequel, out July 18. The reboot’s director said that Gellar resisted the idea of a return. “I tried, OK? I harassed her! But she is dead,” Robinson told Entertainment Weekly. “I tried to pitch some crazy shit too. I was like, ‘What if it’s like you weren’t dead and you’re actually alive, but in hiding?’ And Sarah’s like, ‘I was on ice. I was the most dead a person could be. You can see my frozen body.’ I was like, ‘Yeah, but what if?’ And she said, ‘I am dead. I am Sarah Dead Gellar.’”",
