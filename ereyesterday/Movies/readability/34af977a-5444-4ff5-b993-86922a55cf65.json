  "text": "HBO won’t be checking out of “The White Lotus” any time soon. The cable network has renewed Mike White‘s acclaimed travel anthology for a fourth season, weeks before Season 3 debuts on February 16. The fourth installment will take place in a yet-to-be-disclosed exotic locale, following the show’s previous excursions to Hawaii and Italy and the upcoming trip to Thailand in Season 3. No actors have been announced for Season 4, but given how slots on the show have become some of the most coveted TV roles in Hollywood, it’s a safe bet that an A-list cast will soon materialize. Season 3 will include Carrie Coon, Walton Goggins, Leslie Bibb, Sarah Catherine Hook, Jason Isaacs, Lalisa Manobal, Michelle Monaghan, Sam Nivola, Lek Patravadi, Parker Posey, Natasha Rothwell, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Tayme Thapthimthong, and Aimee Lou Wood. Also appearing are Nicholas Duvernay, Arnas Fedaravičius, Christian Friedel, Scott Glenn, Dom Hetrakul, Julian Kostov, Charlotte Le Bon, Morgana O’Reilly, and Shalini Peiris. Each season of “The White Lotus” takes place at a different location of the fictional luxury hotel chain that shares its name. Seasons 2 and 3 largely revolve around new ensemble casts, though each season has brought back at least one character from previous years. In a 2023 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, creator and showrunner Mike White revealed that he would be open to assembling an “all-star season” comprised entirely of fan favorite returning characters. “It would be easy to just be full-on anthology, but I think it’s more fun to have little threads through the show,” he said. “If the show goes on for a couple of seasons, it would be fun to have an all-star season.” HBO has not announced a production start date for Season 4, but fans will have plenty of “White Lotus” to tide them over while they wait. In the same interview, White explained that the upcoming Season 3 will satirize death and spirituality in the same way that previous seasons tackled wealth and love. “The first season kind of highlighted money, and then the second season is sex,” he said. “I think the third season would be maybe a satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality. It feels like it could be a rich tapestry to do another round at White Lotus.” “The White Lotus” Season 3 premieres Sunday, February 16 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max, with new episodes releasing weekly.",
