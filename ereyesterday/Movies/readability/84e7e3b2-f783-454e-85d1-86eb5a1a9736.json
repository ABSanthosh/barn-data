From this trailer the movie feels like it's borrowing from The Fly, showing him gradually changing into a monster. Here's the full official trailer (+ poster) for Leigh Whannell's horror film Wolf Man, direct from YouTube: You can also rewatch the teaser trailer for Leigh Whannell's Wolf Man right here, for the first look again. Christopher Abbott stars as Blake, a San Francisco husband and father, who inherits his remote childhood home in rural Oregon after his own father vanishes and is presumed dead. With his marriage to his high-powered wife, Charlotte (Julia Garner), fraying, Blake persuades her to take a break from the city and visit the property with their daughter, Ginger (Matlida Firth). But as the family approaches the farmhouse in the dead of night, they’re attacked by an unseen animal and, in a desperate escape, they barricade themselves inside the home as the creature prowls the perimeter. As the night stretches on, however, Blake begins to behave strangely, transforming into something unrecognizable, and Charlotte will be forced to decide whether the terror within their house is more lethal than the danger without. Wolf Man is directed by acclaimed Australian filmmaker Leigh Whannell, director of the films Insidious: Chapter 3, Upgrade, and The Invisible Man previously; writer for the Saw series, Dead Silence, The Mule. The screenplay is written by Leigh Whannell \u0026 Corbett Tuck, Lauren Schuker Blum \u0026 Rebecca Angelo. Inspired by the 1941 classic The Wolf Man. Produced by Jason Blum (and executive produced by Ryan Gosling!). Universal will debut Whannell's Wolf Man movie in theaters nationwide starting on January 17th, 2025 early next year.
