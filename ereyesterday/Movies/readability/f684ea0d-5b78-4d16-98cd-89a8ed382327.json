  "text": "In the beginning, there was blood. That’s the line from the first trailer of “Dexter: Original Sin” during which a forensics student transforms into the serial killer we know and love from the popular Showtime series “Dexter.” Patrick GIbson stars as Young Dexter in this prequel series coming to Paramount+ with Showtime next month, the origin story of how Gibson becomes Michael C. Hall‘s Dexter Morgan. The trailer for the 10-episode series shows Hall’s Dexter lying on his death bed with his life flashing before his eyes, revealing a colorful Miami and how Dexter’s father, played by Christian Slater, coaxes him into a life of homicide, killing only the bad guys and making sure he never gets caught. Here’s the official logline: “Set in 1991 Miami, ‘Dexter: Original Sin‘ follows Dexter (Patrick Gibson) as he transitions from student to avenging serial killer. When his bloodthirsty urges can’t be ignored any longer, Dexter must learn to channel his inner darkness. With the guidance of his father, Harry (Christian Slater), he adopts a Code designed to help him find and kill people who deserve to be eliminated from society without getting on law enforcement’s radar. This is a particular challenge for young Dexter as he begins a forensics internship at the Miami Metro Police Department.” “Dexter: Original Sin” also stars Molly Brown, Christina Milian, James Martinez, Alex Shimizu, Reno Wilson, special guest star Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Patrick Dempsey. Michael C. Hall returns to voice the iconic inner monologue in Dexter Morgan’s head. The series is executive produced by Clyde Phillips and produced by SHOWTIME Studios and Counterpart Studios. Executive producers also include Scott Reynolds, Hall, Mary Leah Sutton, Tony Hernandez, and Lilly Burns. The series is produced by Robert Lloyd Lewis (“The Lincoln Lawyer”). Michael Lehmann (“Heathers”) serves as directing executive producer. For Showtime Studios, the series is being creatively overseen by Gary Levine and Urooj Sharif with production supervised by Tara Power. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution outside of Paramount+ markets. We last saw Dexter Morgan on screen in 2021 with “Dexter: New Blood,” which saw Hall reprise the role eight years after the conclusion of the original series, which ran from 2006 to 2013 on Showtime. “Original Sin” will premiere on Paramount+ with Showtime for on-demand streaming on December 13 (if you have the Showtime plan), and it will also air in the US on the Showtime linear channel on Sunday, December 15 at 10 p.m. ET/PT. Check out the first trailer below:",
