  "text": "The Punisher is officially headed to the big screens, with THR reporting that Jon Bernthal has joined the cast of the upcoming fourth Spider-Man movie, Brand New Day. Who else is in the Spider-Man 4 cast? THR’s report notes that Bernthal will join the likes of Tom Holland and a few other stars in the movie. So far, the cast for the movie remains as mysterious as the actual film’s story, with the only confirmed stars being Bernthal, Holland, Zendaya, Jacob Batalon, and Sadie Sink, the latter of which will be in a mysterious role. Although nothing is known about the movie, that hasn’t stopped tons of rumors from floating around. Rumors about what Sadie Sink’s character to Nicole Kidman appearing in the movie have kept fans theorizing on what the movie could include. Spider-Man: Brand New Day is being directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, who previously helmed the MCU film Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, which was released in 2021. Cretton was also attached to direct the fourth Avengers movie for a time, back when it was called Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, but stepped down from the position in November 2023. Spider-Man 4 will be released in United States theaters on July 31, 2026, with the film releasing ahead of Avengers: Doomsday (December 18, 2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (December 17, 2027) following Doomsday’s delay.
