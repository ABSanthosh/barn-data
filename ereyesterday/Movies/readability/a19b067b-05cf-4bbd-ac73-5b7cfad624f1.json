  "text": "Ryan Reynolds is wishing his Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine co-star Hugh Jackman a happy 56th birthday, with a crop of images featuring behind-the-scenes moments from their time filming the Disney and Marvel Studios tentpole. “I hope we get to do this til we’re 90. Happy Birthday, @thehughjackman,” Reynolds wrote on Instagram. “A lot of years. A lot of adventures.” The first line references a running joke in the action film, where Reynolds’ masked anti-hero breaks the fourth wall to joke about Jackman’s repeated reprisal of the Adamantium-clawed mutant: “Disney’s gonna make him do this ’til he’s 90,” Deadpool delivers in the movie. The carousel of pictures includes shots of the two at red carpet premieres and behind-the-scenes from the superhero movie — of the two chatting and embracing, as well as one posing with director Shawn Levy. Reynolds also bid well wishes to Jackman on his Instagram Story, writing a quote originally spoken by Harrison Ford’s Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark: “It’s not the years, honey. It’s the mileage.” He added in cursive alongside the quote, “Happy Birthday to the one and only, Greatest Showman,” referencing Jackman’s turn as the title performer in the Oscar-nominated musical. Watch on Deadline Back in August, Reynolds celebrated another Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine co-star, Wesley Snipes, calling for “more Blade” after the actor reprised the role in the pic. “The reaction when @realwesleysnipes enters the movie is the most intense thing l’ve heard in a theater. People screaming with uninhibited joy and love is also the sound of a legacy,” Reynolds shared alongside photos from the set.",
