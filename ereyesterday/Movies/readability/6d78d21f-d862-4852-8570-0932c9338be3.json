  "text": "The first Zootopia 2 photos have been released, revealing a new character — a quokka therapist named Dr. Fuzzby, who is played by Quinta Brunson. The original Zootopia hit theaters in March 2016. The voice cast of the animated Disney movie directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore includes Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps and Jason Bateman as Nick Wilde. Zootopia 2 is now scheduled to hit theaters this coming November. Bateman and Goodwin are both returning as their respective characters, while Ke Huy Quan (Everything Everywhere All At Once, Love Hurts) is voicing a snake named Gary. Check out the Zootopia 2 photos below: (Photo Credit: Disney)(Photo Credit: Disney) Who is in Zootopia 2? The film will see Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde reunite for a new case that involves them going undercover. The film will also introduce audiences to a beaver named Nibbles voiced by Fortune Feimster (You’re Cordially Invited, Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar), while Shakira is additionally returning as the pop music superstar Gazelle. “In Walt Disney Animation Studios’ Zootopia 2 detectives Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who arrives in Zootopia and turns the mammal metropolis upside down,” the official synopsis reads. “To crack the case, Judy and Nick must go undercover to unexpected new parts of town, where their growing partnership is tested like never before.” The film is directed by Howard and Jared Bush, with a screenplay by Bush. Yvett Merino serves as producer.  Following Zootopia, Disney released an animated miniseries titled Zootopia+ in November 2022. The anthology show followed a handful of characters — such as Bonnie Hunt’s Bonnie Hopps, Alan Tudyk’s Duke Weaselton, and more — during events that took place during the original film. Zootopia 2 will be released in United States theaters on November 26, 2025. Both Zootopia and Zootopia+, meanwhile, are currently available to stream on Disney+.",
