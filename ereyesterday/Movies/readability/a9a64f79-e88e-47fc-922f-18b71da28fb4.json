  "text": "The recent spoilers of The Young and the Restless are keeping viewers on the edge of their seats, especially with the ever-changing dynamics between Phyllis Summers and Sharon Newman. The duo’s beef started when Phyllis’ influence began to cause problems in Sharon and Nick Newman’s relationship. The long-term rivals subsequently decided upon a truce while trying to escape Martin, their captor. Nevertheless, the current plot of Y\u0026R seems to indicate that Phyllis and Sharon might end up on opposite sides once again. So, let’s take a deep dive into the two ladies’ history on The Young and the Restless and their current equation. Will Phyllis and Sharon become rivals again in The Young and the Restless? As per the latest Young and Restless spoilers, Phyllis and Sharon might resume their enmity after the latter catches her rival sharing a comforting moment with Nick Newman. In the upcoming Y\u0026R episode, Sharon heads to the park, only to find Nick trying to provide emotional support to an upset Phyllis. Seeing the two former lovers in such a position ultimately ignites feelings of jealousy and anger in Sharon. With Phyllis and Sharon sharing a rather rocky past in Young and Restless, the latter’s continued involvement with Sharon’s husband might force Victor Newman’s daughter-in-law to break her peace agreement with Phyllis. In the past, Sharon has witnessed Nick start an affair with Phyllis after the demise of their daughter, Cassie. He even went as far as to have a child with her in the form of Summer. Things went from bad to worse when Sharon inadvertently mixed up Summer’s paternity results, declaring Jack as her father instead of Nick. Besides, even after Nick and Sharon decided to resolve their issues and tie the knot, Phyllis caused much commotion. She revealed Sharon’s act of mishandling Summer’s paternity test, that too, on their wedding day. While Phyllis and Sharon have since found a common ground, recent happenings in The Young and the Restless do threaten to undo their truce in upcoming episodes.",
