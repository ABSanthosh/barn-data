  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Mark Kimsey and Roger Birnbaum‘s Electromagnetic Productions are developing the feature film, Inconceivable. The film, written by Lauren Black, is a gripping thriller about 38-year-old college professor Sydney Drake, who is determined to obliterate any obstacle in her quest to conceive. She finds an unlikely mark in an unsuspecting student that she drags into her increasingly unhinged journey as a decades-old secret entwining their pasts threatens to blow up both their lives. Along with Birnbaum and Kimsey, James Deutch from EMP will produce with Colleen Camp, Jonathan M. Black, Lauren Black and their companies Colleen Camp Productions and Chair 10 Productions.   “I didn’t become a mother until I was nearly 40. For most of my adult life, I was perpetually single and never in a place to have a baby on my own. All the while, the question nagged at me: What if I waited too long?” said screenwriter Lauren Black. “Inconceivable was born out of this question — what happens when the one thing a woman wants more than anything in life seems just beyond her reach? The script paints a darkly comic and suspenseful picture of what can happen when one woman’s single-minded pursuit of motherhood collides with the emotional reality of infertility, dredging up long-buried hurts that bleed into the characters’ lives with devastating consequences.” Watch on Deadline “Inconceivable tackles the hot-button issues of infertility and IVF head-on. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is used to conceive about 2.3% of babies born in the United States each year and with IVF being front page news we felt this story would resonate with millions of people whose lives are touched by IVF,” said Deutch.  The team is currently casting for the leading role of Sydney and seeking a director with an eye on a 2025 shoot. Jonathan M. Black’s producing credits include For a Good Time, Call…,Odd Man and Unleashed. Lauren Black’s TV production credits include Quit Your Day Job, Street Art Throwdown and Restaurant Startup.",
