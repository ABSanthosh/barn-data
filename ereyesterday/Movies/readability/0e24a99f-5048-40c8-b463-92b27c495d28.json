  "description": "\"We can win with something the other teams don't have - and that's The Rhythm.\" Samuel Goldwyn Films has revealed the official trailer for an indie hockey movie called The Rhythm, formerly known as Black Ice: The Rhythm - the first film made by director Gerald McBride. I'd really wish they kept that original title Black Ice, because this other one does not really do much. It's the inspirational story of a Black hockey player who is sentenced to community service at a local hockey rink, where he leads his misfit hockey team to victory in a seemingly bigoted sport \u0026 league. Robert helps transform a group of roller skaters into a championship-caliber ice-hockey team by harnessing their natural talent \u0026 passion, but they must confront racism and discrimination in the predominantly white world of the sport. Arthur Cartwright stars with Jaclene Wilk, Devante Jamar Adams, Carlos Faison, Jovonn Crittendon, Shawnta McDougle. This is pretty much just a Mighty Ducks remake, which is fine, just wish they'd mix up the story somehow. Also a chance to remind everyone of the Black hockey documentary called Black Ice - available on Hulu now. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Gerald McBride's [â€¦]",

Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Gerald McBride's film The Rhythm, direct from YouTube: Fresh out of a three-year prison stint, Robert faces an unexpected challenge: forming a hockey team in an all-black urban neighborhood with a neglected ice rink. Under the watchful eye of his supervisor, Olivia, he must transform roller-skating prodigies from a nearby rink into ice hockey stars. As he guides these novice players, the ice melts away barriers, forging an unlikely team destined for greatness. The Rhythm, formerly known as Black Ice: The Rhythm, is both written \u0026 directed by indie filmmaker Gerald McBride, making his feature directorial debut with this project after working in radio for decades and only watching a hockey game a decade ago. It's produced by Wes Briscoe and Ashlee C. Woolridge. This initially premiered in select theaters in Detroit, Michigan and around the area last year (read more). Goldwyn Films will debut McBride's The Rhythm direct-to-VOD to watch starting May 16th, 2025. Details on the film's official site. Find more posts in: Indies, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
