Here's the autumn re-release trailer for Mike Cheslik's cult classic Hundreds of Beavers, from YouTube: You can rewatch the official trailer for Mike Cheslik's Hundreds of Beavers right here for the original debut. Via Fantasia: \"Paying homage to silent cinema and cartoonality, Mike Cheslik's feature debut Hundreds of Beavers opens with an epic animated sequence introducing us to our trusty hero, a drunken applejack salesman whose supply of Applejack Cider is ruined due to the work of some hungry beavers. To recover his fortune, he must become the greatest fur trapper the continent has ever seen by defeating hundreds of beavers. Hundreds of Beavers is a no-dialogue heroic epic that is endlessly inventive, embracing the innovative spirit of cinema's first decades while using animation to reimagine natural laws in creative and compelling ways.\" Hundreds of Beavers is both written and directed by animator / editor / filmmaker Mike Cheslik, making his feature directorial debut after a few other short films previously. The screenplay is by Cheslik and Ryland Brickson Cole Tews. It's produced by Kurt Ravenwood, Matt Sabljak, and Ryland Brickson Cole Tews. This initially premiered at Fantastic Fest 2022 \u0026 Fantasia 2023. Hundreds of Beavers first opened in US theaters on January 26th, 2024. It'll play again in theaters this December â€“ listings.
