In a post shared to Simon’s Instagram account on Saturday, it was announced that Simon canceled his Saturday and Sunday performances at the Philadelphia Academy of Music due to an ongoing issue with his back. “Regretfully, Paul Simon must cancel two shows tonight June 28 and tomorrow night June 19 – at Philadelphia’s Academy of Music,” read the post. “Paul has been struggling with chronic and intense back pain. Today it became unmanageable and demands immediate attention.” The post continued, “Unfortunately we have to cancel these shows at this time, as we don’t have the ability to reschedule them. However, we are hopeful after this minor surgical procedure which has been scheduled in the next few days, Paul will be able to complete the tour as well as look into returning to make up these dates.” Popular on Variety The post went on to say that full refunds will be provided to those who purchased tickets in advance for the show. Simon, who is currently on his “A Quiet Celebration Tour,” performed at the Philadelphia venue only two days prior on Thursday. It was the first of three shows to take place in the city. After the stint on the East Coast, the tour heads to the Terrace Theater at the Long Beach Performing Arts Center on July 7. Especially considering the surgery, it is unclear how Simon’s health will affect the rest of the tour. After stopping in Long Beach, Calif., Simon is set to do a five-night stint at Los Angeles’ Disney Hall.",
