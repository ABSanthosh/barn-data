  "description": "\"There is a house under the house.\" Shudder has released the trailer for an indie Irish folk horror film titled Fréwaka, made by Irish filmmaker Aislinn Clarke. This first premiered at the 2024 Locarno Film Festival last year, and played at a few other fests including the Sitges Film Festival. Nursing student Shoo takes a placement in a remote Irish village to care for Peig a reclusive, elderly woman who lives in fear, haunted by her experiences in a Catholic asylum... only for Shoo's own troubled upbringing to catch up with her. As they develop a connection, Shoo is consumed by the old woman's paranoia, rituals, and superstitions, eventually confronting the horrors of her past. This stars Clare Monnelly, Bríd Ní Neachtain, and Aleksandra Bystrzhitskaya. This earned positive reviews during its festival run. This one in particular: \"Much of the horror derives from the disquieting mood Clarke can create by simply letting the camera be still; by its end, Fréwaka made me afraid of the shadows in my own room.\" Yep, that sounds like this is a real creepy watch.

Highly acclaimed during its run at the Locarno Film Festival, this subtle but disturbing work combines the exhilarating imagery of pagan horror with a reflection on female trauma and the role of the church in rural communities.\" Fréwaka is written and directed by Irish filmmaker Aislinn Clarke, also director of the horror film The Devil's Doorway previously, as well as many other shorts. Produced by Dermot Lavery. This initially premiered at the 2024 Locarno Film Festival last year, and it also played at the Sitges, Chicago, Cork, and London Film Festivals. Shudder will debut Aislinn Clarke's Fréwaka horror film streaming on Shudder starting April 25th, 2025 coming soon this spring. Who's curious about this movie?
