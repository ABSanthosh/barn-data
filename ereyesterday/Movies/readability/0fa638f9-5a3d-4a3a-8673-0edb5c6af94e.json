  "description": "\"We are here to live with everything you've got...\" Samuel Goldwyn Films has revealed an official trailer for To Live and Die and Live, a unique indie film set in Detroit from filmmaker Qasim Basir. This initially premiered in 2023 at the Sundance Film Festival and will finally be released this year - starting in limited theaters this month. Muhammad returns home to Detroit to bury his stepfather and is thrust into settling his accounts, but Muhammad’s struggles with depression and addiction may finish him before he finishes the task. Muhammad has returned for the funeral, but his own battle with addiction, which he hides from the world, drives him to immediately fade away into the sultry, late-night, drug-saturated after-hours of Detroit and an equally intoxicating romantic relationship. One of the most stunning contemporary films shot in Detroit. Starring Amin Joseph as Muhammad, with Skye P. Marshall, Omari Hardwick, Cory Hardrict, Dana Gourrier, Maryam Basir, and Samantha Basir. I saw this at Sundance and it's very good - an emotionally affecting, intimate, vulnerable film about growing up and finding peace. Worth a look. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Qasim Basir's film To Live and Die and Live, found […]",
