  "text": "Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) may be barely holding it together as chaos swirls around him — and as the forces that want to tear down New York City also menace his allegedly reformed antagonist Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio) — but the world of “Daredevil” looks as rich as it ever has in its newest iteration, “Daredevil: Born Again.” Director of Photography Hillary Fyfe Spera, who shot seven out of nine episodes for the series, and cinematographer Pedro Gómez Millán, who shot Episodes 4 and 5, have both embraced the mission of giving Murdock’s New York a kind of dirtbag romance — visually speaking, at least — in the grand tradition of beautifully grimy films like “Taxi Driver” and “The French Connection.”  Popular on IndieWire The challenge was crafting a cinematic grammar where that vision of Hell’s Kitchen can co-exist with Matt’s sensory abilities as Daredevil, his personal church that is the courtroom, Fisk’s adventures in mayoral politics, and, on top of all that, some truly ultraviolent fight scenes. IndieWire asked Fyfe Spera how the cinematography holds all the different, contradictory pieces of Matt Murdock (though how contradictory are they, really?) together visually. What the director of photography found was that many of the great thrillers of ’70s she reached for as inspiration for the look of New York City offered ways into all the environment and thematic concerns that “Daredevil: Born Again” explores.  “There’s some great stuff coming up [in the series where] you’ve got a really human story, but then there are scenes with really elevated lighting and it still all does feel within the same conversation,” Fyfe Spera told IndieWire.  Read on to learn more about how the shape of that conversation took place and the particular technical choices that Fyfe Spera and the camera team made in order to capture Marvel‘s return to the (mean) streets of New York.  This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  ‘Daredevil: Born Again‘Giovanni Rufino/Marvel IndieWire: I’m curious about the formats and your camera and lens choices for “Daredevil: Born Again.” How did you get your arms around the look of the show?  Fyfe Spera:  I came from shooting film and came from making movies back in the day, very DIY, so lensing is huge for me. I think that’s where it begins. I tend to gravitate towards vintage lenses more than anything else. So we shot the show on the ALEXA 35. I’m always gravitating towards the ALEXA and the 35 is cool because it allowed us to use 35-size sensor lenses, typically vintage lenses.  So for this, we worked with Panavision and we had G-Series Panavision lenses, which are just beautiful. They’re really textured and just have this — I always saw this project as anamorphic. It just felt to me to be kind of more cinematic and elevated. Hell’s Kitchen does feel like a very anamorphic place.   It really is. Then also [it’s] extremely grounded, which is another big aspect of the show that was important. So it was a no-brainer for me: G-Series, Panavision lenses. They’re magic.  Did you discover anything about the look of the show through testing?    I love testing. I feel like that’s the room to really play and explore. So for this show in particular, we did a lot of testing, especially for the sensory aspects of it. It was important to us to find something that was largely analog, that we could do in camera [for Matt’s sensory abilities]. We ultimately landed on a combination of using lensing, aspect ratio changes, and then some filtration to bring it home. 99 percent of it’s in camera, aside from the aspect ratio change, which is pretty cool and exciting.  You know, perfection is not something that I strive for [with lenses]. I really love accepting the anomalies, the weirdness, and the texture that is kind of unique.  Hector Ayala / White Tiger (Kamar de los Reyes) in Marvel Television’s DAREDEVIL: BORN AGAIN, exclusively on Disney+. Photo by Giovanni Rufino. © 2024 MARVEL.Giovanni Rufino/Marvel Yeah, I’ve been enjoying that the show’s visual grammar can have this kind of richness, gritty cityscape crime stuff and also just do a courtroom drama. I’d love to ask about some of the more procedural elements, Wilson Fisk’s politics show, as it were, and making it all feel united.  Totally. That was another part that was super interesting to me for this show. It has all these different aspects. The courtroom stuff is as important as the action, as the mythology, in a lot of ways.  For Matt, the courtroom is a bit like church. It’s his place of just reverence. We did a lot of wide lenses close-ups to shoot that, to feel very with the characters. And then, with Fisk, we shoot his world in a different visual language, which is a lot of locked down cameras, not handheld, a lot of wide-angle close-ups but from below the eyeline, usually, to make him feel big and oppressive — and to also make his institution feel big and oppressive. It’s really fun to be able to have these different visual styles, but they are all having the same conversation, which was really critical.  The lighting evolves as well. In [Fisk’s] world it’s more about the use of white light or overhead sources versus more lighting coming from the windows or more naturalistic for Matt.  ‘Daredevil: Born Again’ Giovanni Rufino / Marvel You do get that oppressive, strained vibe even if you’re not picking up on the fact that it’s coming from the lighting, yeah.  One of my biggest north stars just in life as a cinematographer is the films of the ‘70s. I really gravitate towards them. My pitch, way back before I was hired, was to really make this a New York ‘70s movie. It just felt really appropriate. I love that those movies are really about characters, about how humans navigate through the world. So “The French Connection” was probably our biggest north star. Also “Taxi Driver,” “Mean Streets,” your go-tos. “Klute” was another really big one for me.   But also photographers like Saul Leiter and Robert Frank are two big ones for me. And it just felt like this New York [needed to be] textured and grimy but also beautiful, you know? Saul’s work in particular finds a way of finding beauty in these really small moments and there’s something in Matt’s world of hiding in plain sight — and Fisk is doing the same. The parallels with the two of them are really visceral [and] human.  You know, in the first episode, the cutting between Matt walking through the crowd after Fisk is elected and Fisk standing on the balcony — they’re both kind of iconic scenarios. And they’re both lit in this cinematic way. But they’re just human beings dealing with their next steps. There are these payoffs, you know, these comic book cinematic moments where you have to feel like you’ve earned it. The ‘70s really do that. There are these movies that are crazy circumstances but the people always feel really real. And we wanted to build that world.  “Daredevil: Born Again” is streaming on Disney+",

I think that’s where it begins. I tend to gravitate towards vintage lenses more than anything else. So we shot the show on the ALEXA 35. I’m always gravitating towards the ALEXA and the 35 is cool because it allowed us to use 35-size sensor lenses, typically vintage lenses. \n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo for this, we worked with Panavision and we had G-Series Panavision lenses, which are just beautiful. They’re really textured and just have this — I always saw this project as anamorphic. It just felt to me to be kind of more cinematic and elevated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHell’s Kitchen does feel like a very anamorphic place.  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt really is. Then also [it’s] extremely grounded, which is another big aspect of the show that was important. So it was a no-brainer for me: G-Series, Panavision lenses. They’re magic. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid you discover anything about the look of the show through testing?  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e I love testing. I feel like that’s the room to really play and explore. So for this show in particular, we did a lot of testing, especially for the sensory aspects of it. It was important to us to find something that was largely analog, that we could do in camera [for Matt’s sensory abilities]. We ultimately landed on a combination of using lensing, aspect ratio changes, and then some filtration to bring it home. 99 percent of it’s in camera, aside from the aspect ratio change, which is pretty cool and exciting. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou know, perfection is not something that I strive for [with lenses]. I really love accepting the anomalies, the weirdness, and the texture that is kind of unique. \n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OTK-103-07636_R.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"Hector Ayala / White Tiger (Kamar de los Reyes) in Marvel Television\u0026#39;s DAREDEVIL: BORN AGAIN, exclusively on Disney+.

I’d love to ask about some of the more procedural elements, Wilson Fisk’s politics show, as it were, and making it all feel united. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTotally. That was another part that was super interesting to me for this show. It has all these different aspects. The courtroom stuff is as important as the action, as the mythology, in a lot of ways. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor Matt, the courtroom is a bit like church. It’s his place of just reverence. We did a lot of wide lenses close-ups to shoot that, to feel very \u003cem\u003ewith\u003c/em\u003e the characters. And then, with Fisk, we shoot his world in a different visual language, which is a lot of locked down cameras, not handheld, a lot of wide-angle close-ups but from below the eyeline, usually, to make him feel big and oppressive — and to also make his institution feel big and oppressive. It’s really fun to be able to have these different visual styles, but they are all having the same conversation, which was really critical. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe lighting evolves as well. In [Fisk’s] world it’s more about the use of white light or overhead sources versus more lighting coming from the windows or more naturalistic for Matt. \n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OTK-101-35010_R.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"(L-R): Wilson Fisk/Kingpin (Vincent D\u0026#39;Onofrio) and Vanessa Fisk (Ayelet Zurer) in Marvel Television\u0026#39;s DAREDEVIL: BORN AGAIN, exclusively on Disney+.

I really gravitate towards them. My pitch, way back before I was hired, was to really make this a New York ‘70s movie. It just felt really appropriate. I love that those movies are really about characters, about how humans navigate through the world. So “The French Connection” was probably our biggest north star. Also “Taxi Driver,” “Mean Streets,” your go-tos. “Klute” was another really big one for me.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut also photographers like Saul Leiter and Robert Frank are two big ones for me. And it just felt like this New York [needed to be] textured and grimy but also beautiful, you know? Saul’s work in particular finds a way of finding beauty in these really small moments and there’s something in Matt’s world of hiding in plain sight — and Fisk is doing the same. The parallels with the two of them are really visceral [and] human. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou know, in the first episode, the cutting between Matt walking through the crowd after Fisk is elected and Fisk standing on the balcony — they’re both kind of iconic scenarios. And they’re both lit in this cinematic way. But they’re just human beings dealing with their next steps. There are these payoffs, you know, these comic book cinematic moments where you have to feel like you’ve earned it. The ‘70s really do that. There are these movies that are crazy circumstances but the people always feel really real. And we wanted to build that world. \n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“Daredevil: Born Again” is streaming on Disney+ \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
