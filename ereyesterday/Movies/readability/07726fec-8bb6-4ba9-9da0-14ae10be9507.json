  "text": "Donald Trump has just been ordered by a federal judge to “return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith.” In an order handed down just a couple of hours after a pitched hearing in San Francisco between Department of Justice lawyers and Golden State attorneys, Judge Charles Breyer awarded Gavin Newsom the Temporary Restraining Order he sought over Trump’s federalization of the California National Guard on June 7 after protests over ICE raids of undocumented immigrants in and around LA. “At this early stage of the proceedings, the Court must determine whether the President followed the congressionally mandated procedure for his actions,” the judge wrote in a 36-page order Thursday evening. “He did not.” The Bill Clinton appointed judge added: “His actions were illegal—both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.” Whether or not, this White House complies with Judge Breyer’s order is a whole other matter Watch on Deadline Less than two hours before today’s hearing, Homeland Security Sec. Kristi Noem appeared to be backing Defense Sec. Hegseth’s avoidance from a Congressional hearing in DC earlier in the day of whether or not the administration would resepct court orders over its use of troops in LA. “We are not going away,” Noem said at the same LA press conference where federal agents shockingly assaulted Sen. Alex Padilla, handcuffed and dragged him away for trying to ask the DHS chief a question. “We are staying here to liberate this city from the socialist and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into this city,” Noem went on to say with a reference to California and LA’s `sanctuary’ policies, which prevent state and civic participation in federal immigration raids and detentions.",
