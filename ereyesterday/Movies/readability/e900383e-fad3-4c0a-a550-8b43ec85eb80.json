Moreover, fans captured the tense moment in a video that has been making rounds on the internet following the game. Here’s everything to know about what went down at the Clippers vs. Lakers match with Scott. What happened to Travis Scott at Clippers vs. Lakers match? Following the Clippers vs. Lakers, the rapper was walking along the court side when he was reportedly manhandled by an NBA security guard. As per the video circulating online, the guard seemingly mistook Travis Scott as an unauthorized trespasser and attempted to forcibly pull the latter off the court. From the said clip, it was clear that the guard didn’t initially recognize the “FE!N” singer, which led to a brief yet unintentional altercation. The video that has now gone viral among Scott’s massive fandom shows the security guard pulling and shoving him in a moment of confusion. Luckily, he quickly let go of the rapper after some other individuals intervened. Although the altercation was brief, it did end up being an awkward moment at the Clippers vs. Lakers game that unfolded on February 5. Needless to say, netizens have poured in their thoughts over the incident, with many criticizing the actions of the security guard. Most netizens have pointed out how ludicrous it was for the security personnel to not know who Travis Scott is, given that he is one of the most influential figures in hip-hop today. Meanwhile, many have found it to be a humorous incident. Additionally, there are some individuals who are siding with the security guard for doing what his job requires. One such user commented, “Nothing wrong with security, and don’t put super stars higher than security guys.” Meanwhile, neither Travis Scott nor the Intuit Dome authorities have addressed the incident.",
