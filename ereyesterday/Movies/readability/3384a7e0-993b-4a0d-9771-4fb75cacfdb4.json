  "text": "The Lanterns cast continues to grow, with Variety reporting that Never Have I Ever star Poorna Jagannathan will star in the upcoming series in a recurring role. According to the report, Jagannathan will play the role of Zoe, a character described as “effortlessly confident and poised in any setting, even those where she stands out. She is every bit as composed and cunning of the influential men around her.” Jagannathan is best known for her roles in the Netflix comedy Never Have I Ever, and already has a relationship with HBO, having starred in their hit limited series The Night Of. Jagannathan will next star in the upcoming Hulu series Deli Boys, after appearing in the 2024 George Clooney and Brad Pitt-led Wolfs. Who else is in the Lanterns cast? The Lanterns cast will star Aaron Pierre as John Stewart alongside Kyle Chandler, who has been cast in the series as Hal Jordan in the upcoming series. A separate report from THR notes that HBO looks to begin filming from January to June next year, so more information should come soon. Other confirmed cast members for the series include Kelly Macdonald, who will play a character known as Sheriff Kerry in the series. Lanterns will be executive produced by Chris Mundy (True Detective: Night Country, Ozark), Damon Lindelof (The Leftovers, Watchmen), and Tom King (Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow), with the latter two also co-writing the series. It received an official straight-to-series-order at HBO last June 2024, more than a year since the 8-episode project was first announced back in January 2023. “The series follows new recruit John Stewart and Lantern legend Hal Jordan, two intergalactic cops drawn into a dark, earth-based mystery as they investigate a murder in the American heartland,” the synopsis for the show reads.
