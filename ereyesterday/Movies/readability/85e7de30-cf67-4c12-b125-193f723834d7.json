  "text": "Johnny Rodriguez, one of country music’s first Hispanic stars and known for 1970s hits “Ridin’ My Thumb to Mexico” and “That’s the Way Love Goes,” has died at the age of 73. Rodriguez died on Friday after entering hospice care. His daughter, Aubry Rodriguez, announced news of his death on social media, stating that he was surrounded by family. “Dad was not only a legendary musician whose artistry touched millions around the world, but also a deeply loved husband, father, uncle, and brother whose warmth, humor, and compassion shaped the lives of all who knew him,” she wrote. “We are immensely grateful for the outpouring of love and support from fans, colleagues, and friends during this time of grief.” Throughout his career, Rodriguez blazed the trail for Hispanic musicians in the country space. He found success on the charts since the start of his career, earning six No. 1 songs on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and 20 top 10s. He was also honored by the Academy of Country Music and nominated for CMA Awards, and was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in 2007. Popular on Variety Rodriguez was born in Sabinal, Texas, in 1951. At the age of 18, he ended up in jail, where Texas Ranger Joaquin Jackson heard him and introduced him to promoter “Happy” Shahan. He moved to Nashville at 21, where he auditioned for Mercury Records and was subsequently signed to release his 1972 breakthrough singles “Pass Me By (If You’re Only Passing Through)” and “Ridin’ My Thumb to Mexico.” He released his debut “Introducing Johnny Rodriguez” in 1973, earning a No. 1 record on the Billboard Top Country Albums tally. After putting out more than a dozen records with Mercury, he signed to Epic in 1979, where he found moderate success through the 1980s and worked with producer Billy Sherrill. Though he continued to release albums throughout the years, he faced personal turmoil in 1998 after he shot and killed a man in his home, thinking he was a burglar. After he was acquitted on all charges, he continued to tour and release albums over the years, including 2012’s “Live From Texas.”",
