It’s also awesome, depending on the title, the label, and the release, so each week we take a look at the new Blu-rays and DVDs making their way into the world. Welcome to this week in Home Video for November 5th, 2024! This week’s home video selection includes 4K upgrades for Godzilla and Rules of Engagement, a documentary on an acclaimed filmmaking duo, and more. Check out our picks below. Godzilla [4K UHD, Criterion] What is it? A kaiju classic. Why see it? Ishiro Honda’s 1954 monster movie has grown over the decades to become something bigger than life — and bigger than a mere creature feature. From it’s socio-political commentary on war and human nature to its dozens of sequels, reboots, and spinoffs, Godzilla is here to stay. Happily, it’s also a magnificent film that holds up seventy years later delivering drama, thrills, and monster mayhem. This isn’t Criterion’s first go-around with the scaly beast as they previously released a monster box set, but this standalone is well worth the upgrade as its 4K restoration brings details and shadows to new life. The two-disc set is also packed with extras exploring the film’s production, legacy, and more. [Extras: New 4K restoration, HD restoration of Godzilla King of the Monsters, commentaries, interviews, featurette, audio essay, booklet] The Best The Italian Connection [Raro Video] What is it? You will root for a pimp. Why see it? Italian genre cinema, particularly action, horror, and westerns from the 70s, are among the greatest films ever put to the screen. It’s true. Fernando Di Leo is responsible for many of the best crime films in the group, and this 1972 feature is a great example of that. Mobsters in New York City send two hitmen to Italy to abduct a troublemaker, but the man they’re after, an affable pimp who loves the ladies, loves his daughter, and loves life, has been setup by his fellow Italian crooks. He finds himself on the run as bad guys both Italian and American hunt him down, and it’s a dramatically thrilling ride that isn’t afraid to get very, very mean. Henry Silva and Woody Strode are the Americans, but it’s Mario Adorf who steals the show as the pimp you’re hoping survives this whole bloody affair. This is a terrifically stylish and gritty thriller that delivers the goods at the hands of some very bad men. [Extras: Commentary, documentary] Made in England: The Films of Powell \u0026 Pressburger What is it? A documentary on one of the great filmmaking duos. Why see it? The Red Shoes, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, Black Narcissus, A Matter of Life and Death, The Tales of Hoffman… stunningly beautiful and emotionally affecting cinema is the bread and butter of Michael Powell \u0026 Emeric Pressburger. Martin Scorsese narrates this wonderful documentary exploring the two men who became unlikely friends and filmmakers, and it works through their filmography with appreciation and observation. Clips from the films, talking heads, archival footage, and more all serve to bring their story to life and inform film lovers about the struggles and triumphs behind some of their favorites. [Extras: None] The Rest The 4:30 Movie What is it? A Kevin Smith film. Why see it? While the Clerks films are autobiographical for Kevin Smith, his latest reaches further back in time to his teenage years for inspiration. The result is… decidedly not good. It’s set in the 80s, and Smith’s script takes every single opportunity to remind you of that as his characters speak in catchphrases and imitations, all while a story plays out that itself feels ripped from lazy 80s comedies about shmucks landing hot girls for reasons that never quite reach the screen. It works when said shmuck is funny and sincere, but neither applies here. [Extras: Commentary, featurette] Afraid What is it? A cautionary horror about AI. Why see it? If Jason Blum seems to produce more misses than hits, well, that’s because he does — and because he produces so many movies per year that the odds are always working overtime. John Cho headlines this one, a fairly obvious tale about an artificially intelligent home assistant wired throughout a house that decides it knows best for the people within. Director Chris Weitz is something of an oddball choice here, but it’s arguably the script that keeps the thrills to a minimum. Maybe just watch Demon Seed instead as that film at least understands how to build tension and deliver some harrowing warnings about the future. [Extras: Deleted scenes] The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell [KL Studio Classics] What is it? A courtroom tale from Otto Preminger. Why see it? Otto Preminger’s Anatomy of a Murder is an acclaimed tale of murder unfolding during a military trial, and this precursor feels almost like a trial run with its own military man on trial. Gary Cooper sits front and center as a World War I general who defies orders in an attempt to bolster the idea and need for an air force going forward. He’s good, but while it’s a true story, it’s not necessarily all that compelling — or at least as compelling as the film wants it to be. Interesting, yes, as this is a true story, but fascinating watching it’s not. Still, Preminger, Cooper, Rod Steiger, Jack Lord, Peter Graves, Darren McGavin, and more make it worth the watch. [Extras: New 4K scan, commentary] The Crow [4K UHD] What is it? A doomed remake. Why see it? Alex Proyas’ The Crow may not be a great film, but it found an uncomfortable place in pop culture fandom due to the death of its lead actor during production. A remake was never going to work, just as the sequels don’t, because Brandon Lee’s tragedy is a major part of the original’s legacy. Still, they went ahead with a remake anyway, and the result is pretty much as expected. The goth element is transposed with less appealing imagery and subcultures, the soundtrack fails to compete, and the film is ultimately an unattractive and soulless endeavor. [Extras: Featurettes, deleted scenes] It Ends With Us What is it? A domestic abuse romance. Why see it? Blake Lively’s latest delivered big numbers at the box-office even as it left some viewers stymied by “misleading” marketing that played up the romance while hiding the domestic abuse meat of it all. It’s an adaptation of a popular, best-selling novel, and by all accounts it’s a successful, respectful one, but the appeal is lost on the screen — at least speaking as someone who hasn’t read the book. The film is ultimately a tale of triumph over an abuser, but it arguably lacks the catharsis of something like an exploitation flick. Eh, different strokes. [Extras: None] The Proud and the Profane [KL Studio Classics] What is it? A war widow seeks answers on a beautiful island. Why see it? Deborah Kerr stars as the grieving nurse who wants to know the details behind her husband’s death in battle, but answers aren’t all she finds. William Holden is the dickish officer who steals her heart even as his own secrets come into play. This romantic drama is engaging enough and anchored by its two leads who give good performances as arguably unlikable people. It’s no standout, but fans of wartime drama and romance will find enough to enjoy. [Extras: New 4K scan, commentary] Rules of Engagement [4K UHD, KL Studio Classics] What is it? A US Marine is charged with indiscriminate slaughter. Why see it? This courtroom drama from 2000 is arguably William Friedkin’s most straightforward film — not a criticism — as what you see is what you get. Samuel L. Jackson is a Marine Colonel who makes a tough call in battle resulting in the death of eighty-three civilians in Yemen. Did he murder them, or was he simply defending his men? Tommy Lee Jones is the Marine lawyer hired to defend, and they’re joined by Guy Pearce, Anne Archer, Bruce Greenwood, Ben Kingsley, and more familiar faces. It’s a solid tale carried by its cast as events play out as expected. Kino’s new 4K release looks good, but their new Blu keeps pace. [Extras: New 4K scan, commentary, interviews, featurette] Wolfman’s Got Nards [KL Studio Classics] What is it? A documentary about an 80s horror/comedy classic. Why see it? While 1987’s The Monster Squad isn’t quite for me — it probably should be, but the elements just don’t come together for me — but it’s easy to see its appeal for 80s kids who loved horror. For now-grown film fans, its pairing of writer Shane Black and director Fred Dekker makes for a fun mashup, and watching it now ticks some fun boxes. This documentary, helmed by one of the child stars, revisits the production through old footage and new interviews with the talents involved and lifelong fans, who, coincidentally, are the exact target demo for the doc itself. [Extras: Interviews, deleted scenes] Also out this week: Blink Twice, Frankie Freako, Strange Darling, Trap, White Christmas [4K UHD], The Wizard of Oz [4K UHD], You’ve Gotta Believe",
