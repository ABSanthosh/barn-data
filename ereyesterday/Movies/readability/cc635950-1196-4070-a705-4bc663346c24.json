  "text": "Posted in: HBO, Movies, TV | Tagged: creature commandos, dc studiosBenjamin Byron Davis and James Gunn confirmed that Davis will be voicing crime boss Rupert Thorne in Max and DC Studios' Creature Commandos. Just when you thought that we were done passing along news about DC Studios co-CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran's Creature Commandos, we have some additional casting news that was confirmed on social media. Comics fans who checked out the trailer noticed a familiar figure during those moments when it appeared we were getting the backstory on Dr. Phosphorus (Alan Tudyk). That would be Rupert Thorne, a powerful crime boss who was primarily a pain in the ass for Batman, created by writer Steve Englehart and artist Walt Simonson and first appearing in Detective Comics #469 (May 1977) – and who had a connection with the glowing \"big bad\" in the comics. Posting earlier today, Benjamin Byron Davis (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Borderlands) announced – and Gunn confirmed – that he would be voicing Thorne. Image: Max Screencaps; Lionsgate \"Well, the cat is out of the bag…,\" Davis began the caption to his Instagram post confirming the casting. \"Thrilled to be able to share, I'll be bringing Rupert Thorne to the DCU alongside the absolutely remarkable ensemble James Gunn has assembled for 'Creature Commandos'! Faces are going to melt…\" Here's a look at the post: Creature Commandos: James Gunn Offers Details Thanks to a video presentation from Gunn (busy working on Superman and Peacemaker Season 2) during the 2024 Annecy International Animation Festival, we learned much more about what we can expect – and yes, those in attendance got a look at the adult animated series (though not released). The first look involved Waller (Viola Davis), G.I. Robot (Sean Gunn), Nina (Zoe Chao), and the topic of killing Nazis, followed by a fight scene between deep-sleeper Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo) and Dr. Phosphorus (Alan Tudyk). \"It's a cornerstone of the legacy we've been entrusted to carry at DC Studios and plays an integral role in the vision for our future storytelling,\" Gunn shared with those in attendance. \"Since taking the reins, our true north has been to bring DC film, TV, animation, and gaming into alignment under a single banner and bring a sense of unity and consistency into the DCU as a whole. This frees us to create a range of products that are diverse and compelling and deliver great stand-alone entertainment experiences on every medium while also being part of a larger story that we're telling within our unified DCU.\" Gunn continued, \"What this means in practical terms is that our characters can move in and out of animation or jump into a game or onto the big screen, but they will remain consistent throughout: same character, same history, same actor.\" For example, Davis is reprising her live-action role as Amanda Waller for the animated series, and Grillo's animated Rick Flag Sr. will be making the jump into live-action for the second season of Max's Peacemaker. From there, Gunn shared that the series will pick up \"directly\" from the first season finale of the John Cena-starring series – with Waller finding \"her hands tied operationally.\" \"The new series picks up directly after our 'Peacemaker' season one finale, which leaves Waller with her hands tied operationally, meaning that she's no longer able to get away with putting human lives on the line to carry out her clandestine morally questionable missions. Instead, she recruits a ragtag band of misfits, not unlike the Suicide Squad and Peacemaker,\" Gunn revealed during the video presentation. That makes our leads a very different kind of hero than what viewers may have been used to in the past – and that's one of the things Gunn loves about the series: they \"are actual literal monsters, and I can't wait for you to meet them. Creating this series has been one of the absolute joys of my life.\" CREATURE COMMANDOS (Image: Max/DC Studios) The role call for the adult animated series (and any potential live-action takes) includes Frank Grillo as Rick Flag Sr., with Maria Bakalova as Princess Ilana Rostovic, Indira Varma as The Bride, Zoe Chao as Nina Mazursky, Alan Tudyk as Dr. Phosphorus, David Harbour as Eric Frankenstein, Sean Gunn as G.I. Robot \u0026 Weasel, Steve Agee returning as John Economos, and Anya Chalotra taking on the role of Circe. In addition, Michael Rooker, Peter Serafinowicz, Linda Cardellini, Ben Davis, and Gregg Henry are on board as guest voices. Kevin Kiner and Clint Mansell (Peacemaker, Doom Patrol) are scoring the animated series, First introduced by J.M. DeMatteis and Pat Broderick in Weird War Tales #93 (November 1980), the comic book series focused on Frankenstein's monster teaming with a werewolf, a vampire, and a gorgon to fight Nazis in World War II. The series has the distinction of being the first DCU project that Gunn \u0026 Safran gave the green light to (with Gunn having penned the series) and the first from DC Studios that will hit screens. In addition, the series is being cast with voice actors who could also play their characters in a live-action project down the road. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!
