Records. In case you hadn't heard, the official teaser trailer for writer/director James Gunn's David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan, and Nicholas Hoult-starring Superman dropped on Thursday. We couldn't think of a better way of starting off an update regarding just how many of you have watched the preview. Spoiler? A whole lot of you (and us because seriously… Krypto!). Earlier today, Gunn took to social media to thank everyone for the record numbers that the teaser trailer brought in – 250+ million views and about a million social media posts. In terms of previous DC films as well as Warner Bros. trailers, that makes Superman (as Gunn posted) \"officially the most viewed and the most talked about trailer in the history of both DC and Warner Bros.\" Image: Instagram Stories Screencap; DC Studios Screencap \"Krypto really did take us home: With over 250 million views and a million social posts, Superman is officially the most viewed and the most talked about trailer in the history of both DC and Warner Bros. This is because of all of you: thank you! We're incredibly grateful and, most of all, excited to share this movie with you in July. Happy Holidays!\" Gunn wrote in his Instagram post earlier today – as the teaser trailer continues to pull in big numbers. DC Studios: James Gunn Done with Superman, Batman Origin Stories Near the end of November, Gunn responded on social media for being accused of \"overlooking origin stories\" while also calling out DC Studios for focusing on \"niche characters to headline their own movies like Sgt. Rock or Swamp Thing\" and not focusing enough on characters they believe are better suited to attract a \"general audience.\" When DC Studios' \"Chapter One: Gods and Monsters' was unveiled in 2023, we learned that a Swamp Thing film was planned (with James Mangold attached). Recently, rumblings have gotten louder that director Luca Guadagnino (Queer) and Daniel Craig could be reunited for a Sgt. Rock film. And let's not forget the upcoming Mike Flanagan-penned Clayface move that was recently given a green light. In terms of superhero origin stories, Gunn isn't looking to tell Batman's and Superman's respective backstories again because we've been down that road many times before (\"I'm not telling Batman and Superman's origin stories again because everyone knows them\"). But in terms of Swamp Thing not being deserving enough for his own film, Gunn wasn't having any of it. \"Don't put Swamp Thing in the corner. That's a project in development we've actually announced, and he's an incredibly well-known character with not only some of the greatest comics of all time but a successful film series and his own TV show, something that could be said of only a very small handful of DC characters,\" Gunn added. DC Studios' Superman stars David Corenswet (Hollywood) as Superman/Clark Kent and Rachel Brosnahan (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) as Lois Lane. In addition, the Superman: Legacy cast includes Skyler Gisondo as Jimmy Olsen, Nicholas Hoult (The Great) as Lex Luthor, Wendell Pierce (HBO's The Wire) as Perry White, Isabela Merced (Sicario: Day of the Soldado) as Hawkgirl, Edi Gathegi (X-Men: First Class) as Mister Terrific, Nathan Fillion (The Rookie) as Green Lantern Guy Gardner, Anthony Carrigan (Barry) as Metamorpho, Sara Sampaio as Eve Teschmacher, María Gabriela de Faría as Angela Spica/The Engineer, Sean Gunn as Maxwell Lord, Pruitt Taylor Vince (Murder One, Lady in the Lake) as Jonathan Kent/\"Pa Kent,\" and Neva Howell (Ghosts of the Ozarks) as Martha Kent/\"Ma Kent.\" Image: DC Studios Joining them are Beck Bennett (Saturday Night Live) as Daily Planet sports editor Steve Lombard, Mikaela Hoover (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad) as Daily Planet gossip columnist Cat Grant, and Christopher McDonald as skilled Daily Planet reporter Ron Troupe – with Frank Grillo's Rick Flag Sr. (from Creature Commandos and Peacemaker Season 2) set to appear, along with Alan Tudyk in an undisclosed role. Composer John Murphy (28 Days Later, Sunshine, Kick-Ass, The Suicide Squad, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3) will score the film. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!
