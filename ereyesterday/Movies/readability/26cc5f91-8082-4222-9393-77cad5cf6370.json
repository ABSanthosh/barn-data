  "text": "Steven Soderbergh is one of Hollywood’s most consistent and active directors. Soderbergh’s Presence and Black Bag were both released in theaters this year. While the former was an intriguing ghost story told from the supernatural apparition’s point of view, the latter was a stylish spy movie starring Michael Fassbender and Cate Blanchett. With the Black Bag 4K release, fans can now own the thriller. “From Director Steven Soderbergh, Black Bag is a gripping spy drama about legendary intelligence agents George Woodhouse and his beloved wife Kathryn. When she is suspected of betraying the nation, George faces the ultimate test – loyalty to his marriage or his country,” says the official description. My theatergoing experience for Black Bag was quite poor, as there was a blue dot on the screen during the entire showing, so it was nice to be able to fully appreciate the spy thriller at home. The Black Bag 4K release features a sharp and clear image, which makes you really appreciate the craftsmanship in the film, along with a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio track that sounds great. What’s so great about the core conceit is that the entire main cast is filled with spies and intelligence officers, so you can never trust anyone. The core conflict arises when Fassbender starts to suspect his wife in a case, so the pair’s marriage is tested in a stressful way, as they can’t just talk it out when it involves highly confidential information. The film has a fun idea that is elevated by an incredible cast. Fassbender and Blanchett are electric, with some stellar chemistry, and the rest of the cast is able to keep up with them. Regé-Jean Page is particularly impressive in a supporting role, as are Marisa Abela, Tom Burke, and Naomie Harris. Everyone brings their A-game from the opening dinner scene (which I thought could’ve gone even longer as it was stellar) onward, and we even get Pierce Brosnan in a key role as their boss. The core mystery is brilliant, with viewers constantly changing their suspicions, and the film wraps up in quite a satisfying way. The Black Bag 4K release also features over 20 minutes of bonus features. This includes six and a half minutes of deleted scenes, which include an extra scene each with Fassbender and Blanchett, plus a short but funny exchange between Naomie Harris and Marisa Abela. There are also two featurettes on offer, a 10-minute video called “The Company of Talent,” which focuses on the actors and their roles (check out an exclusive clip of the featurette), plus how Soderbergh’s precise working style impacted their process, and “Designing Black Bag,” a five and a half minute video going over the film’s production and costume design. These are both enjoyable watches, but a commentary track featuring Soderbergh would’ve really been the icing on the cake here. Black Bag 4K Review: Final Verdict As fun to rewatch at home as it was to watch it for the first time in a theater, Black Bag remains a thriller that demands your attention. With a tight script and no wasted moments, great performances from a talented ensemble elevate an already strong base. It’s a shame there’s no commentary track on the 4K release, especially one that’s labeled a collector’s edition, but it’s well worth picking up for Soderbergh fans.
