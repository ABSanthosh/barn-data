  "text": "SPOILER ALERT! This post contains details from the Season 4 premiere of CBS‘ Ghosts. Good news, Ghosts fans. Isaac Higgintoot is alive! Or, well, you know what we mean. Season 3 ended on a major cliffhanger, after the Puritan ghost Patience (now played by Mary Holland) made herself known on the Woodstone grounds, requesting help from the basement ghosts to lure Isaac (Brandon Scott Jones) downstairs. The basement ghosts innocently thought that Patience just wanted to clear the air after Isaac left her in that hole all those years ago, but the latest addition to Woodstone had other plans. Once Isaac trodded down to the basement, Patience grabbed him from behind and pulled him into the wall. Both disappeared — and that’s where things pick up in the Season 4 premiere. Watch on Deadline The morning after Isaac’s wedding, everyone begins to realize it’s been a while since they’ve seen him. Turns out, he’s profusely apologizing to Patience in her lair, which is somewhere on the Woodstone grounds, but Patience isn’t trying to hear it. She tells Isaac she plans to “push him into the dirt” for, well, a long time so he knows the kind of suffering she endured. It’s not as if Patience is all bad, though. Isaac is able to disarm her a bit with his charm, and when he says he’s missing his friends, Patience also kidnaps Sasappis (Román Zaragoza) to keep him company. It’s the thought that counts, right? The rest of their crew put their heads together to figure out where Patience’s lair is, so they can save Isaac and Sasappis, but the Puritan ghost beats them to it. She returns Patience and Sasappis back to the basement, explaining she had a change of heart after she catches the two of them poking fun at her. She realizes she doesn’t want to force anyone to like her, and she retreats back to her lair (it was under the fountain, FYI). The ghosts feel pretty bad that Patience is now left all alone again, so they invite her to join them in the main house. What could go wrong? The episode also gives a glimpse at Patience’s backstory. Apparently, she was banished from her Puritan colony for being too much of a buzzkill. Imagine that.",
