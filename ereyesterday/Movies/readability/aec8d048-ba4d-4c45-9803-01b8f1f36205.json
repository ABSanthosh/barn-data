  "text": "Dropped in amongst the news that Yahya Abdul-Mateen II would be joining the upcoming Once Upon a Time in Hollywood 2, Jeff Sneider of The InSneider also reported that Quentin Tarantino was receiving a big payday for writing the script. How much is Tarantino being paid for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood 2? According to Sneider’s report, Tarantino is getting a whopping $20 million for the script, with Netflix also reportedly offering Leonardo DiCaprio “millions of dollars” to return and reprise his role as Rick Dalton in a cameo. According to initial reports on the movie, David Fincher and Pitt will reunite to work on a sequel to Quentin Tarantino’s 2019 comedy drama, with Pitt reprising his role as stuntman Cliff Booth. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is rumored to be playing a character “in the vein of Jim Brown, who famously ended his Hall of Fame football career early to focus on acting, starring in such hits as The Dirty Dozen.” According to a separate report from The InSneider’s Jeff Sneider, Leonardo DiCaprio — who starred alongside Pitt in the original film — is in talks to join Pitt and Fincher and reprise his role as Rick Dalton. As for Margot Robbie, who played Sharon Tate in the movie, early reports mention that she is also “available” for the movie should Fincher come calling. As for how this movie came together, The Playlist notes that the script for the film was something that his script for The Movie Critic (which was also rumored to involve Pitt as Booth in some capacity) evolved into over time. Tarantino also has a unique deal with Sony Pictures on the rights to various aspects of Once Upon a Time. A release date for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood 2 has not yet been announced.
