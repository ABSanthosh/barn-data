Powell appeared earlier this week at Cinemacon alongside costars Colman Domingo and Josh Brolin to premiere first-look footage from the new “Running Man.” “This game is no game…life and death run wild,” Domingo’s character tells Powell in the trailer. “This is America goddammit and we don’t put up with no bullshit.” Before debuting the trailer, Powell told Cinemacon attendees that making “The Running Man” was “the hardest thing I’ve done in my life.” Production on the film began in London last September, nearly 37 years after Schwarzenegger’s “The Running Man” hit theaters.  Wright’s “The Running Man,” starring Powell, is in theaters November 7.",
