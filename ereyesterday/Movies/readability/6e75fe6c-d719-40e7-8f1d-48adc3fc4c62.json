  "description": "\"The impossible crime...\" During its live Tudum event, Netflix revealed their first look teaser in the form of a \"date announcement\" promo for the next whodunit mystery movie from Rian Johnson with detective Benoit Blanc - titled Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. This teaser features about 60 seconds of excellent footage. This is Johnson's follow-up to Knives Out (2019) and Glass Onion (2022) continuing with Daniel Craig returning as Benoit Blanc in what is described as \"his most dangerous case yet.\" In this one he's investigating a murder at a church, though this teaser sets it up more as a miracle of some kind. So it's a religious horror mystery thriller?? Yep I am very down for this... The superb ensemble cast includes Josh O'Connor \u0026 Josh Brolin as priests, Glenn Close, Mila Kunis, Jeremy Renner, Kerry Washington, Andrew Scott, Cailee Spaeny, Daryl McCormack, and Thomas Haden Church. That's one helluva good line-up, too! Josh O'Connor looking totally crazy in this already, can't wait to see what he's up to with Rian at the helm. The film's release date is revealed as \"XII.XII.MMXXV\" - 12.12.2025. Take a look below. Release date teaser for Rian Johnson's Wake Up [â€¦]",
