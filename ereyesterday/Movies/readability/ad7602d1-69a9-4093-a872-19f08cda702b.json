The vote is the latest step in a five-year effort to professionalize the role of intimacy coordinators, who serve as liaisons between performers and the production during filming of sex scenes. The union did not reveal the number of intimacy coordinators who voted to join, but did say that the vote was unanimous. Fran Drescher, the union’s president, also alluded to the recent presidential election in her statement. “In these sobering times with looming threats to environmental protections and women’s equality, it is refreshing to see the entertainment industry’s recognition of intimacy coordinators and their important contribution to productions and to performers in intimate scenes,” Drescher said. “We at SAG-AFTRA are proud to include this esteemed group of trained professionals as the newest to join our member body. May this continue to carve the path of elevated consideration for the feelings of safety for people and planet.” The union filed a petition in September with the National Labor Relations Board to recognize intimacy coordinators as part of the union. With the vote now behind it, the union must negotiate the first contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which could provide for things like minimum rates and health and pension benefits. Popular on Variety There is no industrywide requirement to use intimacy coordinators, though the recent SAG-AFTRA contract does require producers to use “best efforts” to hire an IC for nudity and sex scenes. Monday, Nov. 11 Neon Sets December Release for Speculative Sci-Fi Doc ‘2073’ Neon has set a Dec. 27 release date and released the trailer for Asif Kapadia’s (“Amy”) “2073,” a speculative sci-fi documentary that serves as a warning for a potentially dismal reality that lurks 49 years in the future. Per an official logline, the film takes place in the year “‘2073,’ and the worst fears of modern life have been realized. Surveillance drones fill the burnt orange skies and militarized police roam the wrecked streets, while survivors hide away underground, struggling to remember a free and hopeful existence. In this ingenious mixture of visionary science fiction and speculative nonfiction, Kapadia transports us to a future foreshadowed by the terrifying realities of our present moment. Samantha Morton (“In America”) plays a survivor besieged by nightmare visions of the past—a past that happens to be our present, visualized through contemporary footage interconnecting today’s global crises of authoritarianism, unchecked big tech, inequality and global climate change. ‘2073’ is an urgent, unshakable vision of a dystopic future that could very well be our own.” Naomi Ackie (“Blink Twice”) also stars with a script from Kapadia and Tony Grisoni. The film is inspired by Chris Marker’s seminal sci-fi film “La Jetée,” which follows a time traveler who attempts to alter the past to save his dismal present. Kapadia and George Chignell serve as producers for Lafcadia Productions. Executive producers include Tom Quinn and Dan O’Meara for Neon, Emily Thomas, Dana O’Keefe, Emily Selinger, Ollie Madden, Farhana Bhula and Nicole Stott for Concordia Studio, Chris King, Eric Sloss and John Sloss. Double Agent, Neon and Film4 executive produced and co-funded the film. Watch the trailer below. Infinity Festival Unveils 2024 Monolith Award Honorees Infinity Festival, a yearly gathering of industry leaders in entertainment and tech, has unveiled the honorees for the 2024 Monolith Awards, which celebrates individuals who push the limits of storytelling, immersive design and technical artistry. “This year’s honorees represent the visionary spirit of Infinity Festival,” said founder and CEO Mark Lieber and chief creative officer Adam Newman in a joint statement. “We are thrilled to acknowledge their profound impact on both technology and entertainment, setting new standards for creativity, innovation and storytelling.” Taking home the lifetime achievement award was Rob Legato, a three-time Oscar-winning VFX artist whose credits include “Titanic,” “Shutter Island” and the live-action adaptation of “The Lion King.” The polaris award, which honors tech companies on the cutting edge of innovation, went to Nvidia. The sentinel award went to James Jensen for his work in immersive entertainment and the New Media fine art award went to Nancy Baker Cahill for her augmented reality film “Body Politic.” Marc Brickman received the Apollo lifetime achievement award for his extensive work in film and live event production. Tuesday, Nov. 12 The supernatural thriller “The Activated Man” is premiering at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills on Dec. 13.
