With each performance creating fresh buzz, anticipation grows for where she’ll be next and what surprises are in store. Wondering where Taylor Swift is today, November 3, and what’s coming up on her schedule? Here’s a look at her latest stops and upcoming shows. Where is Taylor Swift today, November 3? On November 3, Taylor Swift will perform at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. Gracie Abrams will be the opening act. Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos are gearing up for a special Halloween episode of “Live!” In this episode, they will recreate Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s fun day at the U.S. Open. Back in September, Swift and Kelce caught everyone’s attention at the tennis tournament by singing and dancing to The Darkness’ song, “I Believe in a Thing Called Love.” Swift rocked a cute gingham dress while Kelce sported a quirky Gucci bucket hat. (via USA Today) Ripa is excited to capture Swift’s vibe in her costume, although she feels a bit unsure about it. She remembers meeting Swift when she was younger and called her “charming.” She said, “I did my best to at least not embarrass her on behalf of both of us. I just am so afraid of getting red lipstick on my teeth, red lipstick everywhere. I don’t want it to go outside of the lines.” On the other hand, Consuelos joked about his own costume challenges, including his fake mustache and Gucci hat from the show’s costume closet. While he hasn’t met Kelce yet, he expresses admiration for him, saying he “seems like a great guy.” When is Taylor Swift’s next show? Taylor Swift is scheduled to take the stage for her next concert on November 14, 2024, at Rogers Centre Stadium in Toronto. It will feature Gracie Abrams in the opening act. November 3 marks the conclusion of Taylor Swift’s U.S. leg of the Eras Tour, paving the way for the highly anticipated Canadian segment. Swift will make her way to Toronto, where she is set for an extended run at the Rogers Centre from November 14 to 23, 2024. Following her Toronto shows, the tour will culminate with performances in Vancouver at BC Place from December 6 to 8, 2024.",
