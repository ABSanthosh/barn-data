  "text": "The influential Buckley Family turns to the dark side in an effort to keep their empire afloat in The Waterfront, a new drama for Netflix from Kevin Williamson that marks his return to both TV and North Carolina. The family drama series that stars Melissa Benoit, Mario Bello, Holt McCallany and Jake Weary is set to premiere June 19 on the streamer. It plays out over eight episodes. Here’s the official logline for the series that’s inspired by true events: For decades, the Buckley family has ruled Havenport, North Carolina, dominating everything from the local fishing industry to the town’s restaurant scene. But their fishing empire has started to crumble as patriarch Harlan Buckley (McCallany) recovers from two heart attacks, and his wife Belle (Bello) and son Cane (Weary) venture into the deep end to keep the family businesses afloat. As their attempts spiral out of control and into treacherous waters, Harlan steps back in to take command. Facing her own demons, Buckley daughter Bree (Benoist) — an addict in recovery who’s lost custody of her son — finds herself entangled in a complicated relationship that could threaten the family’s future forever. Watch on Deadline The series is set against the backdrop of North Carolina, where Williamson shot Dawson’s Creek.
