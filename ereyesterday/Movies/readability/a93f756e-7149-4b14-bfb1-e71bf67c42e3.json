A cause of death was not listed. ‚ÄúIt is with a heavy heart I share that my sweet, generous, talented, funny, brilliant and handsome little brother David H. K.

Watch on Deadline In this year‚Äôs live-action adaptation of the 2002 animated family-comedy classic, Bell portrays a stand-in of sorts to the white tourist character who drops his mint chocolate chip ice cream repeatedly, unable to eat it. In the 2025 film, Bell, a native Hawaiian, instead drops his shaved ice when he sees Jumba (Zach Galifianakis) and Pleakley (Billy Magnussen) open the portal to the island. Two weeks ago, the actor shared his audition tape for ‚ÄúBig Hawaiian Dude,‚Äù as well as behind-the-scenes photos from filming.
