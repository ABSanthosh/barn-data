  "text": "Eddie Redmayne says the audience has most likely seen the last of Newt Scamander, the character he played in the Fantastic Beasts film series. The actor said in a new interview that the series is possibly over, but fans will maybe get a “glimpse” of what Newt has been up to following the trilogy of films. “I think they probably have,” Redmayne told ComicBook about whether the audience had seen the last of Newt. “That was a very frank answer, but yeah. And that’s as far as I know. I mean, you’d have to speak to the people at Warner Bros. and J.K Rowling, but as far as I know, that’s it.” Redmayne also teased, “I think he may come back in a glimpse in the Universal world in Florida that they’re opening up, in which you may catch a glimpse of what he was up to in Paris.” Watch on Deadline Peacock’s Day of the Jackal actor referred to Universal Orlando Resort’s new theme park, Universal Epic Universe, which is set to open in 2025. The Florida-based theme park will have an area dedicated to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, including 1920s wizarding Paris and the British Ministry of Magic. The Paris area will include the theatrical show Le Cirque Arcanus. Fantastic Beasts is a film series directed by David Yates and based on the characters created by JK Rowling from the Harry Potter universe. The film series began with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them in 2016, revolving around Redmayne’s Newt Scamander, a British wizard with a magically expanded briefcase that houses several dangerous creatures and their habitats. A sequel, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, premiered in 2018, and the trilogy’s final film, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, premiered in 2022. Although the film series was initially announced to consist of five films, it was ultimately reduced due to diminishing box office returns.",
