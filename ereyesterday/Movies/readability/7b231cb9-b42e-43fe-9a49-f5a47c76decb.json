Espinal and Arenales, Huda Mustafa and Chris Seeley, Iris Kendall and Jose “Pepe” Garcia-Gonzales and Olandria Carthen and Nic Vansteenberghe ascended as the final four couples before America selected who they believed had the strongest connection and was worthy of the $100,000 cash prize. Amaya Espinal and Bryan Arenales in Season 7 of “Love Island USA” Peacock Leading up to the final four, the fate of two couples was cut short. For the past week, the public had the opportunity to vote for their favorite couples. The couple with the least amount of votes were left at risk of being dumped from the island. On Tuesday, Taylor Williams and Clarke Carraway were the first couple to leave shortly after deciding to date exclusively. Following their departure was Chelley Bissainthe and Ace Greene during Episode 33 on Thursday, July 10. Popular on Variety The series returned for Season 7 on June 3 and set new records for becoming the second most-watched streaming show on TV in its second week. According to Luminate’s streaming data, the new season garnered 1.2 billion minutes viewed across the nine available episodes from June 6 to 12. From over-the-top challenges, dramatic eliminations, jaw-dropping moments, iconic bombshells and even a surprise appearance from Megan Thee Stallion, audiences were hooked to their TV screens for six days a week since its premiere. Although old and new fans tuned in daily, many viewers expressed that they are ready for the current season to end and have dubbed it the “worst season yet.”  Over the course of six weeks, the show has faced several challenges that altered the fate of this season. Between two islanders being kicked off after past racist posts resurfaced, producers switching and removing fan-favorite challenges to fewer recouplings and the fandom becoming more toxic, viewers felt that the experience was tainted by these factors. Yet, fans tuned in one last time to cast their final votes on who they believed where deserving of the prize money after such a tumultuous season. Before officially closing out the series, Madix announced that “Love Island USA” Season 7 would have a reunion that is scheduled to air on Peacock on Aug. 25. The Season 7 reunion will be hosted by Madix and Andy Cohen (“Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen”), where this season’s winners and eliminated islanders will reflect on their time in the villa, shocking revelations, and Season 7’s most talked about moments. More to come..",
