  "text": "Does Novocaine have a post-credits scene? This dark comedy action-thriller follows a man who feels no physical pain as he embarks on a mission to rescue the woman of his dreams after her abduction. With post-credit scenes being a common feature in modern films, many are curious to know if director Dan Berk included one. Find out whether Novocaine has a post-credits scene or if the film concludes without any additional footage. Does Novocaine have an end, mid or post-credits scene? No, Novocaine does not feature a post-credits, mid-credits, or end-credits scene. This action-comedy thriller does not include any additional scenes during or after the credits. The filmmakers aimed to maintain a focused and self-contained narrative, which is why there are no extra scenes in Novocaine. This choice prevents any further hints at potential sequels. While many blockbuster franchises frequently use post-credit scenes to set up future installments, Novocaine stands as an independent film. Directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, the film follows Nathan Caine, a reserved and kind-hearted introvert who has a rare condition known as congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP). Employed as an assistant manager at a bank, he develops feelings for a coworker, Sherry, and cherishes their time together. In a moment of trust, he reveals his unique condition to her: he is unable to feel physical pain. However, their lives take a dramatic turn when a major robbery occurs at his bank. Sherry becomes entangled in the dangerous situation as the criminals take her hostage. Determined to save her and prove his love, Nathan embarks on a perilous journey, facing intense confrontations and challenges. The movie has a runtime of 110 minutes and features notable actors such as Jack Quaid, Amber Midthunder, Ray Nicholson, Jacob Batalon, Betty Gabriel, Matt Walsh, and others. At the time of writing, Novocaine holds an 86% Rotten Tomatoes rating and is available in 2D, D-Box, 4DX, and MX4D. It will stream on Paramount+ after its theatrical run, with a release date yet to be announced. The R-rated action-thriller Novocaine (2025) is set to be released in theaters nationwide on Friday, March 14, 2025.",
