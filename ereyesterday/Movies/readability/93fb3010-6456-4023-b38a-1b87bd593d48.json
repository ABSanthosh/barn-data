It marks the feature directorial debut of South African-American actress Embeth Davidtz. The film depicts 8-year-old Bobo's life on her family's Rhodesian farm during the Bush War's final stages. It explores the family's close bond with Africa's land and the war's impact on the region and individuals through Bobo's perspective. Starring Lexi Venter as Bobo, Embeth Davidtz, Zikhona Bali, Fumani Shilubana, Rob Van Vuuren, and Anina Reed. \"Rhodesia\" was an unrecognized country in Southern Africa that existed from 1965 to 1979 - eventually it gained independence and was renamed Zimbabwe in 1980.

Official trailer (+ poster) for Embeth Davidtz's film Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, on YouTube: Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight captures the childhood of 8-year-old Bobo living on her family farm in Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) at the end of the Zimbabwean War for independence in 1980. Growing up in the midst of this long running war, Bobo internalizes both sides of the struggle. Conflicted by her love for people on opposing sides, she tries to make sense of her life in a magical way. Through her eight-year-old gaze we witness Rhodesia’s final days, the family's unbreakable bond with Africa, and the deep scars that war leaves on survivors. Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight is written and directed by American-South African actress / filmmaker Embeth Davidtz, making her directorial debut with this film. Adapted from Alexandra Fuller's memoir of the same name. Produced by Paul Buys, Embeth Davidtz, Helena Spring. This initially premiered at the 2024 Telluride Film Festival last year. Sony Classics will debut Davidtz's Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight film in select US theaters starting July 11th, 2025 this summer. Looks good?
