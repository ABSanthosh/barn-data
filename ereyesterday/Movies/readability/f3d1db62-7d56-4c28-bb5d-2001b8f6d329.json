  "text": "The Tulsa King spinoff dubbed NOLA King is on the hunt for a new showrunner. Dave Erickson, who wrote the pilot script, initially was set to run the show that would star Samuel L. Jackson. But his schedule — he’s the showrunner on the current season of Tulsa King in addition to his duties as showrunner on Taylor Sheridan’s Mayor of Kingstown — made it impossible to continue, so NOLA King is moving ahead without him. Paramount+ has yet to officially pick up the spinoff, which is expected to follow Jackson as Russell Lee Washington Jr., who, like Sylvester Stallone’s Dwight “The General” Manfredi, comes from the crime world. Jackson will appear in multiple episodes of Tulsa King‘s upcoming third season before headlining and executive producing the spinoff from 101 Studios and MTV Entertainment Studios. Watch on Deadline Jackson’s Washington will go against Dwight in Tulsa before heading to New Orleans. Production on Season 3 of Tulsa King has been underway in Atlanta and Oklahoma for a couple of months. Jackson is expected to film his episodes in July, with production on NOLA King eyeing a February start, sources said. NOLA King executive producers also include Sheridan and 101 Studios’ David C. Glasser. Variety was the first to report the news about Erickson.",
