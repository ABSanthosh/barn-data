  "text": "“After the Hunt,” a thriller directed by Luca Guadagnino and starring Julia Roberts, Ayo Edebiri and Andrew Garfield, will land in theaters this fall. Amazon MGM is granting the film a prime awards season release date, with a limited rollout on Oct. 10 before expanding on Oct. 17. “After the Hunt” will open nationwide on the same date as Blumhouse’s thriller “The Black Phone 2” with Ethan Hawke and Lionsgate’s R-rated comedy “Good Fortune,” starring Aziz Ansari, Keanu Reeves and Seth Rogen. Described as a “gripping psychological drama,” the film follows Roberts as a college professor who “finds herself at a personal and professional crossroads when a star pupil (Edebiri) levels an accusation against one of her colleagues (Garfield),” according to the official logline. As she navigates the difficult situation, “a dark secret from her own past threatens to come to light.” Michael Stuhlbarg and Chloë Sevigny round out the cast. “After the Hunt” reunites Guadagnino, the Oscar-nominated “Call Me by Your Name” filmmaker, with the studio behind his sexy tennis drama “Challengers,” cannibal love story “Bones and All” and “Suspiria” remake. Guadagnino most recently directed “Queer,” a 1950s-set love story following Daniel Craig as an American expat in Mexico City who becomes infatuated with a much younger man. Popular on Variety First-time screenwriter Nora Garrett wrote the script for “After the Hunt” and will executive produce with Karen Lunder for Imagine Entertainment, as well as Justin Wilkes and Alice Dawson. Imagine Entertainment executives Brian Grazer and Allan Mandelbaum are producing the film with Guadagnino on behalf of his company Frenesy. Along with “After the Hunt,” Amazon MGM’s 2025 theatrical slate includes Ben Affleck’s “The Accountant 2″ and Chris Pratt’s action drama “Mercy.”",
