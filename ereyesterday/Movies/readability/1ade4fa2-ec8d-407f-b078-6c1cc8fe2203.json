  "text": "Wondering why Pete Davidson still has tattoos despite starting the removal process years ago? Recent photos of the comedian on a Florida beach with his new girlfriend have sparked renewed interest in the status of his ink. After previously appearing nearly tattoo-free in a high-profile campaign, the contrast has left fans with questions. Here’s a look at key facts and updates on Pete Davidson’s tattoo removal and why some tattoos remain visible. Why Pete Davidson still has tattoos in new photos Pete Davidson was recently photographed with visible tattoos during a beach outing in Palm Beach, Florida on March 21, 2025, with his new girlfriend, Elsie Hewitt (via TMZ). The photos, taken just over a month after a February 14th campaign showing him nearly tattoo-free, raise questions about the status of his tattoo removal. It remains unclear whether Davidson’s skin appeared clearer in the earlier photos due to makeup or editing. As of March, recent images show that he still has several tattoos. The comedian previously revealed that he began the removal process in 2020. He stated, “It takes like three hours — you have to get there three hours earlier to cover all your tattoos, because for some reason, people in movies, they don’t have them that much” (via Buzzfeed). Davidson has publicly shared glimpses of his progress, including a tattoo-free arm during a February 2025 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Is Pete Davidson still removing all of his tattoos? Yes, Pete Davidson is continuing the process of removing his tattoos. During a February 2025 appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers, he explained that tattoo removal is lengthy and painful. He said, “It’s at least seven visits. If it’s black and white, it’s a little easier, but if it’s a color tattoo, it takes forever.” He also added, “When I’m 40, it’ll all be gone, like the chest and the back.” Davidson began the process for professional reasons but also cited personal growth. He explained, “Well I made a lot of those decisions when, you know, before rehab. So I got the dumbest tattoos.” He also described some of them, saying, “I got a collection of cartoons smoking blunts. Like, a Muppet smoking a blunt, the Tootsie Pop owl smoking a blunt.”",
