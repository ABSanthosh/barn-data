Here's the full US trailer (+ new poster) for Naoko Yamada's The Colors Within, from GKids' YouTube: You can rewatch the teaser trailer for Naoko Yamada's The Colors Within right here for even more footage. Totsuko is a high school student with the ability to see the 'colors' of others. Colors of bliss, excitement, and serenity, plus a color she treasures as her favorite. Kimi, a classmate at her school, gives off the most beautiful color of all. Although she doesn’t play an instrument, Totsuko forms a band with Kimi and Rui, a quiet music enthusiast they meet at a used bookstore in a far corner of town. As they practice at an old church on a remote island, music brings them together, forming friendships and stirring affections. Will they discover their true 'colors'? The Colors Within, also known as きみの色 or Kimi no Iro (Your Color) in Japanese, is directed by acclaimed Japanese animation filmmaker Naoko Yamada, director of the \"K-On!\" and \"Tamako Market\" anime series, plus the films A Silent Voice and Liz and the Blue Bird. The screenplay is written by Reiko Yoshida. It's produced by Eunyoung Choi, Yoshihiro Furusawa, Genki Kawamura, Kôhei Sakita. With animation by Science SARU. This initially premiered at the 2024 Annecy Film Festival earlier this summer, and it opened in theaters in Japan in August. GKids will release Yamada's The Colors Within in select US theaters starting December 13th (only in LA) then in wide release on January 24th, 2025.
