  "text": "The best and brightest of the U.K. and Ireland were celebrated last night in a star-studded bash at the Newport Beach Film Festival UK \u0026 IE Honours event in London. Those receiving honors included Icon Award honoree Stephen Fry, “Nosferatu” and Artist of Distinction honorees Emma Corrin, Sharon Horgan and Felicity Jones.Before receiving her honor, Jones was seen admiring Variety’s cover story on her “The Brutalist” co-star Adrien Brody, now considered a frontrunner for the best actor Oscar. Jones too, is in the running, nominated for best supporting actress at both the BAFTAs and Oscars for her performance in Brady Corbet’s American epic. “It’s so nice when you put in all the work for a campaign and it actually pays off,” she told Variety.   Three actors nominated for this year’s BAFTA Rising Star Award were celebrated – Nibhaan Rizwan was named one of Variety’s 10 Brits to Watch while “Back in Black” actor Marisa Abel and “Alien: Romulus” star David Jonsson were presented with Breakout Artist Awards. Other Breakout Artists included Adam Pearson (“A Different Man”), Mia Threaplton (“The Buccaneers”) and Joe Locke (“Agatha All Along,” “Heartstopper.”) Popular on Variety Speaking to Variety prior to the ceremony, Locke revealed that he’s looking at upcoming projects, but hasn’t worked as an actor since November. “It’s been the first time in five years I literally haven’t been working,” he said. “So now I’m trying to figure out what to fill my free time with. I did a pottery class. I’ve taken a yoga session. It’s been nice to have some down time – but I’m also ready to go back to work.”Locke also spoke about the people who have supported him throughout his career, including his mother. “I have a really great resolve in myself and it’s because of her,” Locke revealed, adding that the sudden attention has been strange for all of them. In fact, his mother fainted on the red carpet of the “Agatha All Along” premiere. “ She’s going to hate me for saying this, but it’s too funny,” he noted. “I was doing press, and my publicist was like, ‘So your mom, she’s, um, fainted.’ I walked over and this really nice guy in Doctor Strange cosplay was helping her. I think she was just overwhelmed by this huge Hollywood premiere and it was really warm out. She was fine, but I make fun of her.” In the Spotlight Category, honorees were Ambika Mod (“One Day”), Will Sharpe (“A Real Pain”), Joe Alwyn (“The Brutalist”) and Jessica Gunning (“Baby Reindeer.”)Gunning reflected on the past year and the sudden success of “Baby Reindeer” in which she plays Martha, a woman who stalks Richard Gadd’s character. “I think both me and Richard felt the show was pretty special when we were doing it,” Gunning revealed. “But even in our wildest dreams we couldn’t imagine the kind of scope it’s had.” Gunning also revealed that she had some experience playing an obsessive character as years prior, she had shot a pilot for a series based on the Bill Murray move “What About Bob?” The show was a gender-swapped, titled “What About Barb?” and starred Gunning as a woman infiltrating the life of her therapist (played by Leah Remini.)  The evening ended with a standing ovation for Fry, who praised his fellow honorees. “This incredible panolpy of young talent I’ve had the privilege of watching come up on the stage filled my heart with utter joy. It’s extraordinary to see the remarkable diversity of talent, the wit, the fire, the extraordinary ability these young people have.” Variety also presented its 10 Brits to Watch for 2025, all of whom were in attendance: Rizwan, Abigail Thorn, Ava Wong-Davies, Erin Kellyman, Mia Tharia, Michelle de Swarte, Rich Peppiatt, Saura Lightfoot-Leon, Varada Sethu and Xander Parish.The ceremony was hosted by Edith Bowman and Cat Deeley and took place at Raffles London at The OWO Hotel.
