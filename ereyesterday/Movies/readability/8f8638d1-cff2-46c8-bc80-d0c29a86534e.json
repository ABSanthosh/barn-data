This does look epic \u0026 glorious. Here's the first official trailer (+ poster) for Nick Hamm's film William Tell, direct from YouTube: Original intro via TIFF: \"In 1307, a cruel Austrian Hapsburg king (Sir Ben Kingsley) occupies the bordering Swiss cantons. His tax collectors oppress and violate the [Swiss] citizens, driving one farmer to thoughts of murderous revenge. Fleeing across a vast landscape, this farmer finds only one man who will come to his aid: William Tell (Claes Bang). Tell has returned home weary after fighting with the Knights Templar in the Holy Land. Now seeking only a quiet life with the wife he met there (Golshifteh Farahani), he’s nevertheless bound by his principles. When pushed beyond his limits by the villainy of the Hapsburg court, Tell picks up his weapons and rides into battle.\" William Tell is written and directed by Northern Irish filmmaker Nick Hamm, director of the films The Very Thought of You, Talk of Angels, The Hole, Godsend, Killing Bono, The Journey, Driven, White Lines, and Gigi \u0026 Nate previously. Produced by Piers Tempest, Marie-Christine Jaeger-Firmenich, and Nick Hamm. This initially premiered at the 2024 Toronto Film Festival this fall, and it also played at Zurich Film Festival. Altitude Films will debut William Tell in UK \u0026 Irish cinemas starting on January 10th, 2025 early next year. No US release date is set yet - stay tuned. Look any good so far?
