Since making its debut last August, the first installment has received positive reviews from critics. It currently has a Certified Fresh score of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 71 reviews. What did showrunner Bill Lawrence say about the Bad Monkey Season 2 renewal? “I hope that people know that Carl Hiaasen is an idol of mine and an inspiration for me as a writer,” showrunner Bill Lawrence said in a statement. “To get to go on telling his story with Vince Vaughn and this great cast, at least the characters who are still alive, is very exciting. I’m very thankful to our partners at Apple TV+ and Warner Bros, as well as the entire team that helps bring this show to life.” Bad Monkey is created and executive produced by Lawrence, based on Carl Hiaasen’s bestselling 2013 novel of the same name.

Scott Caldwell (The Fugitive), Rob Delaney (Catastrophe), Meredith Hagner (Search Party), Natalie Martinez (La Promesa del Retorno), Alex Moffat (Saturday Night Live), Michelle Monaghan (Gone Baby Gone), Ronald Peet (First Reformed), and Jodie Turner-Smith (Queen \u0026 Slim).
