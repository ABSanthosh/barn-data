  "text": "Billboard Women in Music 2025 Universal reached back through the ages to hype Christopher Nolan‘s epic adaptation of “The Odyssey” at CinemaCon on Wednesday. Jim Orr, the studio’s distribution chief, predicted that the film, which is still shooting, will be “a visionary, once-in-a-generation cinematic masterpiece that Homer himself would quite likely be proud of.” He seemed to be serious, but the audience of theater owners (and perhaps a stray classicist or two) laughed at the hyperbole. Orr also talked about Nolan’s “staggering all-star cast.” Nobody seemed to disagree with that considering that Nolan, riding high off the Oscar-winning success of “Oppenheimer,” has assembled an ensemble that includes Matt Damon as as Odysseus, the king of Ithaca, as well as Tom Holland, Anne Hathaway, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong’o, Robert Pattinson and Charlize Theron (no word on what mythical characters they play). Universal didn’t have any footage to share of Nolan’s latest, nor did they provide any teaser for another legendary director’s next feature. That would be Steven Spielberg, who is returning to blockbuster territory after making his semi-autobiographical “The Fabelmans.” That film doesn’t have a title, but it does boast a script by Spielberg’s “Jurassic Park” collaborator David Koepp. The studio has described the project as a “new original event film,” though specific plot details haven’t been revealed. The screenplay is based on a story by Spielberg and is expected to incorporate sci-fi elements. Its cast includes Josh O’Connor, Emily Blunt, Colin Firth, Colman Domingo and Eve Hewson. At CinemaCon, Orr said the film was “propulsive [and] modern,” and has an “out of this world twist.” That sounds on brand for a director whose greatest hits include “E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial” and “Close Encounters of the Third Kind.” Spielberg’s latest movie opens on June 12, 2026, while Nolan’s sails into theaters on July 17, 2026.",
