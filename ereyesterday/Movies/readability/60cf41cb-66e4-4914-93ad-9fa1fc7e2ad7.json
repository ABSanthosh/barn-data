It’s a mix of old and new, as it features cursing and sex scenes that would’ve never been allowed during the time. While the film was a flop upon release, the new The Good German 4K release is worth checking out thanks to its star-filled cast and technical mastery. “Berlin, 1945. Everyone in Berlin has a secret. Everyone is working an angle to get what they need: money, power, survival… or just a way out. Academy Award-winning filmmakers Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney teamed up for this silver screen treatment of Joseph Kanon’s acclaimed novel. Amidst the ruins of post-World War II Berlin, U.S. Army war correspondent Jake Geismer (Clooney) becomes embroiled with Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett), a former lover whose missing husband is the object of a manhunt by both the American and Russian armies. Intrigue mounts as Jake tries to uncover the secrets Lena may be hiding in her desperation to get herself and her husband out of Berlin. Tobey Maguire also stars in this taut thriller as a soldier with black market connections who may be Lena’s way out — or her entry into even darker territory,” says the official description. Like the DVD release, The Good German 4K is presented in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, which allows it to look like 35 mm films of yesteryear and is nearly the Academy ratio. Displayed in black-and-white, the detail of the sets really impresses in ultra-high definition. So does the lighting, especially if you have an OLED television, as the black levels look great. Soderbergh also used plenty of time-appropriate equipment, as it uses 1940s wide-angle lenses for the cameras, incandescent lighting, and a boom mike for the audio. It’s a technical achievement, and the film can really be appreciated if viewed as a film experiment. As for the actual movie, it isn’t up to the standards of the films it pays homage to. Casablanca this is not, despite solid performances by George Clooney, Cate Blanchett (who Soderbergh recently reunited with on Black Bag), and Tobey Maguire. The script doesn’t deliver much in terms of interesting payoffs, and it’s a rather forgettable post-World War II story. Still, it looks great and it’s an enjoyable watch in the moment — maybe due to how little it sticks with you. Sadly, like the DVD release, the special features are the absolute minimum. The only bonus included is the theatrical trailer. It’s a shame that no commentary track was ever recorded, as I would’ve loved to hear Soderbergh discuss the technical details of the film more, especially in terms of the movie’s staging, which is a real standout. So, there’s no added reason to pick this up beyond the film itself. The Good German 4K Review: Final Verdict While it isn’t one of Steven Soderbergh’s best films, even his lesser offerings are undeniably interesting. The Good German 4K is a great way to watch one of Soderbergh’s most impressive technical feats, even if the story it tells isn’t all that captivating. Clooney and Blanchett have moments of magnetism (and it’s very funny seeing Maguire beat up Clooney in one scene), so there are still moments of magic to be appreciated for Soderbergh fans. Disclosure: ComingSoon received product from the distributor for our The Good German 4K review.",
