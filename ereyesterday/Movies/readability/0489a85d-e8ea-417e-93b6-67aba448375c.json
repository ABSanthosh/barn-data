Subsequently, fans have grown curious about easter egg references which will help them connect with the overall Star Wars franchise. So, are you excited to delve deep into the easter eggs in Skeleton Crew Episode 4? So, here is a list of Star Wars: Skeleton Crew Episode 4’s easter eggs and the exciting references to Star Wars and other franchises. List of major Star Wars easter eggs in Skeleton Crew Episode 4 The fourth episode of Skeleton Crew features numerous easter eggs and Star Wars references. Below is a list of a few of them: Mural Identical to One at Fern’s House In the episode, kids come across an old house with a mural or artwork similar to the one at Fern’s home on At Attin. The painting seemingly depicts the founders of the Jewel planets in the Old Republic. Jod’s Home Planet Jod Na Nawood opens up on his background for the first time as he calls his home world dark and dull. This could be the beginning of the show’s narrative delving into his history. Kids Battling Adults The kid’s battle against adults reminds the audience of Yoda witnessing a war between kids and adults in Jason Aaron’s 2015 Star Wars comic. Besides, it can even be a nod to the Lost Boys’ battle against Captain Hook’s crew in Peter Pan. SM-33’s Faulty Memory In the episode, SM-33 faces a memory loss regarding At Attin, similar to the droid BEN from Treasure Planet. In the movie, the robot’s memories of Captain Flint were likely erased to keep it safe from others. A New Sub-Species of Eopies The camel-like Eopies are also shown in Episode 4 of Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, albeit with a few modifications. They first appeared on Tatooine in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Hayna’s Blaster Further in the episode, viewers get to see Hayna with a blaster that looks similar to the Daleks’ gun from the series, Doctor Who. At Achrann and the Other Jewels The series also showcases that the new world is none other than a dark mirror to At Attin, known as At Achrann. The other jewel planets shown are At Arissia, At Aytuu, At Acoda, and At Aravin. SM-33 Resembles E-XD Droids In the fourth episode, SM-33 surprisingly transforms to attack the kids. This is quite similar to the E-XD droids that appeared in Star Wars Rebels Season 3. Much like SM-33, the droids seemed harmless at first, before revealing their murderous traits.",
