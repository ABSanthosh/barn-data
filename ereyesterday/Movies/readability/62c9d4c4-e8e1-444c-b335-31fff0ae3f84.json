  "description": "\"I just want you to come home and finish what you started!\" Lionsgate has revealed an official trailer for Off the Grid, an action thriller made by stuntman filmmaker Johnny Martin. Yet another of these dime-a-dozen junk action films being dumped out this summer. Way too many of these recently. After a morally-bankrupt company tries to weaponize a brilliant scientist’s revolutionary technology, he goes off the grid to safeguard humanity. When the company sends a strike force to find him, they make their biggest mistake of all – they weaponize the man they are trying to catch. Huh? What the hell is this even about - does this give him special powers? Off the Grid stars Josh Duhamel, Greg Kinnear, Peter Stormare, and María Elisa Camargo. No idea how the hell they got these actors for this, because this looks absolutely terrible. But that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. Avoid at all costs! Don't waste any time or money on this movie. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Johnny Martin's action movie Off the Grid, from YouTube: ﻿After a morally-bankrupt company tries to weaponize a brilliant scientist's revolutionary new technology, he goes off the grid to safeguard humanity.
