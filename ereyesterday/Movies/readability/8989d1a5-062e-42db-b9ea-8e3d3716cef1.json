Seriously. Bleecker Street's new movie The Friend is now playing in movie theaters nationwide - one of my favorite films from 2024 (it premiered at TIFF last year - my review). To bring some additional attention to the release, they cut together a very fun \"Bing and Messi FaceTime\" promo - connecting two of the most talented canine movie stars in cinema history. Messi is the French Border Collie dog who starred in Justine Triet's Anatomy of a Fall, appearing at the Oscars in an iconic bit where the dog claps in his seat. Bing the Dog is an enormous, lovable, super cute Great Dane pooch who stars in The Friend, giving one heck of a good boy performance. Seriously. Bing plays Apollo, and Messi plays Snoop, both of them giving two of the finest dog performances that have very important roles in the movie. They're not just best friends, they're key parts of the cast and the story. This is just a funny video [‚Ä¶]",

Easily one of the best movie promos ever made. Seriously. Bleecker Street's new movie The Friend is now playing in movie theaters nationwide - one of my favorite films from 2024 (it premiered at TIFF last year - my review).

Bing plays Apollo, and Messi plays Snoop, both of them giving two of the finest dog performances that have very important roles in the movie. They're not just best friends, they're key parts of the cast and the story. This is just a funny video they cut together using FaceTime footage of the two doggies barking at each other about the movie business. I appreciate the cute creativity \u0026 most importantly - go see The Friend in theaters now. You can rewatch the official trailer for McGehee \u0026 Siegel's The Friend right here for even more Bing footage. In The Friend, writer and teacher Iris (Watts) finds her comfortable, solitary New York life thrown into disarray after her closest friend and mentor (Murray) dies suddenly and bequeaths her his beloved 150 lb. Great Dane. The regal yet intractable beast, named Apollo, immediately creates practical problems for Iris, from furniture destruction to eviction notices, as well as more existential ones, his looming presence constantly reminding her of her friend‚Äôs problematic choices in both life and death. Yet as Iris finds herself unexpectedly bonding with the animal, she begins to come to terms with her past, her lost friend, and her own creative inner life. The Friend is co-directed by filmmaker duo Scott McGehee \u0026 David Siegel, both directors of the films Suture, The Deep End, Bee Season, Uncertainty, What Maisie Knew, and Montana Story previously. Adapted from the novel of the same name written by Sigrid Nunez. It's produced by Liza Chasin, Mike Spreter, with McGehee \u0026 Siegel. This initially premiered at both the 2024 Toronto \u0026 New York Film Festivals last year (read our review). Bleecker Street will debut McGehee \u0026 Siegel's The Friend in select US theaters starting March 28th, 2025 - then opening nationwide on April 4th. Who's ready to watch?
