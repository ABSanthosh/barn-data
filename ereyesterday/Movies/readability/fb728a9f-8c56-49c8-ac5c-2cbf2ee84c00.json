Both Miami and San Francisco have struggled to muster a decent amount of yards in their recent games, limiting their offensive oppourtinities. While the 49ers have ensured their defensive output lately, conceding a combined 25 points in their last two games, it would be interesting to see if they can contain a resurgent Dolphins attack.
