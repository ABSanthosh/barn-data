Utopia’s Circle Collective opened The Visitor from cult Canadian artist Bruce LaBruce in NYC and Toronto to $11.4k  across just four showtimes on three screens . Known as the ‘King of Kink’, LaBruce’s “brilliantly depraved” new film scared away many traditional festivals and theater, but is finding an audience excited to see an independent, radical piece of art on screen with Q\u0026A’s, DJ sets, art installations and more.
