Macon Blair directs this unrated release from Cineverse. Fantastic Fest saw a successful premiere in 2023. Blair praises Troma and Legendary for supporting the film. Toxic Avenger has been done for quite some time and even held a successful premiere at the 2023 version of Fantastic Fest. It stars Elijah Wood, Julia Davis, Taylour Paige, Kevin Bacon, and Jacob Tremblay, and playing Toxie himself, Peter Dinklage. Macon Blair directed it. After the premiere, we heard nothing. It was taken off the release schedule, and Mum was the word until today. Cineverse will give the film a 2025 theatrical release after finding massive success in releasing Terrifier 2 and 3 in theaters in the last couple of years. Variety had the news. Toxic Avenger Fans Rejoice The film follows the story of struggling everyman-janitor Winston Gooze, who is transformed by a horrible toxic accident into a new evolution of hero: THE TOXIC AVENGER! Now, with super-human strength and wielding a glowing mop for his unconventional weapon, he must race against time to save his son and stop a ruthless and power-hungry corporate tyrant bent on harnessing toxic superpowers to strengthen his polluted empire. Credit Legendary Pictures Blair had this to say about the joyous news: \"I'm beyond grateful to the team behind 'The Toxic Avenger' who were so supportive and steady-handed as we searched for the perfect distribution partner for our film,\" said  director  Blair in a statement. \"It's so cool that folks will have the chance to see this in theaters, it's a fun rowdy movie you wanna see with a crowd. Mutant hero smashes bad guys with a mop: perfect entertainment for the whole family! Our goal was always to preserve the heart and spirit of the original Toxie (which was seared into my brain at a very young age) and try to make something that Troma fans would dig and at the same time do something with the character that feels fresh. Lloyd and Michael at Troma have been a blast to work with, absolutely everyone at Legendary are stars, and I can't wait to start working with the champs at Cinverse to bring this version of Toxie to fans new and old.\" Enjoyed this?
