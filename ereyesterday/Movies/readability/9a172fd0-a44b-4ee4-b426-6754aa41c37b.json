  "text": "Utilizing the resources of the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, Donald Trump has announced his intention to seek a 100% tariff on all films brought to America from another country. This includes films made by American companies like Netflix overseas in areas with better tax incentives, such as the U.K. and South Africa. Writing on Truth Social, Trump said, “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated.” Trump went on to claim that production moving overseas was part of a “concerted effort” by foreign countries to undermine American business, calling it “a national security threat.” “It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” Trump wrote. “Therefore, I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands. WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Hollywood has been on the President’s hit list from the very start of his second administration. One of his first actions in office was to name Mel Gibson, Sylvester Stallone, and Jon Voight as “special ambassadors” to help fix an ailing Hollywood. Though not much has been heard from Gibson or Stallone on this effort, Voight has been making the rounds with different union reps and studio executives (as per Deadline). Many were hopeful this might lead to a possible federal tax incentive for production throughout the U.S., but as it’s become Trump’s new favorite toy, it seems a tariff is what we’ll get. It’s unclear whether this tariff will apply to films alone or also include other media such as television, music videos, or commercials, but if so, it may end up doing more damage than good. The stated goal is to incentivize bringing production back to the States and in particular, Hollywood — but this doesn’t actually reduce the cost of production in the way federal U.S. Tax incentives would. This just makes production outside the U.S. more expensive. The net result may be that the studios would just reduce production across the board. As far as tax incentives, in October 2024, California Governor Gavin Newsom put forth a proposal to increase the state’s tax program to $750 million, over twice as much as it’s doling out currently. Others have offered further increases, suggesting no cap be placed on this figure. Voting for this initiative will take place this summer.",
