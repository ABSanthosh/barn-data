  "text": "Director Jon M. Chu has given another Crazy Rich Asians 2 update, revealing why he thinks the film isn’t going to happen anytime soon. What is the latest Crazy Rich Asians 2 update? Speaking to Deadline as part of their Crew Call podcast, Chu was asked about the status of a potential sequel to Crazy Rich Asians. The director noted that as of now, he wouldn’t ask anyone from the first film’s all-star cast to return unless things are worth it. “I won’t bring everyone back unless it’s worth it. There’s too much on the line for everybody,” said Chu, before noting that they’ve been trying, but haven’t landed on something just yet. “I want the best thing. I want it to be worthy of what Crazy Rich Asians 1 was. We’ve tried all different versions. It’s hard because people think the first movie is like the book, but it actually is not. It’s the right spirit, but the plotting is very different. And so, you can’t just go and translate. And we’ve tried versions and the fact is, is that we just haven’t gotten there.” As of now, Chu says he hard at work on the Broadway adaptation of the movie and novel; he considers this to be the sequel as of now. “To me, that sequel right now is that the Broadway musical that we’re working on. That’s very exciting and very fun.” The first Crazy Rich Asians released in 2018, and was based on the 2013 novel of the same name by Kevin Kwan. The film featured an absolute all-star cast, including Constance Wu, Henry Golding, Gemma Chan, Lisa Lu, Awkwafina, Ken Jeong, and Michelle Yeoh. (Source: Deadline)",
