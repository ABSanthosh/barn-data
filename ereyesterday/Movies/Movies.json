    "description": "McEric cleans up his inbox by dumping reviews for NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, RENNER, MOB COPS, and YOUNG WERTHER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all!  I've got some reviews of two films releasing this Friday, April 25th - but thought I'd also take this opportunity to highlight two other films that are already out there but I haven't yet found the time to cover. Hopefully there's something here for everyone, so let's get right to it: First up is NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, starring Jack Quaid (NOVOCAINE, THE COMPANION, \"The Boys\"), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (\"The Boys,\" \"The Walking Dead\"), and Malin Ackerman (WATCHMEN, SLAYERS), directed by Duncan Skiles (THE CLOVEHITCH KILLER) and written by Sean Farley. The film features troubled young man Simon McNally (Quaid), who is trying to find his feet after spending a decade in a facility for mental health treatment, and his paranoid ex-security guard neighbor Ed Deerman. The two form an unlikely partnership when Simon believes he's seen a woman kidnapped but is deemed an unreliable witness by police due to his history and behavior. The two men take it upon themselves to investigate the crime and rescue the woman, revealing a deeper web of villainy in their quiet town. Quaid and Morgan have great chemistry, and Quaid, specifically, does some great work in this film. Whereas the majority of his characters have been able to rely and charm and humor, Simon is stripped of these tools due to the abuse he received at a young age, so the tricks that Quaid would normally utilize to endear himself to audiences are out of reach. Quaid does a great job of humanizing McNally as a Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"Everything can change...\" in an instant. Right? Voltage Pictures has unveiled an official US trailer for an Italian thriller film titled Here Now, set on Sicily in Italy. The original Italian title is Fino alla fine and it's made by the filmmaker Gabriele Muccino, best known for directing Seven Pounds and The Pursuit of Happyness with Will Smith years ago. Sophie is a young Californian traveling in Italy on her vacation with her sister. She meets Giulio and his group of friends with whom she spends the most terrifying night of her life. A young woman's vacation in Palermo turns into a deadly battle for survival in a 24-hour whirlwind crime spree. Starring Elena Kampouris as Sophie, Saul Nanni, Lorenzo Richelmy, Enrico Inserra, and Francesco Garilli. This looks like it's one of those passionate thrillers where a whirlwind romance leads to some crimes, but she goes along with it because why not. Looks like it gets wild once things pick up. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Gabriele Muccino's film Here Now, direct from YouTube: Sophie (starring Elena Kampouris), a 20-year-old American on vacation in Palermo, Sicily with her sister, meets Giulio and his friends on the last […]",

    "description": "\"I want to build something undeniable. Something...\" \"Important?\" \"Iconic.\" Marvel has launched the first official trailer for a new Marvel Television mini-series called Ironheart, a spin-off from the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever movie. The series set in Chicago focuses on genius teenage inventor Riri Williams, who creates the most advanced suit of armor since Iron Man. Riri returns home where she gets entangled with the enigmatic Parker Robbins aka \"The Hood\", discovering secrets that pit technology against magic, setting her on a path of danger \u0026 adventure. The series is launching in June, a one-off creation produced by Ryan Coogler following his work on the Black Panther movies. I guess it took a few years for this series to come together while he was out filming Sinners. Ironheart stars Dominique Thorne as \"Ironheart\", Anthony Ramos, Lyric Ross, Alden Ehrenreich, Regan Aliyah, Manny Montana, Matthew Elam, and Anji White. This looks pretty cool. There's some good storytelling in this. But also seems like Disney is getting a bit afraid people are losing interest after Iron Man is gone so they're kinda sorta bringing back Iron Man – even though it's not actually Iron Man. Iron Woman? Sure, why not, let's roll […]",
