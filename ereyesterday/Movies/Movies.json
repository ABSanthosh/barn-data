Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world. Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis.   Demis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents.    During a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called Theme Park. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence.   For the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"The penguin is not a communist.\" Sony Pictures Classics has debuted their own official trailer for the new film titled The Penguin Lessons, a cute dramedy about rescuing a penguin in Argentina. A similar story to My Penguin Friend with Jean Reno from last year year, but not the same. This is opening at the end of March in US theaters. Starring Oscar nominee Steve Coogan, this endearing new film from director Peter Cattaneo follows an Englishman's personal and political awakening after he adopts a little penguin during a cataclysmic period in Argentine's history. He finds the small penguin covered with oil and cleans him up, making a new friend in the process. The main ensemble cast includes Björn Gustafsson, David Herrero, Jonathan Pryce, Vivian El Jaber, Aimar Miranda, Micaela Breque, Tomas Pozzi, and Ramiro Blas. The film played at TIFF and got glowing reviews, a few of which are quoted in this trailer. Looks good.

    "description": "\"You'll never be alone out here - there's too many voices.\" Quiver Distr. has revealed an official trailer for a Canadian indie sci-fi film titled The Silent Planet, made by filmmaker Jeffrey St. Jules. That title reminds me of another underrated sci-fi indie film called Silent Running (from 1972) with Bruce Dern. This new film follows two inmates in the near future who are sentenced to a lifetime of hard labor on a distant planet. As things unravel, they become increasingly paranoid and start to lose a sense of who they are and their past lives. The film premiered at the 2024 Fantasia Film Festival last year and will be on VOD in March: \"Known for his surreal approach to his subject matter, [director Jeffrey] St. Jules explores what the future of Earth would look like if we included aliens as a part of immigration policies. This contemplative film is light years away from bombastic space operas, exploring regret, redemption, and redress as two people come together in the worst situation and face a horrible truth.\" Very interesting. The Silent Planet stars Elias Koteas and Briana Middleton as the two, with Bridget Wareham and Justin Nurse. Sci-fi fans should take […]",
