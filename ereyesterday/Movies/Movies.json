    "description": "McEric sits down with THE DAILY SHOW writer Daniel Radosh and editor Lauren Beckett Jackson for an interview Read the full article on AICN Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” has been on-air for almost thirty years, garnering 26 PrimeTime Emmy Awards and several Peabody Awards for its writing and execution. Many are familiar with the show’s blend of current news commentary and informational journalism from comedians like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Steve Carrell, John Oliver, Samatha Bee, Roy Wood, Jr, Rob Riggle, Jordan Klepper, Wyatt Cenac, Hasan Minhaj, Larry Whitmore, Lewis Black, Desi Lydic, Ronny Chieng, Michael Kosta, and a bevy of others. “The Daily Show’s” audience has grown up alongside the show, with viewership now skewing in higher age demographics than the coveted 18-34 bracket it dominated during its inception. That maturity is reflected in the current iteration of the show, with Stewart hosting on Monday’s while the rest of “The Best F**king News Team” fill in the remainder of the week. “The Daily Show” is a bit of a misnomer as the show broadcasts nightly on Comedy Central (or Paramount+ for those living in the streaming age) from Monday to Thursday. I suppose “The Intermittent Show” just doesn’t have the same ring to it. “The Daily Show” is not unique in its position as a satirical news program, however it remains the definitive iteration of the format. Everyone knows about “The Daily Show,” love it or hate it. A foundational pillar of the show’s ubiquity and popularity is in the writing and execution of the show, which stands head and shoulders above its contemporaries.   I was honored to speak with senior writer Daniel Radosh Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Scott Adkins talks with McEric about his new action film, DIABLO Read the full article on AICN If you’re a fan of current action films then you likely know the name Scott Adkins. He’s either kicked the ass of or had his ass kicked by every action star of the last five decades: Dolph Lundgren, Jackie Chan, Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, and even Keanu Reeves. That’s right - he was the big guy with the grill in JOHN WICK CHAPTER 4.  Scott’s newest film is DIABLO, which hits theaters and on demand this Friday, June 13th. Conceived alongside action compatriot Marko Zaror, the film takes place in Colombia following Adkins as Kris, a former convict, who seeks to make good on a promise to a fallen friend, which runs him afoul of Zaror’s mercenary, El Corvo. This film isn’t just another straight-to-streaming no-budget piece of content - DIABLO delivers on every front. The fight scenes, choreographed by Zaror, are intense and deftly photographed, thanks to director Ernesto Diaz Espinoza. The gunplay is intense, the acting is top tier, and the film never lags.    Marko Zaror steals his scenes as El Corvo, a mercenary with an iron fist, literally. The six-foot-two Chilean action star has a chilling villain introduction, followed by a massive action scene in a sketchy hideout that plays out like a scene from TERMINATOR. He mows through assailants and bystanders alike with no emotion, only showing a hint of fear when Adkins’s Kris shows up to give him a real fight. El Corvo is fucking terrifying. Their final confrontation is a throwback to Finish the article on AICN",

It all comes down to this final stand. Netflix has debuted another new official trailer for Squid Game 3, the third and final season of the hit Korean thriller series about desperate people chasing money.
