    "description": "Director Simon West and star Lucy Liu talk OLD GUY, starring Christoph Waltz, now streaming everywhere! Read the full article on AICN Director Simon West should be a household name; his first film was a little picture from 1997 called CON AIR. Perhaps you've heard of it? He went on to helm similar big budget action extravaganzas, such as 2001's LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER and 2012's THE EXPENDABLES 2. Eventually, however, time and changing tastes caught up with West, and now he's directing smaller budget flicks, from action to drama, that move at a slightly slower pace and appeal to a different audience.  The same could be said for Danny Dolinski, the titular OLD GUY of West's latest feature, played by Academy-Award Winner Christoph Waltz (INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, THE GREEN HORNET). Danny's a wetworks expert in a field saturated with hot young assassins, desperately trying to prove he's still relevant, often to his detriment. After recovering from a wrist injury that found him relegated to a cleaner role at a local bakery, Danny is itching to get back in the field. When he's told the only role available is support for young assassing Wihlborg (Cooper Hoffman), he is understandably unenthused. He invites his longtime friend Anata (Lucy Liu) along for their job since it'll take them to some charming locations around Europe, and once underway, tries to take point on every hit. Things don't go as planned. As you can probably already divine, there are so many parallels between Waltz's OLD GUY and West's career. Danny was once the best, the biggest game in town, and his name still opens doors... but the game has Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Julianna Margulies and Gretchen Mol Talk MILLERS IN MARRIAGE, Edward Burns' latest with Eric McClanahan Read the full article on AICN Edward Burns made quite the impression after winning the Best Picture prize at the Sundance Film Festival with his 1995 masterpiece THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN, signifying the emergence of a new and singular voice. The plot synopsis for the film was \"Three Irish Catholic brothers from Long Island struggle to deal with love, marriage, and infidelity.\" Now, thirty years later, Burns has returned with a new vision, MILLERS IN MARRIAGE, with the plot synopsis sounding vaguely familiar - \"Three Irish Catholic siblings from New York struggle to deal with love, marriage, and infidelity.\" What can I say? Dude's got range. However, I'm not here to say that Edward Burns is a one-trick pony or that MILLERS IN MARRIAGE is recycled and tired. Truth is, I really liked this movie. The cast is impeccable and the narrative kept me interested, even when I thought some plot points were a bit contrived or predictable. Burns crafts characters that we want to care about, even if they're narcissistic, self-destructive, manipulative, or just plain wrong. Burns' gift of character and dialogue is that we are drawn into the maw of the devouring devils of his narratives.  This film is no different. Following the Miller siblings, Andy (Burns), Maggie (Julianna Margulies), and Eve (Gretchen Mol), and their orbiting cadre of lovers. Andy is a painter, fresh off a separation from his wife Tina (Morena Baccarin) and now dating one of her former colleagues Renee (Minnie Driver). Maggie is an active novelist married to inert novelist Nick (Campbell Scott), Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"A big wedding party with all the people we love? I want the same thing... with you.\" Wayfarer Studios has unveiled an official trailer for an indie romantic comedy titled A Nice Indian Boy, which first premiered at last year's SXSW Film Festival. Finally ready for release in April this spring one year later. From director Roshan Sethi, the film is a queer romance about a boy who brings his soon-to-be-husband back to meet his very traditional family. And they even got THE hunk Jonathan Groff to play Jay the fiance. When Naveen brings his new fiancé Jay home to meet his traditional Indian family, they must contend with accepting his white-orphan-artist boyfriend and helping them plan the Indian wedding of their dreams. What follows is the comedic \u0026 heartfelt collision between the family, and Naveen – caught between the versions of himself his family and Jay know. Karan Soni stars with Jonathan Groff as his fiance, plus Sunita Mani, Zarna Garg, Harish Patel, Peter S. Kim, and Sas Goldberg. This looks super sweet and fun and wholesome. It's not trying to reinvent the romcom wheel, just wants to be a nice, feel-good film we can all enjoy. Got me. […]",

Simple as that – this is the right way to experience a movie together at the movie theater. Another fun Alamo Drafthouse PSA has just arrived online – this time it features the two legendary actors John Lithgow \u0026 Geoffrey Rush together. Last year they visited the Alamo Drafthouse cinema in Austin, Texas to premiere their horror film called The Rule of Jenny Pen (which I am a big fan of as well) at Fantastic Fest. It's opening soon in theaters this week so this video is dropping now. They recorded this fun video for the Drafthouse cinema chain which will play in front of movies at the chain. It's their usual reminder that their rule (which should be the rule at ALL cinemas) is that if you talk during the movie or using your phone you will be kicked out. Just don't do it! We've posted many of these funny PSA videos over the years. This one is especially amusing because of how fully committed to the bit they are. 👇 Send it to all of your […]",
