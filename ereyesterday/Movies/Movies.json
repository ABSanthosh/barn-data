    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Adores THE LIFE OF CHUCK Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here. Have I ever told you what a huge Stephen King fan I am? It started when a teenage me read Pet Sematary and became so enthralled with the author’s work that my mom’s Christmas shopping became immensely easier. She started gifting me Stephen King books for every Christmas and birthday thereafter, knowing I would eagerly devour every page. I did, with relish. Eventually, I began working my way through movies based on his works. Some ventured from the source material in ways I didn’t appreciate, but when I heard Mike Flanagan would be tackling one of King’s short stories, The Life of Chuck, I knew I’d love it. And I did. Mike Flanagan, who’s responsible for my favorite horror miniseries, The Haunting of Hill House, and who was the mastermind who brought Doctor Sleep to screens, remains incredibly faithful to the source material, including how it’s told in three acts using reverse chronology. It’s a film that offers a feast of reflection on life, but I suspect some will dig in more ravenously than others. This is a story about those magical moments in life, the influence others have on our lives, and the decisions we make day to day that steer us one way or another.  Narrated by Nick Offerman, the film begins ominously enough, with the world seemingly coming to an end. Natural and unnatural disasters plague the planet, and as if that’s not bad enough, the internet also appears to be out, possibly for good this time. Uncertainty and fear weigh Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"I ain't going to let them take us away. I'd die before I let them break us.\" Gravitas has revealed the official trailer for an indie small town drama titled What We Hide, the latest feature film from screenwriter / filmmaker Dan Kay. This premiered at the 2025 Santa Barbara Film Festival earlier this year, and it played at the Dallas Film Festival a few months ago. After their mother suffers a fatal overdose, two sisters fear that the foster system will separate them and decide to hide the body. But their lie may be discovered and they must decide how far they are willing to go to keep their secret. Their future becomes uncertain... \"Not all secrets remain buried.\" This stars Mckenna Grace and Jojo Regina, with Forrest Goodluck, Malia Baker, Fernanda Andrade, with Dacre Montgomery and Jesse Williams. Early reviews describe the film as \"a heartfelt watch about rural American families, a community often portrayed through stereotypes.\" Although this trailer looks rather cliche and generic, with a story that doesn't seem that believable anyway.

    "description": "\"I'm not looking forward to old age...\" \"Then don't look forward.\" Sony Pictures Australia has unveiled an official trailer for an Australian family dramedy called The Travellers, opening in cinemas Down Under this October. It's the latest film from acclaimed Aussie filmmaker Bruce Beresford, best known for directing Driving Miss Daisy, Double Jeopardy, and many other movies over decades. It's also written by Beresford, who seems to be tapping into his own experiences to tell this story. Stephen Seary, a stage designer, returns to Australia to say goodbye to his dying mother. What should be a quick trip descends into chaos, drama, and funny moments as he juggles family tension, past lovers, and his desire to return to Europe for a major opera contract. Described as \"poignant \u0026 heartwarming\", The Travellers stars Luke Bracey as Stephen, Bryan Brown, Susie Porter, Shubshri Kandiah, Celia Massingham, and Nicholas Hammond. This looks charming and heartfelt. Bryan Brown looks like he's having a blast with this performance as Fred. Here's the official Australian trailer (+ poster) for Bruce Beresford's film The Travellers, from YouTube: Stephen Seary (starring Luke Bracey), a charismatic and successful stage designer, returns to his small hometown in Australia to say […]",
