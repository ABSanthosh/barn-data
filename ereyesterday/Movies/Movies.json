    "description": "Director Simon West and star Lucy Liu talk OLD GUY, starring Christoph Waltz, now streaming everywhere! Read the full article on AICN Director Simon West should be a household name; his first film was a little picture from 1997 called CON AIR. Perhaps you've heard of it? He went on to helm similar big budget action extravaganzas, such as 2001's LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER and 2012's THE EXPENDABLES 2. Eventually, however, time and changing tastes caught up with West, and now he's directing smaller budget flicks, from action to drama, that move at a slightly slower pace and appeal to a different audience.  The same could be said for Danny Dolinski, the titular OLD GUY of West's latest feature, played by Academy-Award Winner Christoph Waltz (INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, THE GREEN HORNET). Danny's a wetworks expert in a field saturated with hot young assassins, desperately trying to prove he's still relevant, often to his detriment. After recovering from a wrist injury that found him relegated to a cleaner role at a local bakery, Danny is itching to get back in the field. When he's told the only role available is support for young assassing Wihlborg (Cooper Hoffman), he is understandably unenthused. He invites his longtime friend Anata (Lucy Liu) along for their job since it'll take them to some charming locations around Europe, and once underway, tries to take point on every hit. Things don't go as planned. As you can probably already divine, there are so many parallels between Waltz's OLD GUY and West's career. Danny was once the best, the biggest game in town, and his name still opens doors... but the game has Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Julianna Margulies and Gretchen Mol Talk MILLERS IN MARRIAGE, Edward Burns' latest with Eric McClanahan Read the full article on AICN Edward Burns made quite the impression after winning the Best Picture prize at the Sundance Film Festival with his 1995 masterpiece THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN, signifying the emergence of a new and singular voice. The plot synopsis for the film was \"Three Irish Catholic brothers from Long Island struggle to deal with love, marriage, and infidelity.\" Now, thirty years later, Burns has returned with a new vision, MILLERS IN MARRIAGE, with the plot synopsis sounding vaguely familiar - \"Three Irish Catholic siblings from New York struggle to deal with love, marriage, and infidelity.\" What can I say? Dude's got range. However, I'm not here to say that Edward Burns is a one-trick pony or that MILLERS IN MARRIAGE is recycled and tired. Truth is, I really liked this movie. The cast is impeccable and the narrative kept me interested, even when I thought some plot points were a bit contrived or predictable. Burns crafts characters that we want to care about, even if they're narcissistic, self-destructive, manipulative, or just plain wrong. Burns' gift of character and dialogue is that we are drawn into the maw of the devouring devils of his narratives.  This film is no different. Following the Miller siblings, Andy (Burns), Maggie (Julianna Margulies), and Eve (Gretchen Mol), and their orbiting cadre of lovers. Andy is a painter, fresh off a separation from his wife Tina (Morena Baccarin) and now dating one of her former colleagues Renee (Minnie Driver). Maggie is an active novelist married to inert novelist Nick (Campbell Scott), Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"We don't know what we're going to wake up to, like, what the world is going to be like...\" An early teaser trailer has debuted for an indie horror film titled I See the Demon, from filmmaker Jacob Lees Johnson. This is premiering at the 2025 Cinequest Film Festival in March if anyone wants to catch it - grab tickets. It's described as a \"mublegore sci-fi thriller\" - I dig that the title seems like misdirection. There is a strange comet up in the sky? And other weird things going on? Is it a demon or aliens or something else entirely? At her surprise birthday party, an emotionally vulnerable woman experiences unexplainable phenomena that threaten to turn the best night of her life into a never-ending nightmare. Lucy sees a strange object in the sky, but everyone keeps telling her everything is fine. This stars Alexis Zollicoffer, Jon Heder, Mallory Everton, Noah Kershisnik, Archelaus Crisanto, Dave Martinez, Mac Steele Foster, and Oran Stainbrook. It reminds me of the opening party in Cloverfield, but turns into something else trippy \u0026 crazy in the second half of this teaser. Wild.

    "description": "\"Our son was rapidly sucked into it.\" Greenwich Ent. has revealed an official trailer for AUM: The Cult at the End of the World, a documentary film about the dangerous, psychotic doomsday day cult in Japan known as Aum Shinrikyo. This first premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival a few years ago, and is finally getting released in the US this spring. The shocking story of Aum Shinrikyo (today known as Aleph), the doomsday cult that unleashed a deadly nerve gas in Tokyo’s subway system in March of 1995. Founded by disillusioned yoga teacher Shoko Asahara, Aum transformed into a terrorist organization while Japan’s police and media turned a blind eye. Featuring rare archival footage and an interview with one of Asahara’s former high-ranking disciples. This film is an exploration of Aum Shinrikyo, and its leader Shoko Asahara, who were responsible for attack, involves the participation of those who lived through the horror in the 90s as it unfolded. I'm glad I watched this at Sundance a few years ago, it's fascinating and seriously disquieting understanding how they got away with all of this. Another film showing how evil \"religious\" cults always are. Here's the US trailer for Braun […]",
