Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

Read the full article on AICN Found footage horror. Do you love it? Do you hate it? Do you think it is its own genre or do you lump it in with its overarching tone - slasher, supernatural, monster, etc. Love it or hate it, the convention is here to stay, as it offers a realistic, relatable approach to horror that blurs the lines between reality, film, empathy, and voyeurism.   So, when I got an email asking if I wanted to screen the feature DEVON, written and directed by Jenni “JWoww” Farley, I said “of course I do!” My wife is a fan of “Jersey Shore” and has been since day one, so I mostly did it for her, but I was also very curious what the singular star would bring to the horror pantheon. The logline read:   Devon's parents never stopped searching for answers after her disappearance from a notorious asylum. Years after the incident, a mysterious website draws five adventurers to the abandoned asylum where she was last seen. Armed with cameras, they plunge into the darkness, unaware they’re filming their own descent into horror—never meant to return.     I got the chance to chat with writer/director/producer Jenni “JWoww” Farley about jumping into a feature-length film, the serendipitous location, and her crew.      Eric McClanahan: Hey, Jenni! How are you?   Jenni “JWoww” Farley: Good. Nervous.    EM: Nervous? Why are you nervous?   JJF: I feel like this is [me] kind of starting my career over. It’s a different world, a different element.

In this new film from director Naoko Yamada, a girl who can see colors in people's hearts joins a band with two other people. The synesthete Totsuko can see others as colors. Honor student Kimi has dropped out of school but still pretends to attend anyway. They reunite and form a small band with Rui, who dreams of composing on analog synthesizers but whose mother expects him to become a doctor. Together, they find freedom, joy, love, through music. Featuring music by Kensuke Ushio, and animation by the studio Science SARU. The Colors Within is getting a proper wide theatrical release around the US starting in January after a limited run at first - because it has such good buzz after playing at festival for most of the year and opening in Japan already.

This is based on the already beloved manga of the same name, produced by TMS Entertainment \u0026 publisher Shueisha in Japan, with Masaki Watanabe (of \"Battle Spirits\") directing. Legendary ex-hitman Sakamoto bands with comrades to face off against the looming threat of assassins to secure a peaceful life with his beloved family in this long-awaited anime adaptation. Taro ends up becoming a \"plus sized\" man living in a small town. Many of his former rivals \u0026 partners do not believe that he has truly left the business and show up in hopes of taking him out. Barred from killing, Sakamoto must find creative ways to subdue his enemies and prevent them from bringing harm to his family, his store, and the small town he resides in. The anime features Tomokazu Sugita as Taro, along with Nao Tôyama, Ayane Sakura, Nobunaga Shimazaki, Hina Kino, and Miyari Nemoto. This looks it will be a blast!
