Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

Do you think it is its own genre or do you lump it in with its overarching tone - slasher, supernatural, monster, etc. Love it or hate it, the convention is here to stay, as it offers a realistic, relatable approach to horror that blurs the lines between reality, film, empathy, and voyeurism.   So, when I got an email asking if I wanted to screen the feature DEVON, written and directed by Jenni “JWoww” Farley, I said “of course I do!” My wife is a fan of “Jersey Shore” and has been since day one, so I mostly did it for her, but I was also very curious what the singular star would bring to the horror pantheon. The logline read:   Devon's parents never stopped searching for answers after her disappearance from a notorious asylum. Years after the incident, a mysterious website draws five adventurers to the abandoned asylum where she was last seen. Armed with cameras, they plunge into the darkness, unaware they’re filming their own descent into horror—never meant to return.     I got the chance to chat with writer/director/producer Jenni “JWoww” Farley about jumping into a feature-length film, the serendipitous location, and her crew.      Eric McClanahan: Hey, Jenni! How are you?   Jenni “JWoww” Farley: Good. Nervous.    EM: Nervous? Why are you nervous?   JJF: I feel like this is [me] kind of starting my career over. It’s a different world, a different element.

    "description": "\"You cannot understand the damage you've done.\" Vertical has revealed an official trailer for an indie film called Mind Wave, a tech conspiracy thriller from Chinese-Canadian filmmaker Leon Lee. Set for a VOD release later this week - ready to watch right away if you're intrigued. As a global ban looms over a popular Chinese app (in real life - TikTok - though they give it a fake name in here), a framed expatriate cyber expert races to clear his name and expose a conspiracy threatening democracy worldwide. He races against time to find out exactly what is going on; his wife mysteriously vanishes, leaving behind a trail of cryptic clues that point to a deeper conspiracy. Starring Harry Han as Clint Wu, with Liz Cha, Steve Thackray, Ian Kim, and James Lew. This seems to be trying to comment on current events, but looks a bit too cheesy and a bit too obsessed with conspiracies to actually shake up anything in the real world. But still worth a look anyway. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Leon Lee's thriller Mind Wave, direct from YouTube: A Chinese-Canadian cybersecurity expert (starring Harry Han) is wrongfully accused of a devastating attack […]",

A sudden attack by Wulf, a clever and ruthless Dunlending lord seeking vengeance for the death of his father, forces Helm Hammerhand, the King of Rohan, and his people to make a daring last stand in the ancient stronghold of the Hornburg. The main voice cast includes Brian Cox as Helm, Gaia Wise as Hèra, Luke Pasqualino as Wulf, Laurence Ubong Williams as Fréaláf, Shaun Dooley as Freca, and Miranda Otto (returning) to narrate as Éowyn.
