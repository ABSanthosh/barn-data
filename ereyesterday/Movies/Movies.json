Read the full article on AICN Found footage horror. Do you love it? Do you hate it? Do you think it is its own genre or do you lump it in with its overarching tone - slasher, supernatural, monster, etc. Love it or hate it, the convention is here to stay, as it offers a realistic, relatable approach to horror that blurs the lines between reality, film, empathy, and voyeurism.   So, when I got an email asking if I wanted to screen the feature DEVON, written and directed by Jenni “JWoww” Farley, I said “of course I do!” My wife is a fan of “Jersey Shore” and has been since day one, so I mostly did it for her, but I was also very curious what the singular star would bring to the horror pantheon. The logline read:   Devon's parents never stopped searching for answers after her disappearance from a notorious asylum. Years after the incident, a mysterious website draws five adventurers to the abandoned asylum where she was last seen. Armed with cameras, they plunge into the darkness, unaware they’re filming their own descent into horror—never meant to return.     I got the chance to chat with writer/director/producer Jenni “JWoww” Farley about jumping into a feature-length film, the serendipitous location, and her crew.      Eric McClanahan: Hey, Jenni! How are you?   Jenni “JWoww” Farley: Good. Nervous.    EM: Nervous? Why are you nervous?   JJF: I feel like this is [me] kind of starting my career over. It’s a different world, a different element. I am a superfan of horror films; I have been since I Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "HIPPO'S Writer/Director Mark Rapaport Chats Video Games, Sex Talks, and Black-and-White Filmmaking Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends! Barbarella here to talk about dark comedy Hippo, or more accurately to share the conversation I had with Hippo’s director and writer Mark Rapaport. Genuinely funny, this incredible film has the potential to achieve cult status, so long as people take a chance on this black-and-white gem and actually see it. I recommend that they do. Hippo stars Kimball Farley, Lilla Kizlinger, Eliza Roberts, and Eric Roberts as the narrator. It tells the story of two exceptionally different teens being raised by their mother in a somewhat isolated existence. At times, it reminds me of Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, in the way that the children in Hippo are sheltered, while not in the same extreme way they were in the Greek film, both films make strong points about the detriment of isolation. The two would make a great double-feature, but if you want to jump on this one first, Hippo will be in select theaters November 8.  At any rate, after a night of minimal sleep due to staying out late at the Pink concert, I caught up with Mark Rapaport, and we had a fun chat about the movie. Check it out! Barbara: Why go black and white with this?  Mark: I've always loved classic movies, but I never thought I would make a movie in black and white until my cinematographer started taking photos of black and white, and I was like, “These are so cool and good, why don't more people shoot in black and white? Maybe we should do something like that.” He was very into that. When Finish the article on AICN",

Yet another public domain property being turned into a schlocky horror B-movie. Why?! The first promo trailer for a movie called Popeye the Slayer Man (ne Popeye the Sailor Man) has debuted online thanks to our pals at Bloody-Disgusting. A curious group of friends sneak into an abandoned spinach canning factory to film a documentary on the legend of the \"Sailor Man,\" who is said to haunt the factory and local docks. And he's not happy to have any visitors. So it's pretty much the same concept as the Mickey and other public domain character horrors. Popeye the Slayer Man stars Sean Michael Conway, Elena Juliano, Mabel Thomas, Marie-Louise Boisnier, Jeff Thomas, and Steven McCormack. And Jason Robert Stephens plays the titular role of the murderous Popeye. This looks dumb and bloody and gory and ridiculous - which is exactly what they were aiming for with this one.
