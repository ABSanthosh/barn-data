Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world. Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis.   Demis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents.    During a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called Theme Park. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence.   For the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"A movie rooted in small-town American rage.\" Yep it definitely seems like it. Decal Releasing has unveiled an official trailer for a psychological thriller film titled McVeigh, yes indeed about the notorious domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh. Not sure why we need this film right now? Or ever? McVeigh is directed by indie filmmaker Mike Ott, and it first premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival last year - it's next available to watch in March. A haunting psychological thriller based on one of America's most infamous figures. After the Waco siege, a chilling plan brews in the mind of army veteran Timothy McVeigh. What follows are the harrowing events leading up to the single deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history - the Oklahoma City federal building bombing in 1995. Starring Alfie Allen as Tim, Brett Gelman, Tracy Letts, Ashley Benson, and Anthony Carrigan. There was a movie just few years ago about the Unabomber titled Ted K. This looks especially unsettling but not sure that's the kind of feeling I want to have during a film nowadays.

    "description": "\"Would you say that my actions were justified?\" Vertigo Releasing has unveiled an official trailer for a film called Sew Torn, an intriguing crime comedy + psychological thriller with Run Lola Run-esque vibes. This first premiered at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival last year, and it also played at the Locarno, Sitges, and Camerimage Film Festivals. Eve Connolly stars as Barbara Duggen, a mobile seamstress, who gets tangled in her own thread after stealing a briefcase from a drug deal gone bad. In an escalating, frightening game of cat and mouse, her different choices lead her to drastically different outcomes along the way. The narrative presents the repercussions of all three of her decisions, and the deadly confrontations that result from each as she gets entangled with the case's owner. Using thread to free herself, Duggen stops at nothing to save her store. The film also stars Calum Worthy, John Lynch, K. Callan, Ron Cook, Thomas Douglas, Caroline Goodall, and Werner Biermeier. This is a Swiss co-production which is why it seems to have been filmed in Switzerland despite also being in English. Looks interesting, a clever concept for a crime film.
