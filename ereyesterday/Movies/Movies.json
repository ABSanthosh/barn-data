    "description": "McEric talks to director Greg Kohs and producer Gary Krieg about the new documentary THE THINKING GAME Read the full article on AICN It’s apparent that we’re living in the future, but how did we get here? Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world. Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis.   Demis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents.    During a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called Theme Park. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence.   For the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"Hayes attacks 'round the outside!!\" Warner Bros + Apple TV have revealed their 30-second TV spot for the Super Bowl promoting the movie F1 - the Formula One racing movie starring Brad Pitt as a famous driver. F1 is the thrilling new movie from Joe Kosinski (of Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, Top Gun: Maverick) arriving in theaters this June. The first teaser trailer debuted last summer a whole year before the scheduled release date. Now there's just five months to go until this is out in theaters 'round the world. F1 is about a legendary Formula One driver who, after a horrific crash years ago, comes out of retirement to mentor and team with a younger driver - played by Damson Idris. (That just sounds like Top Gun: Maverick again but with race cars.) F1 stars Brad Pitt as Sonny Hayes, with Idris, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, Javier Bardem, Sarah Niles, plus Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen, and the rest of the F1 drivers \u0026 team members as themselves. This footage is exciting! And it's starting to look and feel like the Wachowskis' Speed Racer, proving how ahead of its time it was. This is going to be a must see in […]",

    "description": "\"You're the demon of Shinjo!\" Netflix has debuted the full official trailer for a new live-action manga film called Demon City, ready to view streaming on Netflix later this month. It's based on the Japanese manga series Oni Goroshi by Masamichi Kawabe about a hitman out for revenge. \"Killing isn't enough when there's hell to pay.\" Demon City stars Toma Ikuta, who moved audiences to tears with his role in the Netflix series Beyond Goodbye. This time around, he plays the violent hitman Shuhei Sakata, who swears to avenge his beloved wife and daughter. Sakata fights an organization of strange masked criminals who control the city of Shinjo from the shadows. What awaits him is a truth that threatens to completely alter his destiny... This also stars Matsuya Onoe, Masahiro Higashide, Masanobu Takashima, Ami Touma, Taro Suruga, and Mio Tanaka. The manga is hyper violent and so is this film - this trailer doesn't hold back on featuring some of the extreme violence \u0026 gore as Sakata relentlessly battles these masked murderers.
