    "description": "A first look teaser trailer has debuted for the indie horror comedy film called Super Happy Fun Clown, the latest creation from indie genre filmmaker Patrick Rea (I Am Lisa, They Wait In The Dark, Shriek). It kind of sounds like a mashup between Joker and Falling Down (always worth a watch) featuring a woman this time who goes berserk and heads on a killing spree. To escape a life of oppressed obscurity, a battered former wunderkind weaponizes her obsession with clowning, serial killers, \u0026 classic movie monsters into a night of shocking infamy. Jennifer Seward stars as a woman who dresses up as \"Jenn-O the Clown\", who decides to let loose after realize her life is fading away. The film also features Dan Daly, Tim Shelburne, Nicole Hall, Matt Leisy, Deborah Madick, and Violet Rea. Thanks to Bloody Disgusting for the tip on this. Looks like it might turn out pretty badass - a brutal tale of vengeance from a pissed off clown. Even if it does seem like a Joker remix at least it should be a bit better than Joker 2 in the end. Check this out below. Here's the teaser (+ poster) for Patrick Rea's horror […]",

    "description": "\"You expect us to follow this hallucinating baboon?!\" Nah she's right. At D23 Brazil, Disney unveiled their third \u0026 final trailer for the Mufasa: The Lion King movie, from director Barry Jenkins (of Moonlight \u0026 If Beale Street Could Talk). The story about the rise of one of the greatest kings of the Pride Lands, returns to the African savanna where Rafiki tells Kiara about her grandfather. Told in flashbacks, we're introduced to Mufasa as an orphaned cub, lost \u0026 alone until he meets a sympathetic lion named Taka—the heir to a royal bloodline. The chance meeting sets in motion a lively journey of an extraordinary group of misfits searching for their destiny. This isn't so much The Lion King 2, more of a prequel + sequel combined. With the voices of Aaron Pierre as Mufasa and Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Taka, plus all the usuals: Seth Rogen as Pumbaa, Billy Eichner as Timon, and John Kani as Rafiki. With Tiffany Boone, Kagiso Lediga, Preston Nyman, Thandiwe Newton, Mads Mikkelsen, Anika Noni Rose, Keith David, and also Beyoncé Knowles-Carter as Nala, and introducing Blue Ivy Carter as Kiara, daughter of King Simba \u0026 Queen Nala. Nothing new to see here. […]",

Barbarella here to talk about dark comedy Hippo, or more accurately to share the conversation I had with Hippo’s director and writer Mark Rapaport. Genuinely funny, this incredible film has the potential to achieve cult status, so long as people take a chance on this black-and-white gem and actually see it. I recommend that they do. Hippo stars Kimball Farley, Lilla Kizlinger, Eliza Roberts, and Eric Roberts as the narrator. It tells the story of two exceptionally different teens being raised by their mother in a somewhat isolated existence. At times, it reminds me of Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, in the way that the children in Hippo are sheltered, while not in the same extreme way they were in the Greek film, both films make strong points about the detriment of isolation. The two would make a great double-feature, but if you want to jump on this one first, Hippo will be in select theaters November 8.  At any rate, after a night of minimal sleep due to staying out late at the Pink concert, I caught up with Mark Rapaport, and we had a fun chat about the movie. Check it out! Barbara: Why go black and white with this?  Mark: I've always loved classic movies, but I never thought I would make a movie in black and white until my cinematographer started taking photos of black and white, and I was like, “These are so cool and good, why don't more people shoot in black and white? Maybe we should do something like that.” He was very into that. When Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN ‘Tis the season, for a few more hours, before Mariah Carey breaks through her ice-cocoon and heralds in the winter holidays. If you need a couple of thrillers to hold back the tide of the inevitable, I’ve got you covered with a couple of brand new features released this very month: HOLD YOUR BREATH and DIE ALONE.   DIE ALONE stars Carrie-Anne Moss (THE MATRIX, “The Acolyte”), Frank Grillo (CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, ONE DAY AS A LION), Douglas Smith (HBO’s “Big Love”), and Kimberly-Sue Murray (Netflix’s “V-Wars”). The film is written and directed by Lowell Dean (WOLFCOP, SUPERGRID) and released by Quiver Distribution. After an outbreak turns the majority of the population into plant-based zombies, a young man (Smith) with amnesia searches for his lost love and stumbles across a rugged survivalist (Moss). Check out the trailer:     If you’re getting “The Last of Us” vibes, you’re on the right track. The film features some pretty great creature effects, apt desolation to sell the apocalypse, and a surprisingly original story. Moss is the star of the show, by far, and carries her scenes with a deadpan humor that keeps the heavy subject matter from swallowing the viewer in despair. The budget limitations are clear but the film that emerges is certainly a smart, fun ride that hits all the points of an apocalyptic thriller with a (predictable) plot twist and great performances.   I got the chance to chat with Carrie-Anne Moss about the production of the film, her bicycle-riding skills, and dream roles.
