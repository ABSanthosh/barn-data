    "description": "McEric reviews (new) releases RAGING MIDLIFE and AMERICAN DREAMER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a quick review of two (new) releases hitting the market this St. Patrick's Day Weekend, both of which I actually enjoyed. RAGING MIDLIFE First was RAGING MIDLIFE, a movie that was pitched to me as starring Paula Abdul (I'm a massive fan), Eddie Griffin (DOUBLE TAKE), Walter Koenig (STAR TREK), and Motch O. Mann, the world's foremost Macho Man Randy Savage impersonator. Yeah, I hear it, too. Luckily, I didn't read any further. I saw Paula Abdul's name and shouted \"I'm in!\" Going in to this film blind is the best way to see it. As I'm furnishing you with a review, however, I must speak further to the film. If you want to skip down to AMERICAN DREAMER and go in blind, I do suggest it. Otherwise, here we go. The film, written by Nic Costa and Rob Taylor, and directed by the latter, follows childhood friends Alex and Mark, now in their midlives (see that?) who are chasing their dragon - a purple tanktop once worn by their favorite wrestler, Raging Abe. Raging Abe is a Macho Man Randy Savage-type character who wears a stove pipe hat and chin beard and lives by five \"proclamations,\" all meant to help his young fans navigate life and walk as better people. The film opens with grainy footage of a talk show appearance (think Arsenio Hall) from Raging Abe and his handler, Mary Todd, played by Abdul. The action opens in the eighties with young Alex and Mark ringside Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Chats with BLOAT actors Malcolm Fuller and Sawyer Jones Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here to chat about feeling bloated. Wait that’s not right. I’m here to chat a bit about Bloat, which will be in Theaters, On Demand and On Digital March 7, 2025. It’s a new horror thriller in which Ben McKenzie (“Gotham,” “The O.C.”) plays Jack, a man stuck working while his family vacations in Japan. As if the FOMO isn’t bad enough, one of his sons starts behaving strangely after almost drowning, and his wife, played by Bojana Novakovic (Edge of Darkness, Drag Me to Hell), must grapple with everything essentially alone, while Jack grows increasingly frustrated with his inability to do anything more than bear witness and offer recommendations and theories.  Bloat proves to be pretty fun, generating some tension from the fact that poor Jack is stuck in front of a screen in another country, balancing work and family drama from afar. His sense of powerlessness and the increasing frustration that develops as he video-chats with his family and hears increasingly more unsettling news makes him relatable and really heightens the unease I feel while watching. While the final act doesn't engage me as much as the setup leading up to it, I enjoy enough of the concepts within the story that overall, I like the movie.  I got the opportunity to chat with the actors who play the two sons, Malcolm Fuller and Sawyer Jones. Check it out! Barbara: Would you guys tell me about the casting process. Did you get sent the script or did you have to audition? What was that like Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"Those boys, they're good boys. They're looking for Mother Earth...\" \"They don't know it.\" Mongrel Media has unveiled an official trailer for the Canadian indie film titled The Birds Who Fear Death, made by indie Indo-Canadian filmmaker Sanjay Patel. This originally premiered at the 2024 Calgary \u0026 Whistler Film Festivals in Canada last year, but never showed up down in the US. Two greedy brothers, disinherited and strapped for cash, venture into the Canadian wilderness in search of themselves, their heritage, and a long-lost fortune. They discover that their father has left his estate to the Indigenous people of a remote hamlet in Northern Alberta. Determined to claim their fortune, the brothers return to the community, only to find it devastated by a cancer crisis tied to industrial development––a venture their father had once championed as Chief. Starring Adam Beach \u0026 Simon Baker as the brothers Adam \u0026 Ryan, with Graham Greene, Caren Moore, and Tanaya Beatty. Reviews state that the film \"is a heartfelt and thought-provoking film about two brothers' emotional journey, exploring identity and cultural clashes.\" This looks really powerful. Here's the trailer (+ poster) for Sanjay Patel's film The Birds Who Fear Death, direct from YouTube: Adam […]",

    "description": "\"Needs to be heard big and loud.\" Sovereign Film in the UK has unveiled the trailer for a documentary film titled Desire: The Carl Craig Story, a biopic doc profiling the legendary techno producer, DJ and record label creator Carl Craig. This first premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival last year but it still doesn't have a US release set yet - only the UK. An intimate portrait of techno mastermind \u0026 DJ Carl Craig and an ode to his beloved city, Detroit. Raised in a middle class African American family, Carl's parents fostered his artistic pursuits, even if that meant breaking with their traditions. With Detroit's decline \u0026 recovery as a backdrop, the film follows the career of a musical pioneer whose genre-defying music has been performed around the world. 35 years into his music career, Carl Craig, a leading figure of the second generation of the Detroit techno artists, has now been embraced by the visual arts world, with recent exhibitions at MOCA in Los Angeles and Dia Beacon in New York. But at the pinnacle of his creative and deejaying success, the musician faces challenges that could force him to stay away from the dance floor. […]",
