    "description": "Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE Read the full article on AICN Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN",

Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie.  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter: Bless You.  Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.  Stuart: Thank you.   Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?  Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

    "description": "\"What happened here?\" RLJE Films has revealed a first look teaser for Ash, the next cinema project from acclaimed musician / filmmaker Flying Lotus. It's his latest feature since making the experimental Kuso film in 2017, along with a short film in the V/H/S/99 anthology. A woman wakes up on a distant planet and finds the crew of her space station viciously killed. Her investigation into what happened sets in motion a terrifying chain of events. Apparently this is less experimental and more \"contained\" than Kuso, with a full-on production budget. He shot it down in NZ: \"People go to New Zealand to shoot sci-fi and fantasy movies, so I was [working with] all these people who worked on The Lord of the Rings and other Peter Jackson and James Cameron stuff.\" Ash stars Eiza González, Aaron Paul, Iko Uwais, Kate Elliott, Beulah Koale, and Flying Lotus himself. Whoa this looks rad! Hell yes! My first impression is that it almost seems like a live-action version of Scavengers Reign, about a crew on this strange planet filled with mysterious entities... Here's the first look teaser trailer for Flying Lotus' sci-fi horror film Ash, direct from RLJE's YouTube: On the mysterious […]",

    "description": "\"We were attacked... I think my husband was infected.\" Universal has debuted the full official trailer for the new Wolf Man movie, arriving in theaters January 2025 early next year. The shorter teaser debuted just last month, but there's plenty more frightening footage to see here. Produced by Jason Blum \u0026 Blumhouse, this a fresh update on the classic Universal Monster originally invented with the 1941 film The Wolf Man. Most recently there was the 2010 remake called The Wolfman starring Benicio Del Toro (anyone remember it?) plus tons of other werewolf flicks. From Blumhouse and visionary writer-director Leigh Whannell, the creators of the chilling modern monster tale The Invisible Man, comes a terrifying new lupine nightmare: Wolf Man. The new tagline: \"What if someone you loved became something else?\" A man must save himself and his family when they are stalked, terrorized, and haunted by a deadly werewolf at night during a full moon. Christopher Abbott stars with Julia Garner, Sam Jaeger, Matilda Firth, Ben Prendergast, and Benedict Hardie. Don't expect a full reveal of the Wolf Man yet, that never happens this early.
