    "description": "McEric takes a look at some of the films screening at this year's Tribeca Film Festival in NYC from June 4th - 15th. Read the full article on AICN The Tribeca Film Festival is set to descend once again upon New York City this June 4th through 15th. Begun in 2002 by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff, the festival sought to revitalize Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks and has since become one of the premiere film festivals of North America. This year, alone, the programmers narrowed down their selections from over 13,000 submissions. This year's line-up boasts 95 world premieres from filmmakers across 36 countries, collecting everything from feature films to shorts, episodic content, audio storytelling, interactive games, and more.  I'll be on site for several days of the festival to screen films and speak with attending talent, so let's take a look at some of the selections that made my shortlist of interest: First off, the big trend this year is music documentaries - the festival has programmed at least fifteen music-based films, beginning with the opening night gala selection BILLY JOEL: AND SO IT GOES. The festivities will likely be more of a eulogy than a celebration due to recent developments, but it's still nice to kick off a definitively New York festival with one of the City's own beloved sons as the subject of its inaugural film. Other documentaries that feature prominently are METALLICA SAVED MY LIFE, BILLY IDOL SHOULD BE DEAD, BOY GEORGE 7 CULTURE CLUB, DEPECHE MODE: M, I WAS BORN THIS WAY: CARL BEAN, MOVE YA BODY: THE BIRTH OF HOUSE, and THE SIXTH BOROUGH. This final film made my shortlist as Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a review of the Furst Brothers' new horror/comedy A BREED APART, out now in theaters and on-demand. The film follows several Internet celebrities who are invited to an island overrun by rabid dogs to compete for a prize... survival. Check out the trailer: The film stars Grace Caroline Currey (SHAZAM: FURY OF THE GODS, FALL), Virginia Gardner (FALL, 2018's HALLOWEEN), Page Kennedy (THE MEG, THE MEG 2), Troy Gentile (ABC's \"The Goldbergs\"), Riele Downs (Nickelodeon's \"Henry Danger\"), Zak Steiner (Netflix's \"Jessica Jones\"),and Hayden Panittiere (NBC's \"Heroes\"). The film is directed by Griff Furst and brother Nathan Furst, whose previous collaboration as co-directors brought us NIGHTMARE SHARK. Solo, Griff Furst has directed such films as SWAMP SHARK, GHOST SHARK, and TRAILER PARK SHARK, so he clearly knows his way around a creature feature... even if he doesn't really want to. \"Who is Louie Myman?\" I asked when we spoke this past Friday. [Louie Myman is the credited director of Furst's films 100 MILLION BC and ALLIGATOR ALLEY.) \"Oh, Louie Myman! Do you know Alan Smithee?\" \"Yes.\" \"He's Alan Smithee's brother. Yeah, I mean, it's a tough thing. It's an interesting thing to explore. It's like when you do a creature feature and it rates well, and it does well, they just offer you more of them. And I love them, don't get me wrong. I grew up watching all these creature features - Mysterious Island and Jaws and Cujo. I love those movies, but I love ALL kinds of movies. The creature feature, itself, Finish the article on AICN",

This premiered at Beyond Fest last year and has played at other genre fests. Practical FX galore in this aliens vs men neon horror movie. Here's a description: \"Constantly high \u0026 drunk Jimmy gets a visit from some weird little grey men with big eyes \u0026 spiky needles. Joe Begos, writer, director and leading actor, brings pure madness to the screen. The brilliantly frenetic production keeps pace with Jimmy's increasing paranoia and the wacky, handmade bloody interludes splatter the screen with hectoliters of neon-colored alien slime.\" Starring Joe Begos and Matt Mercer – and tons of tiny grey aliens. This looks totally F'ing bonkers! In a good way! I'm so down for this. Exactly the kind of over-the-top ridiculous horror movie that's perfect to watch with a genre-loving crowd at midnight.

This initially premiered at Fantastic Fest last year and played at other genre fests - ready for a spectacular big D release in the US this summer. A well-endowed adult film star turned Kung Fu master is maniacally murdered by an evil villain in his destructive quest for power and male domination, leaving the students to avenge him and restore peace. While they try to save their relationship, Francis finds himself accused of the murder of his former rival Ti-Kong. Fleeing from the police, Francis falls into the clutches of a rogue surgeon, determined to defend male domination at any cost. His girlfriend Sonia then takes action to rescue Francis, save their relationship, and restore peace between the sexes. Starring Vanessa Guide, Franc Bruneau, Cyril Gueï, Xavier Lacaille, Rébecca Finet, Anaïde Rozam, and Thevada Dek as Ti-Kong. The real twist in this is that he gets endowed with a gigantic metal dick (it's HUGE!!), which becomes a big weapon that starts controlling him. Obviously mocking macho-ism \u0026 dicks.
