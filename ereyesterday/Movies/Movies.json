Read the full article on AICN Found footage horror. Do you love it? Do you hate it? Do you think it is its own genre or do you lump it in with its overarching tone - slasher, supernatural, monster, etc. Love it or hate it, the convention is here to stay, as it offers a realistic, relatable approach to horror that blurs the lines between reality, film, empathy, and voyeurism.   So, when I got an email asking if I wanted to screen the feature DEVON, written and directed by Jenni “JWoww” Farley, I said “of course I do!” My wife is a fan of “Jersey Shore” and has been since day one, so I mostly did it for her, but I was also very curious what the singular star would bring to the horror pantheon. The logline read:   Devon's parents never stopped searching for answers after her disappearance from a notorious asylum. Years after the incident, a mysterious website draws five adventurers to the abandoned asylum where she was last seen. Armed with cameras, they plunge into the darkness, unaware they’re filming their own descent into horror—never meant to return.     I got the chance to chat with writer/director/producer Jenni “JWoww” Farley about jumping into a feature-length film, the serendipitous location, and her crew.      Eric McClanahan: Hey, Jenni! How are you?   Jenni “JWoww” Farley: Good. Nervous.    EM: Nervous? Why are you nervous?   JJF: I feel like this is [me] kind of starting my career over. It’s a different world, a different element. I am a superfan of horror films; I have been since I Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "HIPPO'S Writer/Director Mark Rapaport Chats Video Games, Sex Talks, and Black-and-White Filmmaking Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends! Barbarella here to talk about dark comedy Hippo, or more accurately to share the conversation I had with Hippo’s director and writer Mark Rapaport. Genuinely funny, this incredible film has the potential to achieve cult status, so long as people take a chance on this black-and-white gem and actually see it. I recommend that they do. Hippo stars Kimball Farley, Lilla Kizlinger, Eliza Roberts, and Eric Roberts as the narrator. It tells the story of two exceptionally different teens being raised by their mother in a somewhat isolated existence. At times, it reminds me of Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, in the way that the children in Hippo are sheltered, while not in the same extreme way they were in the Greek film, both films make strong points about the detriment of isolation. The two would make a great double-feature, but if you want to jump on this one first, Hippo will be in select theaters November 8.  At any rate, after a night of minimal sleep due to staying out late at the Pink concert, I caught up with Mark Rapaport, and we had a fun chat about the movie. Check it out! Barbara: Why go black and white with this?  Mark: I've always loved classic movies, but I never thought I would make a movie in black and white until my cinematographer started taking photos of black and white, and I was like, “These are so cool and good, why don't more people shoot in black and white? Maybe we should do something like that.” He was very into that. When Finish the article on AICN",

Paradise is set in a serene, wealthy community inhabited by some of the world's most prominent individuals. But this tranquility explodes when a shocking murder of the President occurs and a high stakes investigation unfolds. Sterling K. Brown stars as Xavier Collins, head of White House Secret Service, who's quickly investigated for the death of the President, whom he discovers next to his bed. But there's much more going on within this communtiy... The series also stars James Marsden, Julianne Nicholson, Sarah Shahi, Nicole Brydon Bloom, Aliyah Mastin, and Percy Daggs IV. This looks like a fascinating conspiracy thriller with some intense twists \u0026 turns, especially with this trailer ending with her \"say yes\". Very interesting.

Netflix has unveiled an official trailer for a new comedy series called No Good Deed, made by TV creator Liz Feldman, also creator of the other series \"One Big Happy\" and \"Dead to Me\". It tells the story of three very different families vying to buy the very same 1920s Spanish style villa that they think will solve all their problems. Sounds like a very personal story turned into a comedy series. Netflix's No Good Deed is a series about the highs and lows of searching for a safe, happy home and just how far we're willing to go to protect ourselves and our loved ones in the process. Featuring Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano as a couple who list their \"gorgeous 1920s Spanish-style villa\" located in one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Los Angeles - and the real estate frenzy begins. Also stars Linda Cardellini, O-T Fagbenle, Abbi Jacobson, Denis Leary, Poppy Liu, Teyonah Parris, and Luke Wilson. Executive produced by Will Ferrell's Gloria Sanchez Productions.
