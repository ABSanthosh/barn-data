    "description": "Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren‚Äôs latest documentary¬†Freediver¬†is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov‚Äôs unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving‚Äôs impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.¬† Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like ‚ÄúHow long could I hold my breath?‚Äù - the answer is not long at all - or ‚ÄúWould I ever consider free diving?‚Äù The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with ‚ÄúHey, do you want to write about movies for a website?‚Äù Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I‚Äôll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences. ¬† This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I‚Äôd already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn‚Äôt be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

    "description": "\"Love is not to be blamed, people are. That's the miracle of life.\" Ain't that the truth! üíî Don't blame love for everyone's craziness ‚Äì it's just them. Netflix has revealed the first look teaser trailer for a new streaming series called Lovers Anonymous, about the kooky guy who runs a Love Hospital in Turkey. This isn't a reality series nor is it a schmaltzy Hallmark romantic comedy, thankfully. From the footage in this teaser, it looks like something along the lines of The Lobster or Fingernails or Equals. Cem, scarred by a childhood that crushed his trust in love, runs the \"Love Hospital\" (to cure those suffering from the \"love disease\") ‚Äì until Hazal, who believes in the power of love, disrupts his life. Will they both change each other? Will Cem learn to appreciate the power of love? This stars Halit Ergenc, Funda Eryiƒüit, Rƒ±za Kocaoƒülu, Zerrin Ni≈üancƒ±, Selcuk Borak, ƒ∞dil Fƒ±rat, Ceren Benderlioƒülu, \u0026 Seda Akman.
