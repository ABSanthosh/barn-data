    "description": "\"This ship collected five different life-forms from the darkest corners of the universe... Each one a unique, deadly species.\" FX has revealed two more promo spots for Alien Day celebrating their upcoming series Alien: Earth. Everyone knows that April 26th (4/26) is Alien Day, in honor of the planet LV-426 from the original 1979 movie. When a mysterious space vessel crash-lands, a young woman (Sydney Chandler) and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet's greatest threat. This is set in 2120 when \"five corporations - Prodigy, Weyland-Yutani, Lynch, Dynamic and Threshold - wield the power of nations, and proprietary advancements in technology provide the promise of a new tomorrow.\" Uh oh. Created \u0026 directed by Noah Hawley. The cast includes Alex Lawther, Timothy Olyphant, Essie Davis, Samuel Blenkin, Babou Ceesay, David Rysdahl, Adrian Edmondson, Adarsh Gourav, Moe Bar-El \u0026 others. The first teaser talks about the alien species being brought back, and the second (disgusting) teaser is a 3-minute long VFX video showing a xenomorph forming in gestation. So gross. Hoping they'll announce the final release date for this soon - most likely at the end of the summer. Here's [‚Ä¶]",

Originally from North Carolina, almost everyone knows Dale Earnhardt - he was a famous racecar driver for 26 years, from the 80s all the way through the 90s until his fatal crash in 2001 (at age 49).

Of course, everyone also now knows his son, Dale Earnhardt Jr., who also set NASCAR records \u0026 retired in 2017.

    "description": "McEric cleans up his inbox by dumping reviews for NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, RENNER, MOB COPS, and YOUNG WERTHER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all!¬† I've got some reviews of two films releasing this Friday, April 25th - but thought I'd also take this opportunity to highlight two other films that are already out there but I haven't yet found the time to cover. Hopefully there's something here for everyone, so let's get right to it: First up is NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, starring Jack Quaid (NOVOCAINE, THE COMPANION, \"The Boys\"), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (\"The Boys,\" \"The Walking Dead\"), and Malin Ackerman (WATCHMEN, SLAYERS), directed by Duncan Skiles (THE CLOVEHITCH KILLER) and written by Sean Farley. The film features troubled young man Simon McNally (Quaid), who is trying to find his feet after spending a decade in a facility for mental health treatment, and his paranoid ex-security guard neighbor Ed Deerman. The two form an unlikely partnership when Simon believes he's seen a woman kidnapped but is deemed an unreliable witness by police due to his history and behavior. The two men take it upon themselves to investigate the crime and rescue the woman, revealing a deeper web of villainy in their quiet town. Quaid and Morgan have great chemistry, and Quaid, specifically, does some great work in this film. Whereas the majority of his characters have been able to rely and charm and humor, Simon is stripped of these tools due to the abuse he received at a young age, so the tricks that Quaid would normally utilize to endear himself to audiences are out of reach. Quaid does a great job of humanizing McNally as a Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives‚Äô HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn‚Äôt good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It‚Äôs a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can‚Äôt walk away. I‚Äôve got to know if and how they‚Äôll pull it off. I think that‚Äôs universal. That said, this is not a good caper.¬† ¬† The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their ‚ÄúI dos,‚Äù attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film‚Äôs entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",
