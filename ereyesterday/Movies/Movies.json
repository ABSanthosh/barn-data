    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"The gendarmes on it.\" \"Humans are useless.\" Kino Lorber has finally revealed an official US trailer for The Empire, the strange French sci-fi film from filmmaker Bruno Dumont. After first being unveiled in 2023 and premiering in early 2024, it's only now getting a US release starting in March 2025 - it already opened in Europe last year and didn't do very well. We also posted the first French trailer for this way back in 2023. Dumont's sci-fi The Empire (called L'Empire in French) is set in a quiet fishing village on the Opal Coast in Northern France, and tells the story of a child who's apparently so unique \u0026 peculiar it unleashes a secret war between extraterrestrial forces of good \u0026 evil. Starring a very French cast including Virginie Efira, Lily-Rose Depp, Camille Cottin, Lyna Khoudri, Anamaria Vartolomei, \u0026 Fabrice Luchini. This received quite a few negative and mixed reviews, apparently it's a bit too kooky and uneven to be a hidden gem. But I gotta say the sci-fi side of this still seems amusing and entertaining – even if it doesn't all work.

    "description": "\"Why can't we just celebrate together?\" Prime Video has debuted a third and final fun trailer for the goofy comedy You're Cordially Invited, an ensemble wedding bash created and directed by filmmaker Nick Stoller (of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him to the Greek, The Five-Year Engagement, Neighbors 1 \u0026 2, Bros). Streaming to watch later this week if anyone wants to drop in on the fun and join the parties (either one!). You're Cordially Invited follows a woman who is planning her sister's wedding, as well as the father of another bride-to-be. They discover that they are double-booked for their fancy destination wedding, so both parties decide to share the venue, but chaos and disaster await, of course. Will Ferrell and Reese Witherspoon star as the feuding hosts, with a fun cast including Geraldine Viswanathan, Meredith Hagner, Wesley Mann, Jimmy Tatro, Celia Weston, Leanne Morgan, Rory Scovel, and Keyla Monterroso Mejia. This is actually the best trailer yet - saving the best for last! Though I'm not sure why they didn't release this actually-funny trailer any earlier. It finally has plenty of legitimately amusing jokes. Here's the third \u0026 final trailer for Nicholas Stoller's You're Cordially Invited, direct from YouTube: […]",
