    "description": "Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE Read the full article on AICN Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN",

Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie.  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter: Bless You.  Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.  Stuart: Thank you.   Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?  Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

They had a panel at New York Comic-Con which is where this trailer is from. It's expected to arrive sometime in 2025, as there's no release or festival premiere set yet - but this first look does hype it up. \"Young People meet Outlaw Bikers meet feral Twin Psycho-killers in a notorious abandoned water park.\" Terror Twins LLC is making the film, which is described as an homage to horror cult classics like Evil Dead 2, Friday the 13th, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, etc. Also inspired by the infamous Action Park water park in New Jersey (profiled in this doc Class Action Park) that was actually very dangerous. Traction Park Massacre stars Kai Thomas Schulz, Bodhi Schulz, and Helene Henry, plus many others. The soundtrack features classic metal tracks, a score by Testament's Alex Skolnick, and a theme song \"Traction Park Massacre (Don't Cry For Me)\" by Brooklyn metal band Das Moöse.

This the kind of marketing I dig! Anora just opened in US theaters last weekend and will be expanding to more cities soon - and some special locations will be showing it in 35mm. This video features Letterboxd's host Flynn Slicker interviewing filmmaker Baker while he visits FotoKem, a famous film processing house based in Burbank (originally founded in 1963!). Anora was also shot on 35mm using Arricam LT cameras, processed into a digital negative by Kodak Film Lab. It's nice to see them going back and letting it screen on film in at least a few theaters. Of course, Brady Corbet's The Brutalist will also be getting a full-on 35mm \u0026 70mm film release coming up in December this fall.
