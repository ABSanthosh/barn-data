    "description": "Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

    "description": "\"It's great to see you back, Mr. Gilmore...\" Hey look – a Christmas surprise! Adam Sandler dropped this 30-second teaser on social media today - to begin building the hype for a sequel to one of his most beloved movies. Happy Gilmore 2 is coming to Netflix in 2025 – 29 years after the original comedy hit theaters back in 1996. Happy Gilmore is considered one of the funniest sports comedies ever made, and one of Adam Sandler's best movies in his filmography. As part of his Netflix deal, they figured out the rights (the original movie is owned by Universal Pictures) and have already shot the sequel - bringing back his co-stars Julie Bowen \u0026 Christopher McDonald. The cast in this next one also includes Benito Martínez Ocasio aka Bad Bunny, Margaret Qualley, Ben Stiller, Benny Safdie, Travis Kelce, and Nick Swardson. No plot details have been revealed yet – but it looks like his bitter rivalry on the golf course will continue on. Perhaps he'll team up with Shooter McGavin this time to take on some other young hotshot? Only time will tell. This teaser has barely any footage – just a quick glimpse before we head into […]",
