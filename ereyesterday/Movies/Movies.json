    "description": "Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

    "description": "\"What's best for business?\" \"Give the audience what they deserve!\" An impressive first look teaser trailer has debuted for a film called Queen of the Ring, about one of the pioneering women wrestlers in the early days of wrestling. This premiered at the 2024 Buffalo Film Festival a few months ago and has been touring around festivals this fall, with a release set for March 2025. This is the true story of Mildred Burke, the first ever million dollar female athlete and champion pro-wrestler who pioneered the sport in a time when all girl wrestling was banned in most of America. Emily Bett Rickards stars in this as Mildred - a small town single mother who embraces the danger to change culture as she dominates America's most masculine sport to become the first million dollar female athlete in history. The ensemble cast includes Josh Lucas, Francesca Eastwood, Tyler Posey, Marie Avgeropoulos, Adam Demos, Kelli Berglund, Damaris Lewis, and many others. So far so good – this looks like a legit fun time and a properly inspirational story. Here's the first teaser trailer for Ash Avildsen's film Queen of the Ring, direct from YouTube: Based on the true story of Mildred […]",

Netflix has revealed the trailer for a documentary film called Don't Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever, focusing on the maniac who is trying to \"live forever.\" Yet another doc about a hot topic from the news recently. How far would you go to live forever - or even just slow down the aging process? This new doc by filmmaker Chris Smith (also of Fyre, 100 Foot Wave, Sr., Bitconned, Wham!, Operation Varsity Blues, Jim \u0026 Andy) is told through intimate access to Bryan Johnson, a man who has dedicated his life to defy aging. Don't Die the doc examines the strange wellness practices one man is using to maintain youth \u0026 vitality, and the effect this journey has on himself \u0026 those around him. For the record I think this guy is totally nuts - he is just a performative narcissist who thinks he can crack the aging problem, rather than accepting the limits of life itself. This trailer makes it seem like it will glorify him, but I'm sure it'll also show those critical of him, too. Official trailer for Chris Smith's doc Don't […]",
