    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

    "description": "\"The boy is out of the box.\" 📦 You've never seen anything like this film before! A hilarious new short film is finally online after playing at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival last year. Meat Puppet is a hilarious comedy short film created by a British-Greek filmmaker named Eros V. The film won the Audience Award at SXSW and played at a bunch of other festivals and is now online to watch. It's a knock out! On the day he promised his girlfriend he'd grow up, a man-child inadvertently traps himself inside a puppet. How will he get back to his old fleshy meat bag self?! Meat Puppet stars David Jonsson (the super talented young actor seen in Alien: Romulus and Rye Lane) along with Máiréad Tyers and Gregg Chilingirian. This concept is crazy to begin with, but it's executed in just the right way to be super funny and exceptionally awkward, which is not easy to pull off. The puppet is also real - created and puppeted by Hugh Purves. Just click on play below. Thanks to Short of the Week for the tip on this funny short landing online.

    "description": "\"We can't choose when to be great. We can only hope to be great when it counts.\" Prime Video has debuted one more official trailer for the sports movie Unstoppable, telling the inspiring true story of one-legged wrestler Anthony Robles. This premiered at the 2024 Toronto Film Festival last fall, and it'll be ready for streaming on Prime Video in a more few weeks this January. Starring Jharrel Jerome (seen in Moonlight, \"When They See Us\", \"I'm a Virgo\") as Anthony Robles in another outstanding performance - one of my fave actors. Unstoppable is both an irresistible sports drama and a family story full of heart. In wrestling and the locker room, he has to convince his two tough coaches (Michael Peña and Don Cheadle) that his grit and potential are real. At home, he contends with an outspoken and loving mother going through some growing up of her own. Along with Jerome, the cast includes Bobby Cannavale, Michael Peña, the real Anthony Robles, Don Cheadle, and Jennifer Lopez as his mother. This looks generic but also properly inspiring.
