    "description": "Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

    "description": "\"What if it's a trap?\" Indeed what if it is? Marvel has revealed another new 60-second promo trailer for the MCU sequel Captain America: Brave New World - hitting theaters February 14th, 2025 in exactly two months. Almost time! From director Julius Onah comes the next Captain America evolution – Anthony Mackie stars as Sam Wilson, who has taken over as the new Cap from Steve Rogers after he retired at the end of the Avengers movies. Brave New World picks up with Harrison Ford as the US president, with the power dynamics in the world changing (a meta reference for sure). After an attack, Cap is asked to join the military - but he ends up in the middle of another international incident. The conspiracy noir side of this is the best part – but they're downplaying it now. The impressive cast includes Giancarlo Esposito, Danny Ramirez as a young Falcon, Carl Lumbly, Tim Blake Nelson as The Leader, Shira Haas, Liv Tyler, Xosha Roquemore; plus an appearance by a Red Hulk, played by Harrison Ford. This looks like it might be entertaining, but it also seems like yet another generic Marvel movie and that's not so exciting anymore. […]",

    "description": "\"It's now or never.\" MGM + Orion have unveiled the second \u0026 final trailer for the film Nickel Boys, which has started playing in select US theaters now. This film is a modern masterpiece and will be on my Top 10 of the year, along with many others. Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel from Colson Whitehead, Nickel Boys chronicles the powerful friendship between two African American men navigating the harrowing trials of reform school together in Florida. Nickel Boys stars Ethan Herisse as Elwood, Brandon Wilson as Turner, Hamish Linklater, Fred Hechinger, Daveed Diggs, \u0026 Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor. It's presented mainly from the POV of the two main characters, which gives it an especially distinct look and feel. Reviews add: \"By the time the credits roll, Ross will have made a lasting \u0026 unique impression of heartbreak on the souls of all who watch his film—precisely the cinematic treatment that Whitehead's novel required.\" I had a chance to watch this film and it's exceptional - it is so powerful, a vibrant story of friendship and tenacity. The cinematography is astounding, it really does invent a new cinema language with everything it shows on this journey of these two young […]",
