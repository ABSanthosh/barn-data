    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric reviews (new) releases RAGING MIDLIFE and AMERICAN DREAMER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a quick review of two (new) releases hitting the market this St. Patrick's Day Weekend, both of which I actually enjoyed. RAGING MIDLIFE First was RAGING MIDLIFE, a movie that was pitched to me as starring Paula Abdul (I'm a massive fan), Eddie Griffin (DOUBLE TAKE), Walter Koenig (STAR TREK), and Motch O. Mann, the world's foremost Macho Man Randy Savage impersonator. Yeah, I hear it, too. Luckily, I didn't read any further. I saw Paula Abdul's name and shouted \"I'm in!\" Going in to this film blind is the best way to see it. As I'm furnishing you with a review, however, I must speak further to the film. If you want to skip down to AMERICAN DREAMER and go in blind, I do suggest it. Otherwise, here we go. The film, written by Nic Costa and Rob Taylor, and directed by the latter, follows childhood friends Alex and Mark, now in their midlives (see that?) who are chasing their dragon - a purple tanktop once worn by their favorite wrestler, Raging Abe. Raging Abe is a Macho Man Randy Savage-type character who wears a stove pipe hat and chin beard and lives by five \"proclamations,\" all meant to help his young fans navigate life and walk as better people. The film opens with grainy footage of a talk show appearance (think Arsenio Hall) from Raging Abe and his handler, Mary Todd, played by Abdul. The action opens in the eighties with young Alex and Mark ringside Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"He wanted people to see who he was as Paul.\" HBO has revealed the trailer for Pee-wee as Himself, a two-part documentary presentation coming to Max this May. \"For the first time, meet the man behind the character.\" Starring Paul Reubens, about Paul Reubens, featuring Paul Reubens, in the definitive life story film examining Paul Reubens (and his iconic character Pee-wee Herman). The doc starts out revisiting Reubens' childhood and his desire to be an actor, inspired by the iconic TV shows like \"Howdy Doody,\" \"Captain Kangaroo,\" and \"I Love Lucy.\" Subsuming himself into the character of Pee-wee, Reubens hides his personal life, and recognizes too late that fame makes for a complicated companion... Later, Reubens talks candidly about his fame as a pop culture icon and the lows he endured as he faced rumors, vilification, and the vitriol of the media. With guests including Abby Rubenfeld, Gary Panter Wayne White, Natasha Lyonne, John Moody, S. Epatha Merkerson, Laurence Fishburne, Debi Mazar, David Arquette, Judd Apatow, and many others. The doc originally premiered at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. This looks fascinating - I think it's time we really give Paul Reubens a reappraisal. I'm sold on […]",

    "description": "\"She's not who I thought she was...! She's a total badass secret agent.\" Magenta Light Studios (a brand new distributor in town) has revealed the first official trailer for Bride Hard, a totally ridiculous action comedy arriving in theaters nationwide in June this summer movie season. A very cheesy concept mashup - take a spy comedy and wrap up with a wedding comedy about a maid of honor who also happens to be an assassin, and here we go. Also looks similar to JLo's Shotgun Wedding last year. It's directed by action movie veteran Simon West (of Con-Air, The Mechanic, Wild Card, Old Guy, etc). This summer – you are invited to one unforgettable wedding. \"Grab your bride or die.\" When a mercenary group takes a lavish wedding hostage, they have no idea what they are in for as the Maid of Honor is actually a secret agent ready to rain hell-fire upon anyone who dares to ruin her best friend's wedding. Rebel Wilson stars with Anna Camp, Anna Chlumsky, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Gigi Zumbado, Stephen Dorff, and Justin Hartley. This looks entirely absurd in every way, but that's the kind of \"kick back and have fun\" entertainment they're going […]",
