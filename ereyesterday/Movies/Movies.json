    "description": "If high school is a popularity contest — the mistaken-priorities assumption that drives writer-director Amy Wang’s SXSW-winning assimilation satire “Slanted” — then Chinese American senior Joan Huang (Shirley Chen) could be justified in ditching her heritage for a shot at being crowned prom queen. That’s the devil’s bargain Wang entertains in a provocative comedy-cum-thought-experiment that […]",

    "description": "Barbarella Chats with BLOAT actors Malcolm Fuller and Sawyer Jones Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here to chat about feeling bloated. Wait that’s not right. I’m here to chat a bit about Bloat, which will be in Theaters, On Demand and On Digital March 7, 2025. It’s a new horror thriller in which Ben McKenzie (“Gotham,” “The O.C.”) plays Jack, a man stuck working while his family vacations in Japan. As if the FOMO isn’t bad enough, one of his sons starts behaving strangely after almost drowning, and his wife, played by Bojana Novakovic (Edge of Darkness, Drag Me to Hell), must grapple with everything essentially alone, while Jack grows increasingly frustrated with his inability to do anything more than bear witness and offer recommendations and theories.  Bloat proves to be pretty fun, generating some tension from the fact that poor Jack is stuck in front of a screen in another country, balancing work and family drama from afar. His sense of powerlessness and the increasing frustration that develops as he video-chats with his family and hears increasingly more unsettling news makes him relatable and really heightens the unease I feel while watching. While the final act doesn't engage me as much as the setup leading up to it, I enjoy enough of the concepts within the story that overall, I like the movie.  I got the opportunity to chat with the actors who play the two sons, Malcolm Fuller and Sawyer Jones. Check it out! Barbara: Would you guys tell me about the casting process. Did you get sent the script or did you have to audition? What was that like Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Director Simon West and star Lucy Liu talk OLD GUY, starring Christoph Waltz, now streaming everywhere! Read the full article on AICN Director Simon West should be a household name; his first film was a little picture from 1997 called CON AIR. Perhaps you've heard of it? He went on to helm similar big budget action extravaganzas, such as 2001's LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER and 2012's THE EXPENDABLES 2. Eventually, however, time and changing tastes caught up with West, and now he's directing smaller budget flicks, from action to drama, that move at a slightly slower pace and appeal to a different audience.  The same could be said for Danny Dolinski, the titular OLD GUY of West's latest feature, played by Academy-Award Winner Christoph Waltz (INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, THE GREEN HORNET). Danny's a wetworks expert in a field saturated with hot young assassins, desperately trying to prove he's still relevant, often to his detriment. After recovering from a wrist injury that found him relegated to a cleaner role at a local bakery, Danny is itching to get back in the field. When he's told the only role available is support for young assassing Wihlborg (Cooper Hoffman), he is understandably unenthused. He invites his longtime friend Anata (Lucy Liu) along for their job since it'll take them to some charming locations around Europe, and once underway, tries to take point on every hit. Things don't go as planned. As you can probably already divine, there are so many parallels between Waltz's OLD GUY and West's career. Danny was once the best, the biggest game in town, and his name still opens doors... but the game has Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"Needs to be heard big and loud.\" Sovereign Film in the UK has unveiled the trailer for a documentary film titled Desire: The Carl Craig Story, a biopic doc profiling the legendary techno producer, DJ and record label creator Carl Craig. This first premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival last year but it still doesn't have a US release set yet - only the UK. An intimate portrait of techno mastermind \u0026 DJ Carl Craig and an ode to his beloved city, Detroit. Raised in a middle class African American family, Carl's parents fostered his artistic pursuits, even if that meant breaking with their traditions. With Detroit's decline \u0026 recovery as a backdrop, the film follows the career of a musical pioneer whose genre-defying music has been performed around the world. 35 years into his music career, Carl Craig, a leading figure of the second generation of the Detroit techno artists, has now been embraced by the visual arts world, with recent exhibitions at MOCA in Los Angeles and Dia Beacon in New York. But at the pinnacle of his creative and deejaying success, the musician faces challenges that could force him to stay away from the dance floor. […]",

    "description": "💎 Cineart has revealed the first trailer for a crazy trippy, avant garde film from France titled Reflection in a Dead Diamond, the latest from filmmaking duo Hélène Cattet \u0026 Bruno Forzani. This recently premiered at the 2025 Berlin Film Festival in the Main Competition. It's the latest from the filmmakers who also made The Strange Color of Your Body's Tears and Let the Corpses Tan, for anyone into wacky, abstract cinema. Filmed on the Côte d’Azur in France, a retired spy suspects his former adversaries have resurfaced when his intriguing neighbor vanishes. It's a peculiar, twisted, heady film featuring all kinds of things going on - mysterious women clad in all black leather, diamond thieves, lots of beautiful shots of the Mediterranean, a woman brandishing a very nice sword, and much more. Starring Fabio Testi, Yannick Renier, Koen De Bouw, Maria de Medeiros, and Thi Mai. There's no dialogue in this trailer so no worries, it's all about the visuals anyway. Is this a classic case of art house style over substance or is there something more here? Reviews explain it's not about the story, it's \"an homage to and a deconstruction of genre, layering its self-reflexive and meta-textual […]",
