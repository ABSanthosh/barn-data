Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world. Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis.   Demis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents.    During a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called Theme Park. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence.   For the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"It's a very deep and complex film, but I want that diarrhea explosion in the trailer.\" Gross! Apple TV has debuted a funny new TV spot for their upcoming series arriving in March called The Studio. This wacky series is one big riff on Hollywood, making fun of movie studios and the egotistical executives who work at these places. The series follows a legacy Hollywood movie studio striving to survive in a world increasingly difficult for art \u0026 business to thrive together. \"The job is a meat grinder.\" Ain't that the truth. Seth Rogen stars as Matt Remick, who takes over Continental Studios. Desperate for the approval of celebrities, he \u0026 his team of executives at Continental must juggle corporate demands with creative ambitions as they try to keep movies alive and relevant. The Studio cast includes Catherine O'Hara, Kathryn Hahn, Ike Barinholtz, Chase Sui Wonders, with Bryan Cranston, Keyla Monterroso Mejia, and Dewayne Perkins. This new promo spot also features cameos from Johnny Knoxville and Josh Hutcherson (in a fake dumb zombie movie called Duhpocalypse).

Now it's time to present our annual Best of the Fest list from the 2025 selection. I was able to catch a total of 54 films this year (my full list on Letterboxd), half of them at screenings in Park City \u0026 Salt Lake City, the other half virtual previews at home (cuddling with doggies on the couch). This was my 19th year attending \u0026 covering Sundance, and this fest still has a special place in my heart. I'm always glad to be back up there, watching films all day, every day, in the snow. I am presenting my final list of my 10 favorite films - a mix of documentaries and narrative features. All 10 are top notch, and I highly recommend catching them on the big screen ASAP. Watching all of these with an entranced audience really makes a difference. I also recorded a podcast talking about many of the Sundance films (good and bad).
