    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

Bleecker Street has revealed an official trailer for the indie sci-fi romance creation titled Love Me. This initially premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival last year to mixed reactions - I'm a big fan of the film, or at least what it's trying to say and teach us about identity. Long after humanity's extinction, a buoy and a satellite inherit the Earth, and with only the internet as their guide, learn what it means to be alive and in love. In this first feature from Sam \u0026 Andy Zuchero, Love Me explores AI and identity through live-action, animatronics, and classic animation in an epic tale of connection and transformation. \"We wanted to make a movie that would make you feel big and small at the same time... It's the story of two completely new beings — the A.I. in two machines — who evolve into virtual avatars and then into flesh \u0026 blood humans.\" Starring Kristen Stewart as the buoy and Steven Yeun as the satellite.

Where – even – are you?!\" 🍄 Adult Swim has debuted a funky second trailer for the psychedelic \u0026 crazy new animated series called Common Side Effects, arriving for streaming in February 2025 in just one month. The series first premiered at the Annecy Film Festival and was also unveiled at SDCC last year - available to watch soon. It's sort of a follow-up to incredible animated sci-fi series Scavengers Reign (on Netflix now) as one of the makers of that also helped co-create this. The show follows two high school friends, Marshall and Frances, who reconnect and discover a new kind of drug (\"a rare mushroom\") that can allegedly cure all disease. BUt they also uncover a conspiracy involving big pharma and the government to suppress all knowledge of said drug. With the voices of Dave King, Emily Pendergast, Joseph Lee Anderson, Martha Kelly, and the legendary Mike Judge as a shitty pharma CEO. This is a much better trailer than the other one last year - more hallucinogenic and fascinating and exciting. It's all about taking down big pharma but – does this shroom really work?
