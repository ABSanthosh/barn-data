    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

(aka the Burden of Black Genius), which is premiering at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. It's one of the first big opening night films screening tomorrow (Thursday) on the very first day of Sundance 2025. Questlove's latest music history doc is an examination of the life and legacy of Sly \u0026 The Family Stone — the groundbreaking band led by the charismatic and enigmatic Sly Stone — captures the band's rise, reign, and subsequent fadeout while also shedding light on the unseen burden that comes with success for Black artists in America. Drawing from his own personal experience and relationships, Questlove tells an empathetic human story about the cost of genius, reframing the way we all engage with pop culture. Sundance says the film is \"a revelatory journey born from a deep understanding of the band’s far-reaching influence and impact\" featuring an \"incredible soundtrack, exuberant archival footage, thought-provoking discussions with family, band members, scholars, and musicians.\" Yep this sounds great - I'm in.

    "description": "\"She's just a kid who doesn't have anyone.\" Roadside Attractions has debuted the official trailer for an indie film called Bob Trevino Likes It, made by indie filmmaker Tracie Laymon. This first premiered at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival last year, and it also played at Seattle, Melbourne, Newport Beach, Nashville, Mill Valley, and Denver Film Festivals, and many others. Bob Trevino Likes It is inspired by the true friendship that writer-director Tracie Laymon found with a stranger when looking for her father online. Often playing the role of caretaker to people like her father who should be caring for her, Lily Trevino longs for a familial connection, having been abandoned by her mother as a child, then suddenly by her father in her 20s. When she accidentally befriends a stranger online who also shares the same name as her own self-centered father, encouragement and support from this new Bob Trevino could change her life. Starring Barbie Ferreira, John Leguizamo, French Stewart, Lauren \"Lolo\" Spencer, \u0026 Rachel Bay Jones. This looks really lovely and wholesome and uplifting - Leguizamo seems to be bringing so much charm \u0026 warmth to his role. Here's the official trailer for Tracie Laymon's indie film […]",
