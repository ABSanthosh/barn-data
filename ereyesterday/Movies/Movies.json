    "description": "\"I will destroy you! I am Tornado! Remember my name.\" üå™ We will remember! IFC Films has unveiled an official trailer for an indie revenge thriller called Tornado, not to be confused with the dangerous weather phenomenon. This UK film premiered at the 2025 Glasgow Film Festival in Scotland earlier this year, and it will be out in theaters starting in May this summer. A Japanese puppeteer's daughter gets caught up with a group of violent criminals when their show crosses paths with a crime gang, led by Sugarman and his son Little Sugar. When her father's puppet Samurai show is ambushed by this notorious gang, Tornado vows to seek vengeance and forge her own destiny by stealing the gang's ill-gotten gold. Starring Japanese model / actress K√¥ki (aka Mitsuki Kimura) as leading lady Tornado, along with Tim Roth, Takehiro Hira, Jack Lowden, Douglas Russell, Rory McCann, and Alex Macqueen. Okay this looks legitimately badass - another killer vengeance tale. I hope she slays them all! Kick their ass, Tornado. Check out the trailer below. Here's the official US trailer (+ two posters) for John Maclean's film Tornado, direct from YouTube: Set in the rugged landscape of 1790s Britain, Tornado [‚Ä¶]",

Not to be confused with the Peter Berg's '07 action film also titled The Kingdom. This first premiered last year at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival in Un Certain Regard, and it will debut in art house US theaters starting in May this summer. A must see if it's playing anywhere near you. The feature debut of director Julien Colonna, The Kingdom is a story of blood: blood split, blood sought, and the blood which binds us.

An underworld war erupts, leading to more death and a chase where father and daughter bond as they try to make sense of this world.

McEric here with a quick review of two (new) releases hitting the market this St. Patrick's Day Weekend, both of which I actually enjoyed. RAGING MIDLIFE First was RAGING MIDLIFE, a movie that was pitched to me as starring Paula Abdul (I'm a massive fan), Eddie Griffin (DOUBLE TAKE), Walter Koenig (STAR TREK), and Motch O. Mann, the world's foremost Macho Man Randy Savage impersonator. Yeah, I hear it, too. Luckily, I didn't read any further. I saw Paula Abdul's name and shouted \"I'm in!\" Going in to this film blind is the best way to see it. As I'm furnishing you with a review, however, I must speak further to the film. If you want to skip down to AMERICAN DREAMER and go in blind, I do suggest it. Otherwise, here we go. The film, written by Nic Costa and Rob Taylor, and directed by the latter, follows childhood friends Alex and Mark, now in their midlives (see that?) who are chasing their dragon - a purple tanktop once worn by their favorite wrestler, Raging Abe. Raging Abe is a Macho Man Randy Savage-type character who wears a stove pipe hat and chin beard and lives by five \"proclamations,\" all meant to help his young fans navigate life and walk as better people. The film opens with grainy footage of a talk show appearance (think Arsenio Hall) from Raging Abe and his handler, Mary Todd, played by Abdul. The action opens in the eighties with young Alex and Mark ringside Finish the article on AICN",
