    "description": "Barbarella Declares BRING HER BACK is an Intense Depiction of the Effects of Grief Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here still reeling from the incredibly intense Australian horror flick Bring Her Back, which comes out on May 30th. Not for the weak of heart, this follow-up from the minds behind Talk to Me grips one’s innards early on and doesn’t let go for the entire duration.  While themes of grief and the different ways individuals cope with loss may not be uncommon in cinema, Bring Her Back approaches the concept in a truly unique fashion through the individuals involved and the manner in which their stories are told.  Sora Wong debuts as the young Piper. Giving a powerhouse performance, she proves that a face doesn’t have to be recognizable to bring the awesomeness. While Piper may be the nucleus of the story, it’s not just her, but also those around her, who drive the points, like nails, into your soul.  I’ll start with Sally Hawkins, whom you may recognize from The Shape of Water. Her portrayal of the adoptive parent is nothing short of exceptional. Nuanced when necessary, flat out psycho when required, she navigates the extremes and subtleties like a master.  While I could ramble about Sally Hawkins more, let’s move on to Jonah Wren Phillips. He’s incredible as the creepy kid, but it’s in those moments where we glimpse his humanity that this young talent shines. I should warn you, though, if he’s onscreen, the odds of you feeling uncomfortable increase 85%. Owning the most disturbing scenes, he can be hard to watch at times. In fact, when Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric takes a look at some of the films screening at this year's Tribeca Film Festival in NYC from June 4th - 15th. Read the full article on AICN The Tribeca Film Festival is set to descend once again upon New York City this June 4th through 15th. Begun in 2002 by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff, the festival sought to revitalize Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks and has since become one of the premiere film festivals of North America. This year, alone, the programmers narrowed down their selections from over 13,000 submissions. This year's line-up boasts 95 world premieres from filmmakers across 36 countries, collecting everything from feature films to shorts, episodic content, audio storytelling, interactive games, and more.  I'll be on site for several days of the festival to screen films and speak with attending talent, so let's take a look at some of the selections that made my shortlist of interest: First off, the big trend this year is music documentaries - the festival has programmed at least fifteen music-based films, beginning with the opening night gala selection BILLY JOEL: AND SO IT GOES. The festivities will likely be more of a eulogy than a celebration due to recent developments, but it's still nice to kick off a definitively New York festival with one of the City's own beloved sons as the subject of its inaugural film. Other documentaries that feature prominently are METALLICA SAVED MY LIFE, BILLY IDOL SHOULD BE DEAD, BOY GEORGE 7 CULTURE CLUB, DEPECHE MODE: M, I WAS BORN THIS WAY: CARL BEAN, MOVE YA BODY: THE BIRTH OF HOUSE, and THE SIXTH BOROUGH. This final film made my shortlist as Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Roaaaar!! GKids Films has unveiled a brand new teaser trailer for the 4K remastered re-release of the other Japanese Gojira movie recently known as Shin Godzilla. This one originally debuted in 2016, opening in Japan and US the same year, also under the original title Godzilla: Resurgence. It was the first big Japanese reboot of Godzilla in a long time, and it was handed to iconic filmmakers Hideaki Anno \u0026 Shinji Higuchi (who later went on to direct Shin Ultraman \u0026 Bullet Train Explosion) to re-imagine. So they gave us this strange, new, gilled lizard creature instead of the typical Gojira kaiju – it wasn't exactly a big hit in the US. After the immense success of Godzilla Minus One, GKids got their hands on a new 4K remaster and will give it another shot. With a re-release in US theaters this August. \"Something has surfaced in Tokyo Bay...\" As the Prime Minister pleads with the public to remain calm, a horrific creature of tremendous size makes landfall in the city, leaving death and destruction in its wake. Then it evolves. Starring Hiroki Hasegawa, Yutaka Takenouchi, Satomi Ishihara. I remember watching this back in 2016 and being let down by […]",

Anarchy Pictures has revealed an official trailer for Satoshi: The Movie, a new Bitcoin-inspired movie about the creation of the (in)famous cryptocurrency and its anonymous Japanese inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Yes this is so cheesy because it's meant to be a first look teaser \u0026 pitch video for this movie which is pretty much made by Bitcoin fans for Bitcoin fans. \"Freedom comes with a price\" is the tagline which is a standard way of claiming that cryptocurrency is \"free\" from all government currency. Whatever. Satoshi is a scripted mystery-thriller from Anarchy Pictures exploring Bitcoin’s untold origin — not through speculation, but through story. Starring Casper Van Dien as Hal Finney, and Peter Shinkoda as Satoshi Nakamoto, directed by indie filmmaker Shaun Piccinino. \"Satoshi reframes the question from who is Satoshi to why was Bitcoin born — honoring the freedom-first ethos at its core.\" Okay sure but this doesn't look like it's going to be a very exciting movie. Pretty dull footage so far. Stay tuned for more updates as this isn't expected to debut until 2026 anyway. 🤑 Here's the first teaser trailer […]",
