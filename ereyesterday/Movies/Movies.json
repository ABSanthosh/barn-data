    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

    "description": "\"If you work with us, we'll let you off the hook.\" Prime Video in Japan has revealed a trailer for Broken Rage, a unique Takeshi Kitano film ready for release on streaming in the next few months. This initially premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival as a special selection following his 3-hour long film Kubi the year before. Broken Rage follows a hitman, Nezumi (played by Beat Talkeshi), fighting for his survival when he’s caught between the police and yakuza. But in the second half, the gritty crime-action thriller takes an unexpected turn, evolving into a self-parodying comedy that retells the same story with a very humorous touch. A two-part film. This first half is a gritty action film in a dark criminal underworld revolving around a hitman and his struggle for survival. Aside from Takeshi Kitano, this also stars Tadanobu Asano and Nao Ômori. I watched this in Venice last year and it's hilarious - I had a blast with it. The second half is full-on Three Stooges-esque slapstick comedy making fun of these yakuza thrillers and action films and how dumb it really is to portray in a film. And of course, Takeshi-san rocks this funny role […]",

This first premiered at FrightFest Glasgow last year - and is out on VOD in February if anyone wants to give it a look. Meredith, her husband Jared, and their young son Alex face unspeakable terror in the wake of a family tragedy. The tagline: \"A mother's love never dies.\" Struggling with postnatal depression \u0026 feeling misunderstood by her husband, Meredith begins to experience terrifying visions foreshadowing an ultimate tragedy - ending up stuck in a nightmarish loop ruled by a malevolent force. Mom stars Emily Hampshire as Meredith, the titular \"Mom\" in this story, with François Arnaud, Christian Convery, Tristan D. Lalla, Cat Lemieux, and Erika Rosenbaum. This looks creepy but it also looks like another seriously underlit, uninteresting, fairly boring horror film that'll be forgotten quickly. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Adam O'Brien's horror film Mom, direct from YouTube: Meredith (Emily Hampshire), a grieving mother, is left utterly alone after the devastating death of her newborn son shatters her world.
