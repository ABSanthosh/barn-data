    "description": "McEric cleans up his inbox by dumping reviews for NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, RENNER, MOB COPS, and YOUNG WERTHER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all!  I've got some reviews of two films releasing this Friday, April 25th - but thought I'd also take this opportunity to highlight two other films that are already out there but I haven't yet found the time to cover. Hopefully there's something here for everyone, so let's get right to it: First up is NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, starring Jack Quaid (NOVOCAINE, THE COMPANION, \"The Boys\"), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (\"The Boys,\" \"The Walking Dead\"), and Malin Ackerman (WATCHMEN, SLAYERS), directed by Duncan Skiles (THE CLOVEHITCH KILLER) and written by Sean Farley. The film features troubled young man Simon McNally (Quaid), who is trying to find his feet after spending a decade in a facility for mental health treatment, and his paranoid ex-security guard neighbor Ed Deerman. The two form an unlikely partnership when Simon believes he's seen a woman kidnapped but is deemed an unreliable witness by police due to his history and behavior. The two men take it upon themselves to investigate the crime and rescue the woman, revealing a deeper web of villainy in their quiet town. Quaid and Morgan have great chemistry, and Quaid, specifically, does some great work in this film. Whereas the majority of his characters have been able to rely and charm and humor, Simon is stripped of these tools due to the abuse he received at a young age, so the tricks that Quaid would normally utilize to endear himself to audiences are out of reach. Quaid does a great job of humanizing McNally as a Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"Making it to the top is not worth your life. It's just... not worth it.\" Blue Harbor Ent. has revealed a teaser trailer for an intriguing new horror film called The Sound, made by filmmaker Brendan Devane. Has there been a rock climbing horror movie before (not counting Cliffhanger which is action)? A group of climbers embarks on a dangerous climb that has been off-limits for years. What begins as an audacious expedition transforms into a battle for survival against a force that toys with them. During their ascent, they come face to face with a malevolent force that quickly turns their expedition into a harrowing battle for survival. This poster hints at the supernatural force hanging over the rock wall. And they even have some rock music, too. Actor William Fichtner is in the cast with Marc Hills, Jocelyn Hudon, David Clennon, Christina Kirkman, plus special guests Kyle Gass and real climber Alex Honnold. Gotta say, I'm kinda intrigued by this - at least the climbing will be real and not bad Hollywood fake. Check out the quick first look below. Here's the first look teaser trailer (+ poster) for Brendan Devane's film The Sound, from YouTube: In terrifying […]",

    "description": "\"It seems like you had a lot to get over today.\" Indeed. Netflix has unveiled an official trailer for the crime thriller titled Straw, the latest Tyler Perry film created for streaming on Netflix as part of his deal with the film studio. This will be out in June - his second film this year following Duplicity for Prime Video a few months ago. In Straw, Taraji P. Henson a single mother who watches her desperate day spiral into chaos. Sounds like that title is a reference to the idiom about \"the last straw.\" She becomes the prime suspect in a crime she never meant to commit—suddenly, her survival depends on the one thing she’s never been able to trust: the people around her. \"She finds herself in a horrible situation where one of those days, you wake up and everything that could go wrong, goes wrong.\" The film also stars Sherri Shepherd, Teyana Taylor, Sinbad, Rockmond Dunbar, Ashley Versher, Mike Merrill, and Glynn Turman. This doesn't seem like Tyler Perry's typical thrillers, I just hope he wrote her a good way out of this bank robbery predicament.
