Read the full article on AICN In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

Read the full article on AICN Everything about film has changed, and while some lambast this brave new world, it does have its silver linings. Streaming services took over channels and then became their own studios. For every Netflix dud there's a great horror film championed by SHUDDER, Bloody Disgusting, or Fangoria that would go otherwise unproduced. SHUDDER, specifically, has been picking up amazing films, from last year's LATE NIGHT WITH THE DEVIL to this year's IN A VIOLENT NATURE. The studio is ending the year strong with a meta take on the coming-of-age slasher rom-com called BLOODY AXE WOUND, releasing in limited theaters before landing on the streamer in early 2025. The synopsis is as follows: Abbie Bladecut (Sari Arambulo, \"A.P. Bio\") is a teenager torn between the macabre traditions of her family’s bloody trade and the tender stirrings of her first crush (Molly Brown, \"Dexter: Original Sin\"). In the small town of Clover Falls, Abbie’s father, Roger Bladecut (Billy Burke, TWILIGHT), has built an infamous legacy by capturing real-life killings on tape and selling them to eager customers, but as Abbie delves deeper into the grisly family business, she begins to wonder if it’s time to take the family tradition in a new direction.  The conceit of the film is surprisingly fresh in a genre that finds new ways to reinvent itself with shocking regularity. Set within the confines of a horror film, we see what it might be like to grow up in a family where the patriarch is a serial killer/slasher who rises from the grave Finish the article on AICN",

One of them that debuted just days before the New Year arrives is this one created by a filmmaker / editor known as Clementine Narcisse who often just goes by simply \"Clementine\". Her 2024 in Film video is a ravishing, refreshing, amusing roundup of some of her favorite films from this year. I'm delighted to see her include a bunch of under-the-radar picks that aren't mentioned as much as they should by others - terriific films such as Monkey Man, Problemista, Blink Twice, Bird, The Outrun, Cuckoo, Saturday Night, The Last Showgirl, Love Lies Bleeding, Oddity, The Shadow Strays.

Artist James Chapman, based in Leeds, UK, has just published his Top 10 Films of 2024 list on Instagram - by drawing an adorable little illustration for each \u0026 every favorite film. I've been an avid follower of Chapman for a few years already (we also posted his illustrations for 2022 and for 2023) and I am a big fan of his artistic style. He draws and colors images in a little notepad and includes the pens \u0026 markers in the shot every time. They make me smile every time. Each image is so clever. Many of these films are my faves, too (Conclave and Dune: Part Two and Sing Sing and Anora are also in my Top 10). Many critics put La Chimera on their list this year due to a late release (it was my #1 last year). This year he posted only 10 picks, and I've included all 10 images below.
