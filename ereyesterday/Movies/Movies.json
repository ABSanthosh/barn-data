    "description": "Scott Adkins talks with McEric about his new action film, DIABLO Read the full article on AICN If you’re a fan of current action films then you likely know the name Scott Adkins. He’s either kicked the ass of or had his ass kicked by every action star of the last five decades: Dolph Lundgren, Jackie Chan, Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, and even Keanu Reeves. That’s right - he was the big guy with the grill in JOHN WICK CHAPTER 4.  Scott’s newest film is DIABLO, which hits theaters and on demand this Friday, June 13th. Conceived alongside action compatriot Marko Zaror, the film takes place in Colombia following Adkins as Kris, a former convict, who seeks to make good on a promise to a fallen friend, which runs him afoul of Zaror’s mercenary, El Corvo. This film isn’t just another straight-to-streaming no-budget piece of content - DIABLO delivers on every front. The fight scenes, choreographed by Zaror, are intense and deftly photographed, thanks to director Ernesto Diaz Espinoza. The gunplay is intense, the acting is top tier, and the film never lags.    Marko Zaror steals his scenes as El Corvo, a mercenary with an iron fist, literally. The six-foot-two Chilean action star has a chilling villain introduction, followed by a massive action scene in a sketchy hideout that plays out like a scene from TERMINATOR. He mows through assailants and bystanders alike with no emotion, only showing a hint of fear when Adkins’s Kris shows up to give him a real fight. El Corvo is fucking terrifying. Their final confrontation is a throwback to Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Declares BRING HER BACK is an Intense Depiction of the Effects of Grief Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here still reeling from the incredibly intense Australian horror flick Bring Her Back, which comes out on May 30th. Not for the weak of heart, this follow-up from the minds behind Talk to Me grips one’s innards early on and doesn’t let go for the entire duration.  While themes of grief and the different ways individuals cope with loss may not be uncommon in cinema, Bring Her Back approaches the concept in a truly unique fashion through the individuals involved and the manner in which their stories are told.  Sora Wong debuts as the young Piper. Giving a powerhouse performance, she proves that a face doesn’t have to be recognizable to bring the awesomeness. While Piper may be the nucleus of the story, it’s not just her, but also those around her, who drive the points, like nails, into your soul.  I’ll start with Sally Hawkins, whom you may recognize from The Shape of Water. Her portrayal of the adoptive parent is nothing short of exceptional. Nuanced when necessary, flat out psycho when required, she navigates the extremes and subtleties like a master.  While I could ramble about Sally Hawkins more, let’s move on to Jonah Wren Phillips. He’s incredible as the creepy kid, but it’s in those moments where we glimpse his humanity that this young talent shines. I should warn you, though, if he’s onscreen, the odds of you feeling uncomfortable increase 85%. Owning the most disturbing scenes, he can be hard to watch at times. In fact, when Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"The Sandman can make your dreams come true!\" Netflix has revealed a first look teaser trailer for a new animated movie arriving this year titled In Your Dreams, another new take on a \"what if dreams came to life\" concept. We already have Pixar's Dream Productions series on Disney+ (and the Slumberland movie), and this is coming soon to Netflix this fall. In Your Dreams is a comedy adventure about Stevie and her brother Elliot who journey into the absurd landscape of their own dreams. If the siblings can withstand a snarky stuffed giraffe, zombie breakfast foods, and the queen of nightmares, the Sandman will grant them their ultimate dream come true...the perfect family. \"What if your dreams could become reality?\" This was just unveiled with a preview at the Annecy Film Festival in France. The voice cast features Jolie Hoang-Rappaport, Elias Janssen, Craig Robinson, Simu Liu, Cristin Milioti, Omid Djalili, Gia Carides, SungWon Cho, Zachary Noah Piser. Featuring music by John Debney. And with animation from Kuku Studios \u0026 Sony's Imageworks. This looks super fun and weird and wacky! As a movie about dreams should.

    "link": "https://www.firstshowing.net/2025/official-trailer-for-rage-hbo-series-about-5-women-on-the-edge/",
    "description": "\"You young people suck!\" HBO has revealed the official US trailer for the Spanish series Rage, premiering on Max for streaming starting in July this summer. Originally known as Furia, this will premiere in Spain on the exact same day, too. Five women face extreme situations like extortion, oppression, \u0026 manipulation. Their conflicts all intertwine, triggering a butterfly effect, ultimately leading to a shared catharsis. Rage, a series of eight 30-minute episodes, is created and directed by Félix Sabroso. The new series brings together five iconic actresses on screen together for the first time: Carmen Machi, Candela Peña, Cecilia Roth, Nathalie Poza, and Pilar Castro. These five women go to the limit and perpetrate revenge, but not even they are spared in this contemporary satire. Additional cast also includes Claudia Salas, Alberto San Juan, Ana Torrent, Claudia Roset, Mima Riera, Pedro Casablanc, Marilu Marini, Iván Pellicer, Francesc Garrido, Martxelo Rubio and Pepón Nieto, among others. This series looks very clever and entertaining, a spunky \u0026 satirical take on everything wrong with the world right now and how it treats women. Check this out below. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Félix Sabroso's series Rage, direct from HBO's YouTube: […]",
