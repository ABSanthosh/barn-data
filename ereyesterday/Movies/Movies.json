He’s a country traditionalist whose music bears virtually no signs of having been touched by contemporary influences. He’s also a non-raconteur who does fewer interviews than Beyonce, […]",

    "description": "SORRY BABY Thoughtfully Explores Trauma's Aftermath Read the full article on AICN Hey friends. Barbarella here after being enthralled with Sorry, Baby, a thoughtfully told story about the enduring effects of trauma. In theaters now, Eva Victor’s film proves both sensitive and candid. Although violence lies at the center of everything, it avoids showing any potentially triggering sequences. During the pivotal event that takes place within a house, the camera remains outside holding a static shot on the domicile’s façade. The viewer could only imagine what occurs behind the door. The stillness of the scene provides a stark contrast to the savagery we envision happening within. This masterful decision makes the scene more powerful as we must sit with the knowledge and gravity of what we suspect occurs inside. This quiet restraint characterizes much of the film, distinguishing it from other cinematic explorations of trauma. Much of the film proves artfully still as Agnes (Eva Victor) grapples with her life in the aftermath of the aforementioned event. While the topic is serious, it’s not an unrelenting, heavy film. Rather, it’s injected with humor and care throughout. The tale reveals the deep impact a moment in time could have on a life’s trajectory, and it shows the resilience of survivors as they struggle to find meaning, humor, and connection in the aftermath.   Sorry, Baby relies heavily on its brilliant cast who draw out the intricacies of each moment. Naomi Ackie and Eva Victor do most of the heavy lifting, carrying the emotional heart of the film, and I can’t get enough of either. Naomi imbues Lydie Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Hercules loves Superman 2025 Read the full article on AICN Superman 2025 FAQ I am – Hercules!! What’s it called? “Superman.” Who’s responsible? James Gunn, writer and director of the wonderful “The Suicide Squad” (the one with Idris Elba and John Cena, not the one with Will Smith) and all three excellent “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies. Is it any good? Like much of Gunn’s prior work, it’s funny and moving and exciting, and never boring. There’s plenty to nitpick, but you’d be a fool to miss this very entertaining entertainment. What says Warner Bros.? “Superman embarks on a journey to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing as Clark Kent.” How does it start? As John Williams’ Superman theme plays, a lot of text catches us up on what happened: 300 years ago superhumans became public knowledge on Earth, 30 years ago an alien spacecraft crashed into Kansas, 3 years ago a new superhuman arrived in Metropolis, 3 weeks ago a superhuman interfered in a middle-eastern conflict, 3 hours ago another new superhuman, one billing himself as The Hammer of Borovia, arrived in Metropolis, and 3 minutes ago Superman loses a brawl for the first time ever.* Then we see what a lot of fans have already seen in that famous clip: a bloodied and beaten Superman crash-lands in a field of snow, then summons Krypto to take him home.

The Regular is a Clerks-inspired riff following employees working at a movie theater - set and filmed entirely in the beloved independent cinema known as The Prince Charles Cinema. The PCC is a famous repertory theater located located in Leicester Place, just north of Leicester Square in the City of Westminster, London (see Google Maps). The Regulars follows a day in the life of its hapless employees. During their shift they watch movies, argue with customers, and, above all, deal with each other.

This crazy brutal cannibal horror is being dumped on VOD in the summer - starting in August next month. Four kayakers take the wrong river into hell. Will they escape? A jungle kayak adventure descends into terror when a group of friends becomes the target of a merciless, bloodthirsty tribe of cannibals. This stars Joseph Millson, Louis James, Ella Starbuck, Sarah Alexandra Marks, and David Wayman. More horror filmmakers keep trying to make cannibal horror movies, but none of them will ever live up to the intensity of Apocalypto or brutality of The Green Inferno. This looks like another generic cannibal tribe thriller without much of anything new to offer. Here's the official trailer (+ posters) for Howard J.
