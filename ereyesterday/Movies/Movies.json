    "description": "Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE Read the full article on AICN Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN",

Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie.  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter: Bless You.  Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.  Stuart: Thank you.   Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?  Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

This crime series comes from Spain and it already debuted streaming in Spain and Mexico a year ago. Apple just caught up with it now and will send it streaming in the US on Apple TV+ soon. An armed robbery takes place on the bus line that connects the airport with several cities near Barcelona. The result? The three dead robbers, a wanted person, and six witnesses can't identify the fugitive. Why won't they talk? As they navigate a world where perception often trumps reality, this thriller shines a spotlight on the importance of truth in today's society and the lengths people will go to protect their own version of it. Starring Ana Polvorosa, Michelle Jenner, Pablo Molinero, and José Manuel Poga. These kind of twisty crime and murder, who-did-it / why, series are pretty popular in the US, too.

And I can't do anything to stop it.\" Warner Bros has revealed the full trailer for the final half of the animated adaptation of the celebrated Watchmen graphic novel. Watchmen: Chapter 2 is set to debut in November. Back in 2009, Zack Snyder adapted the graphic novel into an epic 3 hour long movie. Which was extended into the \"Ultimate Cut\", including animated segments of \"Tales of the Black Freighter\" from the original book. There was also a Motion Comic version in 2009. Then came the \"Watchmen\" series on HBO in 2019, a re-invention from Damon Lindelof (which was terrific). Now, WB is adapting the entire book again (written by Alan Moore, illustrated by Dave Gibbons) once again. It's a direct from-page-to-screen retelling of this dark \u0026 complex story about a group of superheroes with too much power. Voices of Titus Welliver as Rorschach, Rick D.
