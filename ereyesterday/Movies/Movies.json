    "description": "McEric cleans up his inbox by dumping reviews for NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, RENNER, MOB COPS, and YOUNG WERTHER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all!  I've got some reviews of two films releasing this Friday, April 25th - but thought I'd also take this opportunity to highlight two other films that are already out there but I haven't yet found the time to cover. Hopefully there's something here for everyone, so let's get right to it: First up is NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, starring Jack Quaid (NOVOCAINE, THE COMPANION, \"The Boys\"), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (\"The Boys,\" \"The Walking Dead\"), and Malin Ackerman (WATCHMEN, SLAYERS), directed by Duncan Skiles (THE CLOVEHITCH KILLER) and written by Sean Farley. The film features troubled young man Simon McNally (Quaid), who is trying to find his feet after spending a decade in a facility for mental health treatment, and his paranoid ex-security guard neighbor Ed Deerman. The two form an unlikely partnership when Simon believes he's seen a woman kidnapped but is deemed an unreliable witness by police due to his history and behavior. The two men take it upon themselves to investigate the crime and rescue the woman, revealing a deeper web of villainy in their quiet town. Quaid and Morgan have great chemistry, and Quaid, specifically, does some great work in this film. Whereas the majority of his characters have been able to rely and charm and humor, Simon is stripped of these tools due to the abuse he received at a young age, so the tricks that Quaid would normally utilize to endear himself to audiences are out of reach. Quaid does a great job of humanizing McNally as a Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"I decide who lives and who dies!\" You do? Uncork'd Entertainment has revealed an official trailer for a sci-fi action thriller movie called Primal Games, being dumped on VOD this May in a few weeks. The entirely uninteresting title is already an indication this won't be worth your time - and the trailer below will confirm that. \"Primal Games is a relentless, high-concept survival thriller with strong performances, brutal action, and a unique edge.\" A newlywed couple heads on the honeymoon of their dreams, only to become unwitting participants in a sadistic vacation experience. Trapped in a deadly game designed for the thrill-seeking elite, they must fight for survival and uncover the shocking truth about their existence before it's too late. In a world where nothing is as it seems, primal instincts are their only hope. It's a generic action movie with a sci-fi twist, I guess, though it just reminds me of Ready or Not. Primal Games stars Hannaj Bang Bendz, John Love, and Gary Kasper, featuring practical stunts, martial arts action, and high-intensity set pieces. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for David Ryan Keith's film Primal Games, direct from YouTube: From the producers of Army of One, […]",

IMAX just posted a few videos highlighting the massive success of Ryan Coogler's Sinners and the spectacular experiencing of watching it in IMAX. Sinners is currently playing strong in its second week of release – everyone is flipping out watching this movie and telling everyone else to go see it. Thanks to the success, IMAX announced that they are giving away collectible filmtrips of few frames of 70mm film for anyone going back to watch Sinners (again) in IMAX during its second week. I want one! Earlier this month we also posted the video created by Kodak \u0026 Ryan Coogler where he discuses the various aspect ratios, film formats, and many other projection details for the movie's big screen release. All of these videos have done more to push people to actually go watch this movie in theaters than any of the actual trailers and marketing from Warner Bros. In this video, we also get to spend time with DP Autumn Durald Arkapaw as they get a closer look at filmstrips and check out some prints at IMAX's HQ in Los Angeles. Basically a big […]",
