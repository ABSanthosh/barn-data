    "description": "\"We need to make sure he doesn't make it into the top 50.\" Giant Pictures has unveiled the official trailer for an indie martial arts action thriller film titled Absolute Dominion, the latest feature made by Punisher: War Zone director Lexi Alexander. This will be out on VOD in May to watch. It's sort of a modern reboot of Bloodsport or Mortal Kombat, set in the near future involving a grand tournament. In 2063, desperate for a solution to save humanity from a global holy war on religions, the world's governing bodies establish a fierce, no-holds-barred martial-arts tournament to determine a champion whose faith will govern humanity and restore peace for the future. Created by an internet personality (played by Patton) the event is called The Battle Of Absolute Dominion. All qualifying belief systems will send one representative to compete, the last fighter standing wins Absolute Dominion for one faith. Can you guess which one is going to win from the trailer? The film stars Désiré Mia as fighter Sagan Bruno, Andy Allo, Mario D'Leon, Alex Winter, Olunike Adeliyi, and Patton Oswalt. With fight coordination from Phil Tan (known for Bloodsport 2, Martial Law, Showdown in Little Tokyo, Lethal Weapon […]",

    "description": "\"Is there any need for good? It's unnecessary.\" Arrow Video is releasing this violent action thriller film from Kazakhstan on Blu-ray soon. Steppenwolf is one of the latest creations from the prolific Khazak filmmaker named Adilkhan Yerzhanov, also known for The Gentle Indifference of the World, A Dark Dark Man, Yellow Cat, and Goliath previously. This new one played at the some genre festivals last year and picked up a bunch of awards during the 2024 Brussels Fantastic Film Festival last year. A brutal story of an unlikely duo who will stop at nothing to find what they are looking for, Adilkhan Yerzhanov's Steppenwolf movie is \"a nihilistic, hyper-violent redemption tale filled with social commentary\". Tamara searches for her missing son in a violent town. She hires a morally questionable ex-cop detective to find him. His methods are cruel but she is determined to find her son whatever the cost. Starring Anna Starchenko and Berik Aitzhanov as the duo. Described in reviews as \"sadistic, bleak, tedious, yet darkly humorous.\" Definitely not for most people, that's for sure. The disc release also includes Yerzhanov's 2022 film Goliath, available for the very first time. This looks extremely brutal and sadistic, yet somehow […]",
