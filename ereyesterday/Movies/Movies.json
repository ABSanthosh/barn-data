Shudder has unveiled an official trailer for an indie horror comedy film called Dark Match, which will be streaming on Shudder at the end of this month. It first premiered at the 2024 Fantasia Film Festival last year, and also played at FrightFest and Fantasy Filmfest. A group of small-time wrestlers find out just how real wrestling can get when they become guests of honor at a match held by Satanists in a small community. This wrestling horror comedy pits small-time wrestling company against a town of crazy people. With an ensemble cast led by the living legend Chris Jericho, Dark Match is heading direct to streaming on Shudder to view. The indie flick stars Sara Canning, Steven Ogg, Michael Eklund, Ayisha Issa, + Chris Jericho, among others. It looks especially fun if you're a pro-wrestling fan and horror fan finally waiting to see these two worlds mashed up.

    "description": "\"What's the point of pampering myself at my age?\" Cohen Media Group has unveiled an official US trailer for an indie French film called Rose, which is finally getting a US release this winter. It originally premiered way back in 2021 at the Locarno Film Festival where it won an award - but hasn't even been released in the last 4 years. It most recently played at as the Closing Night Film at Lincoln Center's New York Jewish Film Festival. Directed by musician and actress Aurélie Saada, this is her feature directorial debut. When Rose, 78, loses her husband, her grief inspires her to live as fully as possible and go out and pamper herself again. Her children disapprove, forcing them all to confront what it means to redefine oneself later in life. The film is described as being similar to Thelma or Driving Madeleine - they're \"emotionally moving and powerful, filled with laughter, tears and smiles throughout.\" This stars Françoise Fabian as the titular Rose, with Aure Atika, Grégory Montel, Damien Chapelle, Mehdi Nebbou, and Pascal Elbé. Get a look below. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Aurélie Saada's film Rose, direct from CMG's YouTube: Starring Award […]",

    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.
