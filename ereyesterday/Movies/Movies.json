    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric reviews (new) releases RAGING MIDLIFE and AMERICAN DREAMER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a quick review of two (new) releases hitting the market this St. Patrick's Day Weekend, both of which I actually enjoyed. RAGING MIDLIFE First was RAGING MIDLIFE, a movie that was pitched to me as starring Paula Abdul (I'm a massive fan), Eddie Griffin (DOUBLE TAKE), Walter Koenig (STAR TREK), and Motch O. Mann, the world's foremost Macho Man Randy Savage impersonator. Yeah, I hear it, too. Luckily, I didn't read any further. I saw Paula Abdul's name and shouted \"I'm in!\" Going in to this film blind is the best way to see it. As I'm furnishing you with a review, however, I must speak further to the film. If you want to skip down to AMERICAN DREAMER and go in blind, I do suggest it. Otherwise, here we go. The film, written by Nic Costa and Rob Taylor, and directed by the latter, follows childhood friends Alex and Mark, now in their midlives (see that?) who are chasing their dragon - a purple tanktop once worn by their favorite wrestler, Raging Abe. Raging Abe is a Macho Man Randy Savage-type character who wears a stove pipe hat and chin beard and lives by five \"proclamations,\" all meant to help his young fans navigate life and walk as better people. The film opens with grainy footage of a talk show appearance (think Arsenio Hall) from Raging Abe and his handler, Mary Todd, played by Abdul. The action opens in the eighties with young Alex and Mark ringside Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"I am retiring.\" Or are you? Ha ha. This extra cute and amusing animated short film is created by a group of students at the famous Gobelins animation school in Paris. Miyazaki is a 60-second animated short film tribute to maestro Hayao Miyazaki, the iconic filmmaker / animator / storyteller. It is about how he said he was retiring then just sits there not doing anything, so he comes back to work again. Always more stories to tell! Of course! Miyazak-san first announced his retirement in 2013, then Studio Ghibli said they were shutting down in 2014. A decade later he returned to work and went on to make The Boy and The Heron, which won the Oscar last year. There's also rumors that he's already working on another movie that he wants to make, so he's pretty much never retiring. Which is what this fun little short film is about! Made by 8 students at the acclaimed Gobelins School Paris. It's so darn cute seeing anything with Miyazaki-san in it! Thanks to Polygon for the tip on this animated short debuting online.

    "description": "\"This is inside people's homes - stay the hell out!\" Privacy is always important! Prime Video has revealed the official trailer for a docu series titled Spy High, available for streaming in April in a few weeks. It recently premiered at SXSW 2025 where it won an Audience Award in the TV Premieres section. This unsettling doc examines the latest era of surveillance and monitoring tech implementation at schools around the nation. A teen's life is upended when his school accuses him of dealing drugs using a photo from his bedroom taken by the computer they gave him. His family's lawsuit reveals a shocking scandal that sparks FBI involvement and raises alarming questions about student privacy. Spy High is a 4-part series that explores the story of 15-year-old Blake Robbins, who filed a lawsuit claiming that his prestigious public school was spying on him. Beneath this juicy suburban scandal lie more troubling revelations, with implications in a larger war over digital privacy being waged in schools today. Scary stuff! This is pretty creepy!
