    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"You think you're gonna wake up from a nightmare – but it ain't no nightmare, it's real.\" Lionsgate has revealed an official trailer for an indie horror thriller movie called Bloat, made by filmmaker Pablo Absento who is based in Tokyo, Japan. Ready for release in March including on VOD, though we haven't seen this show up at any festivals before. The film follows a mother and two sons vacationing in Japan. Their younger son almost drowns in a lake, and soon after the accident, the parents realize that something is wrong with their boy. From a producer of Searching and Unfriended, Ben McKenzie and Bojana Novakovic star in this chilling tale of horror and suspense. The boy's family is horrified to discover he has become possessed by a legendary demon from the depths of the lake. As the family races against time to save the boy's soul, the evil monster tears the family apart as it seeks to destroy anything in its path. Also with Malcolm Fuller, Sawyer Jones, and Kane Kosugi. This is actually yet another screen story movie – told entirely through computer screens. Which seems a bit strange for this kind of drowning possession story, but […]",

    "description": "\"We have to sink it!\" Well Go USA has posted the teaser trailer for Operation Hadal, a Chinese action thriller from filmmaker Dante Lam. This jingoistic movie is about the Chinese Navy going all out to defend an offshore platform in the sea. It's set for a US release at the end of February after originally opening in China this month first. The offshore platform Deep Blue 3 in Chinese territorial water has been occupied by mercenaries. The Chinese Navy sets sail then to repel invaders as the Jiao Long commando team prepares for a fierce fight in the deep sea. So this is mostly a movie about the Chinese Navy being badass and taking out bad guys (they've been making these for years - also see The Battle at Lake Changjin). Starring Xuan Huang, Yosh Yu, Bryan Larkin, Luxia Jiang, Karry Wang, Kelvin Taylor, Sean Kohnke, Cory Beeston. Half of this seems to be an old school submarine movie, the other half a Special Ops action movie. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster for Dante Lam's Operation Hadal, direct from YouTube: Mercenaries have occupied the offshore platform Deep Blue 3 in Chinese territorial waters by force.
