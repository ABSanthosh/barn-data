    "description": "\"Will this end in a sexual fusion of the three?\" Strand Releasing has unveiled the first official US trailer for the film titled Love, part of the Norwegian film trilogy called The Oslo Trilogy made by filmmaker Dag Johan Haugerud. This just premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival last year, the second one following Sex (at Berlinale 2024) and Dreams (at Berlinale 2025). Love focuses on two colleagues at an Oslo hospital — Marianne, a straight (and straitlaced) doctor, and Tor, a gay male nurse, who are avoiding conventional relatiosnhips. Both single, they cross paths and confide in each other: Marianne confesses her desire to be more adventurous and open in her encounters with men; Tor shares his fatigue with Grindr hook-ups. Their conversations form the heart of exploration of desire and emotional fulfillment. The idea of spontaneous intimacy, and questioning societal norms... Starring Andrea Bræin Hovig, Tayo Cittadella Jacobsen, Marte Engebrigtsen, Lars Jacob Holm, and Thomas Gullestad. The other two films in this intimate trilogy are quite good - and this one looks delightful as well. So much honesty and ingenuity in these stories. Here's the official US trailer (+ original poster) for Dag Johan Haugerud's film Love, […]",

It was also filmed in and around Morocco - obviously. Now ready for release on VOD starting in May - skipping theaters despite its grandiose vibes. The Lost Princess emotionally charged romance-action adventure film starring Cillian O’Sullivan, Gary Dourdan, Soraya Azzabi, Robert Knepper, Irma Lake, Melodie Casta, and Eric Roberts. A haunted castle, an Ayahuasca trip, and a forbidden love story unfold as Alec meets Hanna, who shares her mother's tragic tale of an arranged marriage and a secret affair. \"Hicham Hajji has created a film that not only delivers a thrilling adventure but also touches on universal themes of love and sacrifice, making it a story that will stay with audiences long after the credits roll.\" This really just looks like a big \"Visit Morocco!\" advertisement as a movie. I want to go to this castle \u0026 resort, too! Sure, why not?
