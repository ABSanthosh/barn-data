    "description": "Barbarella Says Tim Robinson Makes FRIENDSHIP Fantastic! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here back from hiatus, and I’m delighted to share my thoughts on A24’s newest release, Friendship. Sometimes people watch trailers and think, “Oh this movie is like [insert movie about a similar topic].” If you’re thinking that about Friendship, it’s not. Genuinely funny without being cruel, Andrew DeYoung’s exploration of adult male friendship proves charming and elicits more than a few hearty laughs from me.  In an era where seemingly fewer friendships exist in the real world than online, making new friends may be challenging, particularly for adult men. Keeping them may be nearly impossible.  When Craig (Tim Robinson) receives a misdelivered package intended for cool new neighbor Austin (Paul Rudd), Craig walks it over to him. Upon meeting the charismatic and friendly guy, he quickly gets invited in and finds himself actually making friends. His expressions reveal his delight in this newly formed camaraderie with someone who is just so darned interesting. One can’t help but feel happy for his new accomplishment.   Sadly, new friendships are fragile, and in a group setting, Craig doesn’t make the best impression on the guys. It doesn’t take long before Austin begins distancing himself from the awkward neighbor. In his desperation to rekindle the closeness they once shared, Craig makes some questionable decisions that lead to more awkward situations and laughs. On the surface, this is a quirky comedy that relies heavily on Tim Robinson’s performance. However, there is much more to this movie. Throughout, it addresses many common insecurities that men face in their Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric cleans up his inbox by dumping reviews for NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, RENNER, MOB COPS, and YOUNG WERTHER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all!  I've got some reviews of two films releasing this Friday, April 25th - but thought I'd also take this opportunity to highlight two other films that are already out there but I haven't yet found the time to cover. Hopefully there's something here for everyone, so let's get right to it: First up is NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, starring Jack Quaid (NOVOCAINE, THE COMPANION, \"The Boys\"), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (\"The Boys,\" \"The Walking Dead\"), and Malin Ackerman (WATCHMEN, SLAYERS), directed by Duncan Skiles (THE CLOVEHITCH KILLER) and written by Sean Farley. The film features troubled young man Simon McNally (Quaid), who is trying to find his feet after spending a decade in a facility for mental health treatment, and his paranoid ex-security guard neighbor Ed Deerman. The two form an unlikely partnership when Simon believes he's seen a woman kidnapped but is deemed an unreliable witness by police due to his history and behavior. The two men take it upon themselves to investigate the crime and rescue the woman, revealing a deeper web of villainy in their quiet town. Quaid and Morgan have great chemistry, and Quaid, specifically, does some great work in this film. Whereas the majority of his characters have been able to rely and charm and humor, Simon is stripped of these tools due to the abuse he received at a young age, so the tricks that Quaid would normally utilize to endear himself to audiences are out of reach. Quaid does a great job of humanizing McNally as a Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Stuck sleeping on the street, with no one to turn to for help, nowhere to go... How can you pull yourself back together in this situation? How does one get out of this rut? The next actor trying their hand at directing is the very talented British youngster Harris Dickinson (of Triangle of Sadness, The Iron Claw, Babygirl, Scrapper, Blitz). His feature directorial debut is a movie titled Urchin, premiering at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section. This film is also playing alongside Kristen Stewart's directorial debut titled The Chronology of Water – and between these two projects, it is Dickinson's film and choices and vision that really stand out. Both written \u0026 directed by Dickinson, Urchin follows the compelling story of a homeless man named Mike – a rough sleeper in London, trapped in a cycle of self-destruction as he attempts to turn his life around. Not only is the direction confident and the vision for this story clear, it's a damn good film featuring some clever creative choices. Delighted to report it's one of the year's best debuts. Urchin stars actor Frank Dillane in a social realism story that thankfully does not vilify […]",

This is something we should be celebrating and appreciating – diversity is vitally important and invigorating and meaningful. Alas, there are still people who do not understand that humanity as evolved beyond the simple concept of relationships being between a man \u0026 woman. As a lover of cinema, I'm so grateful this art form can tell stories that stir the soul, and show us how beautiful the world really is when we respect and admire and appreciate other relationships. Love Letters is the latest film written \u0026 directed by French filmmaker Alice Douard – premiering in the Critics Week sidebar at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It's undoubtedly one of the best films of the festival, one of my favorites and a film that I believe will connect with audiences all over the world after its initial unveiling in France. Love Letters is a lively, upbeat, emotionally honest, delightful, touching story about a lesbian couple expecting their first baby. \"Céline, 32, is expecting her first child. But Céline is not pregnant... In 3 months, it is Nadia, her wife, who will give birth to […]",
