    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Adores THE LIFE OF CHUCK Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here. Have I ever told you what a huge Stephen King fan I am? It started when a teenage me read Pet Sematary and became so enthralled with the author’s work that my mom’s Christmas shopping became immensely easier. She started gifting me Stephen King books for every Christmas and birthday thereafter, knowing I would eagerly devour every page. I did, with relish. Eventually, I began working my way through movies based on his works. Some ventured from the source material in ways I didn’t appreciate, but when I heard Mike Flanagan would be tackling one of King’s short stories, The Life of Chuck, I knew I’d love it. And I did. Mike Flanagan, who’s responsible for my favorite horror miniseries, The Haunting of Hill House, and who was the mastermind who brought Doctor Sleep to screens, remains incredibly faithful to the source material, including how it’s told in three acts using reverse chronology. It’s a film that offers a feast of reflection on life, but I suspect some will dig in more ravenously than others. This is a story about those magical moments in life, the influence others have on our lives, and the decisions we make day to day that steer us one way or another.  Narrated by Nick Offerman, the film begins ominously enough, with the world seemingly coming to an end. Natural and unnatural disasters plague the planet, and as if that’s not bad enough, the internet also appears to be out, possibly for good this time. Uncertainty and fear weigh Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"Just can't let the past get you down.\" 🇮🇪 WildCard Distribution has unveiled the official Irish trailer for an indie film titled Christy, marking the feature directorial debut of Irish filmmaker Brendan Canty – who looks to be a very talented filmmaker. This originally premiered at the 2025 Berlin Film Festival earlier this year, and it next plays at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival and Galway Film Fleadh. Two estranged brothers with checkered childhoods in the care system suddenly find themselves living under the same roof in Cork. They must now reconcile with their pasts and make decisions about the future. \"Bursting with humour, soul, and raw authenticity,\" the film stars breakout talents Danny Power and Diarmuid Noyes, alongside a brilliant Irish ensemble including Emma Willis, Alison Oliver, Chris Walley, and Helen Behan. The film also features members of Cork's Kabin Studio, the arts collective behind the song \"The Spark\" heard in this trailer. Described as \"a heartwarming story of second chances, connection, and finding your place in the world.\" Opening in Ireland first in August, and hopefully in the US not longer after. Keep an eye out for this. Here's the official UK trailer (+ poster) for Brendan Canty's […]",

The live-action version of the animated classic open in theaters worldwide in May 2025 earlier this summer. It was a huge hit (currently earned $914 million worldwide) and fans love it, so they're already happy to start making another one. The original Lilo \u0026 Stitch animated movie opened in 2002 and they actually did make a direct-to-home-video sequel for it back in 2005 titled Lilo \u0026 Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch. Though I expect this live-action sequel to go in a different direction. 2025 Lilo \u0026 Stitch director Dean Fleischer Camp is expected to return with the cast: Maia Kealoha as Lilo, Sydney Elizebeth Agudong as Nani, Billy Magnussen, Tia Carrere, Hannah Waddingham, with Courtney B. Vance, and Zach Galifianakis. This is just an announcement in celebration of \"626 Day\", confirming the sequel is in the works. But no other details are available just yet - stay tuned.
