    "description": "\"She's a fighter.\" \"I underestimated you.\" Netflix has unveiled an official trailer for an action thriller movie called Exterritorial, made by German filmmaker Christian Zübert. Ready for release on Netflix at the end of April - for anyone who wants to take a look. Maybe it'll be entertaining? When a former Special Forces soldier's son vanishes without a trace at the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, she illegally remains on the premises to search for him, unknowingly entangling herself in a dangerous conspiracy. She embarks on a nerve-wracking search for her son. The title Exterritorial is a word that means \"existing or taking place outside the territorial limits of a jurisdiction.\" Obviously enough. Exterritorial stars Jeanne Goursaud as Sara, with Dougray Scott, Lera Abova, Kayode Akinyemi, \u0026 Annabelle Mandeng. This looks super cheesy and so generic, yet another Netflix streaming action movie that'll be forgotten a week after it debuts. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Christian Zübert's action movie Exterritorial, from YouTube: On a visit to the US consulate in Frankfurt, the young son of former Special Forces soldier Sara (Jeanne Goursaud) disappears without a trace. Stranger still, nobody seems to remember him ever being in the building. […]",

    "description": "\"A return to the golden age of samurai cinema.\" Well Go USA has revealed an official trailer for 11 Rebels, an action movie set in feudal Japan made by veteran action filmmaker Kazuya Shiraishi. After premiering last year at the Tokyo Film Festival and opening Japan last fall, Well Go will release 11 Rebels on VOD in the US starting in June this summer. Shiraishi Kazuya directs this action epic where a group of small town cons are drafted to defend a fortress from government forces. Amidst the Boshin War's brutal conflicts, a motley squad of criminals and samurai undertakes a desperate defense – their stand triggered by clashing interests of the Shibata clan, the shogunate, and the new government. When the officials who offered them freedom back off their promise, the rebels must fend for themselves. Starring Takayuki Yamada, Taiga Nakano, Riho Sayashi, Ukon Onoe, Takara Sakumoto, and Seiji Chihara. Holy hell - this looks pretty badass! Brutal and epic and intense throughout - tons of fights galore. I hope the 11 bring them down! Worth a look.
