    "description": "Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

Apple TV has unveiled the full trailer for the extra mysterious new season of Severance, the sci-fi series from Ben Stiller \u0026 creator Dan Erickson. It's looking crazier \u0026 crazier! The first season of Severance debuted in 2022 and now it's back in early 2025 (teaser here). In this sci-fi story, Mark leads a team of office workers whose memories have been surgically divided between their work and personal lives. Season 2 continues in Lumon where the first left off, deepening the mystery of what is going on at this strange business. \"Everything they told you about Severance is a lie.\" The cast is back again, including Emmy Award nominee Adam Scott, with Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Zach Cherry, Jen Tullock, Michael Chernus, Dichen Lachman, and also featuring John Turturro, Academy Award winner Christopher Walken, and Academy \u0026 Emmy Award winner Patricia Arquette, and welcomes new series regular Sarah Bock.

    "description": "\"Contact with the other side is strictly forbidden.\" Apple + Skydance have revealed the official trailer for an intriguing new sci-fi action thriller called The Gorge, a new film directed by Scott Derrickson (of Sinister, Doctor Strange, The Black Phone 1 + 2). This is ready to drop on Apple TV+ beginning in February, just in time for Valentine's Day, early next year - unfortunately it's only getting a streaming debut and no theatrical release (as far as we know). Two highly-trained sniper operatives (Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy) are appointed to posts within guard towers on opposite sides of a vast and highly classified gorge, protecting the world from an undisclosed, mysterious evil that lurks within. They bond from a distance while trying to stay vigilant in defending against an unseen enemy. Despite the corrupt and lethal world they operate in – they still find a soulmate in each other. Ah so that's why it's a Valentine's Day release. It co-stars Anya Taylor-Joy \u0026 Miles Teller, as well as William Houston, Samantha Coughlan, Alessandro Garcia, Greta Hansen, and featuring Sigourney Weaver.
