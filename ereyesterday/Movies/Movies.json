    "description": "Barbarella Declares BRING HER BACK is an Intense Depiction of the Effects of Grief Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here still reeling from the incredibly intense Australian horror flick Bring Her Back, which comes out on May 30th. Not for the weak of heart, this follow-up from the minds behind Talk to Me grips one’s innards early on and doesn’t let go for the entire duration.  While themes of grief and the different ways individuals cope with loss may not be uncommon in cinema, Bring Her Back approaches the concept in a truly unique fashion through the individuals involved and the manner in which their stories are told.  Sora Wong debuts as the young Piper. Giving a powerhouse performance, she proves that a face doesn’t have to be recognizable to bring the awesomeness. While Piper may be the nucleus of the story, it’s not just her, but also those around her, who drive the points, like nails, into your soul.  I’ll start with Sally Hawkins, whom you may recognize from The Shape of Water. Her portrayal of the adoptive parent is nothing short of exceptional. Nuanced when necessary, flat out psycho when required, she navigates the extremes and subtleties like a master.  While I could ramble about Sally Hawkins more, let’s move on to Jonah Wren Phillips. He’s incredible as the creepy kid, but it’s in those moments where we glimpse his humanity that this young talent shines. I should warn you, though, if he’s onscreen, the odds of you feeling uncomfortable increase 85%. Owning the most disturbing scenes, he can be hard to watch at times. In fact, when Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric takes a look at some of the films screening at this year's Tribeca Film Festival in NYC from June 4th - 15th. Read the full article on AICN The Tribeca Film Festival is set to descend once again upon New York City this June 4th through 15th. Begun in 2002 by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff, the festival sought to revitalize Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks and has since become one of the premiere film festivals of North America. This year, alone, the programmers narrowed down their selections from over 13,000 submissions. This year's line-up boasts 95 world premieres from filmmakers across 36 countries, collecting everything from feature films to shorts, episodic content, audio storytelling, interactive games, and more.  I'll be on site for several days of the festival to screen films and speak with attending talent, so let's take a look at some of the selections that made my shortlist of interest: First off, the big trend this year is music documentaries - the festival has programmed at least fifteen music-based films, beginning with the opening night gala selection BILLY JOEL: AND SO IT GOES. The festivities will likely be more of a eulogy than a celebration due to recent developments, but it's still nice to kick off a definitively New York festival with one of the City's own beloved sons as the subject of its inaugural film. Other documentaries that feature prominently are METALLICA SAVED MY LIFE, BILLY IDOL SHOULD BE DEAD, BOY GEORGE 7 CULTURE CLUB, DEPECHE MODE: M, I WAS BORN THIS WAY: CARL BEAN, MOVE YA BODY: THE BIRTH OF HOUSE, and THE SIXTH BOROUGH. This final film made my shortlist as Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"Low risk, high reward!\" Or so they thought... But nope. Tribeca Films has revealed the official trailer for an indie comedy titled Stealing Pulp Fiction, marking the feature directorial debut of filmmaker Danny Turkiewicz. Another one of these meta films about film geeks trying to get involved in cinema by stealing something from another famous filmmaker – because why not. Much like Fanboys before this, and some of Kevin Smith's movies, too. This indie first premiered at the 2024 Newport Beach Film Festival last year, and will be out on VOD to watch this June. The film follows a group of enterprising wannabes and their eccentric therapist as they concoct a plot to steal Quentin Tarantino’s personal 35mm print of his famous 1994 film Pulp Fiction from his movie theater, quickly spirals into a chaotic misadventure with unexpected twists \u0026 mishaps. Starring Jon Rudnitsky, Karan Soni, Cazzie David, Jason Alexander, Taylor Hill, Oliver Cooper. Looks like everyone was having a blast making this! With New Beverly references galore, of course.

    "description": "\"We're making a movie right now!\" Vertical has unveiled a clever official trailer for an indie horror creation called Found Footage: The Making of the Patterson Project, from filmmaker Max Tzannes. A crew of documentarians chronicle an amateur filmmaker's quest to try to make the world's greatest found footage horror film. This is set for release in theaters and on VOD together starting in June this summer. Nothing like a classic bigfoot movie! And don't forget about the brilliant Sasquatch Sunset from last year. Starring Brennan Keel Cook, Dean Cameron, Chen Tang, Erika Vetter, and others. The horror filmmakers Radio Silence are also presenting this new meta \"found footage\" horror film this summer. Tzannes' Found Footage is a mockumentary horror movie about a budding filmmaker's attempt to produce his first feature, a found footage movie about Bigfoot, only to discover he's literally in a very real horror movie. It's nice how this trailer starts out upbeat \u0026 fun before getting all sinister \u0026 scary - this might be a good one. Check it out.
