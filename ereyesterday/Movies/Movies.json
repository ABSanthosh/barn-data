I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015).\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/lifeanddeathsofchristopherleeffreview2024-83593/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003estaff\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eSat, 05 Oct 2024 14:56:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83593\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eSTRANGE HARVEST: THE OCCULT MURDER IN THE INLAND EMPIRE Premieres at Fantastic Fest 2024!\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/strangeharvestinterview2024-83592/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;STRANGE HARVEST: THE OCCULT MURDER IN THE INLAND EMPIRE Premieres at Fantastic Fest 2024!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/strangeharvestinterview2024-83592/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hey friends. Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out!\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Peter: Bless You. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Stuart: Thank you.  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for? \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

The film tells the story of young Brian David, an avatar of Kevin Smith, and his adventures at the local Atlantic Cinema where he watches films with his friends Burny and Belly in 1986. It’s a departure from the View Askewniverse that Smith started thirty years ago, which admittedly stretched to its possible breaking point as the characters within encountered rebel angels, demons, Hollywood, jewel thieves, terrorists, and a monkey. THE 4:30 MOVIE offers a much more grounded story of a simpler time when the cinema and video store ruled the weekend, and the lives on the silver screen either mirrored our own or showed us worlds we could only imagine. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I had the opportunity to chat with Kevin Smith yesterday in support of the film’s digital release and it went exactly as I thought it would: we were given six minutes, I asked one question, and he talked for eight. What I got in that response, though, was a good deal of wisdom about what the filmmaker attempts when he puts his memories to screen for our amusement, how he’s remained relevant, and where his ideas originate. Prior to the interview’s start, my cat Bennie decided she needed to be part of it all, as well, and leapt onto the seat behind me. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Eric McClanahan - Hi Kevin!\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Kevin Smith - Hello, Eric!

This time the terror is set against the backdrop of Christmas, with Art (David Howard Thornton) returning to hunt down Sienna (Lauren Lavera) after she cut his head off in the last installment. The film picks up right at the end of Part 2 before allowing Art to take a five year siesta while Sienna spends time in facilities piecing her psyche back together. Young Jonathan Shaw (Elliott Fullam) isn’t so young anymore, attending college near his Aunt and Uncle, Jessica and Mark (Margaret Anne Florence and Alex Ross), with whom Sienna stays after being checked out of the latest facility. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The film opens with Art dispatching a family while dressed in a Santa Claus suit, letting the audience know right away that no one is safe. The entire film plays out as a supercut of gory kills and dark humor, with occasional moments of genuine world-building that allows the supporting cast to really stretch their acting muscles. Plotwise, the film seems to be more focused on showcasing creative kills than telling a cohesive story, and the end seems somewhat rushed, as though the filmmakers had almost forgotten that they had to end the thing. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; What a TERRIFIER fan is looking for, however, is exactly what they’ll find in 3: inventive kills, stomach-turning sound design, laughs that’ll make you question your own morality, and surprises.

Sci-fi film Subservience, starring Megan Fox, Michele Morrone  (his name’s Italian so the “ch” is pronounced like a “k”), Madeline Zima, and Matilda Firth, just came out on Demand and Digital, so let’s talk about AI. Do you think artificial intelligence will bring about major medical advancements, or do you envision more of a Terminator situation evolving? I tend to think it’s not the AI itself but whoever’s behind it that should be on whom we focus our concern. When it comes to cinema, filmmakers always hold technology responsible, because let’s face it, that makes for a more entertaining movie. I would argue Will Honley and April Maguire’s screenplay puts at least some of the onus on the humans. Maybe don’t say certain things to a Sim that’s constantly evolving and learning; that’s all I’m saying. If it weren’t for one comment made to Alice (Megan Fox), the attractive Sim acquired to help out around the house, perhaps a lot of mayhem could have been avoided. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I appreciate that the conflict in Subservience primarily occurs within the family unit, as this makes it more believable to me. Favoring older technologies, Nick (Michele Morrone) isn’t the biggest fan of artificial intelligence, but when he and his sick wife (Madeline Zima) can’t keep up with managing the household and children, he caves and gets Alice, the best new Sim on the market, to help out, and you know that’s not going to work out quite how everyone expects, well, at least how everyone\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/skdaleinterview2024subservience-83589/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eBarbarella\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eSat, 14 Sep 2024 13:57:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83589\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eTHE 4:30 MOVIE's Cast Speaks About Kevin Smith's New Comedy\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/interview-cast-new-kevin-smith-film-83588/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;McEric chats with the cast of Kevin Smith\u0026amp;#39;s THE 4:30 MOVIE\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/interview-cast-new-kevin-smith-film-83588/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Writer/Director Kevin Smith began his View Askewniverse in 1994 with his breakout hit CLERKS. The film tells the story of a couple of slackers working dead-end jobs in New Jersey in the 1990s and the conversations and misadventures they dabble in along the way. The film paved the way for countless stories, and so far nine films by Smith have rounded out its canon, along with several animated adventures and more in the pages of comic books. Before Dante and Randall ever sat around the Quik Stop and chatted about JAWS, STAR WARS, or even NAVY SEALS, young Kevin Smith was a New Jersey native soaking up inspiration on the silver screen at his local movie theater, the Atlantic Highlands Cinema. Flash forward to today and he owns that theater, rebranded as the Smodcastle, where he showcases new releases, repertory classics, film festivals, and even special screenings of “Movies With Kev,” where he screens a classic and participates in a Q\u0026amp;A following the screening.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Finally the formative experiences of young Kev are getting their own film treatment, with Kevin Smith’s newest release, THE 4:30 MOVIE, premiering tomorrow in cinemas around the country. The film, not set within the View Askewniverse, tells the story of a young man named Brian David, a not-even-thinly-veiled stand-in for Kevin Smith, played by Austin Zajur, who one day in the late spring of 1986 asks his crush Melody Barnegat (Siena Agudong) to meet him at the movies.

Barbarella here. It feels a little wrong that I have a ton of pep today while I’m covering a movie about the very serious topic of suicide, but here we are. Continue makes a personal and powerful statement from writer, director, and star Nadine Crocker, who survived her own suicide attempt in her twenties. In Theaters, On Demand and Digital September 6, 2024, Continue escorts viewers through Dean’s struggles as she experience life after a suicide attempt. Beautifully shot, the film also includes an unexpected love story, albeit, I’m not sure I believe that two people would be that flirtatious while discussing their past traumas, but just because I wouldn’t flirt while sharing horrific things from the past doesn’t mean it’s not possible that some people might. Anyway, before I veer too far off-topic, the movie stars an actor of whom I’ve been a fan since first seeing him about fifteen years ago in an independent film at Fantastic Fest called Deadgirl, and I’m grateful to have the opportunity to chat with that actor, Shiloh Fernandez, about the film. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Right out of the gate, I share my love of Deadgirl and Shiloh’s performance in it. Check out his response and the rest of our conversation! \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Shiloh: That is so sweet. It’s still one of my favorite movies. I loved doing a small movie like that, and all these years later, to do Continue, I think it was maybe the 2nd smallest.

Barbarella here. A new Western, Place of Bones, rides into theaters and on digital Friday, August 23, 2024. Unlike the Westerns of yesteryear, this one is female-led, with Audrey Cummings in the director’s chair and Heather Graham shining in the lead role as a mother who, along with her daughter (Brielle Robillard), must fight for survival when a gang of outlaws, led by Tom Hopper, arrives in the area.   \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I’ve been a Tom Hopper fan ever since he won me over with his enticing portrayal of Billy Bones in Black Sails. He earns additional adoration from me through the way he injects subtle humor as villain Bear John in this film. I find myself laughing at moments that I’m fairly certain weren’t intended to be funny, yet he fires wit like a true sharp-shooter with a faint exasperation about him that’s just funny. However, he’s not the only one who offers something more than just delivering what’s written on the page. Corin Nemec, Brielle Robillard, and Heather Graham also add an extra something that gives insight into their characters and adds a bit of snark to the exchanges.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I had the opportunity to speak with Audrey Cummings, and I sometimes like to break the ice with a question about Muppet-casting on remakes. While she placed Kermit, Miss Piggy and Fozzy Bear in the lead roles of Calhoun (Corin Nemec), Pandora (Heather Graham), and Hester (Brielle Robillard), I took a completely different approach, thinking it would be fun to have Statler and\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/audreycummingsinterview2024placeofbones-83585/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eBarbarella\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eThu, 22 Aug 2024 23:29:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83585\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003e#ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/all-my-friends-are-dead-interview-83584/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;#ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD director Marcus Dunstan and star Jade Pettyjohn talk to McEric about the new slasher comedy!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/all-my-friends-are-dead-interview-83584/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There was every manner of film at this year’s Tribeca Festival, and I managed to take in thirteen features, four shorts, and an episodic premiere by the time the whole thing wrapped this past June. One of the highlights was the opportunity to interview two of the lead talents behind the new slasher ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD: director Marcus Dunstan and star Jade Pettyjohn. We met at the Roxy Hotel bar and restaurant, a favorite meetup spot of mine, on a Saturday morning. I was, admittedly, running late, but they were so patient and gracious with me and I always appreciate that from stars and filmmakers, whose lives are probably ten times as cluttered as mine. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Its logline says of the film: “A group of college friends rents an airbnb for the biggest music festival of the year. However, their weekend of partying soon takes a deadly turn as a masked killer murders them one by one according to their sins.”\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The film, though familiar in synopsis, finds a way to inject new life into a tired formula. The design of the killer is unique, the kills are creative, the victims are fighters rather than training dummies, for the most part, and the twist(s) are welcome.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Marcus Dunstan is perpetually smiling, speaking in a small voice from a large, gentle face. Jade Pettyjohn is excitable, clearly enjoying being at the festival and also talking about this joyous diversion in her filmography. We couldn’t help but jump right in.

\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In some exciting news circulating the internet, it would seem that the ex-head of film at Netflix Scott Stuber is reviving the once legendary United Artists label through new partners Amazon MGM Studios.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Founded in 1919 by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickforth, D.W.Griffith and famed actor and filmmaker Douglas Fairbanks, United Artists began as a studio that would allow artists to control their own careers and artistic vision instead of being controlled by Hollywood moneymen.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; After decades of success, Metro Goldwyn Mayer bought the company over in 1981 for an unheard-of 350 million dollars and continued to release movies under the brand MGM/UA through the rest of the 80s, 90s and 2000s. United Artists are responsible for releasing some of the most classic movies of all time including The Mark of Zorro (1920), D.W.Griffith’s final film The Struggle (1931), The Great Dictator (1941), Alexander the Great (1956), Robert Mitchum’s Thunder Road (1958), The Magnificent Seven (1960), Dr. No (1963), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), Rocky (1976), Annie Hall (1977), Raging Bull (1980) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) to name but a few. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Jennifer Salke (Head of Amazon MGM Studios) had this to say about the resurrection:\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; “With his proven track record of delivering global hits and an eye towards theatrical fare, Scott’s expertise and vision align perfectly with our film strategy. We are so proud to welcome him on the relaunch of the legendary UA brand, as we work to leverage existing and new IP into big, broad films\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/amazon-mgm-revives-the-legendary-studio-united-art-83578/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eHouseOfMacleod\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eSat, 27 Jul 2024 01:22:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83578\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eFanhome Launches The Legends of Batman Collection\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/fanhome-legends-of-batman-collection-83577/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=comics\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Fanhome, a subscription-based models and collections service, launches a Batman collection for the ages.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/fanhome-legends-of-batman-collection-83577/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=comics\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hello all!\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; So, if you're like me, you love Batman. Who doesn't? However, when it comes down to reading his myriad adventures, where should one start? \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Batman has been a hero in pages and on screens for over 85 years, so it's hard to jump into his exploits without a guiding hand to navigate the most important formative stories. To this end Fanhome, a subscription-based model and collectible service, has launched a new collection called The Legends of Batman Graphic Novel Collection. From Year Zero to Year 100, this collection promises to tell the most definitive stories of the Caped Crusader in beautifully reproduced glossy hardcovers, each with bonus content such as variant covers, concept art, and creator notes.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \"From the moment Bruce Wayne becomes The Caped Crusader to his final days in the future, this collection brings together essential Batman tales in a book series that belongs on every bookshelf.\"\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; New volumes arrive monthly, and the series is MASSIVE. From the collected spines one can see that we'll witness the Joker's origin, the Death in the Family, the Breaking of the Bat, and the formation and expansion of the Bat Family. This looks to be an amazing collection for fans of the Bat new and established, young and old. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; To find out how to order, check out https://www.fanhome.com/us/movie-series/legends-batman-graphic-novels\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Check it out and stay tuned for more info!\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; -McEric, aka Eric McClanahan-\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/fanhome-legends-of-batman-collection-83577/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=comics\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eMcEric\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eSat, 20 Jul 2024 18:02:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83577\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eExclusive Clip from THE MANDELA EFFECT PHENOMENON!!\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/mandelaeffectclip2024-83576/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Exclusive Clip from THE MANDELA EFFECT PHENOMENON!!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/mandelaeffectclip2024-83576/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hey friends, Barbarella here.

I’ve had quite a couple months, and I wish I could say that I was gallivanting around the globe, but not this time. I’ve been sick a good chunk of it. In fact, I had quite a fever when I screened Murder Company, written by Jesse Mittelstadt and directed by Shane Dax Taylor. I don’t know that it would be fair to the filmmakers to review the film, given that I was feeling so awful while watching it that I don’t think my thoughts would necessarily be a true reflection of how the movie was. I will make a few observations, though. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; First of all, Kelsey Grammer was my favorite thing about Murder Company, which is currently On Digital and On Demand, and I wanted him to have far more screen time. I love a serious Kelsey Grammer, and he's incredibly serious in this. Second, while there was far less graphic violence and gore than I would have expected from a war movie made in this day and age, the filmmakers seemed to compensate for that with the amount of people flying around, proving yet again that stunt men are insane. “Yeah, you can hurl me into that tree. Sure.” Finally, could we please stop having people engage in casual conversations while walking through enemy-occupied territories? I understand that it seems a good way to develop characters, but it drives me crazy every time anyone has a conversation at a normal volume as if they’re just strolling through the\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/shanedaxtaylorinterview2024murdercompany-83575/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eBarbarella\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eFri, 12 Jul 2024 01:44:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83575\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eIt May Only be July, but Here's a Trailer for THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER!\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/bestchristmaspageantevertrailer2024-83574/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It May Only be July, but Here\u0026amp;#39;s a Trailer for THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/bestchristmaspageantevertrailer2024-83574/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hey friends, Barbarella here. I know it’s way too early to start thinking about Christmas, but we have a trailer to share with you for a Christmas movie! Please forgive us. The Best Christmas Pageant Ever comes to theaters November 8. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Based on Barbara Robinson’s beloved book, the story centers on the Herdmans as they take over their local church pageant. The worst kids in the community participating in a church activity; what could go wrong? It’s hard to say from the trailer if this movie, starring Judy Greer, Pete Holmes, Molly Belle Wright, and Lauren Graham, is going to be just another sappy Christmas story or something memorable to add to one's annual holiday movie rotation. I guess we’ll find out soon enough.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/bestchristmaspageantevertrailer2024-83574/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eBarbarella\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eMon, 01 Jul 2024 22:46:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83574\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eMarc Singer talks AGENT RECON\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/marc-singer-interview-agent-recon-eric-mcclanahan-83573/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Marc Singer (BEASTMASTER, V) talks Derek Ting\u0026amp;#39;s AGENT RECON, streaming now!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/marc-singer-interview-agent-recon-eric-mcclanahan-83573/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I get a lot of emails.

But when I got an email that said there was a new film coming out with Chuck Norris and Marc Singer, and would I like to talk to Marc Singer about it, I practically broke the sound barrier with my swift response of “hell to the yes!”\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I’m a man of a certain age, and I grew up in the wilds of Southeast Texas. As I recall my rough and tumble childhood, I don’t say I’m from the streets - I’m from the roads. Concrete jungle films didn’t interest me quite as much as actual jungle films, so if you wanted my ticket money, throw an animal or two in your film. Want to see Clint Eastwood act with a monkey? Hell yes, take my money.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; So for me there was no greater action franchise than the BEASTMASTER films starring Marc Singer. The Sword \u0026amp; Sorcery world of Conan distilled through the eyes and wings of beasts and marketed to a younger audience, it surprised me to learn that the films came out in the same year and were envisioned in relative ignorance of one another. While CONAN THE BARBARIAN was the box office victor, and probably stands the test of the time more defiantly, I take some pleasure in knowing that it made four times the box office draw of BEASTMASTER at the\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/marc-singer-interview-agent-recon-eric-mcclanahan-83573/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eMcEric\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eSat, 29 Jun 2024 20:00:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83573\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eWIN an Autographed Poster of THE STRANGERS - CHAPTER 1!!\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/node/83572?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=contests\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;WIN an Autographed Poster of THE STRANGERS - CHAPTER 1!!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/node/83572?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=contests\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hey, friends!

I was married for seven years, and the very first night I went out after the divorce – which was quite a long time after the divorce – I met my second husband, so I haven't really done much dating. I should have done a lot more. No, I honestly, I'm absolutely stumped. So unlike me.

The weirdest or craziest experience I've had dating. This is not going to paint me in a very good light. I will tell you, my last long-term relationship, we met at a bar. I don't know if this was dating. We made out in the back of the bar for three and a half hours, on our first meeting, so it was an egregious public display of affection, and just shameless. I guess that would be my weirdest, but it was great. It didn't show a lot of couth, but there we go. I'll go with that.”\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Couth is overrated.

In this post-apocalyptic era, the earth’s oxygen level has reached a not-fit-for-life amount, yet one family has survived thanks to the engineering genius and survivalistic skills of Darius (Common). He, his wife, Maya (Jennifer Hudson), and their daughter, Zora (Quvenzhané Wallis) live in a DIY-tech dwelling amidst the ruins. When Darius ventures out and remains gone longer than expected, Zora, who has learned much from her dad, attempts to reach out, bringing unwanted consequences.  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I caught up with director Stefon Bristol to chat a bit about his personal journey, Breathe, and working with its cast. Check it out!\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I feel a little sleep-deprived today. Do you find that as a director, you're more sleep-deprived than the average person?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; “Definitely. When you're working on set, or you're doing pre-production, or you're in post, definitely. But this is what I love to do for my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.\"\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; How did you get into directing? I know you worked with Spike Lee, but what interested you about it? \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; “Directing? I grew up in Brooklyn. I grew up in Coney Island. When I was a kid, I was watching DVDs with director's commentary and special features, behind the scenes. I had the Jurassic Park DVD, and I would watch all the time the behind the scenes, because I was always fascinated on how they made Jurassic Park and whatnot.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/stefonbristolinterview2024breathe-83567/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eBarbarella\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eThu, 25 Apr 2024 22:27:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83567\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eBarbarella Chats with Raymond St-Jean about DUSK FOR A HITMAN\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/raymondstjeaninterview2024duskforahitman-83566/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Barbarella Chats with Raymond St-Jean about DUSK FOR A HITMAN\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/raymondstjeaninterview2024duskforahitman-83566/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hi, my friends. Barbarella here. Did you know that there’s a new drama about a hitman coming to Digital and On Demand tomorrow, April 19? French language film DUSK FOR A HITMAN may be based on a true story, but it includes its share of fiction. Written by Martin Gerard and Raymond St-Jean, who also directed, the film transports viewers back to the late 70’s, early 80’s as the most feared hitman in Montreal finds himself a target. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Make no mistake. This is not a John Wick action-packed assault on your senses. No, DUSK FOR A HITMAN plants itself firmly in the realm of drama.  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; While I like the film, portions of the story feel quite familiar to me because I recently finished the Max series TOKYO VICE, which includes a similar narrative around a gangster and his brother who wants to be in the life. I feel it’s unfair to compare the two, because they handle the subject differently, and the series has the time to really flesh out the characters and situations over several episodes. The added time granted allows a deeper connection to the characters than DUSK FOR A HITMAN’s runtime provides. That said, Érik Bruneau’s performance as a conflicted man truly enhances the movie’s impact. The film also beautifully captures the vibe of the era and removes the glamour from the gangster lifestyle. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I had the opportunity to speak with director and co-writer Raymond St-Jean. Check it out, mes amis! \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; This movie is based on an actual person, and\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/raymondstjeaninterview2024duskforahitman-83566/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eBarbarella\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eThu, 18 Apr 2024 21:50:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83566\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eSLEEPING DOGS co-writer/director Adam Cooper in Conversation\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/sleeping-dogs-director-adam-cooper-interview-83565/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;SLEEPING DOGS co-writer/director Adam Cooper in Conversation with McEric about thriller starring Russell Crowe and Karen Gillan\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/sleeping-dogs-director-adam-cooper-interview-83565/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Opening today in theaters only is the new mind-bending thriller from writer/director Adam Cooper SLEEPING DOGS, starring Russell Crowe, Karen Gillan, Tommy Flanagan, and Márton Csókás. The synopsis reads “An ex-homicide detective (Russell Crowe) with memory loss is forced to solve a brutal murder he can't recall. But as evidence uncovers secrets tied to his forgotten past, he is led to a chilling truth - sometimes, it's best to let sleeping dogs lie.”\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Check out the trailer:\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Now if the synopsis and the trailer make the film seem predictable to you, you’d totally be forgiven. Maybe you’re like me and you’ve seen enough movies to know that the “chilling truths” are almost always exactly what you think they are. What SLEEPING DOGS offers, however, is a clever deconstruction of a brilliant mind, double-turned-triple-crosses, a femme fatale to truly die for, and stellar performances from everyone in attendance. There are practically zero sour notes in the film, and it is fun to watch with a friend and pause as you give your predictions, à la a spirited game of CLUE, to see who comes closest to the final conclusion.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Russell Crowe is wonderful in the role of Roy Freeman, a former detective who is living a labeled life as he struggles with dementia brought about by a damning automobile accident. When a man he put away is facing execution, Roy takes it upon himself to re-investigate a decade-old murder despite often failing to recall his own name. It’s a testament to muscle memory, true\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/sleeping-dogs-director-adam-cooper-interview-83565/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eMcEric\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eFri, 22 Mar 2024 06:41:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83565\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eTHE STRANGERS Spotted in Austin During SXSW\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/strangers2024photosaustin-83564/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;THE STRANGERS Spotted in Austin During SXSW\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/strangers2024photosaustin-83564/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hey, friends.

Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie. \u003cbr\u003e It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff.\u003cbr\u003e Peter: Bless You. \u003cbr\u003e Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done.

The film tells the story of young Brian David, an avatar of Kevin Smith, and his adventures at the local Atlantic Cinema where he watches films with his friends Burny and Belly in 1986. It’s a departure from the View Askewniverse that Smith started thirty years ago, which admittedly stretched to its possible breaking point as the characters within encountered rebel angels, demons, Hollywood, jewel thieves, terrorists, and a monkey. THE 4:30 MOVIE offers a much more grounded story of a simpler time when the cinema and video store ruled the weekend, and the lives on the silver screen either mirrored our own or showed us worlds we could only imagine. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e I had the opportunity to chat with Kevin Smith yesterday in support of the film’s digital release and it went exactly as I thought it would: we were given six minutes, I asked one question, and he talked for eight. What I got in that response, though, was a good deal of wisdom about what the filmmaker attempts when he puts his memories to screen for our amusement, how he’s remained relevant, and where his ideas originate. Prior to the interview’s start, my cat Bennie decided she needed to be part of it all, as well, and leapt onto the seat behind me. \u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e Eric McClanahan - Hi Kevin!\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e Kevin Smith - Hello, Eric!

This time the terror is set against the backdrop of Christmas, with Art (David Howard Thornton) returning to hunt down Sienna (Lauren Lavera) after she cut his head off in the last installment. The film picks up right at the end of Part 2 before allowing Art to take a five year siesta while Sienna spends time in facilities piecing her psyche back together. Young Jonathan Shaw (Elliott Fullam) isn’t so young anymore, attending college near his Aunt and Uncle, Jessica and Mark (Margaret Anne Florence and Alex Ross), with whom Sienna stays after being checked out of the latest facility. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e The film opens with Art dispatching a family while dressed in a Santa Claus suit, letting the audience know right away that no one is safe. The entire film plays out as a supercut of gory kills and dark humor, with occasional moments of genuine world-building that allows the supporting cast to really stretch their acting muscles.

Sci-fi film Subservience, starring Megan Fox, Michele Morrone  (his name’s Italian so the “ch” is pronounced like a “k”), Madeline Zima, and Matilda Firth, just came out on Demand and Digital, so let’s talk about AI. Do you think artificial intelligence will bring about major medical advancements, or do you envision more of a Terminator situation evolving? I tend to think it’s not the AI itself but whoever’s behind it that should be on whom we focus our concern. When it comes to cinema, filmmakers always hold technology responsible, because let’s face it, that makes for a more entertaining movie. I would argue Will Honley and April Maguire’s screenplay puts at least some of the onus on the humans. Maybe don’t say certain things to a Sim that’s constantly evolving and learning; that’s all I’m saying. If it weren’t for one comment made to Alice (Megan Fox), the attractive Sim acquired to help out around the house, perhaps a lot of mayhem could have been avoided. \u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e I appreciate that the conflict in Subservience primarily occurs within the family unit, as this makes it more believable to me. Favoring older technologies, Nick (Michele Morrone) isn’t the biggest fan of artificial intelligence, but when he and his sick wife (Madeline Zima) can’t keep up with managing the household and children, he caves and gets Alice, the best new Sim on the market, to help out, and you know that’s not going to work out quite how everyone expects, well, at least how everyone\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/skdaleinterview2024subservience-83589/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnews\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eFinish the article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e BarbarellaSat, 14 Sep 2024 13:57:00 +000083589THE 4:30 MOVIE's Cast Speaks About Kevin Smith's New Comedyhttps://www.aintitcool.com/interview-cast-new-kevin-smith-film-83588/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviews\u003cp\u003eMcEric chats with the cast of Kevin Smith\u0026#39;s THE 4:30 MOVIE\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/interview-cast-new-kevin-smith-film-83588/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviews\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eRead the full article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWriter/Director Kevin Smith began his View Askewniverse in 1994 with his breakout hit CLERKS. The film tells the story of a couple of slackers working dead-end jobs in New Jersey in the 1990s and the conversations and misadventures they dabble in along the way. The film paved the way for countless stories, and so far nine films by Smith have rounded out its canon, along with several animated adventures and more in the pages of comic books. Before Dante and Randall ever sat around the Quik Stop and chatted about JAWS, STAR WARS, or even NAVY SEALS, young Kevin Smith was a New Jersey native soaking up inspiration on the silver screen at his local movie theater, the Atlantic Highlands Cinema. Flash forward to today and he owns that theater, rebranded as the Smodcastle, where he showcases new releases, repertory classics, film festivals, and even special screenings of “Movies With Kev,” where he screens a classic and participates in a Q\u0026A following the screening.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e Finally the formative experiences of young Kev are getting their own film treatment, with Kevin Smith’s newest release, THE 4:30 MOVIE, premiering tomorrow in cinemas around the country. The film, not set within the View Askewniverse, tells the story of a young man named Brian David, a not-even-thinly-veiled stand-in for Kevin Smith, played by Austin Zajur, who one day in the late spring of 1986 asks his crush Melody Barnegat (Siena Agudong) to meet him at the movies.

In Theaters, On Demand and Digital September 6, 2024, Continue escorts viewers through Dean’s struggles as she experience life after a suicide attempt. Beautifully shot, the film also includes an unexpected love story, albeit, I’m not sure I believe that two people would be that flirtatious while discussing their past traumas, but just because I wouldn’t flirt while sharing horrific things from the past doesn’t mean it’s not possible that some people might. Anyway, before I veer too far off-topic, the movie stars an actor of whom I’ve been a fan since first seeing him about fifteen years ago in an independent film at Fantastic Fest called Deadgirl, and I’m grateful to have the opportunity to chat with that actor, Shiloh Fernandez, about the film. \u003cbr\u003e Right out of the gate, I share my love of Deadgirl and Shiloh’s performance in it.

Barbarella here. A new Western, Place of Bones, rides into theaters and on digital Friday, August 23, 2024. Unlike the Westerns of yesteryear, this one is female-led, with Audrey Cummings in the director’s chair and Heather Graham shining in the lead role as a mother who, along with her daughter (Brielle Robillard), must fight for survival when a gang of outlaws, led by Tom Hopper, arrives in the area.   \u003cbr\u003e I’ve been a Tom Hopper fan ever since he won me over with his enticing portrayal of Billy Bones in Black Sails. He earns additional adoration from me through the way he injects subtle humor as villain Bear John in this film. I find myself laughing at moments that I’m fairly certain weren’t intended to be funny, yet he fires wit like a true sharp-shooter with a faint exasperation about him that’s just funny. However, he’s not the only one who offers something more than just delivering what’s written on the page. Corin Nemec, Brielle Robillard, and Heather Graham also add an extra something that gives insight into their characters and adds a bit of snark to the exchanges.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e I had the opportunity to speak with Audrey Cummings, and I sometimes like to break the ice with a question about Muppet-casting on remakes.

We met at the Roxy Hotel bar and restaurant, a favorite meetup spot of mine, on a Saturday morning. I was, admittedly, running late, but they were so patient and gracious with me and I always appreciate that from stars and filmmakers, whose lives are probably ten times as cluttered as mine. \u003cbr\u003e Its logline says of the film: “A group of college friends rents an airbnb for the biggest music festival of the year.

reviving the once legendary United Artists label through new partners Amazon MGM Studios.\u003cbr\u003e Founded in 1919 by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickforth, D.W.Griffith and famed actor and filmmaker Douglas Fairbanks, United Artists began as a studio that would allow artists to control their own careers and artistic vision instead of being controlled by Hollywood moneymen.\u003cbr\u003e After decades of success, Metro Goldwyn Mayer bought the company over in 1981 for an unheard-of 350 million dollars and continued to release movies under the brand MGM/UA through the rest of the 80s, 90s and 2000s. United Artists are responsible for releasing some of the most classic movies of all time including The Mark of Zorro (1920), D.W.Griffith’s final film The Struggle (1931), The Great Dictator (1941), Alexander the Great (1956), Robert Mitchum’s Thunder Road (1958), The Magnificent Seven (1960), Dr. No (1963), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), Rocky (1976), Annie Hall (1977), Raging Bull (1980) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) to name but a few. \u003cbr\u003e Jennifer Salke (Head of Amazon MGM Studios) had this to say about the resurrection:\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e “With his proven track record of delivering global hits and an eye towards theatrical fare, Scott’s expertise and vision align perfectly with our film strategy. We are so proud to welcome him on the relaunch of the legendary UA brand, as we work to leverage existing and new IP into big, broad films\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/amazon-mgm-revives-the-legendary-studio-united-art-83578/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnews\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eFinish the article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e HouseOfMacleodSat, 27 Jul 2024 01:22:00 +000083578Fanhome Launches The Legends of Batman Collectionhttps://www.aintitcool.com/fanhome-legends-of-batman-collection-83577/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=comics\u003cp\u003eFanhome, a subscription-based models and collections service, launches a Batman collection for the ages.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/fanhome-legends-of-batman-collection-83577/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=comics\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eRead the full article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHello all!\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e So, if you're like me, you love Batman.

From Year Zero to Year 100, this collection promises to tell the most definitive stories of the Caped Crusader in beautifully reproduced glossy hardcovers, each with bonus content such as variant covers, concept art, and creator notes.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e \"From the moment Bruce Wayne becomes The Caped Crusader to his final days in the future, this collection brings together essential Batman tales in a book series that belongs on every bookshelf.\"\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e New volumes arrive monthly, and the series is MASSIVE. From the collected spines one can see that we'll witness the Joker's origin, the Death in the Family, the Breaking of the Bat, and the formation and expansion of the Bat Family.

I’ve had quite a couple months, and I wish I could say that I was gallivanting around the globe, but not this time. I’ve been sick a good chunk of it. In fact, I had quite a fever when I screened Murder Company, written by Jesse Mittelstadt and directed by Shane Dax Taylor. I don’t know that it would be fair to the filmmakers to review the film, given that I was feeling so awful while watching it that I don’t think my thoughts would necessarily be a true reflection of how the movie was. I will make a few observations, though. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e First of all, Kelsey Grammer was my favorite thing about Murder Company, which is currently On Digital and On Demand, and I wanted him to have far more screen time. I love a serious Kelsey Grammer, and he's incredibly serious in this. Second, while there was far less graphic violence and gore than I would have expected from a war movie made in this day and age, the filmmakers seemed to compensate for that with the amount of people flying around, proving yet again that stunt men are insane. “Yeah, you can hurl me into that tree. Sure.” Finally, could we please stop having people engage in casual conversations while walking through enemy-occupied territories? I understand that it seems a good way to develop characters, but it drives me crazy every time anyone has a conversation at a normal volume as if they’re just strolling through the\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/shanedaxtaylorinterview2024murdercompany-83575/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnews\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eFinish the article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e BarbarellaFri, 12 Jul 2024 01:44:00 +000083575It May Only be July, but Here's a Trailer for THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER!https://www.aintitcool.com/bestchristmaspageantevertrailer2024-83574/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnews\u003cp\u003eIt May Only be July, but Here\u0026#39;s a Trailer for THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/bestchristmaspageantevertrailer2024-83574/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnews\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eRead the full article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHey friends, Barbarella here.

In this post-apocalyptic era, the earth’s oxygen level has reached a not-fit-for-life amount, yet one family has survived thanks to the engineering genius and survivalistic skills of Darius (Common). He, his wife, Maya (Jennifer Hudson), and their daughter, Zora (Quvenzhané Wallis) live in a DIY-tech dwelling amidst the ruins. When Darius ventures out and remains gone longer than expected, Zora, who has learned much from her dad, attempts to reach out, bringing unwanted consequences.  \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e I caught up with director Stefon Bristol to chat a bit about his personal journey, Breathe, and working with its cast.

Barbarella here. Did you know that there’s a new drama about a hitman coming to Digital and On Demand tomorrow, April 19? French language film DUSK FOR A HITMAN may be based on a true story, but it includes its share of fiction. Written by Martin Gerard and Raymond St-Jean, who also directed, the film transports viewers back to the late 70’s, early 80’s as the most feared hitman in Montreal finds himself a target. \u003cbr\u003e Make no mistake. This is not a John Wick action-packed assault on your senses. No, DUSK FOR A HITMAN plants itself firmly in the realm of drama.  \u003cbr\u003e While I like the film, portions of the story feel quite familiar to me because I recently finished the Max series TOKYO VICE, which includes a similar narrative around a gangster and his brother who wants to be in the life. I feel it’s unfair to compare the two, because they handle the subject differently, and the series has the time to really flesh out the characters and situations over several episodes. The added time granted allows a deeper connection to the characters than DUSK FOR A HITMAN’s runtime provides. That said, Érik Bruneau’s performance as a conflicted man truly enhances the movie’s impact. The film also beautifully captures the vibe of the era and removes the glamour from the gangster lifestyle. \u003cbr\u003e I had the opportunity to speak with director and co-writer Raymond St-Jean.

The synopsis reads “An ex-homicide detective (Russell Crowe) with memory loss is forced to solve a brutal murder he can't recall. But as evidence uncovers secrets tied to his forgotten past, he is led to a chilling truth - sometimes, it's best to let sleeping dogs lie.”\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e Check out the trailer:\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e Now if the synopsis and the trailer make the film seem predictable to you, you’d totally be forgiven. Maybe you’re like me and you’ve seen enough movies to know that the “chilling truths” are almost always exactly what you think they are. What SLEEPING DOGS offers, however, is a clever deconstruction of a brilliant mind, double-turned-triple-crosses, a femme fatale to truly die for, and stellar performances from everyone in attendance. There are practically zero sour notes in the film, and it is fun to watch with a friend and pause as you give your predictions, à la a spirited game of CLUE, to see who comes closest to the final conclusion.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e Russell Crowe is wonderful in the role of Roy Freeman, a former detective who is living a labeled life as he struggles with dementia brought about by a damning automobile accident.

Read the full article on AICN Hey friends. Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie.  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter: Bless You.  Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.  Stuart: Thank you.   Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?  Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

The film tells the story of young Brian David, an avatar of Kevin Smith, and his adventures at the local Atlantic Cinema where he watches films with his friends Burny and Belly in 1986. It’s a departure from the View Askewniverse that Smith started thirty years ago, which admittedly stretched to its possible breaking point as the characters within encountered rebel angels, demons, Hollywood, jewel thieves, terrorists, and a monkey. THE 4:30 MOVIE offers a much more grounded story of a simpler time when the cinema and video store ruled the weekend, and the lives on the silver screen either mirrored our own or showed us worlds we could only imagine.  I had the opportunity to chat with Kevin Smith yesterday in support of the film’s digital release and it went exactly as I thought it would: we were given six minutes, I asked one question, and he talked for eight. What I got in that response, though, was a good deal of wisdom about what the filmmaker attempts when he puts his memories to screen for our amusement, how he’s remained relevant, and where his ideas originate. Prior to the interview’s start, my cat Bennie decided she needed to be part of it all, as well, and leapt onto the seat behind me.    Eric McClanahan - Hi Kevin!   Kevin Smith - Hello, Eric! How are you?   EM - I’m well, thank you!   KS - Look at that cat!

This time the terror is set against the backdrop of Christmas, with Art (David Howard Thornton) returning to hunt down Sienna (Lauren Lavera) after she cut his head off in the last installment. The film picks up right at the end of Part 2 before allowing Art to take a five year siesta while Sienna spends time in facilities piecing her psyche back together. Young Jonathan Shaw (Elliott Fullam) isn’t so young anymore, attending college near his Aunt and Uncle, Jessica and Mark (Margaret Anne Florence and Alex Ross), with whom Sienna stays after being checked out of the latest facility.  The film opens with Art dispatching a family while dressed in a Santa Claus suit, letting the audience know right away that no one is safe. The entire film plays out as a supercut of gory kills and dark humor, with occasional moments of genuine world-building that allows the supporting cast to really stretch their acting muscles. Plotwise, the film seems to be more focused on showcasing creative kills than telling a cohesive story, and the end seems somewhat rushed, as though the filmmakers had almost forgotten that they had to end the thing.    What a TERRIFIER fan is looking for, however, is exactly what they’ll find in 3: inventive kills, stomach-turning sound design, laughs that’ll make you question your own morality, and surprises.

Dale Read the full article on AICN Hi friends, Barbarella here. Sci-fi film Subservience, starring Megan Fox, Michele Morrone  (his name’s Italian so the “ch” is pronounced like a “k”), Madeline Zima, and Matilda Firth, just came out on Demand and Digital, so let’s talk about AI. Do you think artificial intelligence will bring about major medical advancements, or do you envision more of a Terminator situation evolving? I tend to think it’s not the AI itself but whoever’s behind it that should be on whom we focus our concern. When it comes to cinema, filmmakers always hold technology responsible, because let’s face it, that makes for a more entertaining movie. I would argue Will Honley and April Maguire’s screenplay puts at least some of the onus on the humans. Maybe don’t say certain things to a Sim that’s constantly evolving and learning; that’s all I’m saying. If it weren’t for one comment made to Alice (Megan Fox), the attractive Sim acquired to help out around the house, perhaps a lot of mayhem could have been avoided.    I appreciate that the conflict in Subservience primarily occurs within the family unit, as this makes it more believable to me. Favoring older technologies, Nick (Michele Morrone) isn’t the biggest fan of artificial intelligence, but when he and his sick wife (Madeline Zima) can’t keep up with managing the household and children, he caves and gets Alice, the best new Sim on the market, to help out, and you know that’s not going to work out quite how everyone expects, well, at least how everyone Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaSat, 14 Sep 2024 13:57:00 +000083589THE 4:30 MOVIE's Cast Speaks About Kevin Smith's New Comedyhttps://www.aintitcool.com/interview-cast-new-kevin-smith-film-83588/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsMcEric chats with the cast of Kevin Smith's THE 4:30 MOVIE Read the full article on AICN Writer/Director Kevin Smith began his View Askewniverse in 1994 with his breakout hit CLERKS. The film tells the story of a couple of slackers working dead-end jobs in New Jersey in the 1990s and the conversations and misadventures they dabble in along the way. The film paved the way for countless stories, and so far nine films by Smith have rounded out its canon, along with several animated adventures and more in the pages of comic books. Before Dante and Randall ever sat around the Quik Stop and chatted about JAWS, STAR WARS, or even NAVY SEALS, young Kevin Smith was a New Jersey native soaking up inspiration on the silver screen at his local movie theater, the Atlantic Highlands Cinema. Flash forward to today and he owns that theater, rebranded as the Smodcastle, where he showcases new releases, repertory classics, film festivals, and even special screenings of “Movies With Kev,” where he screens a classic and participates in a Q\u0026A following the screening.   Finally the formative experiences of young Kev are getting their own film treatment, with Kevin Smith’s newest release, THE 4:30 MOVIE, premiering tomorrow in cinemas around the country. The film, not set within the View Askewniverse, tells the story of a young man named Brian David, a not-even-thinly-veiled stand-in for Kevin Smith, played by Austin Zajur, who one day in the late spring of 1986 asks his crush Melody Barnegat (Siena Agudong) to meet him at the movies.

Barbarella here. It feels a little wrong that I have a ton of pep today while I’m covering a movie about the very serious topic of suicide, but here we are. Continue makes a personal and powerful statement from writer, director, and star Nadine Crocker, who survived her own suicide attempt in her twenties. In Theaters, On Demand and Digital September 6, 2024, Continue escorts viewers through Dean’s struggles as she experience life after a suicide attempt. Beautifully shot, the film also includes an unexpected love story, albeit, I’m not sure I believe that two people would be that flirtatious while discussing their past traumas, but just because I wouldn’t flirt while sharing horrific things from the past doesn’t mean it’s not possible that some people might. Anyway, before I veer too far off-topic, the movie stars an actor of whom I’ve been a fan since first seeing him about fifteen years ago in an independent film at Fantastic Fest called Deadgirl, and I’m grateful to have the opportunity to chat with that actor, Shiloh Fernandez, about the film.  Right out of the gate, I share my love of Deadgirl and Shiloh’s performance in it.

Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here. A new Western, Place of Bones, rides into theaters and on digital Friday, August 23, 2024. Unlike the Westerns of yesteryear, this one is female-led, with Audrey Cummings in the director’s chair and Heather Graham shining in the lead role as a mother who, along with her daughter (Brielle Robillard), must fight for survival when a gang of outlaws, led by Tom Hopper, arrives in the area.    I’ve been a Tom Hopper fan ever since he won me over with his enticing portrayal of Billy Bones in Black Sails. He earns additional adoration from me through the way he injects subtle humor as villain Bear John in this film. I find myself laughing at moments that I’m fairly certain weren’t intended to be funny, yet he fires wit like a true sharp-shooter with a faint exasperation about him that’s just funny. However, he’s not the only one who offers something more than just delivering what’s written on the page. Corin Nemec, Brielle Robillard, and Heather Graham also add an extra something that gives insight into their characters and adds a bit of snark to the exchanges.   I had the opportunity to speak with Audrey Cummings, and I sometimes like to break the ice with a question about Muppet-casting on remakes. While she placed Kermit, Miss Piggy and Fozzy Bear in the lead roles of Calhoun (Corin Nemec), Pandora (Heather Graham), and Hester (Brielle Robillard), I took a completely different approach, thinking it would be fun to have Statler and Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaThu, 22 Aug 2024 23:29:00 +000083585#ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEADhttps://www.aintitcool.com/all-my-friends-are-dead-interview-83584/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviews#ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD director Marcus Dunstan and star Jade Pettyjohn talk to McEric about the new slasher comedy! Read the full article on AICN There was every manner of film at this year’s Tribeca Festival, and I managed to take in thirteen features, four shorts, and an episodic premiere by the time the whole thing wrapped this past June. One of the highlights was the opportunity to interview two of the lead talents behind the new slasher ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD: director Marcus Dunstan and star Jade Pettyjohn. We met at the Roxy Hotel bar and restaurant, a favorite meetup spot of mine, on a Saturday morning. I was, admittedly, running late, but they were so patient and gracious with me and I always appreciate that from stars and filmmakers, whose lives are probably ten times as cluttered as mine.  Its logline says of the film: “A group of college friends rents an airbnb for the biggest music festival of the year. However, their weekend of partying soon takes a deadly turn as a masked killer murders them one by one according to their sins.” The film, though familiar in synopsis, finds a way to inject new life into a tired formula. The design of the killer is unique, the kills are creative, the victims are fighters rather than training dummies, for the most part, and the twist(s) are welcome.   Marcus Dunstan is perpetually smiling, speaking in a small voice from a large, gentle face. Jade Pettyjohn is excitable, clearly enjoying being at the festival and also talking about this joyous diversion in her filmography. We couldn’t help but jump right in.

Read the full article on AICN In some exciting news circulating the internet, it would seem that the ex-head of film at Netflix Scott Stuber is reviving the once legendary United Artists label through new partners Amazon MGM Studios. Founded in 1919 by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickforth, D.W.Griffith and famed actor and filmmaker Douglas Fairbanks, United Artists began as a studio that would allow artists to control their own careers and artistic vision instead of being controlled by Hollywood moneymen. After decades of success, Metro Goldwyn Mayer bought the company over in 1981 for an unheard-of 350 million dollars and continued to release movies under the brand MGM/UA through the rest of the 80s, 90s and 2000s. United Artists are responsible for releasing some of the most classic movies of all time including The Mark of Zorro (1920), D.W.Griffith’s final film The Struggle (1931), The Great Dictator (1941), Alexander the Great (1956), Robert Mitchum’s Thunder Road (1958), The Magnificent Seven (1960), Dr. No (1963), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), Rocky (1976), Annie Hall (1977), Raging Bull (1980) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) to name but a few.  Jennifer Salke (Head of Amazon MGM Studios) had this to say about the resurrection:   “With his proven track record of delivering global hits and an eye towards theatrical fare, Scott’s expertise and vision align perfectly with our film strategy. We are so proud to welcome him on the relaunch of the legendary UA brand, as we work to leverage existing and new IP into big, broad films Finish the article on AICN HouseOfMacleodSat, 27 Jul 2024 01:22:00 +000083578Fanhome Launches The Legends of Batman Collectionhttps://www.aintitcool.com/fanhome-legends-of-batman-collection-83577/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=comicsFanhome, a subscription-based models and collections service, launches a Batman collection for the ages.

From Year Zero to Year 100, this collection promises to tell the most definitive stories of the Caped Crusader in beautifully reproduced glossy hardcovers, each with bonus content such as variant covers, concept art, and creator notes.   \"From the moment Bruce Wayne becomes The Caped Crusader to his final days in the future, this collection brings together essential Batman tales in a book series that belongs on every bookshelf.\"   New volumes arrive monthly, and the series is MASSIVE.

I’ve had quite a couple months, and I wish I could say that I was gallivanting around the globe, but not this time. I’ve been sick a good chunk of it. In fact, I had quite a fever when I screened Murder Company, written by Jesse Mittelstadt and directed by Shane Dax Taylor. I don’t know that it would be fair to the filmmakers to review the film, given that I was feeling so awful while watching it that I don’t think my thoughts would necessarily be a true reflection of how the movie was. I will make a few observations, though.  First of all, Kelsey Grammer was my favorite thing about Murder Company, which is currently On Digital and On Demand, and I wanted him to have far more screen time. I love a serious Kelsey Grammer, and he's incredibly serious in this. Second, while there was far less graphic violence and gore than I would have expected from a war movie made in this day and age, the filmmakers seemed to compensate for that with the amount of people flying around, proving yet again that stunt men are insane. “Yeah, you can hurl me into that tree. Sure.” Finally, could we please stop having people engage in casual conversations while walking through enemy-occupied territories? I understand that it seems a good way to develop characters, but it drives me crazy every time anyone has a conversation at a normal volume as if they’re just strolling through the Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaFri, 12 Jul 2024 01:44:00 +000083575It May Only be July, but Here's a Trailer for THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER!https://www.aintitcool.com/bestchristmaspageantevertrailer2024-83574/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnewsIt May Only be July, but Here's a Trailer for THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER!

But when I got an email that said there was a new film coming out with Chuck Norris and Marc Singer, and would I like to talk to Marc Singer about it, I practically broke the sound barrier with my swift response of “hell to the yes!”     I’m a man of a certain age, and I grew up in the wilds of Southeast Texas. As I recall my rough and tumble childhood, I don’t say I’m from the streets - I’m from the roads. Concrete jungle films didn’t interest me quite as much as actual jungle films, so if you wanted my ticket money, throw an animal or two in your film. Want to see Clint Eastwood act with a monkey? Hell yes, take my money.   So for me there was no greater action franchise than the BEASTMASTER films starring Marc Singer. The Sword \u0026 Sorcery world of Conan distilled through the eyes and wings of beasts and marketed to a younger audience, it surprised me to learn that the films came out in the same year and were envisioned in relative ignorance of one another.

She’s the kind of person I could spend days just absorbing the stories that she tells with passion, energy, and humor. I found her so engaging. I hope you will, too. Check it out.  I want to start with a little icebreaker. What's the weirdest experience you've had while dating? “Oh. I don’t know if I've had that many weird things. I think I've got quite a high threshold of what weird would be. Yeah, I have. Also, I'm a serial monogamist, and I've been married twice. I was married for seven years, and the very first night I went out after the divorce – which was quite a long time after the divorce – I met my second husband, so I haven't really done much dating. I should have done a lot more. No, I honestly, I'm absolutely stumped. So unlike me. I think the only quote from that is, I have a very high threshold of weird.” You know, writers, you're creative, Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaFri, 10 May 2024 22:27:00 +000083571WIN a Signed Copy of Best-Selling Novel THE IMAGE OF YOU!!https://www.aintitcool.com/imageofyoubookcontest2024-83570/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=contestsWIN a Signed Copy of Best-Selling Novel THE IMAGE OF YOU!!

Barbarella here. The psychological thriller The Image of You examines duality in the form of twins, Zoe and Anna, who although they look identical, couldn’t be further apart. When sweet and naïve Anna meets a man and falls in love quickly, her bad-girl twin Zoe aims to test the strength of the relationship and the caliber of man who has captured her sister’s heart. The movie will be in select theaters and on Digital Friday, May 10.  I had an opportunity to speak with director Jeff Fisher about directing dual roles. Check it out!   I want to start with kind of a crazy icebreaker question, but what is the weirdest or craziest experience you've had dating, that you're willing to share? “Oh, my God. The weirdest or craziest experience I've had dating. This is not going to paint me in a very good light. I will tell you, my last long-term relationship, we met at a bar. I don't know if this was dating. We made out in the back of the bar for three and a half hours, on our first meeting, so it was an egregious public display of affection, and just shameless. I guess that would be my weirdest, but it was great. It didn't show a lot of couth, but there we go. I'll go with that.” Couth is overrated. How did you get involved in The Image of You?  “The production company helped with distribution on my first feature back in 2008.

In this post-apocalyptic era, the earth’s oxygen level has reached a not-fit-for-life amount, yet one family has survived thanks to the engineering genius and survivalistic skills of Darius (Common). He, his wife, Maya (Jennifer Hudson), and their daughter, Zora (Quvenzhané Wallis) live in a DIY-tech dwelling amidst the ruins. When Darius ventures out and remains gone longer than expected, Zora, who has learned much from her dad, attempts to reach out, bringing unwanted consequences.   I caught up with director Stefon Bristol to chat a bit about his personal journey, Breathe, and working with its cast. Check it out! I feel a little sleep-deprived today. Do you find that as a director, you're more sleep-deprived than the average person? “Definitely. When you're working on set, or you're doing pre-production, or you're in post, definitely. But this is what I love to do for my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.\" How did you get into directing? I know you worked with Spike Lee, but what interested you about it?  “Directing? I grew up in Brooklyn. I grew up in Coney Island. When I was a kid, I was watching DVDs with director's commentary and special features, behind the scenes. I had the Jurassic Park DVD, and I would watch all the time the behind the scenes, because I was always fascinated on how they made Jurassic Park and whatnot.

Barbarella here. Did you know that there’s a new drama about a hitman coming to Digital and On Demand tomorrow, April 19? French language film DUSK FOR A HITMAN may be based on a true story, but it includes its share of fiction. Written by Martin Gerard and Raymond St-Jean, who also directed, the film transports viewers back to the late 70’s, early 80’s as the most feared hitman in Montreal finds himself a target.  Make no mistake. This is not a John Wick action-packed assault on your senses. No, DUSK FOR A HITMAN plants itself firmly in the realm of drama.   While I like the film, portions of the story feel quite familiar to me because I recently finished the Max series TOKYO VICE, which includes a similar narrative around a gangster and his brother who wants to be in the life. I feel it’s unfair to compare the two, because they handle the subject differently, and the series has the time to really flesh out the characters and situations over several episodes. The added time granted allows a deeper connection to the characters than DUSK FOR A HITMAN’s runtime provides. That said, Érik Bruneau’s performance as a conflicted man truly enhances the movie’s impact. The film also beautifully captures the vibe of the era and removes the glamour from the gangster lifestyle.  I had the opportunity to speak with director and co-writer Raymond St-Jean. Check it out, mes amis!    This movie is based on an actual person, and Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaThu, 18 Apr 2024 21:50:00 +000083566SLEEPING DOGS co-writer/director Adam Cooper in Conversationhttps://www.aintitcool.com/sleeping-dogs-director-adam-cooper-interview-83565/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsSLEEPING DOGS co-writer/director Adam Cooper in Conversation with McEric about thriller starring Russell Crowe and Karen Gillan Read the full article on AICN Opening today in theaters only is the new mind-bending thriller from writer/director Adam Cooper SLEEPING DOGS, starring Russell Crowe, Karen Gillan, Tommy Flanagan, and Márton Csókás. The synopsis reads “An ex-homicide detective (Russell Crowe) with memory loss is forced to solve a brutal murder he can't recall. But as evidence uncovers secrets tied to his forgotten past, he is led to a chilling truth - sometimes, it's best to let sleeping dogs lie.”   Check out the trailer:   Now if the synopsis and the trailer make the film seem predictable to you, you’d totally be forgiven. Maybe you’re like me and you’ve seen enough movies to know that the “chilling truths” are almost always exactly what you think they are. What SLEEPING DOGS offers, however, is a clever deconstruction of a brilliant mind, double-turned-triple-crosses, a femme fatale to truly die for, and stellar performances from everyone in attendance. There are practically zero sour notes in the film, and it is fun to watch with a friend and pause as you give your predictions, à la a spirited game of CLUE, to see who comes closest to the final conclusion.   Russell Crowe is wonderful in the role of Roy Freeman, a former detective who is living a labeled life as he struggles with dementia brought about by a damning automobile accident. When a man he put away is facing execution, Roy takes it upon himself to re-investigate a decade-old murder despite often failing to recall his own name.

Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie.  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter: Bless You.  Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.  Stuart: Thank you.   Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?  Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

    "description": "\"It's good for me. Makes me feel useful.\" Netflix has revealed an official trailer for a comedy series called A Man on the Inside, which will be streaming later in November. This is the next series from Mike Schur, known for creating \"Parks \u0026 Rec\", \"The Good Place\", \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\". This time he's borrowing from another source - this fun series is based on Oscar-nominated Chilean documentary film called The Mole Agent, which was included as one of my favorite documentaries of 2020. Retired professor Charles feels life has nothing new in store for him. He’s become stuck in his routine and grown distant from his daughter. But when he spies a classified ad from a private investigator, he’s inspired to roll the dice on a new adventure, going undercover into the Pacific View Retirement Home in San Francisco to solve the mystery of a stolen family heirloom. Ted Danson stars with Mary Elizabeth Ellis, Stephanie Beatriz, Lilah Richcreek Estrada, Stephen McKinley Henderson, and a cast including: Sally Struthers, Margaret Avery, John Getz, Susan Ruttan, Lori Tan Chinn, Clyde Kusatsu, Marc Evan Jackson, Jama Williamson, Wyatt Yang, and Deuce Basco.

    "description": "\"This is our chance... to show 'em who's boss!\" Prime Video has unveiled an official trailer for a new comedy crime / heist thriller series called The Sticky, which will be streaming starting in December later this year. It's inspired by the true story known as the \"Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist\" - which really happened in 2011 \u0026 2012. Officially, according to the numbers, it is the \"most valuable heist in Canadian history!\" How dare anyone steal that precious liquid gold. \"Mayhem, murder, and maple syrup.\" The Sticky is a comedy-drama series about Ruth Landry, a maple syrup farmer who, in defiance of a heartless system, assembles a team of misfits to undertake the Canadian heist of the century. The target: the country's multi-million dollar maple syrup surplus. The acclaimed Margo Martindale stars as Ruth in this, with a series cast featuring Chris Diamantopoulos, Guillaume Cyr, Guy Nadon, Gita Miller, Mickaël Gouin, and Suzanne Clément. Oscar \u0026 Emmy winner Jamie Lee Curtis also appears as a guest star in the series (and in this trailer). Extra kooky with crime antics bouncing between Fargo to Super Troopers.
