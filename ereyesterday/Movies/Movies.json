    "description": "Barbarella Declares BRING HER BACK is an Intense Depiction of the Effects of Grief Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here still reeling from the incredibly intense Australian horror flick Bring Her Back, which comes out on May 30th. Not for the weak of heart, this follow-up from the minds behind Talk to Me grips one’s innards early on and doesn’t let go for the entire duration.  While themes of grief and the different ways individuals cope with loss may not be uncommon in cinema, Bring Her Back approaches the concept in a truly unique fashion through the individuals involved and the manner in which their stories are told.  Sora Wong debuts as the young Piper. Giving a powerhouse performance, she proves that a face doesn’t have to be recognizable to bring the awesomeness. While Piper may be the nucleus of the story, it’s not just her, but also those around her, who drive the points, like nails, into your soul.  I’ll start with Sally Hawkins, whom you may recognize from The Shape of Water. Her portrayal of the adoptive parent is nothing short of exceptional. Nuanced when necessary, flat out psycho when required, she navigates the extremes and subtleties like a master.  While I could ramble about Sally Hawkins more, let’s move on to Jonah Wren Phillips. He’s incredible as the creepy kid, but it’s in those moments where we glimpse his humanity that this young talent shines. I should warn you, though, if he’s onscreen, the odds of you feeling uncomfortable increase 85%. Owning the most disturbing scenes, he can be hard to watch at times.

    "description": "McEric takes a look at some of the films screening at this year's Tribeca Film Festival in NYC from June 4th - 15th. Read the full article on AICN The Tribeca Film Festival is set to descend once again upon New York City this June 4th through 15th. Begun in 2002 by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff, the festival sought to revitalize Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks and has since become one of the premiere film festivals of North America. This year, alone, the programmers narrowed down their selections from over 13,000 submissions. This year's line-up boasts 95 world premieres from filmmakers across 36 countries, collecting everything from feature films to shorts, episodic content, audio storytelling, interactive games, and more.  I'll be on site for several days of the festival to screen films and speak with attending talent, so let's take a look at some of the selections that made my shortlist of interest: First off, the big trend this year is music documentaries - the festival has programmed at least fifteen music-based films, beginning with the opening night gala selection BILLY JOEL: AND SO IT GOES. The festivities will likely be more of a eulogy than a celebration due to recent developments, but it's still nice to kick off a definitively New York festival with one of the City's own beloved sons as the subject of its inaugural film. Other documentaries that feature prominently are METALLICA SAVED MY LIFE, BILLY IDOL SHOULD BE DEAD, BOY GEORGE 7 CULTURE CLUB, DEPECHE MODE: M, I WAS BORN THIS WAY: CARL BEAN, MOVE YA BODY: THE BIRTH OF HOUSE, and THE SIXTH BOROUGH. This final film made my shortlist as Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"When you choose a path, you don't get to see the other ones.\" One of the common themes amongst many films at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival is an appreciation for finding love any way that works for you, and being honest with yourself about your romantic desires. Many of the films about romance or relationships at Cannes this year focus on how unconventional \u0026 decidedly unique love should be the new norm. Instead of traditional relationships, following the basic trends that have been the norm of decades, break free and be with whoever it is you love because they connect with you. It's always a challenge, but always worth it. One of the best films about exactly this love story is Amour Apocalypse, also retitled as Peak Everything in English (which I don't think is the right title - the original is much better). It's a remarkably calm, somewhat quiet, charming little indie film from Quebec - about a lonely middle-aged guy who runs a dog shelter who meets a woman on a phone line. At first I wasn't so sure what to make of it, however as time goes on the film remains with me, there's a peculiar […]",

    "description": "\"Everyone is talking about the Comeback Kid - Happy Gilmore!\" He's back for more golf mayhem! During their Tudum event, Netflix revealed the main official trailer for Happy Gilmore 2, the highly anticipated, long-awaited legacy sequel to one of Adam Sandler's funniest movies - 1996's Happy Gilmore. It'll be out for streaming on July 25th - in just a few months this summer. 29 years after the original comedy hit theaters in 1996, Happy is back! But not in theaters this time. He ends up on the golf course again for a comeback tour with a new caddy \u0026 scruffier beard. Returning with co-stars Julie Bowen \u0026 Christopher McDonald. The cast in this one includes Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio aka Bad Bunny as his caddy, Margaret Qualley, Ben Stiller, Benny Safdie, Travis Kelce, and Nick Swardson. After the teaser, this is finally a proper trailer that actually has some funny jokes in it, along with endless references to the first movie, of course. I am hopeful this will turn out entertaining and not a complete disaster! We'll find out soon enough.
