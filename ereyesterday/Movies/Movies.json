    "description": "McEric talks to director Greg Kohs and producer Gary Krieg about the new documentary THE THINKING GAME Read the full article on AICN It’s apparent that we’re living in the future, but how did we get here? Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world. Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis.   Demis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents.    During a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called Theme Park. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence.   For the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

The Writers Guild of America has announced the winners of the 2025 WGA Awards. Last year, the big WGA winners were The Holdovers (Original), written by David Hemingson, and American Fiction (Adapted), written by Cord Jefferson adapted from the novel \"Erasure\" by Percival Everett. What have fellow writers determined to be the best scripts of 2024? The winners: Anora (Original), written by filmmaker Sean Baker, plus Nickel Boys (Adapted), written by RaMell Ross and Joslyn Barnes; based on the book \"The Nickel Boys\" by Colson Whitehead. Mark Monroe also won the Best Documentary award for Jim Henson: Idea Man (on D+). I'm happy about all of the winners - Anora and Nickel Boys are two of my favorite films from 2025 anyway. There were many fantastic scripts last year, it's hard to choose just one winner among all of them. Which scripts do you think deserve awards? Which films have the best dialogue?

    "description": "\"Great – now we're all stuck here with a murderer!\" Gravitas has debuted the trailer for an indie mystery thriller titled Death 4 Dinner, which will be out on VOD in March. The latest film produced \u0026 directed by Lana Read, even though you've never heard of any of her previously films. \"The devil is in the details.\" A savvy Detective and his partner attempt to unravel the mysterious sudden death of a prominent Senator, while simultaneously navigating his insanely quirky family \u0026 their fierce appetites for the now dead father's money. The film's cast includes Michael Paré, Wendell Kinney, John Savage, Cyril O'Reilly, Jessica Dawn Willis, Erik Fellows, Carly Wheeler, and Lenny Robinson. This sounds and looks like such a derivative film with an extra generic whodunit plot about greed \u0026 murder and all the usual shenanigans that come with these things. Despite its funny title, I don't think there's much of anything worthwhile about this. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Lana Read's thriller Death 4 Dinner, direct from YouTube: Savvy Detective Noah Rafferty (Michael Pare) and his partner (Wendell Kinney) attempt to unravel the mysterious sudden death of a prominent Ohio Senator (Cyril O'Reilly) while simultaneously […]",
