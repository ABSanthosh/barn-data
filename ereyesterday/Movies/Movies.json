    "description": "Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE Read the full article on AICN Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN",

Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie.  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter: Bless You.  Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.  Stuart: Thank you.   Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?  Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

    "description": "\"Everything about this film feels incredibly authentic. It's a true portrayal of London.\" Apple TV has just unveiled a behind-the-scenes featurette providing a quick look at Steve McQueen's latest - a WWII drama set in London called Blitz. Taking place during the bombings on London at the start of WWII, following a young boy lost in the city. This premiered at the 2024 London \u0026 NYFF Film Festivals and will be opening in November in theaters first before it's later on Apple TV to stream at home. Nice to see McQueen on set in some of this footage. A defiant young boy goes on an adventure running around London during the war only to find himself in immense peril, while a distraught Rita searches for her missing son. Saoirse Ronan is Rita, with Elliott Heffernan as her 9-year-old son George. The full ensemble cast in this features Harris Dickinson, Benjamin Clementine, Kathy Burke, Paul Weller, Stephen Graham, CJ Beckford, Leigh Gill, Mica Ricketts, Alex Jennings, Joshua McGuire, Hayley Squires, Erin Kellyman and Sally Messham.

The 14-minute short is made by Nick Martini and Stept Studios with remarkable shots and recreations. In 1982, mountain rescue volunteers attempt to locate and retrieve missing hikers lost in a snow storm up on New Hampshire's Mount Washington (see Google Maps) - known as one of the coldest places. \"A tale of resilience, grit and about how an attempted rescue changed not only the course of two climbers' lives - but also the future of prosthetics, forever.\" The filmmakers add: \"We created this film alongside a team of incredible filmmakers who share a profound love for the mountains and the communities that surround them. Two years on, this story continues to resonate deeply with us all.\" With Joe Lentini, Hugh Herr, Alexa Siegel, Paul Cormier.
