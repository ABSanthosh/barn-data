    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Adores THE LIFE OF CHUCK Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here. Have I ever told you what a huge Stephen King fan I am? It started when a teenage me read Pet Sematary and became so enthralled with the author’s work that my mom’s Christmas shopping became immensely easier. She started gifting me Stephen King books for every Christmas and birthday thereafter, knowing I would eagerly devour every page. I did, with relish. Eventually, I began working my way through movies based on his works. Some ventured from the source material in ways I didn’t appreciate, but when I heard Mike Flanagan would be tackling one of King’s short stories, The Life of Chuck, I knew I’d love it. And I did. Mike Flanagan, who’s responsible for my favorite horror miniseries, The Haunting of Hill House, and who was the mastermind who brought Doctor Sleep to screens, remains incredibly faithful to the source material, including how it’s told in three acts using reverse chronology. It’s a film that offers a feast of reflection on life, but I suspect some will dig in more ravenously than others. This is a story about those magical moments in life, the influence others have on our lives, and the decisions we make day to day that steer us one way or another.  Narrated by Nick Offerman, the film begins ominously enough, with the world seemingly coming to an end. Natural and unnatural disasters plague the planet, and as if that’s not bad enough, the internet also appears to be out, possibly for good this time. Uncertainty and fear weigh Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"I suspect 'you' aren't the only secret he kept...\" Acorn TV has revealed an official trailer for a new mystery thriller series titled Irish Blood, arriving to watch on Acorn TV later this summer. There is another series called Blood on Acorn TV, but it's unrelated. Alicia Silverstone (who has British parents) stars as divorce lawyer Fiona Fox who receives a message from her estranged father, embarking on a journey to Ireland. Her path in life is earmarked by her father, Declan, who seemingly abandoned her and her mother on her 10th birthday. In Ireland, she uncovers family truths and her father's dark past, realizing her life's abandonment story was a protective lie. Silverstone also adds: \"Irish Blood is the story of a woman discovering herself and confronting her past after traveling abroad unexpectedly. I love how unpredictable the storytelling feels and the combination of drama, humor, and suspense my character experiences.\" The series also features Wendy Crewson, Jason O'Mara, Dearbhla Molloy, Simone Kirby, Ruth Codd, \u0026 Leonardo Taiwo. Shot on location in Ireland (and it looks beautiful there, of course). Worth watching just to explore the island. 🇮🇪 Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Acorn TV's Ireland series […]",

Oslo-based filmmaker Martin Sofiedal has just debuted his latest creation - a Men in Black fan film tilted Neuralize This! The last real MIB movie they made was Men in Black: International in 2019 (but it got bad reviews) so I'm intrigued that someone is still making fan films for this sci-fi franchise. MIB: Neuralize This! is a fan-made MIB short film — a gooey, action-comedy tribute where nothing goes according to protocol. Two agents try to contain an alien incident, but end up dealing with a malfunctioning neuralizer, a Nerf gun, a confused child, and a very angry Polish muscle man. Starring Torgny Gerhard Aanderaa and Cecilie Svendsen, with Eirik Hallert and Lijana Brahimi. With VFX by the same company doing the VFX on Troll 2. It's just the right amount fun using the MIB concept and gimmicks. Everyone wishes they had one of these neuralizers, right? Thanks to Martin for the tip on this short.
