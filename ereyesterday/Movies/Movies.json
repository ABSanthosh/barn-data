    "description": "Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE Read the full article on AICN Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN",

Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie.  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter: Bless You.  Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.  Stuart: Thank you.   Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?  Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

    "description": "\"Resistance to evil must be uncompromising.\" Picturehouse has revealed the full trailer for a documentary film called Porcelain War, an award-winning film that brings us into Ukraine during the ongoing war. It has won tons of awards at many film festivals, including the Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary at Sundance 2024, and Audience Award at the Nantucket Film Festival. Under roaring fighter jets, Ukrainian artists Slava, Anya, and Andrey choose to stay behind. Defiantly finding beauty amid destruction, they show that although it's easy to make people afraid, it's hard to destroy their passion for living. \"Porcelain War is a story far bigger than Ukraine, it’s an unforgettable story about all of us. It’s about the human need to create, to restore meaning and beauty in the darkest of times,\" said co-director Slava Leontyev. Critics say the film \"masterfully illustrates the enduring power of art in the face of adversity.\" It'll be opening in US theaters this fall as part of an awards season run in hopes of getting an Oscar nomination next year.

    "description": "\"I've got a favor to ask. I want to see my Mom.\" 🐈 GKids has unveiled their main official US trailer for the Japanese animated film Ghost Cat Anzu, ready to play on the big screen starting this November. This film initially premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival and it already opened in Japanese cinemas earlier this summer. It's a rotoscoped 2D anime movie that's co-directed by the great Nobuhiro Yamashita, who often makes live-action films. A distinctly humorous anime. Precocious tween Karin finds herself abandoned by her father in rural Japan. Living in a temple with her grandfather, she meets Anzu, a giant \"ghost cat\" and notorious \"layabout\" tasked with looking after her. Distrustful of her new guardian and his informality, she also befriends the eccentric local forest spirits. Mirai Moriyama plays the titular Anzu, and Noa Gotō voices Karin. Both played their characters live-action that became the reference for the animators, with both their dialogue and their movements being turned into animation (seen here). I'm glad they're giving this a proper theatrical release in the US! It's a smart, amusing, unique little film that is absolutely worth a watch. Here's the official US trailer (+ Japanese poster) […]",
