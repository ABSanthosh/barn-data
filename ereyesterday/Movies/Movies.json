Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world. Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis.   Demis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents.    During a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called Theme Park. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence.   For the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"You trying to steal from me?\" \"Just protecting my family.\" Saban Films has debuted the official trailer for a junky action crime thriller called High Rollers, the latest from filmmaker Randal Emmett also know as Ives. The film is now ready to launch in March and will be available on VOD right away if anyone out there cares. It's a surprise sequel to Cash Out (from last year) which also starred Travolta as a thief. In this follow-up, master thief Mason is pulled back in for a big casino heist that he must complete in order to get the love of his life back from his ruthless nemesis Salazar. Will he be able to outsmart him and the casino? The cast features John Travolta back as Mason Goddard again, with Gina Gershon, Lukas Haas, Quavo, Kelly Greyson, Swen Temmel, and Demián Castro. This is pretty much just a knock off Ocean's Eleven with Travolta as the heist leader - and it doesn't even look remotely watchable. Skip this one \u0026 save your money. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Randall Emmett's film High Rollers, direct from YouTube: Master thief Mason (John Travolta) is living the criminal's dream: island-hopping with […]",

    "description": "Year after year, the Sundance Film Festival in Utah continues to be one of the most important launching grounds for documentary films. They've been programming \u0026 featuring some of the finest documentaries ever made throughout their 40+ year history. But most of these doc films (or docs for short) rarely get much attention. Some critics ignore them; the media only covers the few they can turn into topical stories. While most screenings are full, it's hard to get anyone to care about many of these doc films after their premiere. It's one of the best aspects of the Sundance Film Festival – many other major fests like Cannes and Venice and AFI Fest always push docs to the side. A few will make the cut, but not enough, and most of these fests don't have sections specifically to showcase docs in their own category. Above all else, the overall quality of doc films that Sundance shows is exceptional – they bring in the best of the best every single year. It's quite exciting. One of my colleagues Anthony Kaufman just wrote an article for the International Documentary Association claiming that \"Sundance May Now Be the World’s Most Important Documentary Launchpad.\" […]",
