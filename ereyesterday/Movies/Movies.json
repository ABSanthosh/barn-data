    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric reviews (new) releases RAGING MIDLIFE and AMERICAN DREAMER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a quick review of two (new) releases hitting the market this St. Patrick's Day Weekend, both of which I actually enjoyed. RAGING MIDLIFE First was RAGING MIDLIFE, a movie that was pitched to me as starring Paula Abdul (I'm a massive fan), Eddie Griffin (DOUBLE TAKE), Walter Koenig (STAR TREK), and Motch O. Mann, the world's foremost Macho Man Randy Savage impersonator. Yeah, I hear it, too. Luckily, I didn't read any further. I saw Paula Abdul's name and shouted \"I'm in!\" Going in to this film blind is the best way to see it. As I'm furnishing you with a review, however, I must speak further to the film. If you want to skip down to AMERICAN DREAMER and go in blind, I do suggest it. Otherwise, here we go. The film, written by Nic Costa and Rob Taylor, and directed by the latter, follows childhood friends Alex and Mark, now in their midlives (see that?) who are chasing their dragon - a purple tanktop once worn by their favorite wrestler, Raging Abe. Raging Abe is a Macho Man Randy Savage-type character who wears a stove pipe hat and chin beard and lives by five \"proclamations,\" all meant to help his young fans navigate life and walk as better people. The film opens with grainy footage of a talk show appearance (think Arsenio Hall) from Raging Abe and his handler, Mary Todd, played by Abdul. The action opens in the eighties with young Alex and Mark ringside Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"Stop thinking! Breathe!\" What the funk is this?! Level 33 Ent. has revealed an official trailer for a strange indie thriller tilted Electra, made by Bahraini filmmaker Hala Matar. Not to be confused with the Marvel movie Elektra from 2005. This Electra follows two journalists who travel to the lush Italian villa of a famous musician and his partner for an interview, but all is not as it seems — the trip spirals into deceit \u0026 deadly betrayals. Hala Matar teases: \"Electra is a film about lies and deceit, where characters wear metaphorical masks to impress or manipulate others. The unicorn, representing the mask of innocence, is drawn from a painting central to the film's plot — something I'd rather keep a mystery for now.\" The cast features Maria Bakalova, Abigail Cowen, Jack Farthing, and Daryl Wein. This looks very kooky and peculiar, more experimental \u0026 conceptual than clever, borrowing from The Talented Mr. Ripley. It's worth a look anyway. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Hala Matar's film Electra, direct from Level 33's YouTube: A journalist and his female companion (Abigail Cowen) travel to interview a famous musician in Rome where a generous invite to a country […]",

Seriously. Bleecker Street's new movie The Friend is now playing in movie theaters nationwide - one of my favorite films from 2024 (it premiered at TIFF last year - my review). To bring some additional attention to the release, they cut together a very fun \"Bing and Messi FaceTime\" promo - connecting two of the most talented canine movie stars in cinema history. Messi is the French Border Collie dog who starred in Justine Triet's Anatomy of a Fall, appearing at the Oscars in an iconic bit where the dog claps in his seat. Bing the Dog is an enormous, lovable, super cute Great Dane pooch who stars in The Friend, giving one heck of a good boy performance. Seriously. Bing plays Apollo, and Messi plays Snoop, both of them giving two of the finest dog performances that have very important roles in the movie. They're not just best friends, they're key parts of the cast and the story. This is just a funny video […]",
