    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

An official trailer has debuted for a super wacky, low budget indie comedy called Cuisine de la 'Pocalypse, from filmmaker Kyle Weingart. Set to debut in theaters during the next few months. 10 years after the world as we know it ends, one aspiring chef refuses to give up on his dreams and creates the apocalypse's first cooking show. For John, it will take more than the end of the world for him to give up on his dream of getting his cooking show \"out there\". John lives in the Gilligan Island-esc town of New Missoula. After he uploads his show to the town’s makeshift internet service, the apocalyptic town’s exact location becomes known to the world. The film stars Kevin Jack as John, Kevin Sorbo, Natasha Leggero, Emilio Rivera, Zuzu Weingart, \u0026 Braeden Sorbo. Another of these films you'd find in the back of a VHS store and laugh at because it is so dumb \u0026 goofy, but that's the whole point.

This is a very short 40-sec promo featurette, with nothing but behind-the-scenes shots edited together and no other dialogue besides a few fun quips from Charlize Theron. Some of you may remember the first The Old Guard movie was released on Netflix back in 2020. Go behind the scenes of The Old Guard 2 and get a taste of the insane action coming your way this year — keep your eyes peeled for new faces and one shocking return. Huh. Andy and her team of immortal warriors return to protect humanity from a formidable new enemy who threatens their existence. The Old Guard 2 features Charlize Theron, KiKi Layne, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, Matthias Schoenaerts, Vân Veronica Ngô, with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Uma Thurman, and Henry Golding, too. I was not a fan of the first movie and I'm not sure this one will be any better. We'll see. Stay tuned for the full trailer soon.
