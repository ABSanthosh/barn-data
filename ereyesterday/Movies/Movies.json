Flophouses are cheap, run-down motels where many people are forced to live when they cannot afford better housing. For her feature documentary debut, Strømdahl spent many years touring such places in America and taking photos of their inhabitants. Then she met Mikal, […]",

    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric reviews (new) releases RAGING MIDLIFE and AMERICAN DREAMER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a quick review of two (new) releases hitting the market this St. Patrick's Day Weekend, both of which I actually enjoyed. RAGING MIDLIFE First was RAGING MIDLIFE, a movie that was pitched to me as starring Paula Abdul (I'm a massive fan), Eddie Griffin (DOUBLE TAKE), Walter Koenig (STAR TREK), and Motch O. Mann, the world's foremost Macho Man Randy Savage impersonator. Yeah, I hear it, too. Luckily, I didn't read any further. I saw Paula Abdul's name and shouted \"I'm in!\" Going in to this film blind is the best way to see it. As I'm furnishing you with a review, however, I must speak further to the film. If you want to skip down to AMERICAN DREAMER and go in blind, I do suggest it. Otherwise, here we go. The film, written by Nic Costa and Rob Taylor, and directed by the latter, follows childhood friends Alex and Mark, now in their midlives (see that?) who are chasing their dragon - a purple tanktop once worn by their favorite wrestler, Raging Abe. Raging Abe is a Macho Man Randy Savage-type character who wears a stove pipe hat and chin beard and lives by five \"proclamations,\" all meant to help his young fans navigate life and walk as better people. The film opens with grainy footage of a talk show appearance (think Arsenio Hall) from Raging Abe and his handler, Mary Todd, played by Abdul. The action opens in the eighties with young Alex and Mark ringside Finish the article on AICN",

I have been attending the Sundance Film Festival longer than any other festival – next year it will be the 20th year in a row that FirstShowing has covered Sundance. It was the first festival I attended as a member of the press, and I've been going non-stop ever since 2007. I feel a deep connection to Sundance, not only because of the mountains \u0026 snow, but I sort of grew up going to this festival every year since I was 20 years old. I originally grew up in Colorado Springs, CO before moving away to Los Angeles and New York and Berlin – but I still fly back to Utah year after year. For the last 44 years, Sundance has been based in Park City, Utah, a ski resort town outside of Salt Lake City. The fest started out as the US Film Festival in SLC in 1978, moved to Park City in 1981, only becoming known as \"Sundance\" in 1984.
