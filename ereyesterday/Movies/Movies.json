    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Adores THE LIFE OF CHUCK Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here. Have I ever told you what a huge Stephen King fan I am? It started when a teenage me read Pet Sematary and became so enthralled with the author’s work that my mom’s Christmas shopping became immensely easier. She started gifting me Stephen King books for every Christmas and birthday thereafter, knowing I would eagerly devour every page. I did, with relish. Eventually, I began working my way through movies based on his works. Some ventured from the source material in ways I didn’t appreciate, but when I heard Mike Flanagan would be tackling one of King’s short stories, The Life of Chuck, I knew I’d love it. And I did. Mike Flanagan, who’s responsible for my favorite horror miniseries, The Haunting of Hill House, and who was the mastermind who brought Doctor Sleep to screens, remains incredibly faithful to the source material, including how it’s told in three acts using reverse chronology. It’s a film that offers a feast of reflection on life, but I suspect some will dig in more ravenously than others. This is a story about those magical moments in life, the influence others have on our lives, and the decisions we make day to day that steer us one way or another.  Narrated by Nick Offerman, the film begins ominously enough, with the world seemingly coming to an end. Natural and unnatural disasters plague the planet, and as if that’s not bad enough, the internet also appears to be out, possibly for good this time. Uncertainty and fear weigh Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"It inhabits him now.\" \"Our boy is sick, that is all.\" Well Go USA has revealed an official trailer for an indie horror film titled Shaman, set in rural Ecuador. Made by filmmaker Antonio Negret, Shaman will debut to watch including on VOD starting in August this summer. Shot on location in Ecuador. A Missionary trying to convert an Indigenous Community on this remote Ecuadorian volcano must come to terms with her Faith when her son is possessed by dark forces. Candice believes that an exorcism in the Catholic tradition will free her boy from the evil bonds that bind him. The local shamans know that this spirit is older than her religion and must be dealt with or the demon will take them all. Starring Sara Canning, Daniel Gillies, Jett Klyne, Alejandro Fajardo, \u0026 Segundo Fuérez. It looks like it has some seriously creepy moments and actually unsettling jump scares. It's definitely not for the faint of heart! Stay away from ancient demons.

Every shot in this is absolutely jaw-dropping. This short film originally debuted back in 2017, but was recently reposted by National Geographic on their channel and it's a breathtaking must watch. Directed and shot by cinematographer Macgregor, the 13-min film is titled The Mauritania Railway - Backbone of the Sahara. \"One of the longest and heaviest trains in the world, the 1.8-mile beast runs from the mining center of Zouerat to port city of Nouadhibou on Africa’s Atlantic coast. The train is the bedrock of the Mauritanian economy and a lifeline to the outside world for the people who live along its route.\" The best \"holy shit\" shot is at 6:08. This video also adds an especially fascinating context to the outstanding film Sirat, which premiered to rave reviews at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival this year (here's mine).
