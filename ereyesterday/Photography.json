Check out the 60-second video below: Give this one a try, and you’ll super dig it. 🙂 Thanks To Everybody Who Join Us For Photoshop World 2024 The conference wrapped up yesterday (Hurricane and all), and I’m very grateful to all the folks who spent 3+ days with us learning, and laughing, and making friends. The weather here proved to be a challenge, but our team did an amazing job of keeping the trains on the tracks. I’m very grateful to Erik Kuna, Ron Ducan, Christina Sauer, Jason Stevens, Eric Hathaway, Juan Alfonso, Dobson “Gibmaster,” Kathy P (K-Pop), and our whole crew, who worked through it all and delivered an amazing conference with lots of “Lightroom learnin’.” Here’s wishing you a safe, dry weekend. #GoBucs, and #RollTide! -Scott The post How To Turn Any Collection Into a Favorite appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",

First, I taught a workshop in Norway, then after a few days with some dear friends in England. After that my wife flew over to London to meet me, where we boarded a cruise ship for a trip around England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and Northern Ireland, and back to Norway to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary. I put together a Web page (using Adobe Express) with some of my favorite images from before the workshop (during our scouting days) and then from the workshop (including lots of behind-the-scenes images). Lots to share and the story behind it all, if you’ve got a sec. Here’s a link to the images: https://new.express.adobe.com/webpage/r3WsEHRGQfqdj Thanks for giving ’em a quick look. 🙂 It’s great to be back, and I’ll be hitting ya with some more Lightroom tips later this week. 🙂 Cheers, -Scott The post I’m Back From Norway (and here’s some photos) appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",

    "description": "While exploring the Quick Actions on Lightroom web I also played around with the newly added adaptive presets you can access while editing in your web browser. Anyone needing to make quick edits can take advantage of these to leverage the power of subject detection to make adjustments in a single click. Open a photo into the editing space by clicking on it, then click the Presets icon to open the Presets panel. Among all the Premium (subscription required to access) presets, you’ll find the adaptive presets for portrait, sky, subject, and now blur background. Each of those represents a group of presets to achieve certain looks or starting points. The newest take advantage of the new Lens Blur panel (also accessible in Lightroom web), so let’s explore those. Click each preset to see how it affects your photo, and note there is a Reset Blur preset at the bottom to clear those adjustments. Also, you can click the undo arrow icon at the top of the panel to undo any change. You also need to click the Save button at the top to apply the settings in the preset and move on. Once you click a preset you’ll see an Amount slider allowing you to dial in the intensity of the settings. Once you are happy with the amount, click Save, then click the Edit icon to access all of the editing tool panels and fine tune the results. In the case of Lens Blur, you can further refine the Amount, Bokeh, and Focus Range to get the photo looking just the way you want. Click Save to finalize your settings, which will be synced across all other Lightroom apps, and you’re ready to move on to the next photo. Give it a spin! Photoshop World is fast approaching (September 24-26), and I hope you’ll join me and about 30 world-class instructors for multiple days of learning on Lightroom, Photoshop, and photography!

    "description": "It’s easy to forget about all the tools found at lightroom.adobe.com (aka, “Lightroom on the web” or just “Lightroom web”) since I have an actual Lightroom app on all of my devices. That said, every now and then Adobe sneaks a feature into Lightroom web that’s worth checking out. Recently, an early access feature (meaning still under development and subject to change) called Quick Actions appeared only in Lightroom web. You’ll need to go there in your web browser and log in with the same Adobe ID and password you use on your computer and mobile device for your subscription. Once logged in, and assuming you’ve imported photos into Lightroom or synced from Lightroom Classic, you’ll see your library. To test drive this new feature, click a photo you’d like to edit to access the editing tools available in the browser-based version of Lightroom. This new tool is the first one at the top, with the magic wand looking icon, and its name is Quick Actions. What makes this tool so different is that once you choose it, Quick Actions analyzes your photo and then shows buttons it thinks you might want to use on this photo to make it better. The buttons shown vary somewhat with the contents of the photo selected, but expect to see some presets, some single-click adjustments (like Auton tone), some adaptative presets based on subject, some background blur presets, and maybe the straightening tool (if the photo is crooked, or maybe that’s just mine). I just used the arrow keys on my keyboard to step through all of the photos in this album to see what adjustment options appeared. For this raw photo below, I clicked Auto light \u0026 color, Pop for subject (using a subject-based mask to apply settings to just what it considered the subject), and the Strong background blur button that I dialed back using the slider that appears under the button you click. The eyeball button at the top of the interface is a quick way to see before and after views of your progress. Now, would I have normally just used one of the Lightroom (including LrC in that) apps to make those edits manually? Yes. That said, for someone new to editing with Lightroom (or in a hurry to quickly edit and share out to social media or both), having the app analyze the photo and only surface adjustments it thinks you might want in a simplified format (buttons), this could be very useful. It is early access, so it will undoubtedly change before it becomes final (or maybe it will just go away never to be seen again?), but worth taking for a spin if you are curious. Would love to know what others think after trying.

    "title": "New Update for Syncing Catalog to Cloud",
    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/new-update-for-syncing-catalog-to-cloud/",
    "description": "The August update for Lightroom Classic, version 13.5, included an improvement to the way we can manage files that get stuck syncing. If you haven’t synced your Lightroom Classic catalog, but are curious about how to do it, be sure to check out my previous post on how to get started syncing. Also, be sure you’ve updated to the latest version by checking for updates in the Adobe Application Manager. Now, if you never experience syncing issues, then high five, you are living your best life. For the rest of us, sometimes, for reasons I do not know or understand, some number of photos just seem to be stuck syncing for (ever) a long time. I had this recently happen to me, so here’s how you can now try to resolve that situation. First, check the cloud icon to see what’s up. If it is in mid-sync you’ll see a blue syncing icon and if you hover your cursor over it a tooltip will appear showing how many photos are being synced. If it seems like this has been going on for some time the simplest thing can be to close and restart Lightroom Classic, which can be enough to clear the clog. If that doesn’t work, and you want to take matters into your own hands, click the cloud icon to open the cloud storage window and look for the gear icon. Click that gear icon to open the Lightroom Sync tab of the preferences and see what’s displayed in the Sync Activity section (this was restored with the recent update). If you’re not sure what photo is stuck, click that blue link to view that photo in Grid view of the Library showing the photo within its containing folder. Don’t delete the photo from here unless you want to delete the photo entirely from your catalog and hard drive. If you just want to remove it from being synced to clear that (and resync later if you choose) there are two ways to do this now. First, the old fashioned way, which is to leave the problem photo selected and go up to the Catalog panel and click All Synced Photographs. By leaving the photo selected you’ll see it is still the selected photo when viewing the contents of All Synced Photographs. If you think you will want to add it back to a synced collection later, an easy way to find it again is to drag it to the Quick Collection in the Catalog panel. Now, press Delete to remove it from being synced while leaving the source photo to remain in your catalog. You’ll see this popup telling you what will happen. Click OK to complete the process. The photo will be removed from all synced collections, which is important to realize what that means. In other words, it will clear it from being stuck syncing, but if you had it in more than one synced collection it will be removed from all of them. So make sure you know which synced collections it was in before you hit the delete button if you plan to add it back them all. In my case, this was an old photo that I no longer need synced, so just removing it from being synced solves my problem. Repeat for any other stuck photos and you should see the Sync Activity area clear out. The cloud icon will change to a green check mark showing everything as synced now. Here’s the second, and much simpler way to remove a photo from being synced thanks to this latest update. You’d only use this option once you knew what photo it was (click the link to check) and if it was in more than one synced collection that you may want to add it back into later. Once you know you want to remove it from being synced, just right-click that blue link and you’ll see a new option to Remove from All Synced Photographs. This is just a short cut from the first method I showed above, but it does result in a different looking popup message you have to click through before it is done. Hope that helps anyone with a photo stuck in the endless sync loop. To add it back to be synced, just drag it back to the synced collection it was in before (cross your fingers) and it should sync successfully.

But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",

Between homebound people snapping them up and all of the various broken supply chains, most of the bike inventory — other than very pricey specialty bikes — has pretty much vanished. Which means that if you have a functional bike in your garage that you don't need, it will likely never be worth more than it is right now. My daughter Emily has an unneeded bike in the garage. It's a Trek 7100, which is decent hybrid. She rode it to middle school. But she's just graduated college and won't be bringing it to her new job. But right now it should fetch a nice price in the Craigslist Bicycle Hunger Games. Especially if it is photographed and presented well. So that's exactly what we are going to do today: photograph a bike with a basic two speedlight kit.Read more »",

    "description": "There's something about shooting medium format — especially in black and white. The look is unmistakeable: creamy highlights supported by lush, detailed shadows. So it's perfectly understandable why many photographers shell out big bucks for pricey medium format gear. In fact, it's possible that some of you are at this very moment casually thinking about how cool it would be to shoot with a MF camera system. And why not? I mean, don't you deserve it? But a lot of the tonal qualities we often associate with medium format can be acheived on the cheap if you light your photos from the bottom end first. Take the photo above, which was shot with a small-chip Fuji, a kit zoom and a pair of small, $25 soft boxes. Read more »",

Because our goal is to learn to exist in a more fluid way along the Kelvin scale. Read more »",

    "description": "Watching the movie Joker, I felt repeatedly that I was watching a film that Greg Heisler could have lit. The use of color was unique, sophisticated and fearless — almost a character unto itself. In this outstanding 15-minute short produced by Vanity Fair, Joker cinematographer Lawrence Sher dissects his own use of light and color in the movie. Read more »",

    "description": "Photos by Sara Lando and David Hobby except where noted. Just as most of us are either right- or left-handed, it is said that we all have a dominant side of our brain as well. Left-brained people are supposed to be more analytical and methodical, whereas right-brained people are more artistic and creative. For most photographers, one of these two areas is probably a relative strength; the other a weakness. But ideally, you need the whole package. Which is something we were exploring earlier this month in Porto, Portugal. Read more »",

    "description": "COVID-19 Update: Thank you for your patience, and for your continued interest in in-person Strobist Lighting Workshops. To provide the safest possible environment for learning, we have paused the program until the end of the pandemic has been declared. Our current plan is to resume the workshops at that time. If you would like to be notified when we restart, make sure your name and contact into is on the interest list below. Thanks, David Strobist® Lighting Workshops Our classes are held as both single- an multi-day events. They have small class sizes and feature lots of time behind the camera. In the longstanding tradition of Strobist.com, our goal is to deliver as much value and knowledge as possible while keeping the costs economically accessible. We work in an environment of rotating small teams, with lots of one-to-one instruction. We have fun, and I can guarantee you'll have a solid understanding of lighting principles before you leave. Or I won't let you leave. Single day workshops are usually held near my home base in the Baltimore/Washington area, but are occasionally held elsewhere. That is why I am also collecting geo-information, so I can notify people if a one-day workshop would be occurring near their home. Extended lighting workshops (usually 2-3 days in length) are generally held in an area that is both economically accessible, and very much worth the trip. Because if you are going to travel for something like this, why not go to a cool destination? The goal for multi-day workshops is a fast-paced/fun/firehose weekend, in a fantastic setting, while working to keep everything to a manageable cost. Might Be Interested? Let Me Know. The interest sign-up list approach has proved to be both fair and efficient for our X-Peditions trips. So I am going to use that approach for single- and multi-day small-class lighting workshops as well. Here's how it works. 1. If you think you even might be interested in a single- or multi-day lighting workshop, please submit your name and email below. This confers no obligation on you whatsoever. 2. I do not sell, rent or otherwise share your email. Because I hate companies who do that. 3. When a lighting worksop is opened, you will be notified via email. Please note that being on this list is the only way to be notified of upcoming worksops. 4. Make sure to include your city/state/country, as that allows me to determine geo-based interest, and helps me to decide where to hold future workshops. That's it! Thanks, David Loading…",

    "link": "http://strobist.blogspot.com/2019/10/announcing-2-small-class-lighting.html",
    "description": "UPDATE: Both workshops filled very quickly. I only do these about once a year; apologies for the imbalance. I have set up a system so people who are potentially interested in future small-class lighting workshops can receive advance notice. More info here. __________ I'll be teaching two, full-day lighting workshops in the suburban Baltimore/DC area on December 6 and 7. They are two separate one-day events. These are small-group workshops, with a maximum class size of 12 people each day. These are shooting workshops, and you'll be behind (and/or in front of!) a camera for most of the day. Assuming you arrive at this class with a basic understanding of f/stops and shutter speeds, you will leave with a strong foundation in the fundamentals of off-camera lighting. You will be comfortable using single and multiple lights both alone and/or balanced with a mix of ambient lighting. All lighting gear will be provided. We will also provide lunch. You will need to bring a camera that is adjustable in manual mode and has a hot shoe connection for a flash, a lens that covers normal and/or portrait range, one or two fully charged batteries and an empty storage card. Maybe a notebook and pen if you like. That's it. Just show up ready to learn and to have fun. Leave the rest to me. Details Dates: December 6 and 7, 2019 Time: 9:30am - 5:30pm Price: $259 Location: Sandy Spring Friends Lyceum 17715 Meeting House Road Sandy Spring, MD 20860 Note; These are the only small-class lighting workshops I'll be teaching in the US this year. In the past, these have tended to fill very quickly. So if this is something you'd like to do, I'd suggest signing up sooner rather than later. Sign-Up Links Friday, December 6 [FRIDAY'S CLASS HAS BEEN FILLED] Saturday, December 7 [SATURDAY'S CLASS HAS BEEN FILLED]",
