  "text": "Design for trust, then for possibilityWhat the evolution of the horseless carriage to the robotaxi teaches us about periods of transitionTomás Del Coro from Fabulous Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, CC BY-SA 2.0I’ve been thinking a lot lately about transitional periods: those strange, in-between moments where the old world hasn’t fully left us and the new one hasn’t quite arrived. Times of technological change are even more interesting. You can recognize them as a time when new innovations replace our older systems, but you can still see traces of both as people figure out how to adapt.Often in this time, we see a design that has some features of the past and some of the future. Sometimes these features linger because we’re not quite ready to let them go. Other times, in order for the public to adopt something new, it needs to be close enough to the past that it still feels familiar and trustworthy.I am calling these vestigial designs. A design element of the past that has outstayed its usefulness but we haven’t quite figured out how to get rid of it.If you are older than 35 years old, you may have noticed that the “save” icon in most software programs is actually a picture of a tiny floppy disk.",
