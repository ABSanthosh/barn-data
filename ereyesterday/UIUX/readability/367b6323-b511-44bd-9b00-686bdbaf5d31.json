  "text": "On May 19, 1994, an iconic Seinfeld episode aired entitled “The Opposite.” In it, the show’s indisputably best character, George Costanza, has a revelation: every instinct he’s ever had has led him to failure. So, he decides to try something radical — he does the opposite. As the episode unfolds, this counterintuitive strategy works like magic: George gets the girl, lands his dream job, and moves into his dream apartment.Fast forward to 2008. Elon Musk, already a board member of Tesla, ascends to the CEO role, cementing his place in history as the leader of a company that would revolutionize the auto industry. Over the years, his list of leadership titles has grown to include CEO of SpaceX, Neuralink, and X (formerly Twitter), Chairman of SolarCity (now absorbed into Tesla), head of The Boring Company, and even self-appointed problem-solver-in-chief for the world’s biggest challenges through “The Department of Government Efficiency.”Musk is a busy man. And there’s no denying Musk is three things: a remarkable business success, a prolific executive, and — let’s be honest — a terrible leader.",
