There was unanimous consensus, among three chatbots, regarding specifying a set of four hues that addressed this criterion. However, there were slight differences in the color hex codes each GenAI tool noted. Let’s get started by reviewing the tetrad color harmony, color deficiencies and text-based GenAI systems.The Tetrad Color Harmony:Color harmony is the process of choosing colors on a color wheel that work well together in the composition of an image. Like concepts in music, these harmonies are based around color combinations on the color wheel that help to provide common guidelines for how color hues will work together. Isaac Newton is credited with creating the color wheel concept when he closed the linear color spectrum into a color circle in the early 1700s. An illustration of his concept is shown below. Artists and color scientists evolved and amplified his concept to include color harmonies.",
