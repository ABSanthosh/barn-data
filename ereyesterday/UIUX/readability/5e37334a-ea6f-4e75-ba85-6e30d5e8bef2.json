  "text": "Rethinking experiences for young people outside social media.Lucas and Mateus playing on the jungle gym after schoolAustralia has made the decision to ban children under 16 from accessing social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The Prime Minister said that it puts Australia at the vanguard of efforts to protect the mental health and well-being of children from detrimental effects of social media, such as online hate or bullying.This policy isn’t just a step forward for youth protection; it’s also a turning point for digital designers. Without social media, we need to rethink how we design for an audience outside the reach of algorithms. And that’s a good thing.My point here isn’t to debate the ban — which I fully support — but to explore what this means for digital services that rely on social media, and more importantly, for responsible design. This moment calls us to think beyond the obvious and embrace more thoughtful solutions focused on ethically protecting and engaging young people.How Teenage Girls Believe Each Social Media Feature Affects Them — Source: Common Sense / The New York Times. URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-dec-6-2023.htmlSocial login and the echoes of addictive designI had been following this topic closely, and the day the decision was announced, the impact on social login popped into my mind while I was driving. That thought is what led me to start writing, trying to understand how this change affects digital design more broadly.Social login is one of those brilliant ideas that ended up becoming a standard. It was marketed as the solution to everything: less friction, more speed, greater personalization. And indeed, it brought benefits:One-click formsAuto-validated profilesConvenient — at least it seems soBut convenience comes at a cost. Over the years, social login has become part of the machinery for services that not only depend on it but have built their strategies around hyper-personalized profiles and addictive algorithms. Additionally, the fact that young people are present on social media has enabled the creation of interfaces and interaction flows designed to maximize engagement, exploiting behaviors ranging from seeking social validation to binge consumption of content.If social login is removed from the equation, and if the presence of this audience on social platforms decreases, how will these services adapt? More importantly: is this the moment to rethink strategies that prioritize screen time over well-being?How Often Teens Say They Use Each Platform — Source: Pew Research Center / The New York Times. URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-dec-6-2023.htmlPractical impacts: Redesigning interfacesWithout social media as mediators, digital services need to adapt to this new landscape.1. The end of social login’s comfort zonePlatforms like games and educational tools must rethink entry flows without social login:Rethink entry flows: How do you avoid friction when social login is no longer an option?Offer more intuitive and secure methods, such as simplified email authentication.2. Identity management: A new burden for young peopleFor those who grew up with “one-click login,” creating and managing multiple accounts could become a new source of friction:More credentials to remember, more passwords to forget.A higher risk of losing access to important services.3. Redefining forms and experiencesForms need to evolve. Simplicity is no longer optional; it’s mandatory:Fewer fields, more automation.Clear instructions to ensure accurate data entry.The impact doesn’t stop thereWhen social media stops being the backbone of digital experiences:Personalization without profilesWithout direct access to social media data, how can we offer relevant content without invading users’ privacy? This is an invitation to explore personalization models that respect users rather than exploit them.An opportunity for healthy disconnectionWithout incessant notifications and endless feeds, young people can rediscover the world beyond screens. For designers, this means creating digital experiences that complement, rather than compete with, offline life.Parental responsibility and beyondPerhaps issues like this should be solved at home with community support, without state interference. I say this as a father of two children, with whom I work daily to balance screen time and offline activities. But the truth is that things have spiraled out of control. Unchecked access to social media goes beyond the family sphere and has already impacted society on a structural level. Decisions like this are necessary, even if they force us to rethink practices and responsibilities that should ideally be resolved at home.Responsible Design: A call for ethical innovationWe need to rethink our priorities as creators of digital experiences. It’s no longer about “engaging at all costs.” It’s about creating safe, educational experiences that respect boundaries and promote well-being.What do we need to do?Abandon addictive practices: Social media thrived by keeping us glued to screens. It’s time to break this cycle.How to Implement:Introduce Design Friction: Add conscious pauses or stopping cues, such as reminders to take breaks after a certain time of use.Transparent Metrics: Allow users to track their time spent and set usage limits within the app.Who’s Leading by Example:Apple’s Screen Time: Provides tools for users to monitor and limit app usage, fostering healthier digital habits.YouTube’s “Take a Break” Reminders: Prompts users to pause autoplay and step away from the platform.Headspace: A meditation app intentionally designed to guide users through focused sessions, avoiding distractions and excessive engagement.Make privacy the foundation: Design without relying on sensitive data or excessive collection.How to Implement:Adopt Privacy by Design Principles: Build systems that require minimal data to function and ensure user control over their information.Local Data Processing: Keep sensitive operations, such as biometric authentication, on the device rather than transferring data to external servers.Who’s Leading by Example:Apple: Processes Face ID and fingerprint data directly on devices, ensuring that sensitive information never leaves the user’s control.Signal: A messaging platform that uses end-to-end encryption and collects virtually no metadata, focusing on privacy-first communication.DuckDuckGo: Offers a search engine that avoids user tracking, prioritizing privacy without sacrificing usability.Promote digital education: Teach young people good habits at home, in schools, and within their communities.How to Implement:Collaborate with Schools: Develop tools and programs for educators to teach digital literacy.Create In-App Educational Features: Include modules or tips on safe and balanced internet use within platforms.Who’s Leading by Example:Google’s Be Internet Awesome: A program aimed at teaching children digital safety and citizenship through interactive games and resources.Common Sense Media: Offers curated content and advice to families, helping them make informed decisions about media consumption.Khan Academy: Provides educational resources and guidance on the ethical use of technology in learning environments.Designing a new tomorrowBanning social media for those under 16 is not a step backward; it’s progress. It’s an opportunity to rethink digital design and embrace more ethical and inclusive practices.If this wave reaches other countries, I hope we are ready — not just ready, but leading the way toward a more responsible and, above all, healthier digital future.Further readingTackling addictive social media practices:Harvard Health Publishing. “A Conversation About Reducing the Harms of Social Media.” Harvard Health Blog, November 5, 2021.O que é design viciante e por que a UE quer limitar seu uso?Deutsche Welle Brasil, June 15, 2024.Building trust through transparencyHoffmann, Rainer, et al. “Artificial Intelligence Disclosures Are Key to Customer Trust.” MIT Sloan Management Review, September 2023.Building User Trust In UX DesignSmashing Magazine, Published in 2021.Addictive design and social media:Lawrence, Matthew B., e Avraham R.
