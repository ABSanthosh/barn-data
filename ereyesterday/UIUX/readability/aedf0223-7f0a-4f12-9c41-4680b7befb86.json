  "text": "Exploring Generative AI Suggestions for Analogous Data Color SchemesAnalogous color harmonies refer to at least three colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. The color scheme can create pleasing color combinations but runs the risk of failing color blindness tests when applied to data visualization. Can Generative AI help in data color scheme design by providing analogous suggestions that pass color deficiency. Here I explore this question. Let’s begin by reviewing in more detail the concepts of an analogous color harmony, color deficiencies, and Generative AI systems.The Analogous Color Harmony:Color harmony is the process of choosing colors on a color wheel that work well together in the composition of an image. Like concepts in music, these harmonies are based around color combinations on the color wheel that help to provide common guidelines for how color hues will work together. Isaac Newton is credited with creating the color wheel concept when he closed the linear color spectrum into a color circle in the early 1700s. An illustration of his concept is shown below. Artists and color scientists evolved and amplified his concept to include color harmonies.",
