  "text": "Weekly curated resources for designers — thinkers and makers.“Here’s something that has always fascinated me: our understanding of the human body, particularly the brain and nervous system, has been profoundly shaped by the tools and technologies of each era.During the rise of mechanical craftsmanship, we began perceiving the body and brain as hydraulic systems (Descartes, 1600s) and intricate clockwork mechanisms of gears and springs (La Mettrie, 1700s). The industrial revolution brought new perspectives: the telegraph system with its information-carrying electrical wires transformed our view of the nervous system (Helmholtz, 1800s), while the steam engine, with its energy and pressure, became a model for understanding the brain (Freud, 1800s). (…)Our bodies and brains are incredibly complex systems. To comprehend them, we naturally turn to what we already understand — the most sophisticated technologies of our time — and we do so through metaphors and analogies. As designers, we dedicate substantial time to crafting the perfect visual metaphors that make the novel and unexpected feel familiar and approachable. But how do metaphors and analogies work? And what makes a good metaphor?”The secret of good metaphors →By Make me thinkThe new skill in AI isn’t prompting, it’s context engineering →“With the rise of Agents it becomes more important what information we load into the “limited working memory”. We are seeing that the main thing that determines whether an Agents succeeds or fails is the quality of the context you give it. Most agent failures are not model failures anymore, they are context failures.”I deleted my second brain →“Two nights ago, I deleted everything. Every note in Obsidian. Every half-baked atomic thought, every Zettelkasten slip, every carefully linked concept map. I deleted every Apple Note I’d synced since 2015. Every quote I’d ever highlighted. Every to-do list from every productivity system I’d ever borrowed, broken, or bastardized. Gone. Erased in seconds.”Design leadership in the age of AI →“AI is transforming the way we work — automating production, collapsing handoffs, and enabling non-designers to ship work that once required a full design team.
