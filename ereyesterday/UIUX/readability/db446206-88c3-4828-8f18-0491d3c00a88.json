  "text": "A curated selection of books that have inspired my design journey and shaped my perspective on creativity.This year, I started my spring cleaning early ‚Äî partly because my bookshelves were collapsing under their own weight, partly because my bank account was giving me the look üëÄ, and partly because IKEA seems to thrive on my inability to resist the temptation of buying yet another book.With no space left, I had to rethink my organization, rearrange my shelves, and finally give my books the space they deserved.In the midst of this chaos, I rediscovered some real gems ‚Äî books that have shaped my approach to design, sparked new ideas, or simply become trusted companions over time. Some are fairly recent, others have been around for a while, but they all hold a special place on my shelf ‚Äî not because they follow trends, but because they continue to inspire and challenge me.This isn‚Äôt a ranked list or a definitive guide. It‚Äôs simply a glimpse into my world of books ‚Äî the ones I believe are worth reading, whether you‚Äôre passionate about design or just curious about its many dimensions.Since design is an ever-evolving field, I‚Äôd love for this to become a recurring series ‚Äî a space to share, revisit, and discover both new and timeless reads together.1. Mismatch: How Inclusion Shapes Designby Kat Holmes (2018)‚ÄúMismatch‚Äù explores how non-inclusive design creates barriers and how inclusivity improves both accessibility and user experience. Through real-world examples and interviews, Kat Holmes demonstrates how design can either exclude or include, showing that ignoring diversity leads to products that fail to serve a wide range of users.Holmes, K. (2018). Mismatch: come l'inclusione plasma il design . The MIT Press.üìñ Why it‚Äôs interestingInclusive design isn‚Äôt just ethical ‚Äî it‚Äôs a smart strategy. This book offers practical insights on making inclusivity an integral part of the design process, showing how companies that embrace it gain a competitive edge, improve user satisfaction, and expand their reach.‚ú®Why I like itWhat I love about Mismatch is how it turns inclusivity from an obligation into a design necessity. Holmes doesn‚Äôt just point out problems ‚Äî she provides actionable solutions.Today, inclusivity extends beyond physical and digital products to AI and automation, where biased algorithms can create exclusion by design. Holmes reminds us that exclusion is often unintentional but never insignificant ‚Äî a crucial lesson for anyone creating user-centered experiences.2. Futura: Die Schriftby Petra Eisele, Annette Ludwig e Isabel Naegele (2017)More than just a font, Futura has shaped visual culture, from advertising and modern architecture to the Moon landing. This book offers a deep dive into how this geometric typeface became a symbol of progress, minimalism, and modernity, influencing design for nearly a century.Eisele, P., Ludwig, A. e Naegele, I. (2017). Futura: Die Schrift . Libri di Spector.üìñ Why it‚Äôs interestingTypography isn‚Äôt just about aesthetics ‚Äî it‚Äôs a powerful tool of cultural expression. Futura: Die Schrift traces the historical, political, and artistic significance of one of the most influential typefaces of the 20th century, proving that choosing a font is never neutral ‚Äî it shapes perception and communication.‚ú®Why I like itI‚Äôve always been fascinated by how typography preserves history, and Futura is a perfect example. Designed as a symbol of progress, it was later co-opted by Nazi propaganda, then re-emerged post-war as the corporate typeface of modernity, even making its mark on the Apollo 11 plaque.This isn‚Äôt unique to Futura. Gotham, originally designed for GQ in 2000, drew inspiration from mid-century New York signage. Its clean, geometric style made it the symbol of Obama‚Äôs 2008 campaign, representing hope and progress. Yet, its widespread corporate use eventually diluted its original associations, proving how typefaces evolve, reflecting shifting cultural and ideological narratives. Futura: Die Schrift brilliantly explores these transformations, revealing how typography is never just about aesthetics ‚Äî it‚Äôs deeply tied to history and identity.3. Iron Fists: Branding the 20th-Century totalitarian stateby Steven Heller (2008)‚ÄúIron Fists‚Äù explores how totalitarian regimes weaponized graphic design to manipulate public opinion and consolidate power. Steven Heller examines the branding tactics of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Soviet Russia, and Communist China, showing how symbols, colors, and imagery were deliberately crafted to shape ideology and national identity.Heller, S. (2008). Pugni di ferro: marchiare lo Stato totalitario del XX secolo . Phaidon Press.üìñ Why it‚Äôs interestingBranding isn‚Äôt just a corporate tool ‚Äî authoritarian regimes mastered visual identity long before modern marketing. From bold symbols to strict color schemes, design was used to evoke loyalty and suppress dissent. These techniques are still relevant today, shaping political campaigns, corporate branding, and digital media.‚ú®Why I like itHeller makes you rethink design as a form of persuasion, not just aesthetics. What struck me most is how the tactics of totalitarian propaganda never disappeared ‚Äî they evolved. Today, the same visual strategies are used in advertising, social movements, and online activism, making visual literacy more crucial than ever.4. Oh Sh*t‚Ä¶ What Now? Honest Advice for New Graphic Designersby Craig Oldham (2018)This book is a no-nonsense survival guide for emerging designers. Craig Oldham shares real-life advice, industry truths, and practical tips on everything from finding clients to handling criticism. It‚Äôs brutally honest, refreshingly funny, and exactly what you need when stepping into the design world.Oldham, C. (2018). Oh Sht‚Ä¶ What Now? Honest Advice for New Graphic Designers*. Laurence King Publishing.üìñ Why it‚Äôs interestingStarting out in design can feel overwhelming. This book doesn‚Äôt sugarcoat the challenges, but it offers valuable insights and a dose of motivation to navigate the ups and downs of the industry with confidence.‚ú®Why I like itI love how Oh Sht‚Ä¶ What Now?* feels like getting advice from a blunt but supportive mentor. It skips the clich√©s and instead gives you the kind of guidance you wish you had when starting out.One of my favorite takeaways is that failure isn‚Äôt just inevitable ‚Äî it‚Äôs necessary. Oldham reminds us that mistakes are part of the process and that learning to take criticism (and even rejection) is as important as mastering design skills. Whether you‚Äôre a new designer or just need a reality check, this book is a must-read.5. User Friendly. How the hidden rules of design are changing the way we live, work, and playby Cliff Kuang e Robert Fabricant (2019)This book explores how user experience design shapes our daily lives, often without us even noticing. Kuang and Fabricant examine how intuitive interfaces, seamless interactions, and invisible design principles determine how we navigate both digital and physical spaces ‚Äî from websites to airports to smart devices.Kuang, C., \u0026 Fabricant, R. (2019). User Friendly: come le regole nascoste del design stanno cambiando il nostro modo di vivere, lavorare e divertirci . MCD.üìñ Why it‚Äôs interestingUn buon design UX non riguarda solo l'estetica, ma definisce il successo o il fallimento . Questo libro fornisce uno sguardo ben documentato su come il design dell'esperienza influisce su tutto ci√≤ che facciamo, rendendolo una lettura essenziale per i designer che vogliono creare prodotti che funzionino davvero per le persone.‚ú®Why I like itWhat I love about User Friendly is how it makes you see design everywhere. Suddenly, you start noticing why some apps feel effortless while others frustrate you, or why some public spaces guide you naturally while others leave you lost.One of the most eye-opening takeaways is how the best design is often invisible ‚Äî it works so well that you don‚Äôt even realize it‚Äôs there. Whether you‚Äôre a UX designer or just curious about why some experiences feel intuitive and others don‚Äôt, this book offers a fascinating look into the hidden rules of design.Final thoughtsDesign is everywhere ‚Äî it shapes how we see, interact, and navigate the world. This selection of books isn‚Äôt just about making things look good; it‚Äôs about understanding why design matters, how it influences society, and how we, as designers (or simply as curious minds), can use it to create something meaningful.From typography to AI, inclusivity to branding, ethics to user experience, each book offers a different perspective on the power of design. Some challenge the way we think about creativity, others provide practical advice, and a few remind us that design is never neutral ‚Äî it always carries meaning.I hope this list sparks curiosity, inspiration, or even a shift in perspective. Maybe one of these books will find its way onto your shelf ‚Äî or maybe, like me, you‚Äôll just keep making space for more üòä.Thank you for reading my article ü§ó If you enjoyed it and found it interesting, feel free to share it with others.
