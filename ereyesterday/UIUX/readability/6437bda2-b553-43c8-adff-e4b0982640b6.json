It was the first exhibition worldwide about computer-aided art and design.“In computational art and design, many responses to the questions of what and why continue historic lines of creative inquiry centered on procedure, connection, abstraction, authorship, the nature of time, and the role of chance.” (Levin \u0026 Brain, 2021).The first relevant attempts of using computers as a means of creative production happened in the 1960s when programmers and artists began experimenting with the machines to generate shapes and sounds. In the beginning, the introduction of computers to the creative community faced resistance, especially because of their mechanical, mathematical, and multidisciplinary nature. At the core of the debate was the comprehension that creating artifacts alongside computational systems involved ceding a part of the creative process — which before belonged entirely to humans— to the machine. Such a shift naturally challenged the conventional conception of ownership, as it raised an intuitive question:Who should be considered the author of a given piece of intellectual production, art, or design when…",
