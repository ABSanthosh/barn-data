  "text": "ListenThe world speaks, too.1973, Harvard Square, Cambridge.In the middle of a busy intersection stands a piano, surrounded by a small crowd. A bearded man in his sixties approaches, calmly sits down, and starts a stopwatch. Silence falls.He lifts the piano lid with precision, places his hands in his lap, and stares ahead. He does nothing. The sounds of the city continue — cars, footsteps, conversations, a siren in the distance. Everyone watches in silence. Time passes slowly. The man doesn’t move. The world keeps turning, but he just sits.After 4 minutes and 33 seconds, he stops the timer and closes the lid. The crowd applauds.Listen attentively.When someone speaks, don’t plan your reply while they’re still talking. Just listen — truly. Don’t react too fast. Don’t jump to answers.Just be present.Whether you’re talking to a client, a friend, a user, or a colleague — listen like the pianist did: with patience and openness. True listening leads to understanding. Understanding builds connection. This kind of attention isn’t silence — it’s presence.4′33″The man in the story is John Cage, who composed and performed the piece 4′33″ — a three-movement work written for any instrument or ensemble, in which the musician plays nothing for four minutes and thirty-three seconds.What’s the point?The piece reminds us that if we truly listen, we can hear meaning in everything. It invites full acceptance of the present moment — a kind of zen experience.4′33″ isn’t about silence. It’s about listening — to the world itself as music. John Cage once said:“If you listen to anything closely enough, it becomes music.”It’s not silence that matters — it’s attentive listening.You can witness the described public performance — or at least a 1-minute-22-second excerpt of it — in the following video:",
