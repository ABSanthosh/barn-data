How AI Is Reshaping Product Development The Expert Panel of Product and Design Strategists How Designers Can Stay Indispensable in the Age of AI Conclusion How AI Is Reshaping Product Development Integrating new technologies into design workflows is nothing new — from the dot-com boom to responsive design and blockchain, designers have always adapted. AI is simply the latest shift, but its speed and scale can feel overwhelming. AI is reshaping product development by automating tactical design tasks, accelerating feature production, and surfacing patterns in data at unprecedented speeds. While these advancements offer efficiency gains, they also introduce new risks: Design may become marginalized as UI execution is automated. With the ability to build new functionality more quickly, teams may flood products with low-value features. The large number of data patterns identified with the help of AI might obscure the insights that matter most. Still, seasoned experts advise against panic. The core principles of UX and product design remain unchanged, and AI amplifies their importance in many ways. To stay indispensable, designers must evolve: adapt to new workflows, deepen their judgment, and double down on the uniquely human skills that AI can’t replace. The Expert Panel of Product and Design Strategists Many designers wonder how they can future-proof their careers in the age of AI. (We use “designers” to refer broadly to both design and user-experience research professionals.) To explore this question, we spoke with seven leading experts in product and design; these experts bring over 150 years of combined experience across product management, UX design, user research, behavioral psychology, growth strategy, and digital innovation. Meet the panel: Anuj Adhiya: Author of Growth Hacking for Dummies; fractional growth exec, advisor for founders, and coach for heads of growth. Nir Eyal: Author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, exploring the intersection of behavioral psychology, design, and business Ramli John: Founder at Delight Path and author of Product-Led Onboarding Laura Klein: Principal experience specialist at Nielsen Norman Group and author of Build Better Products; expert advisor in product strategy and design Melissa Perri: Author of Escaping the Build Trap, CEO and founder of Product Institute, and strategic advisor to leaders at Fortune 500 companies and scale-up companies. Melissa spent many years as a UX designer and product manager. She previously taught Product Management at Harvard Business School. Josh Seiden: Coauthor of Lean UX, the author of Outcomes Over Output, and the co-founder of Sense \u0026 Respond Learning. Teresa Torres: Product-discovery coach, author of Continuous Discovery Habits, and thought leader in user research and iterative development. How Designers Can Stay Indispensable in the Age of AI Our expert panel recommends several tactics for designers to stay indispensable as AI reshapes product development. The key is to become more strategic and make the most of what AI offers by leveraging AI-driven insights while applying human judgment and critical thinking to make informed product decisions. Our panel of experts shared their top 4 pieces of advice, summarized below. 1. Embrace the Strategic Scope of Design There is a growing misconception that AI tools can take over design, engineering, and strategy. However, designers offer more than interaction and visual-design skills. They offer judgment, built on expertise that AI cannot replicate. Our panelists return to a consistent message: across every tech hype cycle, from responsive design to AI, the value of design hasn’t changed. Good design goes deeper than visuals; it requires critical thinking, empathy, and a deep understanding of user needs. It involves: Systems thinking: Understanding how different parts of a product – features, multiple user flows, backend systems, and business processes – work together to create a cohesive experience Use-case evaluation: Anticipating all scenarios, including less-than-ideal ones, in which someone might use the product Service design: Designing, aligning, and optimizing how business operations support complete user journeys efficiently and sustainably If your role as a designer is limited to polishing UIs or producing high-fidelity prototypes, you’ve likely been boxed into a narrow definition of design that is not UX in the first place. To future-proof yourself in the age of AI tools, Josh Seiden urges designers to avoid getting stuck in this box and seek to break out of it actively. He said, “Make yourself valuable by not limiting yourself with a rigid definition of your role.” LinkedIn: Josh Seiden Remember that design activities exist on a spectrum. Some activities are tactical (e.g., creating mockups, writing specifications), while others are strategic (e.g., defining the product vision, creating user flows, and aligning stakeholders). Strategic design activities are often intangible and, thus, easy to overlook and deprioritize. If designers can shift focus to strategic activities, automation will not replace them. 2. Strengthen Storytelling Skills Many stakeholders still equate the role of design with outputs like mockups, prototypes, and polished visuals, instead of strategy. Multiple experts agree that designers can shift this perception through compelling storytelling, which AI can’t replicate. While AI can generate ideas and data, most of AI’s outputs are adequate at best, and some are poor. AI can’t explain tradeoffs, justify decisions, or connect solutions to business outcomes. That’s where designers add lasting value. Melissa Perri puts it simply when she says, “Be able to tell the story of why your design matters to your customers and the business.” In AI-rich work environments, storytelling helps cut through the noise. It aligns stakeholders, highlights impact, and positions designers as strategic leaders. As Nir Eyal said, “Suddenly, you’re not just designing—you’re leading.” LinkedIn: Melissa Perri Effective storytelling also depends on emotional intelligence and audience awareness, which AI tools lack. As Laura Klein advises, “Treat your coworkers the way you treat customers, and understand what drives them.” Nir Eyal emphasizes that great design is less about perfect pixels and more about psychology: understanding cognitive biases, attention, and motivation, both for users and your stakeholders. Melissa Perri highlights that storytelling starts with framing. For example, instead of saying This flow has poor usability, reframe it in business terms that resonate with your stakeholders: We’re seeing high churn here. But when other customer segments adopt the product, churn drops significantly. I can reduce churn by rethinking this design. Speaking the language of your audience helps, too. For example, if business analytics speaks to your product manager more than design terminology, overlay key metrics directly on wireframes. This approach shows how layout, content, and research connect to measurable outcomes in a format that aligns with your product manager's thinking. Ultimately, as Teresa Torres reminds us, effective communication means staying anchored in shared goals: “Remember, we all share the same goal — serving the customer in a way that also serves the business.” LinkedIn: Teresa Torres 3. Frame Conversations Around Outcomes As AI automates tactical tasks like prototyping or coding research summaries, designers must help their teams resist the urge to build every new feature idea — a temptation amplified by AI’s speed and prototyping capabilities. In this fast-moving environment, designers must steer their teams toward decisions that drive meaningful user behaviors and business results. Anuj Adhiya bluntly highlights what’s at stake when he says: “Design is either becoming more strategic or completely irrelevant.” LinkedIn: Anuj Adhiya To do this, designers must prioritize work strategically, not reactively. Ramli John recommends framing product discussions around the user behaviors you want to create, qualitatively (the actual behavior you would observe) and quantitatively (how you would measure it). As Josh Seiden puts it, if the team asks, “What should we build?” shift the question to, “What behavior are we trying to create?” This framing anchors decisions in what will solve real problems for users and the business, not novelty. LinkedIn: Ramli John Melissa Perri adds that scoping is critical in AI-driven environments. Don’t unquestioningly trust AI suggestions or launch sweeping redesigns. Instead, iterate in small, testable chunks to evaluate the impact on users and the business and maximize value. Tools like the Lean Product Canvas can help you anchor and facilitate these discussions. With teams rushing to ship AI features, designers have a prime opportunity to step into more strategic roles. We saw this during the mobile-application boom a decade ago, when chasing trends without clear goals led to products that didn’t deliver real value. Designers can prevent repeating the same mistakes by focusing their teams on outcomes and guiding decisions aligned to those outcomes. 4. Sharpen Data-Judgment Skills to Interpret AI Outputs AI tools are becoming increasingly adept at analyzing quantitative and qualitative data from customer support logs, behavioral analytics, and qualitative research repositories to generate trends, summaries, and possible explanations. People mistake quantity for quality. Regardless of the kind and volume of data AI can process, teams can’t make accurate sense of it without human judgment. Klein and Eyal are adamant that the human ability to analyze data with a critical lens has never been more important. It’s not just about having data; it’s about assessing whether the data is meaningful, ensuring that AI calculations are correct, and knowing how to use this information to make decisions and ask the right questions about users. Just because AI can detect a pattern doesn’t mean the pattern is valid or valuable. You'll become irreplaceable if you know which data points indicate meaningful changes in user behavior, how to collect them, and how to interpret them. For example, AI might calculate that a new onboarding flow reduces user dropoff by 12%, but without statistical literacy, that number may be meaningless. You still need to check: Was the sample size large enough? Is the improvement statistically significant? Does the trend hold across key user segments? AI might surface metrics instantly, but it can’t assess their reliability or relevance. Without thoughtful human interpretation, teams risk misreporting or overestimating impact. As Eyal said, “Design isn’t just an art — it’s a science. The more comfortable you are with A/B testing and behavioral analytics, the more influential you’ll be.” LinkedIn: Nir Eyal Even when AI tools synthesize qualitative data from surveys, reviews, or interview transcripts, they are prone to oversimplifying. AI might suggest explanations for behaviors or feedback, but without human insight, those explanations could be reductive or incorrect. Laura Klein emphasized this: \"AI can come up with a lot of theories about why things are happening...it becomes very clear quickly when you actually do good qualitative research. AI processes data, but human insight is necessary to understand motivations and behaviors.” LinkedIn: Laura Klein In a world of data analysis augmented by AI, designers can leverage machines' speed and efficiency for processing data. However, designers bring irreplaceable skills to the table: Challenging assumptions Verifying findings Framing insights in ways that lead to smart decisions No matter how advanced the tool is, it still takes a human to ask: What does this really mean, and what should we do about it? For example, Laura Klein described a high-performing product team she advised — not one that blindly A/B tested everything, but excelled by asking sharp, strategic questions: What types of users in each segment do we want more of? What are our biggest leverage points? They didn’t just react to every data point; they interrogated their metrics, looking for deeper meaning and long-term impact. This disciplined, thoughtful approach to data, not just the volume of tests, made the team genuinely effective. Conclusion AI is accelerating product development and automating execution, but it doesn’t create great products — people do. The true value of design has never been about pushing pixels. It’s about making better decisions, shaping business strategy, and solving real user problems. AI can help us move faster but can’t think for us. Product experts make a clear case: Designers who treat AI as a tool, not a threat, will thrive. While AI can uncover patterns at scale, it can’t ask the right questions, understand human motivations, or make judgment calls about what matters. AI shouldn’t replace designers, as long as designers evolve into strategic partners and collaborators. The future belongs to those who think critically, connect insights across disciplines, and lead teams toward meaningful, user-centered outcomes.",
