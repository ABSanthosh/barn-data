  "text": "Have Figma won back user trust?In August, I wrote a deep dive on Figma.It wasn’t just any deep dive.It was rough.Rough because I had a bad experience with dark UX in their admin and billing flows.And it wasn’t just me having issues.The deep dive resonated with lots of people across product, growth and UX.As it turns out, being secretly billed for excess members is an endemic problem with Figma.What was interesting though, was that Figma responded.Figma’s Director of Product for monetization said that they were working on making billing more transparent, and shared more detail about their roadmap.",
