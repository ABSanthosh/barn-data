In fact, understanding psychology and tactically applying those principles is user experience design at its core.The connection between psychology and product design is one of the main reasons I chose to transition careers from mental health social work; I entered the product design industry with over a decade of deep understanding of psychology and human behavior.According to the World Health Organization, about 1 billion people worldwide live with mental illness (source). Rates of adults suffering from depression have risen 8.7% from 2017 to 2023 (source), and about one-third of US adults experience an anxiety disorder in their lifetime (source).A graph from the Gallup depicting the rising trends in depression from 2015 to 2023 (source).On top of that, the Federal Trade Commission has reported a rise in commercial companies using sophisticated digital designs called “deceptive patterns” (also known as dark patterns), manipulating users into giving up their money and personal data (source). These deceptive patterns exploit human psychology, especially in the most vulnerable users, like those with mental illnesses.Seeing the rise in mental illness and the simultaneous growth in deceptive patterns and bad UX, I began to connect product design, accessibility, and mental illness. Or rather, I have begun to expand my understanding and definition of accessibility to include mental illness. I began to ask myself:What does it mean to design products that are more accessible to those with mental illness?Co-creationThe process of designing and building products that are accessible to those with mental health disorders should always start with the people who live with mental illness. This idea is probably not surprising or groundbreaking for most product designers because empathy and the user are centered in the standard design process. However, due to the vulnerabilities those with mental illnesses have, the collaboration and co-creation process should be altered and adjusted to accommodate their needs and ensure an emotionally safe environment.An emotionally safe environment is one where someone “feels safe to express emotions, security, and confidence to take risks and feel challenged and excited to try something new” (source).When conducting research with participants who have mental health conditions:Create a comfortable, judgment-free environment. Adjust your style and methods based on the individual participants if possible to help them feel comfortable.Ensure that the participants know what is expected of them. When possible, explain the research structure, what your goals are, what types of responses you are looking for, and the time commitment.Be flexible with session timing and structure. Allow breaks when possible, and pay close attention to participants’ body language and facial expressions to catch discomfort that might not be expressed verbally.Offer multiple ways to participate (in-person, remote, written responses).Provide clear explanations of how their information will be used, including where and how it will be stored, and who will have access to it.Follow up sensitively after sessions to ensure participants feel supported.Simplify and streamlineOne of the most important and impactful ways to design for those with mental illnesses is to reduce cognitive load. In addition to benefiting those with mental illnesses, reducing cognitive load leads to better experiences for most users, making it an easy sell to skeptical stakeholders.“In the field of user experience, we use the following definition: the cognitive load imposed by a user interface is the amount of mental resources that is required to operate the system. Informally, you can think of mental resources as ‘brain power’ — more formally, we’re talking about slots in working memory.” -Kathryn Whitenton (source)Our brains, similar to machines or computers, have limited processing power. Those with mental illnesses can have even less capacity to process new information and make decisions (source). Basic usability principles can help with this, like chunking or framing content, optimizing response time, and embracing minimalism.Users experience cognitive load when interacting with products. (Image Source)Taking it a step further, I have found the following strategies help those with mental illness when using the products I am designing:Simplify designs further: Avoid using unnecessary images or videos in the UI, narrow down the typography and color palettes, and lean into the use of white space. Allowing the UI room to breathe helps users understand what decisions they need to make and reduces cognitive load.Step-by-Step Processes: Lead users on a streamlined journey through your product or feature with simple, bite-sized steps. Make sure the path is clear to users at all times, and they know what they should do next. This is particularly important for onboarding experiences because this is the user’s first introduction to the product, and reducing the learning curve will lead to a better experience.Limit Choices: Hold the user’s hand and give the illusion of freedom while limiting the number of decisions on one screen. There is not an exact science or number of choices for one page, but use a critical eye on your designs and think through ways to limit the decisions users have to make.Offload tasks: Look for anything in your design that requires user effort. Reading text or remembering information are key examples. Then look for alternatives: can you auto-fill information to prevent the user from having to memorize? Can you show a picture or video instead of forcing them to read? It’s not possible to shift all tasks away from users, but every task you automate leaves more cognitive space for the decisions that truly are necessary.Soften copywriting and avoid shamingShame is an extremely distressing emotional experience that can be debilitating to those with mental illnesses (source; source). Shaming, confronting, or aggressively persuading users has very serious consequences, both for the user and for the product. It is such a distressing experience that users with mental illnesses will begin to develop a poor impression of the brand, or worse, abandon the product altogether (source).As Regina Jankowski quotes Angie Chaplin in an article for Inclusion Hub (source): “If I feel something is a trauma trigger for me, then I will scroll past it.”How do you avoid shaming or confrontation in designs?A popup that uses shaming language to pressure users into providing their personal information.Use supportive language and avoid accusatory wording. Do not blame the user for mistakes or errors, and instead shift the focus to the abstract or the platform.❌ “You entered an invalid email”✅ “We couldn’t recognize this email”2. Design more thoughtful error states. Be specific about the error or issue presented, provide a path forward, and avoid technical jargon that could alienate users. Additionally, ensure that an error state only appears after the user has completed an action incorrectly, and not while they are attempting to finish. For example, an input box should not display an error message while a user is still typing, and should only appear once they have completed the task (incorrectly).❌ “The information provided doesn’t match our records. Please try again.”✅ “The username entered does not match our records. Please double-check and try again, or create an account here.”(image source) ; (image source)3. Frame messages positively. Highlight progress completed instead of work remaining, celebrate small wins, and use an encouraging tone. Avoid pressuring users to make decisions, and include inclusive language.❌ “20% remaining”✅ “80% completed”A screenshot depicting a progress bar that highlights the amount of work completed instead of the amount of work left to do. (image source)Providing control and safetyPeople with mental health conditions often experience feelings of powerlessness or anxiety when faced with unpredictable situations (source). Designing products that give users a sense of control can significantly improve their experience.Clear escape routes: Always provide obvious ways to exit processes or return to a previous state. Ensure that “back” and “cancel” options are prominently displayed, and confirm before irreversible actions.Save progress automatically: For users with attention difficulties or those who may need to step away suddenly, automatically save their progress so they don’t lose work or have to start over.Customizable experiences: Allow users to adjust aspects of the interface that might be triggering, such as animations, sounds, or high-contrast visuals (source). Consider options to:Reduce motionControl notification frequencyToggle between light/dark modesAdjust text sizeTurn off time-based featuresConclusionDesigning with mental health accessibility in mind is not just an ethical imperative — it’s good business. By creating products that are accessible to those with mental health challenges, we create better experiences for everyone.The principles outlined here — co-creation, simplification, thoughtful communication, providing control, and mindful content presentation — form a foundation for more inclusive design practices. These approaches reduce barriers for those with mental health conditions while simultaneously improving usability for all users.As designers and product creators, we have the power to shape experiences that either add to the mental burden our users carry or help lighten their load. By integrating these principles into our work, we can create digital spaces that support well-being rather than detract from it.Remember: accessibility isn’t just about accommodating physical disabilities — it’s about making our products work for diverse minds as well.Additional resourcesInterested in learning more about accessibility, mental illness, deceptive patterns, and product design?
