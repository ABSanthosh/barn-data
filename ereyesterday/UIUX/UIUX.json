    "description": "In 2013, Marcel Moerkens was working on Brooklyn, his WordPress theme, and he needed a way to make it stand out from the pack of other WordPress themes.

    "description": "Tomasz Jakut reflects on the evolution of web design, from the days of table-based layouts and Flash games to the rise of responsive web design (RWD), which often feels like the end of history in web layout.
