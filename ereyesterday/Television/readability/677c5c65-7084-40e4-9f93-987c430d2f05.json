  "text": "John’s funeral won’t be until June, but I’m already crying. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-31-25 honor John by bringing Orpheus back. Orpheus is one of John’s worst enemies — and one of his oldest. I can think of no better tribute to John than to close out their long rivalry with one last story. (Screenshot/Peacock) Orpheus Has Hated John Since Believing John Was Roman It’s not clear yet what Orpheus has to do with John’s demise. I’m thrilled he’s part of this story, but I hope he’s not the one who actually killed John. It would suck for John’s story to end with Orpheus getting the revenge he sought for over 45 years. Still, if John’s going to have a proper sendoff, Orpheus should be involved in some capacity. One of the first John stories I clearly remember took place in 1986, when John was still believed to be Roman. Orpheus was Roman’s former partner who had gone rogue after his wife died. He wanted revenge because Roman was responsible for that death. I was only eight years old when this story aired, but I have never forgotten it. (Screenshot/Peacock) Orpheus’ revenge plan was brilliant. His life was a mirror image of “Roman’s,” complete with him having twins the same age as Sami and Eric that he forced Marlena to play mother to after making John think she was dead. This story was meant to be a one-off, and when Orpheus was brought back 30 years later, he was sadly rewritten as a run-of-the-mill villain. Still, he’s been obsessed with stealing Marlena from John to get his revenge for over four decades, so it would be wrong not to include him in John’s final story. Of course, John is not Roman, so it doesn’t make sense for Orpheus to hate him, but their rivalry is still something special that deserves to be honored. (Peacock (Screenshot)) Could Orpheus Play a Surprising Role In John’s Final Story? Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-31-25 don’t say much about Orpheus, but they do say that Marlena and Steve fear the worst about John. So while it’s obvious Orpheus is going to mess with Marlena, he’s not going to kidnap her or try to kill her. Thank goodness! That last go-around with the orchids was incredibly tedious. It’s possible that Steve, Andrew, or Paul returns just in time to stop Orpheus from hurting Marlena. A spoiler says that Paul will help Andrew at the exact right moment — could this be referring to this scenario? (Screenshot/Peacock) I think it would be interesting if Orpheus were instrumental in helping Steve and Marlena find John. In a perverse way, I think Orpheus considers John his best friend. His attacks have always felt to me like a twisted way of getting John’s attention. If that’s the case, Orpheus might surprise everybody by being the one to lead them to knowledge of John’s fate. Sadly, that’ll backfire, with everyone assuming he knew John was dead and wants to gloat. (There are no specific Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-31-25 about this; it’s all my speculation.) (Screenshot/Peacock) Back In Salem, All The Pieces Are In Place For The “Who Shot EJ?” Story Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-31-25 focus on two stories, and the other one is the long-promised mystery of who shot EJ. The crime will occur on Thursday, April 3, and the initial investigation will take place the next day. Interestingly, spoilers don’t say that EJ will die, only that he will get shot. One spoiler suggests his life will hang in the balance in the hospital. That puts somewhat of a new twist on what could be a stale story. EJ’s been shot several times in the past, once supposedly fatally. I love murder mysteries if they’re done well. I write them myself, so I appreciate it when other writers create good ones. Because of the murder mystery element, I enjoy shows like Elsbeth and The Irrational. However, Days of Our Lives doesn’t generally do a great job with these types of stories. (Screenshot/Peacock) In most cases, the soap has detectives arrest one person after another on flimsy evidence, only to have to let them go when they’re proven innocent. Eventually, the murderer is revealed to be a random person who wasn’t around much before the story started. I hate the random killer trope. It’s cheating — the audience can’t solve the mystery if the best suspect isn’t on screen until three seconds before the reveal. Let’s hope this mystery is better than that, especially considering the victim is an iconic character who half of Salem has a reason to hate. I was enjoying the story of Johnny realizing he is the product of rape, too, so I hope it isn’t ruined by any nonsense surrounding the attack on EJ’s life. (Screenshot/Peacock) Days of Our Lives Spoilers for the Week of 3-31-25 Suggest A Strong Lead-Up To The Murder Mystery The initial stages of these mysteries are the best part of Days of Our Lives’ versions of these stories, and this one is no exception. Days of Our Lives will never be a police procedural, but in the early stages it tries to pretend its police force is competent. JJ and Shawn will be kept busy by the large number of suspects. In recent weeks, Ava, Johnny, and Kate have all developed reasons to want EJ dead, and Kate and Ava both have guns. Plus, Rafe attacked EJ in front of Jada! Jada and Belle team up to get a confession out of EJ for kidnapping Rafe and replacing him with a doppelganger. Jada herself will become a suspect after Shawn finds her getting drunk on the night of the murder attempt, and Kristen recently swore revenge after EJ made her mother disappear. (Screenshot/Peacock) Heck, Chanel, Sophia, and Tate all have motives, too. The only reason Amy Choi nixed the adoption idea is that she didn’t want her grandchild anywhere near EJ. JJ realizes that Shawn has feelings for Jada — could he have tried to avenge her by killing EJ? Finally, Paulina’s known for going to extremes when her baby is under attack, plus her former DA kept threatening to destroy her political career, while Gabi has a history of committing murder and a well-known beef with EJ. 90% of Salem is under suspicion — JJ will start. by questioning Kristen, which means she’s probably innocent — and the other 10% is either investigating or in Estonia looking for John. I’m excited for this even though I doubt Days of Our Lives will stick the landing on this one any better than they did with Charlie Dale’s murder. (Screenshot/Peacock) I’m Disappointed My Favorite Story Isn’t Being Shown, Though This One Seems Exciting It’s annoying that there are no Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-31-25 for the Holly/Doug III/Tate triangle or its cousin, Tate and Sophia trying to put their baby up for adoption. There’s also no news on the Philip forgery front even though the secret came close to unraveling before Alex decided to cover for Philip at the last second. It’s annoying that Days of Our Lives so often leaves stories hanging, even if they are trying to finish (or start!) two front-burner stories right now.
