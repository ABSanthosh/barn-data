  "text": "Emmy winner Matthew Rhys (The Americans) will next take on a superstitious town as star of the Apple TV+ series Widow’s Bay, TVLine has learned. The 10-episode series, first ordered at the streamer in September 2024, focuses on a “mysteriously cursed New England island and its superstitious citizens,” per the official logline. Rhys will star as the town’s mayor, who refuses to believe the residents’ warnings. Details on when the Apple TV+ series will premiere are still unknown, as well as who will be joining Rhys as part of the main cast. Not only will Rhys star in the series, but he’ll executive-produce alongside series creator and EP Katie Dippold (Parks and Recreation). Emmy Award winner Hiro Murai (The Bear) is also set to direct the pilot and serve as producer alongside Claudia Shin and Carver Karaszewski. Joanne Toll will co-executive produce. Rhys is known for his role as spy Philip Jennings in the 2013 FX drama The Americans, which earned him a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 2018, when the series ended after six seasons. More recently, Rhys led HBO’s detective drama Perry Mason for two seasons. Excited to see Rhys in Widow’s Bay? Drop your comments below. Your February Streaming Guide Is Here!",
