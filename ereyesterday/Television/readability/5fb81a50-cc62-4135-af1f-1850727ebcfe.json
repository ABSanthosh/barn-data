  "text": "Martha Stewart probably has a beautiful rose garden on her property… but she won’t be handing out any of those roses on TV anytime soon. The home and garden guru didn’t mince words when asked by Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live this week if she’d consider starring on ABC’s senior dating competition The Golden Bachelorette. “Absolutely not,” the 83-year-old Stewart declared, and when Cohen tried to sweeten the deal by asking what if ABC offered her $1 million, or even $10 million, per episode, she held firm. Her reason? “The guys aren’t hot enough,” she stated flatly. The Golden Bachelorette — a spinoff of The Golden Bachelor, which had a successful run last year — debuted on ABC last month, with 61-year-old Joan Vassos handing out the roses to men age 60 and over. (Check out our full premiere recap here.) The season finale is set to air Wednesday, Nov. 13. ABC making a play for Stewart wouldn’t be completely unprecedented: Soap opera queen Susan Lucci claimed in May that her publicist was contacted by The Golden Bachelorette to gauge whether she’d be interested in starring… but she ultimately decided “it wasn’t for me.” Press PLAY below to watch Martha’s diss in full, and tell us in the comments: Which celebrity would you like to see handing out roses as The Golden Bachelorette?",
