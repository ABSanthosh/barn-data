Sling is offering streaming savings left and right. Here are the platform’s best active offers, including a major deal on your first month and a discount when you bundle with Max to stream shows like Hacks, The Last of Us, The Pitt and more.

Please note that if you purchase something by clicking on a link within this story, we may receive a small commission of the sale. Right now, Sling is offering users half off their first month. That brings the price down to as low as $23 for your first month of streaming. The service offers three subscription plans: Sling Orange, Sling Blue, and Sling Orange + Blue. Sling Orange offers 34 total channels, including sports and family networks, such as ESPN, ESPN2, Disney Channel and Freeform. Other base channels include CNN, TBS, TNT and more. With the half-off deal, Sling Orange starts at $23/month. If you want a plan focusing more on news and entertainment, you can opt for Sling Blue. This subscription offers 47 total channels, including 20 news and entertainment channels. In select markets, Sling Blue users can access their local ABC, Fox and NBC channels. Other Sling Blue channels include Fox Sports 1, MSNBC, NFL Network, Bravo, FX, TLC and more. Of course, Sling Blue also includes base channels like CNN, TBS and TNT. With the 50% off deal, the subscription costs as low as $25.50/month. If you’ve just read through those two plans and thought, “Why not both?!” You’re in luck! Sling offers a combination plan combining the channels from both Sling Orange and Sling Blue. With Sling Orange + Blue, you can enjoy all 46 channels, including all 22 of the exclusive networks. The combination plan starts at $33/month with the half-off deal. Sling Streaming Deal: Get $5 Off When You Bundle With Max In addition to the half-off deal, you can add Max to your subscription to earn another $5 off per month. The Max add-on typically costs $16.99/month, but if you act fast you can add the streamer to your subscription for just $11.99/month. If you’ve been wanting to stream Max but haven’t wanted to pay full price, now is the time to sign up with Sling.",
