  "text": "Arienne Mandi, who most recently starred in Season 2 of Netflix’s The Night Agent, is joining Chicago P.D., our sister site Deadline reports. Mandi joins as a series regular in the role of officer Naomi Kerr. Per Deadline, Naomi is a former soldier and military contractor who thrives in dangerous situations and keeps her cards close to her vest. Chicago P.D. had been seeking a female cast member to replace Toya Turner, who played Kiana Cook, after NBC announced in June that Turner would not be returning for Season 13. And this won’t be Mandi’s first trip to the Dick Wolf TV universe: The actress guest-starred in a January episode of CBS’ FBI as a terrorist’s wife. Mandi is perhaps best known to TV audiences for playing Dani Núñez on Showtime’s The L Word: Generation Q. She most recently starred in The Night Agent as Noor Taheri, a low-level aide in the Iranian mission to the UN in New York who somehow had access to critical, presumably explosive documents. Her other TV credits include In the Vault, Hawaii Five-0, NCIS and NCIS: Los Angeles. Are you excited to see Mandi in the Windy City?
