  "text": "Meghan Markle is throwing some glamorous dinner parties in the new year, and all Netflix subscribers are invited. The streamer on Thursday released a trailer for With Love, Meghan, an upcoming lifestyle series centered on the Duchess of Sussex. As seen in the video above, Markle blends “practical how-tos and candid conversation with friends, new and old” in the series, per the official logline. Alongside guest stars like Mindy Kaling and chef Roy Choi, the Duchess also “shares personal tips and tricks, embracing playfulness over perfection and highlights how easy it can be to create beauty, even in the unexpected.” With Love, Meghan releases Wednesday, Jan. 15, with eight half-hour episodes. (And yep, Prince Harry makes a cameo in the trailer, as well.) Ready for some more recent newsy nuggets? Well… * Peacock has cancelled its adult animated series In the Know after one six-episode season, TVLine has confirmed. Led by Zach Woods (Silicon Valley), the show followed Lauren Caspian, NPR’s fictional third-most-popular host, as he made new episodes of his interview show In the Know. (Deadline first reported the cancellation.) * The Viola Davis-led film G20 will premiere Thursday, April 10, on Prime Video, per Variety. Also featuring black-ish‘s Anthony Anderson and Marsai Martin, Will Trent‘s Ramón Rodríguez and The Boys‘ Antony Starr, the action thriller stars Davis as U.S. President Danielle Sutton, who becomes the target of an attack at the G20 world leaders summit. Which of today’s TVLine Items pique your interest?",
