  "text": "Is Colter Shaw about to track down the truth about his father’s murder? The Tracker Season 2 finale is only one week away, and TVLine has an exclusive extended trailer. Airing Sunday, May 11 (CBS, 8/7c), the episode sees Colter return to Echo Ridge to investigate a diner owner’s disappearance, only to uncover a decades-old kidnapping… and a shocking family secret. There, our hero is reunited with Mary (returning guest star Wendy Crewson), who viewers last saw in Episode 2. At the time, Colter believed that Russell (Jensen Ackles) was responsible for killing Dad, and Mom did little to dissuade him. In fact, she insisted that Colter dodge his brother’s calls.  Several weeks later, the Shaw siblings reunited and cleared the air. Russell swore that he did not kill Dad; there was someone else in the woods that night, and whoever it was probably pushed Dad to his death. By then, we knew that Ashton spent seven years working as a covert government contractor. We also knew that he had enemies. Come Season 2, Colter and Russell were confronted by a government spook who knew an awful lot about Dad. And this week, younger sister Dory (Melissa Roxburgh) delivered Colter a file box full of Dad’s research on zero point energy — a box that’d previously been left with Lizzy’s mom, a former colleague with whom Ashton had an extramarital affair. Was it his research that got him killed? Sergei Bachlakov/CBS When Colter is finally reunited with Mary in the Season 2 finale, she insists that there’s a lot she didn’t know about her husband… but she also hasn’t given her son a reason to believe her. At one point in the following promo, we see a teary-eyed Colter hold someone at gunpoint. Is it possible that Mom is staring down the barrel of his firearm?  Watch the Tracker finale trailer above, then leave a comment and share your theories about Ashton Shaw’s murder. Do you think we’ll finally receive answers at the end of Season 2?",
