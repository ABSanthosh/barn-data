  "text": "Critic's Rating: 4.4 / 5.04.4 On Tulsa King Season 2 Episode 9, unlikely alliances and shifting loyalties set the stage for a battle against a greater threat. Dwight Manfredi, ever the strategic thinker, partners with Bill Bevilaqua and Cal Thresher to tackle a new adversary — a move that’s as surprising as it is dangerous. As these men come together, the cracks in their relationships deepen, and the episode takes us on a rollercoaster of trust and betrayal. (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) The addition of Native American allies, led by the enigmatic Old Smoke, brings another layer of complexity to this unfolding drama. Known for his deep portrayals of Native American characters, Taylor Sheridan gives the episode a distinct feel that elevates the story. With past tensions bubbling just below the surface, it’s clear this alliance is as fragile as it is powerful, making every interaction fraught with the potential for explosive outcomes. But if you thought “Triad” was just about rivalries and alliances, there’s more in store. As Dwight’s loyalty to his makeshift family is tested, so is Tyson’s — and the lines between choice and coercion blur. This review breaks down the episode’s pivotal moments, its uneasy alliances, and what this latest twist could mean for Dwight’s crew as they brace for a turbulent finale. (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) Sometimes, You Have to Join Forces with Unlikely Allies to Face a Bigger Threat On Tulsa King Season 2 Episode 9, Dwight Manfredi, Bill Bevilaqua, and Cal Thresher formed an uneasy “Triad” to take down a dangerous enemy. This temporary truce was filled with surprises, weaving together intrigue, chaos, and a strange sense of camaraderie. But with one episode left and Chickie heading for Tulsa, this alliance feels tenuous. Surely, it won’t be this simple for rival factions to set aside their differences and work together. The episode opened with a funeral — a somber reminder of the stakes. Here, the Native American tribes joined forces with Dwight, Bill, and Cal, adding depth and layers to this story. The introduction of Old Smoke (Graham Greene) hinted at a potential long-term collaboration with a story that’s just beginning. Greene’s presence connects Tulsa King with Taylor Sheridan’s ongoing portrayal of Native Americans across Yellowstone and its prequels. (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) And it was priceless to hear Old Smoke dub Dwight as “Da White”—a moment of humor in the otherwise intense narrative. The alliance with the Native American tribes makes sense on multiple fronts, including their own financial security, tied to Dwight and his allies. And yet, even with so much on the line, the lines were blurry — just like Bodhi’s conflicted stance on Jimmy’s fate. After Jimmy’s native friends turned up to pay respects, Bodhi got a glimpse of forgiveness, though he’s been haunted by guilt. Meanwhile, Manny was close to the border with his bag of cash but decided to seek out Dwight, hoping for mercy and forgiveness. The editing built suspense here, making Manny’s arrival at Dwight’s doorstep an unexpected twist. His decision to return signaled a possible turning point — one I didn’t see coming but, in hindsight, was all too logical. (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) The build-up was methodical, almost teasing, with Dwight’s conversations with Joanne casting a shadow over his choices since getting out of prison. Their sibling bond was a highlight here, with Joanne grounding Dwight as he wrestled with decisions that only seemed to lead to darker places. In a way, Dwight was ready to go after Bill, just as Bill himself realized he’d have to bring things to a halt before everyone was consumed by the chaos. Dwight may have thought he was at a dead end, and Manny showing up wasn’t the rescue he expected — but Manny’s information offered a way forward, holding keys to a fragile alliance. (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) It was fascinating to see how Manny, typically not the bravest, was the one to bring Dwight, Bill, and Cal together, buying himself a slim chance at mercy. It was also a revelation to see how intertwined Cal was with Margaret’s ranch. He had hoped to persuade Margaret to intervene with Dwight, a strategy that might have seemed hopeless — but Cal didn’t know Dwight like we do. For Dwight, solving a problem with brute force is the last resort, not the first. The plan set in motion felt like a paradox — one that seemed destined to implode, but somehow, it held together. Then there’s the audacity of Manny, who, despite being anything but fearless, visited Jackie to spark this entire setup. His brazenness implicating Margaret’s ranch as an ideal ambush site showed a level of ruthlessness that shocked me. Manny’s move didn’t make sense at that moment, but it underscored the chaos at the heart of this episode. (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) A Tactical Ambush and an Uneasy Celebration As Jackie and his crew approached the ranch, there was an almost surreal quiet before the storm. They crept toward the barn, only to be met by a triad of Dwight’s allies and the unexpected arrival of Native American forces in a perfectly executed ambush — a scene worthy of the Duttons. It was a chillingly satisfying twist, capped off by Dwight handing Tyson the weapon to finish Jackie. Tyson, once a reluctant member, crossed a line, committing his first kill and fully binding himself to Dwight and his crew. The act was a sobering moment. Tyson’s family had just welcomed him back, and now, with blood on his hands, his ties to Dwight and the crew are unbreakable. (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) It’s the kind of bond the Duttons expect from their branded ranchers — a loyalty that’s both powerful and confining. Tyson’s brandless initiation left me uneasy; while it served a purpose, it felt calculated and manipulative, making him a pawn in this grim game. Where Do We Go From Here? As the episode closes, we’re left with an unexpected sense of dread. Chickie’s arrival looms large, bringing the chance of reuniting Dwight with the Invernizzi family. But Dwight’s world has shifted, and it’s hard to imagine him reintegrating after everything that’s transpired. If it had been Chickie, not Manny, at Dwight’s door, would this alliance have even happened? (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) Joanne’s role in Manny’s redemption and the triad’s success is also worth noting. Without her, this plan could have crumbled before it began. It’s an explosive penultimate chapter that leaves plenty of questions as we head toward the finale. Will Dwight finally get maneuvering room to turn this shaky alliance into something more permanent? Bill’s grudging respect for Dwight hints that he’s open to a more collaborative future. Cal, on the other hand, knows his place now, but where does he go from here? The question of whether this is the last we’ll see of death and betrayal remains unanswered, but one thing’s clear: the finale promises even more fallout from this uneasy triad.
