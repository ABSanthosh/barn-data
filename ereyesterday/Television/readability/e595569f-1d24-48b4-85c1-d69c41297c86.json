Ahead of The Way Home Season 3 finale, Hallmark has announced a renewal for the cherished series, spawning one of the most active fandoms I’ve witnessed. Hallmark played this right because if the finale had aired before the renewal, fans would have been up in arms. (Hallmark Media/Screenshot) Fan uproar over the Season 3 move to Hallmark+ was so great that the network changed its plans for the series, so you know this group means business. And it’s no wonder. The Way Home captures our hearts and imaginations with rich romances and layered, timeless storytelling. (©2024 Hallmark Media/Photographer: Michael Tompkins) The mysteries have evoked theories that remind us of some of TV’s best, from Lost to The Blacklist, with each new episode providing as many answers as it does new questions for fans to ponder. Starring Chyler Leigh and Andie McDowell, The Way Home has created a flawed but beautiful family with the Landrys. Watching three generations of Landry women navigate through a life made richer and more complicated through time travel makes The Way Home one of the best shows on television. The current season concludes on Friday, March 7 (8 p.m. ET/PT) and all three seasons of the series are available to stream on Hallmark+. (©2025 Hallmark Media/Photographer: Peter Stranks) Since the first pond jump of the first episode of season one, critics and fans alike have recognized this groundbreaking show and praised it for its writing, strong performances, and premium production values. “Our talented writing staff led by the mother-daughter showrunning team of Heather Conkie andAlexandra Clarke continues to amaze us as they raise the bar each season,” noted Samantha DiPippo, Senior Vice President, Programming, Hallmark Media. “Their carefully crafted storytelling filled with family drama, romance and an absorbing mystery has enthralled the show’s passionate fanbase and has made The Way Home appointment television. We can’t wait for them to see where the pond takes our time travelers as their journey continues.” The upcoming conclusion of The Way Home Season 3 promises plenty of answers, but like any good returning series, it offers just enough to keep us hooked. (©2024 Hallmark Media/Photographer: Michael Tompkins) More questions arise, which will be sure to keep the most faithful viewers watching and rewatching every episode as they scour for clues. Be sure to join us tomorrow for more coverage of The Way Home. The Way Home Season 4 will return in 2026. Let’s start the celebration now! Watch The Way Home Online",
