  "text": "One of Days of Our Lives’ worst habits is having characters constantly jump from one relationship to another. Holly’s young, so she can be forgiven somewhat, but it happens too much.  At least Holly has the sense not to jump into bed (yes, I’m looking at all of you New Years couples), but Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 1-06-25 suggest she’ll get involved with the wrong man… and it might be because of lies and half-truths. (Peacock/Screenshot) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 1-06-25 Say That Holly Starts Falling For Doug III After Sophia’s Update Holly will likely decide that she can’t be with Tate because of this baby situation. This scenario is one of the reasons it’s a shame things went down the way they did behind the scenes with Arianne Zucker.  Nicole was in this exact situation not long before she left town. When she first found out she was pregnant, she was with EJ and knew there was a chance her baby was Eric’s.  While the baby switch complicated things, for a while she was trying to navigate the possibility of raising a baby with Eric while married to EJ, which is similar to what Tate may have to do since Sophia’s mother will not allow Sophia to get an abortion. Thus, Nicole would be the logical person to turn to, but since she’s not in Salem, that probably won’t happen. Instead, Holly will turn to Doug III for comfort, which in Salem is code for grief sex. In her case, she probably won’t have sex with him — that would be a sucky way to lose her virginity — but she will probably get closer to him emotionally. (Peacock/Screenshot) The biggest question here is whether Sophia will even tell Holly the truth rather than an embellished version that makes it sound like her marriage to Tate is a done deal. Other Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 1-06-24 say that Brady and Tate will stand firm about their decision in this matter.  That sounds an awful lot like Brady putting his foot down and saying that Tate will NOT be marrying Sophia regardless of her mother’s wishes. But Sophia is far from the chaste, good-intentioned Christian girl her mother thinks she is. She’s a schemer who will do anything to get Holly out of her way so she can be with Tate. We don’t even know for sure the baby is his. Sophia is giving off Jan Spears vibes, and it certainly seems like regardless of whether Tate is the father, Sophia wants him to dump Holly and be with her for the baby’s sake. (Peacock/Screenshot) She probably didn’t plan on getting married at 17.  That was her mother’s ridiculous idea. Still, if that binds Tate to her, Sophia won’t object too hard, and she’s not above twisting the facts to make sure Holly gives up on her relationship with Tate. Holly should be smart enough not to do anything until she gets confirmation from Tate about what’s happening, but Days of Our Lives has this habit of making characters stupid when it suits the plot. The Pressure Will Be On For Doug III To Come Clean, But Will He? Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 1-06-24 have Doug III debating admitting that he stole Alice’s necklace from the time capsule so he could sell it to pay off his debts. Knowing this soap the way I do, I doubt he’ll do more than think about it.  (Peacock/Screenshot) We just had this whole mess with Johnny and Chanel’s relationship imploding because of Johnny’s lies and half-hearted attempts to come clean, and now we’ll probably do it all over again with Doug III and Holly. Holly is tangentially related to the Hortons through Maggie and the father she never knew, but she’ll still make a huge deal out of it when the time comes. That’ll likely send her back into Tate’s arms, but it’ll probably be at least a few months, if not half a year before anything like that happens. It all depends on what the new writing team, whose material starts airing in April, decides to do, though that’s still three months of Doug III dancing around this secret before anything happens. Julie Gets Comfort From Doug III And Chad (Not At The Same Time) (Peacock/Screenshot) Julie’s storyline is the most realistic one Days of Our Lives has had in a while, probably because it mirrors Susan Seaforth Hayes’ real-life grief. She and Bill Hayes were married in real life, so Julie’s heartbreak over Doug’s death is a fitting tribute to both the character and the man who played him. Doug III’s redeeming value is that he genuinely cares about Julie and wants to comfort her over his grandfather’s death. I hope when the truth comes out, Julie remembers that she was once a teenage thief, too, and is more forgiving than I expected. Chad will be back, too, and I’m looking forward to his scenes with Julie, though I suspect his return is set up for him to fall hard for Cat (aka Fake Abigail) when she returns to Vancouver. (Peacock/Screenshot) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 1-06-25 Promise An Epic Confrontation Between Chanel and Joy I’m not sure who to root for in this Chanel/Joy mess. Joy took a married man up to her hotel room and would have had sex with him had he not stopped her at the last second and then accepted Chanel’s friendship. Still, she didn’t know Johnny was married to Chanel at the time, and he was more wrong to flirt with another woman and almost go all the way with her just because he thought his wife was cheating on him. Even if he’d been right about Chanel, which he wasn’t, that didn’t make cheating okay. Two wrongs don’t make a right, and his jealousy of Chanel and Alex’s on-screen romance was not an excuse. Joy was old enough to know better but young enough to put job security and wanting to hold onto her friendship with Chanel above telling the truth.  I don’t know how Chanel would have reacted if Joy had told her from the get-go what Chanel’s husband had been up to, but it probably would have demonstrated that Joy was at least trying to be a good friend. (Peacock/Screenshot) I don’t blame Joy for wanting to protect her newfound friendship with Chanel, though.  She doesn’t know many people in Salem and Chanel has been extremely nice to her. Chanel will turn into mini-Paulina when she confronts Joy, which should be epic.  Whatever she says will upset Joy so much that Joy will turn to Alex again for comfort, which means they will probably end up having sex… while Stephanie secretly pines for Alex. (Peacock/Screenshot) EJ Teams Up With (Real) Rafe  Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 1-06-25 promise an unusual twist in this ridiculous Fake Rafe storyline. EJ is so desperate to get rid of Fake Rafe that he enters a reluctant alliance with the real Rafe, who is currently locked in the Dimera wine cellar. This is the kind of story that only happens in Salem. I’m not a fan of these silly doppelganger stories, so hopefully, this is over fast! (Peacock/Screenshot) Over to you, Days of Our Lives fanatics!
