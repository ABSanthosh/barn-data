It’s almost hard to believe we have even more episodes coming. Then again, the show was created by Drew Goddard, who has had his hands in several very successful films and shows. His involvement might explain why every episode is even better than the last. Between the quality plotting and talented cast, High Potential already feels unbelievably well-developed. However, there are still moments that make us go, “Oh, I didn’t love that.” (Pamela Littky/Disney) Not even a show as innovative as High Potential is immune to a questionable decision or two when it comes to creative choices. Thankfully, there is far more that’s good about this show than bad. Username or Email AddressPassword Best Episode — “One of Us” — High Potential Season 1 Episode 7 After the statement above, it should be no surprise that the best episode would be the latest. Kaitlin Olson was a force of nature in this episode. At this point, audiences are fully aware of and always ready for more of “Mama Bear” Morgan. Until this point in the season, there had been a general divide between Morgan’s work and home life. “One of Us” saw that divide come crumbling down when Ava and Morgan were taken hostage with the rest of the precinct. Seeing a new side of Morgan made this episode stand out above the rest. (Mitch Hasseth/Disney) Since the start of High Potential, if there is one word that could easily describe Miss Gillory (Kaitlin Olson), it would be “confident.” However, “One of Us” gave viewers a Morgan riddled with fear over her child’s safety. Imagine if all three of Morgan’s children had been in the precinct. I’m pretty sure her mind would have overloaded, and she would have become Liam Neeson in Taken. In summary, High Potential Season 1 Episode 7 showed Morgan’s growth as a resourceful and calm person under pressure, as well as her view of the precinct as family. Worst Episode — “Dirty Rotten Scoundrel” — High Potential Season 1 Episode 3 With a show like High Potential, the term “worst” is more subjective. As mentioned above, the series consistently delivers quality writing and acting. (Carlos Lopez-Calleja/Disney) So, “worst” has nothing to do with production value or even questionable story choices. What makes “Dirty Rotten Scoundrel” the worst is that Morgan was more or less still in limbo with the precinct. At this point in the season, she had established her value to the police but wasn’t exactly a “team member” yet. Morgan had yet to get a handle on protocol, which led to a pretty dangerous situation. Because Morgan tried to get the jump on a bartender suspect (Ck Bolado), Karadec had to chase the guy down before leading to a kitchen standoff. Morgan’s carelessness put Karadec in the path of a chef’s knife. It’s wild that there are only three episodes between the best and the worst, but that’s one of the many incredible things about High Potential. The character development alone is a masterclass in keeping a police procedural feeling fresh and new. Although, as great as the whole team is, it’s the Morgan and Karadec show at the end of the day. Best Karadec \u0026 Morgan Moment – “Croaked” – High Potential Season 1 Episode 5 One unexpected treat in High Potential has been watching Morgan and Karadec’s relationship develop. They went from hating each other to practically being family. (Mitch Hasseth/Disney) In the beginning, many viewers, yours truly included, were worried that Morgan and Karadec would become romantically involved. Thankfully, by “Croaked,” it’s clear that’s not their destination. I have been saying for a good while now that Morgan and Karadec’s relationship reminds me of adult siblings with how they can playfully poke at each other. High Potential Season 1 Episode 5 gave viewers the downright most hysterical Karadec (Daniel Sunjata) and Morgan moment of the series so far. Only Morgan could crash Karadec’s date and be charming the entire time. As cute as it was that Morgan rolled up on Karadec’s date with all three of her kids without him getting upset, the funniest part is how it started. You may not remember, but Morgan jokingly saddled up to Karadec’s table, pretending to be his wife with their gaggle of kids in tow. It was a moment of pure humor with good family fun sprinkled all over. Worst Karadec \u0026 Morgan Moment – “Dancers in the Dark” – High Potential Season 1 Episode 2 (Carlos Lopez-Calleja/Disney) Hopefully, this will be the last time we have to discuss a rocky Morgan and Karadec moment. Since “Dancers in the Dark,” those instances have become few and far between. However, this episode was the worst moment for the now very close partners. This was worse than the bartender incident because that was a misstep, whereas this was a full-on explosion of tempers. Some viewers may recall that Morgan and Karadec reached a boiling point during a screaming match while working the case of the tap-dancing mechanics. Karadec was yelling, and Morgan quit on the spot for the second time. Of course, that didn’t faze Captain Selena (Judy Reyes). When Karadec told Selena Morgan had quit, the captain didn’t miss a beat when she replied, “No, she didn’t.” The captain may not be in every episode, but she doesn’t miss a thing. She’s not the only lovable character who doesn’t get as much screen time as Morgan and Karadec, either. Honorable Mention – Ludo We have to give it up to High Potential for the character of Ludo. He’s certainly not in every episode, but his presence is always felt. (Carlos Lopez-Calleja/Disney) For one thing, viewers are getting a refreshingly new depiction of healthy co-parenting. Ludo (Taran Killam) and Morgan have an open dialogue that helps them maintain a happy and stable lifestyle for the kids. It has been a growing trend in television to abandon the old cliche that exes can’t get along and co-parenting is impossible because of past history and blah, blah, blah. In reality, most parents who are no longer together can maintain a respectful relationship. Hell, a lot of parents even stay friends after. It took a while, but TV is finally catching up to life. There’s a great example of this in Matlock with the characters Olympia and Julian. Although, those two are currently on the path to getting back together. The same cannot be said of Ludo and Morgan. Sadly, being a great dad doesn’t translate into being a great partner. And now, with Tom, the handsome janitor, Ludo’s chances are shot to hell. (Mitch Hasseth/Disney) Still, with a show like High Potential, audiences are well advised to expect the unexpected. If you read the High Potential Season 1 Episode 7 Spoilers, you know we anticipated the worst. It was the first time one of Morgan’s children would be in danger, and there was no telling how Morgan or Ludo would react afterward. We could still see some backlash when the series returns after the fall break, but at least things ended on a very happy note. No one was killed, and Morgan got her own desk. Who’s to say which event was more monumental? Either way, CBS‘s High Potential continues to live up to its name. (Carlos Lopez-Calleja/Disney) What has been your favorite moment from High Potential Season 1 so far? Do you like the handsome janitor, Tom, for Morgan, or would you rather see her back with Ludo?

It was a moment of pure humor with good family fun sprinkled all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-worst-karadec-amp-morgan-moment-dancers-in-the-dark-high-potential-season-1-episode-2\"\u003eWorst Karadec \u0026amp; Morgan Moment – “Dancers in the Dark” – \u003ca href=\"https://www.tvfanatic.com/high-potential-season-1-episode-2-review-dancers-in-the-dark/\"\u003eHigh Potential Season 1 Episode 2\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/173804_0126_enhanced.png\" alt=\"KAITLIN OLSON, JUDY REYES\" srcset=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/173804_0126_enhanced-768x1024.png 768w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/173804_0126_enhanced-225x300.png 225w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/173804_0126_enhanced-1536x2048.png 1536w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/173804_0126_enhanced-546x728.png 546w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/173804_0126_enhanced-720x960.png 720w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/173804_0126_enhanced-810x1080.png 810w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/173804_0126_enhanced-900x1200.png 900w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/173804_0126_enhanced.png 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/173804_0126_enhanced.png\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003e (Carlos Lopez-Calleja/Disney)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully, this will be the last time we have to discuss a rocky Morgan and Karadec moment.

This was worse than the bartender incident because that was a misstep, whereas this was a full-on explosion of tempers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome viewers may recall that Morgan and Karadec reached a boiling point during a screaming match while working the case of the tap-dancing mechanics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKaradec was yelling, and Morgan quit on the spot for the second time. Of course, that didn’t faze Captain Selena (\u003ca href=\"https://www.tvfanatic.com/stars/judy-reyes/\"\u003eJudy Reyes\u003c/a\u003e). When Karadec told Selena Morgan had quit, the captain didn’t miss a beat when she replied, “No, she didn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain may not be in every episode, but she doesn’t miss a thing. She’s not the only lovable character who doesn’t get as much screen time as Morgan and Karadec, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-honorable-mention-ludo\"\u003eHonorable Mention – Ludo\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have to give it up to High Potential for the character of Ludo.

Ludo (\u003ca href=\"https://www.tvfanatic.com/stars/taran-killam/\"\u003eTaran Killam\u003c/a\u003e) and Morgan have an open dialogue that helps them maintain a happy and stable lifestyle for the kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt has been a growing trend in television to abandon the old cliche that exes can’t get along and co-parenting is impossible because of past history and blah, blah, blah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn reality, most parents who are no longer together can maintain a respectful relationship. Hell, a lot of parents even stay friends after. It took a while, but TV is finally catching up to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a great example of this in \u003ca href=\"https://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/matlock/\"\u003eMatlock\u003c/a\u003e with the characters Olympia and Julian. Although, those two are currently on the path to getting back together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe same cannot be said of Ludo and Morgan. Sadly, being a great dad doesn’t translate into being a great partner. And now, with Tom, the handsome janitor, Ludo’s chances are shot to hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/11/174002_0589-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"JD PARDO\" srcset=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/11/174002_0589-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/11/174002_0589-225x300.jpg 225w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/11/174002_0589-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/11/174002_0589-546x728.jpg 546w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/11/174002_0589-720x960.jpg 720w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/11/174002_0589-810x1080.jpg 810w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/11/174002_0589-900x1200.jpg 900w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/11/174002_0589-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/11/174002_0589-scaled.jpg\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003e (Mitch Hasseth/Disney)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStill, with a show like High Potential, audiences are well advised to expect the unexpected.
