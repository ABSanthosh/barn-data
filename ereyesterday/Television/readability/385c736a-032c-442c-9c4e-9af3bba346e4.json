  "text": "Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 1-20-25 promise movement on a very obvious love triangle. From the moment Brady declared he was done with Kristen forever, I knew it was a matter of time before he reversed course. Sure enough, his daughter’s disappearance will push him into Kristen’s arms… but also into Ava’s, while his son deals with a complicated love triangle of his own. (Peacock/Screenshot) Brady Being Unable To Resist Kristen Is Par For The Course When it comes to Kristen, Brady is like a moth attracted to a particularly hot flame that burns him every time. His rebound relationships are almost always with some shady person who is even worse for him than Kristen (if such a thing is possible). (Chloe wasn’t, but she was too weak to withstand Kristen and Rachel’s nonsense, so it didn’t matter.) Thus, it’s unsurprising that Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 1-20-25 say that Brady and Kristen will turn to each other for comfort as it sinks in that their daughter is missing. Weirdly, afterward, Brady will turn to Ava for comfort too. What kind of new weirdness is this? (Peacock/Screenshot) Brady is not going to get into a threesome or other polyamorous relationship with Kristen and Ava. That’s a recipe for disaster. So he’ll have to choose eventually, and despite his mature decision that he’s not letting his nine-year-old decide who he dates, I don’t envision many scenarios where he doesn’t choose Kristen… at least until she breaks his heart again with her ridiculous antics. Meanwhile, there’s no news on where Rachel disappeared. She only packed a couple of sandwiches, so she probably didn’t expect to go too far. Will there be an obnoxious plot twist, like someone kidnapping her while she’s out and about? I wouldn’t put it past Days of Our Lives under the outgoing writing team, which is constantly repeating the beat of having people being kidnapped and held at the Horton Cabin. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 1-20-25 say that Rachel will have an “unusual encounter,” which could be ominous. (Peacock/Screenshot) It could also be something like running into Doug III, who doesn’t have the sense to wait until he’s in private before leaving voice messages about how he wants to recover the necklace he stole from Julie. I wouldn’t be surprised if firecracker Rachel blackmails Doug III, and he has no recourse despite being twice her age. The Least Interesting Story Is Finally Almost Over Leo set his trap for “Lady Whistleblower,” and now all that’s left is for Kerry to break down and confess. This story is incredibly annoying. The stakes are way too low, and it feels as if it’s a vehicle for the current writer to vent all his frustrations with critics and online fans. Plenty of things happen in Salem that don’t happen in the real world, but making such a big deal out of an anonymous troll who trashes the show is a bit much, especially since this started as a quest to stop them from leaking spoilers. (Peacock/Screenshot) Here’s an idea: find out what bigmouth is supplying Kerry with ideas and get them to stop instead of acting like spoiler-leaking is a federal crime  Also, shutting down a newspaper column because you don’t like what it says is a serious violation of freedom of the press, and as the former mayor, Abe surely knows this. Hopefully, Leo confronting Kerry while Kerry and Javi are in bed is worth it. Kerry could easily wiggle out of this by claiming Marlena was the one who leaked the spoilers, but I doubt anyone will believe him. Body \u0026 Soul should just put out official spoilers for entertainment journalists to use and be done with it. That would take the wind out of Kerry’s sails. Instead, we have this nonsense about Leo setting a trap to expose him instead of developing a thicker skin. You can’t succeed as a writer if you’re worried about bad reviews. They’re a part of the job (Peacock/Screenshot) One good thing comes out of this story. Leo and Javi will reevaluate their relationship status after Kerry is exposed. I’m especially excited to see Gabi eat her words (though we know she won’t). She wasted an entire afternoon pushing Javi to get rid of Leo because she likes Kerry. Kate Has Damage Control To Do On The Soap-Within-A-Soap I don’t know how Kate does it all. She’s juggling protecting Philip’s secret with co-producing Body \u0026 Soul. That includes unimportant tasks like bringing Hattie back to Salem so she can resume her role as Charlemagne, which is supposed to happen this week. I’m not looking forward to that. This meta storyline was overplayed weeks ago, and now I just want it to go away. (Peacock/Screenshot) Besides, this Hattie stuff is going to be silly. I don’t mind Hattie in small doses, but she’s become as insufferable as she is ridiculous. The other Kate spoiler is slightly more interesting. Joy will confide in Kate about her ongoing guilt, shame, and self-hatred over her fling with Johnny. I don’t think her boss is the best person for Joy to talk to about this, but who else does she have? A lot of fans seem to think that Chanel is a hypocrite not to forgive Joy because she slept with a married professor when she was at university in England. That’s not really a fair comparison because Chanel was coerced by someone who had the power to give her failing grades if she didn’t do what he wanted. Furthermore, there’s a big difference between the professor’s wife trying to push Chanel off a rooftop and Chanel telling Joy their friendship is over and then quitting Body \u0026 Soul so she doesn’t have to see Joy anymore. I don’t think Chanel ever said that the professor’s wife had no right to be angry. Anger and trying to murder someone are two different things.  (Peacock/Screenshot) However, it would be interesting for Chanel to reflect on her experience now that she’s a married woman whose husband slept with someone else. There are no Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 1-20-25 saying so, but Chanel is supposed to get advice from Paulina, so maybe that’ll come into play there. Ava Keeps Getting Caught In The Crossfire According to Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 1-20-25, Ava gets caught in the crossfire when Sophia and Sophia’s mother have another fight. Kristen already blasted Ava, unfairly accusing her of being responsible for Rachel running away by daring to date Brady when Rachel didn’t like it. I’m more interested in the Sophia scenario than that nonsense. Her mother is overly controlling and needs to be put in her place. (Peacock/Screenshot) I’m not a fan of Ava. She did horrible things that really shouldn’t be forgiven, like killing Shawn Sr. and forcing Steve to have sex with her to save Kayla’s life. Still, I’m rooting for her in this scenario. She has more love and respect for Sophia than Sophia’s mother does.  I’m pro-choice, but I can understand a pro-life mother not being willing to consent to an abortion for their seventeen-year-old, even if I strongly disagree. However, this idea she has that Sophia and Tate need to get married and that she needs to have her nose in every aspect of what Sophia does about the pregnancy is obnoxious. She comes off as a control freak who doesn’t care about anything other than making sure that the baby is born that she doesn’t intend to take care of.  It’s 50-50 on whether the fight is about Sophia wanting to put the baby up for adoption or daring to go to an appointment without her mother.  (Peacock/Screenshot) Either way, Ava will probably stand up for Sophia and get told to mind her own business, which is not smart considering Ava is a former mob boss. A Few Random Spoilers There are a few minor things going on that are more transitional on this week’s Days of Our Lives. EJ will have big plans for Fake Rafe, but no hints yet as to what they are. I would bet anything that with Rafe and Jada’s wedding coming up in two weeks, the real Rafe will break out just in time to stop Jada from marrying his doppelganger. Sarah will struggle to keep her secret in front of Kayla. Kayla already knows Philip did something shady, so will she figure this out? Juile agrees to get help while Cat turns toward Marlena. This one is so obvious — eventually, Julie will go to Marlena’s office and run into Cat, who she never wants to see again. (Peacock/Screenshot) Over to you, Days of Our Lives fanatics.
