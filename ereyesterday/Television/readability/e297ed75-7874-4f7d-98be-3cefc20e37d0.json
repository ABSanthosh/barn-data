  "text": "Jessica Lange Firmly Shuts Down Any Chance of an American Horror Story Return: ‘Oh Christ, No’Don’t hold your breath waiting to see Jessica Lange back on American Horror Story — because you might end up as dead as one of the franchise’s countless murder victims. Lange didn’t mince words when asked by an Irish radio station if she’ll be in the cast of the FX horror anthology’s upcoming 13th season: “Oh Christ, no. I haven’t done it for more than 10 years, 12 years. So no, I’m not doing it.” Even when the reporter pointed out that Season 13 has been speculated to be the show’s final season — nothing has officially been announced by FX — Lange was unmoved. “If they asked you back, would you come back?” the reporter inquired, and Lange’s reply was quick and to the point: “No.” Now far be it from us to quibble with the great Jessica Lange, but she did actually return to reprise her Season 1 role of Constance Langdon in a pair of Season 8 episodes, just seven years ago. Prior to that, Lange starred in the first four seasons of Horror Story, exiting the cast after Season 4’s Freak Show in 2015. The series earned Lange a pair of Emmys, along with three additional nominations. American Horror Story didn’t air a new season last fall for the first time since its 2011 debut, but executive producer Ryan Murphy teased in October that the franchise will return “sooner than you think” for Season 13, with franchise veterans Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters reportedly in talks to return. See Lange’s interview below, and tell us in the comments if you’re still excited for more American Horror Story. All 12 American Horror Story Seasons Ranked From Worst to Best",
