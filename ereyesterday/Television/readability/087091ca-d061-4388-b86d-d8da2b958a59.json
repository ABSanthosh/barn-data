  "text": "Nobody Wants This wants more Esther. The hit Netflix rom-com has promoted Jackie Tohn, who plays Esther Roklov, to series regular for Season 2, TVLine has learned exclusively. Tohn heavily recurred in the first season as the sister-in-law of Adam Brody’s character and the wife of Timothy Simons’ Sasha. After Rabbi Noah (Brody) started dating gentile podcaster Joanne (Kristen Bell), Esther was not shy in expressing her disapproval. (Not surprising considering Esther is good friends with Noah’s ex-girlfriend, Rebecca.) Esther did, eventually, warm up to Joanne a little bit — until Joanne’s sister Morgan (Justine Lupe) got a little too friendly with Sasha, leading Esther to declare in the season finale that both sisters need to go. When asked about Sasha and Morgan’s text exchanges, Tohn previously told TVLine, “I think [Esther] absolutely has the right to at least an explanation, right? I mean, this isn’t like a dude she’s been dating for three weeks. This is her husband, and the texts are [in] that weird gray area…where, like, the texts are too cute. You can have a friend, and if someone needs a ride, give them a ride. But, like, why you being cute with someone else?” “What are the boundaries there? What is OK? Can [Morgan and Sasha] be friends?” Tohn continued. “Should [Esther] be pissed? Whether she should or shouldn’t, she is, obviously, and I think, personal opinion, she has the right to be… It’s the lack of information. So it’s the finding out about the hiding that gets weird.” Nobody Wants This was renewed for Season 2 in October 2024, with Girls vets Jenni Konner and Bruce Eric Kaplan joining creator Erin Foster — on whose life the show is loosely based — as new showrunners. Nobody Wants This fans, are you looking forward to seeing more of Esther? Hit the comments!",
