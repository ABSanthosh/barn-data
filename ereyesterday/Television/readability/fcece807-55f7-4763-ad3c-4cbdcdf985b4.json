  "text": "Having Michael Gandolfini as a scene partner on Disney+’s Daredevil: Born Again has an extra layer of meaning for Vincent D’Onofrio, who as an East Coast-based actor had crossed paths with Michael’s father, James Gandolfini, a time or two. “We spent some time together, James and I…,” D’Onofrio shared with TVLine of the Emmy-winning Sopranos front man who passed away in June 2013. (Fun fact: they both had roles in the 1993 rom-com Mr. Wonderful, starring Matt Dillon and future Sopranos shrink Annabella Sciorra.) “We weren’t like best friends or anything, but we had some great conversations,” D’Onofrio warmly recalled. “He was a really good dude.” D’Onofrio said that he and James both “being Italian, having sons” — his eldest of two is the same age as Michael — gave extra meaning to sharing scenes with the younger Gandolfini. “James had Michael, and now I know Michael and we’ve become friends… and he’s just the sweetest kid,” D’Onofrio said. James Gandolfini with first wife Marcy and their son Michael in 2007 (Getty Images) In Daredevil: Born Again (Episode 4 of the first season’s nine streams this Tuesday at 9/8c), D’Onofrio reprises his Marvel’s Daredevil role of Wilson Fisk, the crime boss fka Kingpin who now serves as mayor of New York City. Michael Gandolfini plays Daniel Drake, a member of Fisk’s staff who has an inside line with the younger constituency. Daniel has thus far been offering his take on Fisk’s mayoralty in bits and pieces, but in an upcoming episode, he risks facing his boss’ wrath by speaking up much more loudly. “There is a scene in Fisk’s in office that called for [Michael] to stand up to my character,” D’Onofrio previewed. “[Daniel Blake] wasn’t written as a powerful character, but in this particular moment he needs to be powerful because he has been called out by Kingpin to answer for something that he did.” Michael Gandolfini (Daniel Blake), Zabryna Guevera (Sheila Rivera) and Vincent D’Onofrio (Wilson Fisk)Courtesy of Marvel Television As Daniel’s moment of truth unfolds, “Michael had this monologue right in my face, and every time he did a take, he just hit it perfectly in a different way each time,” D’Onofrio said. “That’s the sign of a an actor that’s on his way to becoming one of those actors that’s multi-leveled and can carry a story.” Previously, Michael Gandolfini played a teenage Tony Soprano in the 2021 prequel film The Many Saints of Newark, while his TV roles have included The Deuce. “I was so impressed by [Michael’s monologue] and simultaneously so happy for him,” D’Onofrio shared. “I naturally have warm feelings towards him because of his father, but once I realized that he’s his own man and he’s also an amazing talent…. It was almost as if my own son was accomplishing something big. It was really quite nice.” Want scoop on Daredevil: Born Again, or for any other TV show?
