  "text": "John Krasinski has been a small-screen staple for multiple decades now. But we’re used to watching him portray unassuming good guys like Jim Halpert or heroic badasses like Jack Ryan. Now, it seems that we might be on the verge of seeing 2024’s Sexiest Man Alive in a very different light. (Photo by John Nacion/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures) According to a new report from The Hollywood Reporter, Krasinski has signed on to join The Americans and Perry Mason star Matthew Rhys in a new serial killer drama for Prime Video. Both actors will also serve as executive producers on Silent River, which does not yet have a release date. The details of their roles are unclear at the moment, but we know that the Krasinski and Rhys “will play two men whose lives are more connected than they realize.” “We are thrilled to continue our work with John Krasinski, Allyson Seeger, and Sunday Night on this gripping series, which delves into the mysteries and secrets of small-town America,“ Vernon Sanders, head of television at Amazon MGM said in a press release. (Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images) “With John and Matthew Rhys attached to star in this wonderful story from Aaron Rabin, our global customers will be on the edge of their seats throughout this thought-provoking, psychological thriller.” Both stars have been on a role lately, with Rhys recently earning acclaim for his performance as George Carlin in Saturday Night. And in addition to receiving People magazine’s sexiest honor, Krasinski has been absolutely crushing it behind the camera lately. He recently directed the children’s flick IF, and the Quiet Place franchise that he conceived in 2018 shows no signs of slowing down. (Photo by John Phillips/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures) In the past, Krasinski has been accused of playing it a bit safe with his acting choices. So hopefully he’ll indulge his darker side with this one and drop the nice-guy persona for a bit. Although we wouldn’t mind if he did one quick glance at the camera, a la Jim Halpert — just for old times’ sake. Over to you, TV fanatics! Has this project piqued your interest?
