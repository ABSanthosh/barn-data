  "text": "The Wheel of Time will start spinning again when Season 3 of the Prime Video adaptation on Thursday, March 13, 2025. The release date was announced on Saturday at CCXP24 in Sao Paolo, Brazil, alongside the premiere of a first trailer for Season 3, seen below. The Wheel of Time teaser unveils a changing world, where the Shadow’s roots have taken hold and the battle between Light and Dark has become so consequential that Moiraine (played by Rosamund Pike) and Egwene (Madeleine Madden) will stop at nothing to keep from losing Rand (Josha Stradowski) to the darkness. Based on the best-selling Robert Jordan fantasy novels, The Wheel of Time tells the story of Rand a’Thor, a humble farm boy who learns he is The Dragon Reborn — a dangerous figure from history destined to save the world … or break it. At the end of Season 2, Rand after defeating Ishamael reunites with his friends at Falme and is declared the Dragon Reborn. But in Season 3, “the threats against the Light are multiplying,” the official synopsis tells us. “The White Tower stands divided, the Black Ajah run free, old enemies return to the Two Rivers, and the remaining Forsaken are in hot pursuit of the Dragon… including Lanfear (Natasha O’Keeffe), whose relationship with Rand will mark a crucial choice between Light and Dark for them both. “As the ties to his past begin to unravel, and his corrupted power grows stronger, Rand becomes increasingly unrecognizable to his closest allies, Moiraine and Egwene,” the overview continues. “These powerful women, who started the series as teacher and student, must now work together to prevent the Dragon from turning to the Dark… no matter the cost.” The Wheel of Time also stars Daniel Henney al’Lan Mandragoran, Zoë Robins as Nynaeve al’Meara, Marcus Rutherford as Perrin Aybara, Dónal Finn as Mat Cauthon, Ceara Coveney as Elayne Trakand, Kate Fleetwood as Leandrin Guirale, Ayoola Smart as Aviendha, and Kae Alexander as Min Farshaw. The series was adapted for television by showrunner Rafe Judkins (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), who serves as executive producer with Pike, Rick Selvage, Larry Mondragon, Ted Field, Mike Weber, Marigo Kehoe, Ciaran Donnelly, Justine Juel Gillmer and Dave Hill.
