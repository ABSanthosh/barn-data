That’s right; Chicago PD is back with an all-new episode, and it’s an intriguing Kim-centric that implies that the series may get a bit creative with their latest case. Let’s just say it involves a diner and Kim’s memory. (Elizabeth Sisson/NBC) When we last left things, Voight enlisted the help of Chapman to orchestrate something to take down Reid during Chicago PD Season 12 Episode 15. It’ll likely be something she has to figure out, as the best approach with someone like Reid is gathering enough evidence that could bury him. From the sounds of things, there’s plenty of intel out there, and he has quite the reputation, but in the meantime, Voight and Intelligence remain under his thumb for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, he won’t have his fingerprints all over the upcoming case. (Elizabeth Sisson/NBC) With the revolving roster of character centrics, we’re circling back to Burgess, who is slowly emerging as the season’s MVP. During this installment, we can expect a case-heavy hour to introduce a fascinating case involving something different for Intelligence. We’re treated to Burgess, who is connected to an event at a regular diner she’s been attending. This is brand-new information, as I cannot recall ever hearing about her having a steady diner where she goes and hangs out, catches up on work, and enjoys a hot meal. But it’s at least a change of pace from Ruzek or Voight’s cop bars. (Elizabeth Sisson/NBC) Unfortunately, a series of murders happen at this diner when someone kills four regulars. Burgess describes it as a “massacre” in the promo. She’s been hanging out at this diner often, possibly even every night, for some reason (wedding planning, maybe?), and she’s essentially an asset for this entire case because of her experience. She’ll have flashbacks or do mental mapping that involves walking through her own memory, trying to pinpoint clues and little moments that may give them a possible lead. Yes, we’ve often occasionally compared the series to Criminal Minds when they have these heavy case-centered episodes. I’m willing to toss the comparison out again only because the promo and stills tease that Ruzek may employ a cognitive interview approach with Burgess. (Elizabeth Sisson/NBC) Because of her familiarity and natural gifts as a seasoned detective, he hopes that walking through some of what she may have seen, heard, smelled, or experienced in the many nights she sat there may help them solve the case. It’s a unique concept for Chicago PD, and it doesn’t seem like they’ll venture from the diner too much in this one, so the prospect of it sounds incredible and fascinating all on its own. The hour may be another way of challenging Burgess or seeing what more she can do. Of course, because of its possibly unique concept, this one may be an acquired taste for some if it doesn’t play out like a traditional installment of the series.

Another exciting component in this one is that we have Ruzek, Cook, and Atwater heavily present. They all get along so well and are great characters to pair up with or what have you during all of this. Something about Kiana’s photos also suggests she may be playing an undercover role at some point in the hour. Maybe she’ll head into the diner to stake things out herself, posing as a customer, or she’ll want to quickly establish herself as a “regular,” too. Whatever the case may be, if she’s going undercover, it’s guaranteed to be a scene-stealing moment or two because Kiana has already proven herself adept at that. Some of her best moments thus far have been how easily she can transition into a role for the nature of a case. We don’t see Torres in the photo stills or the promo, so he may be sitting this particular episode out. Nevertheless, the rest of the team may come in strong for this one, supporting Kim and helping her solve this case. The installment teases the possibility of something unique. It’ll either go over incredibly well for views or possibly bomb if it stray too far from what the audience generally loves. But Chiago PD Season 12 has done a great job taking some creative risks and diversifying their approach to tackling cases and telling stories.
