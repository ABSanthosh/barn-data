  "text": "The Legend of Vox Machina is far from over: Prime Video has renewed the animated series for Season 4, ahead of its third season finale on Oct. 24, TVLine has learned. Watch the announcement above. “We are beyond thrilled — and grateful — to continue the epic and wild adventures of Vex, Vax, Keyleth, Percy, Pike, Grog and everyone’s favorite character – Scanlan,” executive producer Sam Riegel said in a statement. “With each season, this show levels up, and we already have big plans to level up both our heroes and villains in Season 4.” In the third season, “the Chroma Conclave’s path of destruction spreads like wildfire while the Cinder King hunts down Vox Machina,” reads the official description. “Our lovable band of misfits must rise above inner (and outer) demons to try and save their loved ones, Tal’Dorei, and all of Exandria.” Ready for some more recent newsy nuggets? Well… * A holiday edition of Is It Cake?, hosted by SNL’s Mikey Day, will premiere with four episodes Thursday, Nov. 28 on Netflix, our sister site Variety reports. In the special, nine “All Star” bakers from the show’s first three seasons compete in a holiday showdown. The guest judge lineup includes Rachel Bloom, Wayne Brady, Sebastian Maniscalco, Hannah Berner, Tiffany Haddish, Devon Walker, James Austin Johnson, Chris Witaske, Sasheer Zamata, Terry Crews, Punkie Johnson and Randall Park. * Netflix has set a Jan. 7, 2025 release date for Jerry Springer: Fights, Camera, Action, a two-part documentary that promises a “jaw-dropping” look at how The Jerry Springer Show “became one of the biggest and most outrageous TV hits of the 1990s.” * In celebration of How to Get Away With Murder’s 10th anniversary, all six seasons of  the ABC drama are now streaming on Hulu. * FX has released a trailer for the limited series Say Nothing, premiering with all nine episodes on Thursday, Nov. 14, exclusively on Hulu: Which of today’s TVLine Items pique your interest?",
