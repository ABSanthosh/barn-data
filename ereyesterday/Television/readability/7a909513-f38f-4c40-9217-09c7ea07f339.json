Her parents are dead, and her only other relative, an older brother, has moved away to work as a live-in servant at a certain estate, so she has no contact with him. One day, as Wisteria is begging, a great demon called Marbas with a beastlike form passes by her. Three or four centuries ago, there were more people who could see demons, but they are invisible to most people now, which has left the immortal Marbas quite bored. But Wisteria was born with the ability to see things other people can\u0026#39;t, so she happens to see Marbas and calls out to him. Marbas takes an interest in the little girl, so he heads to her room that evening, and thus their days of secret meetings begin. Around the same time, the Knights of the Sword Cross, the only organization in the British Empire dedicated to slaying demons, begins to show up around town. They\u0026#39;ve been tracking a demon, and the trail has led them to the church where Wisteria lives… A girl and a demon, both searching for their place in the world, have been brought together by fate.
