  "text": "Buddie-Watch 2025 continues: When we last left 9-1-1‘s brooding besties, Buck revealed himself to be Eddie’s secret subletter, taking over his apartment while he relocates to Texas to be closer to his son. I referred to last week as the show’s “Buddiest episode yet,” and while I stand by that statement, this week’s follow-up gave it an unexpected run for its money. Even with most of the episode focusing on Maddie’s kidnapping (and rightfully so), it still found time to honor Buck and Eddie’s final days together in big and small ways, beginning with an emotional exchange in Eddie’s car. Understandably panicked about his sister’s disappearance, Buck found himself spiraling. He feels like his life is falling apart, between Tommy dumping him, Maddie going missing and now Eddie moving away “like it’s nothing, like it doesn’t affect anyone else.” Eddie corrected Buck (“It’s not nothing”), but when Buck tried to apologize, Eddie told him not to bother. “You’ve been up all night,” he said. “You don’t have to say anything.” Eddie could tell that Buck was only speaking out of hurt and frustration. When you’re as close as these two are, you don’t always have to explain yourself. Then came their goodbye scene, which couldn’t have been filmed on a more perfectly gloomy day. As the rain fell, they loaded the last of Eddie’s belongings into a U-Haul and closed up shop. Following a quick moment of uncomfortable silence, Eddie got the goodbyes rolling — and the only thing heavier than the rain was the subtext. “I know this whole thing between us has been messy and hard, and both of us could have handled it a little better, but I hope you know you do matter to me,” Eddie said. It was exactly what Buck wanted to hear, even if all he could say in the moment was “I know.” Buck did his best to remain in good spirits, giving Eddie some homemade protein snacks for the road and going in for one last hug. Then, like a little kid who just saw his puppy for the last time, Buck stood in the road as Eddie drove out of his life. Look, did I giggle a little bit when Eddie pulled down the back of the van to reveal a sign that said “This Trailer Holds a Queen-Sized Bed” in big letters? Yes, but that’s only because I’m a child. The truth is, this was a beautiful moment shared between two guys who don’t always have the easiest time expressing how they feel, especially about one another. During a recent chat with TVLine, 9-1-1 showrunner Tim Minear said that Buck losing Eddie to Texas “is a breakup, in a sense. Eddie is the yin to his yang. They’re tightly intertwined characters. However you want to view that — you know, your your mileage may vary — he’s losing someone who’s very important to him, and that’s going to be rough on him.” With that in mind, let’s be real, have any of Buck or Eddie’s actual romantic breakups been as heartbreaking as their final moment with one another? Yes, it was sad when Shannon died, but she and Eddie were already estranged. And yes, we were bummed for Buck when Abby left him for Ireland, but he was able to pick himself back up fairly quickly. Heck, I’d even say that this parting of ways will leave Buck more hurt than his split from Tommy — and he’s still in his post-breakup baking phase over that one. Who else can we even compare them to? Taylor? Marisol? Love interests come and go, but “Buddie” is forever. At this point, we’ll just have to hope that Christopher notices how miserable Eddie is in Texas and asks to move back to Los Angeles. But where will they live now that Buck has given up his apartment and taken over Eddie’s lease? I mean, I suppose they could all live together, just as God and the 9-1-1 fandom has always intended. How are you feeling about Buddie’s parting of ways on this week’s 9-1-1? And what are your hopes for the show moving forward?
