  "text": "Ghosts finally made good on its promise of a new love interest for Sasappis during this Thursday’s episode — but she may not be the one that Sas was hoping for. Creators Joe Port and Joe Wiseman first teased that Sasappis would get another chance at romance at San Diego Comic-Con back in July 2024, and eight months later, the mystery woman arrived in the form of snappy 1940s screenwriter ghost Joan (played by Welcome to Flatch’s Taylor Ortega). During his travels beyond Woodstone B\u0026B, Pete found another spirit with the ability to roam and brought her to the property to meet Sas. (Doesn’t it feel like the show jumped a step by not showing us Pete and Joan’s initial conversation about Sas? Also, where was Pete and what was he doing when he found Joan? And why and how can Joan roam? But I digress…) Despite the extremely random circumstances of their match, Sas and Joan immediately hit it off. He shares that car ghost Jessica left him for roast beef, but Joan wonders how he can be so unlucky in love. “Witty, great hair — a girl could do worse,” Joan remarks. “Maybe I just haven’t met the right girl yet,” Sas says, to which Joan not-so-subtly replies that maybe the right girl has been there since that morning. And if Sas wasn’t won over enough, Joan then roasted Trevor, remarking that “with twigs like those” for legs, “you must be the bravest man I ever met.” Sas and Joan’s random blind date almost seems too perfect to be true. Joan doesn’t even need to leave soon for fear of vanishing like Pete if she sticks around Woodstone too long. “The longer you roam, the more you build up your tolerance. You don’t have to go back as much,” she reveals, which is certainly interesting information for Pete, potentially. Alas, Sas seems a bit iffy on Joan, even though she’s his only option at the moment, which prompts Hetty to suggest that Sas has a thing for unavailable ghosts. But unlike with Jessica, Sas had real feelings for Lenape spirit Shiki when he was alive… and maybe he still does, which is why he’s self-sabotaging himself, romantically, he realizes. So matchmaker/”cuckold” Pete visits Shiki to get Sas some closure and find out, once and for all, if she has any interest in Sas. She does not — until she learns that Sas killed a dear and left it outside her home when they were alive as a courting gesture. That changes everything for Shiki, but Hetty, Pete and Sam decide to keep that piece of information secret from Sas so he can finally move on. However, the truth comes out when Jay walks into the room and comments about Shiki liking Sas, not knowing that Sas is there and listening. (Poor Jay vows not to enter a room while talking from now on.) Even though Joan is crushing on Sas, she helps him through his “all is lost moment” to realize he needs to think outside the box when it comes to being with Shiki, who “lives” at a newspaper office. To get to the woman he loves, Sas will go inside the ghost trap in the hopes of crossing the Woodstone boundary. He has no idea if this crazy plan will work, but “talk about a cliffhanger!” Joan declares. Ghosts fans, what did you think of Joan? Are you rooting for her and Sas, or Sas and Shiki?
