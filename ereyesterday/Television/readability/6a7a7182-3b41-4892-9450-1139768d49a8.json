  "text": "The devastating wildfires in the Los Angeles area have forced another change: Monday’s NFL playoff game between the Minnesota Vikings and L.A. Rams, originally scheduled to be played at L.A.’s SoFi Stadium, will now be played at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, the league announced on Thursday. “In the interest of public safety, Monday’s Vikings vs. Rams Wild Card game has been moved to Arizona,” the NFL said in a statement. The Vikings and Rams will square off in the Wild Card round on Monday, Jan. 13 at 8/7c on ABC/ESPN, as previously scheduled. The Rams earned home-field advantage as a division champion, but now the game will be played on a neutral field: State Farm Stadium, the home of the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals. Earlier in the week, the NFL still planned to play the game in Los Angeles, but announced on Wednesday that they could move the game to Arizona if needed as a contingency plan. “The NFL’s priority is the safety of the Los Angeles community,” the league said in a statement. “We are grateful for the tireless efforts of the first responders. Our hearts are with Los Angeles and everyone affected by the fires.” The venue change is just the latest adjustment made due to this week’s L.A. wildfires, with major blazes and high winds forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate and destroying thousands of structures. Thursday’s NBA game between the L.A. Lakers and Charlotte Hornets has been postponed to a later date, and Thursday’s planned series premiere of CBS’ Hollywood Squares reboot was delayed a week, with several movie premieres and showbiz events postponed or cancelled as well.",
