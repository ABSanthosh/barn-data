CBS confirmed the news that the franchise would expand, and the first details are interesting, to say the least. (Courtesy of CBS) The series is titled Boston Blue, which, as you’ve probably gathered, means we’ll be leaving New York behind. Boston Blue focuses on Donnie Wahlberg‘s Danny Reagan, who takes a position with Boston PD. (CBS/Michael Parmalee) “Once in Boston, he is paired with detective Lena Peters, the eldest daughter of a prominent law enforcement family,” the logline teases. Beyond that, all we know is that Boston Blue has nabbed a straight-to-series order and will premiere sometime in the 2025-2026 TV season. Blue Bloods‘ cancellation after 14 seasons was purely financially driven as the series had become too expensive to sustain. As a result, there was every indication that a new entry in the franchise would materialize. (CBS/John Paul Filo) In recent years, CBS has ended many beloved series, only to bring the universes back with spinoffs. The network is having great success this season with Young Sheldon offshoot Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage and The Good Fight follow-up Elsbeth. Blue Bloods’ Universe Is Continuing Because It’s Still Popular Given brand recognition, spinoffs are a far cheaper way to keep franchises alive, and we should probably expect similar tactics employed across broadcast networks in the coming years. The need for TV shows to be financially feasible and dwindling ratings are making the barometer for success much more difficult to reach. (CBS/Screenshot) The good news for Blue Bloods is that the property has a lot of life. Fans made their voices heard in droves when news broke that it had been canceled. These decisions often don’t make much sense to viewers, but at least fans will be able to see what happens next for Danny. There’s no telling what other cast members will appear, but we have to imagine they will get guest arcs because it would be iffy to keep Danny away from his family. NCIS expanded on both CBS and Paramount+, so perhaps a third entry in the Blue Bloods universe will get the green light at Paramount+. (CBS/Screenshot) The possibilities are endless here, but it’s exciting for the fans that they will get some more of some of the fantastic characters. More casting details should be available soon, but we expect there to be theories about who will follow Danny to Boston. Many Spinoffs Of Proven Series Are in the Works Boston Blue will join Sheriff Country, a spinoff of Fire Country, on CBS’ schedule for the 2025-26 season. The network is also prepping spinoffs of FBI, The Equalizer, and The Neighborhood. (CBS/2023 CBS Broadcasting ) However, the fate of those shows will be decided after backdoor pilots air this spring. Given that Boston Blue went straight to series, we’re inclined to believe CBS felt the script was solid enough for a pickup. What are your thoughts on the spinoff news, Blue Bloods Fanatics?
