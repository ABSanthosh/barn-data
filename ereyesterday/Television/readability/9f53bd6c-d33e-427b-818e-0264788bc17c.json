  "text": "Faith Mitchell has been a badass since Will Trent began, but she has blossomed into an even more dynamic individual this season. The series delved into her complicated and close relationships with her family, detailing how she would fight anyone to protect them. You would never want to interfere with a fierce Faith Mitchell. (Zac Popik/Disney) While most of our favorite moments on the list include her moments on a case, a few showcase her personal or family life. Check out the list below. Faith Led the Charge to Rescue Her Mother Mother-and-daughter relationships are complicated, and Faith and Evelyn have years of intense resentment between them. However, even though she needed a break from her mother, Faith fought tooth and nail to rescue her on Will Trent Season 3 Episode 5. (Zac Popik/Disney) She was willing to play dirty and threaten a suspect’s family to get information, a level she swore she’d never sink to. She wouldn’t give up and vowed to destroy every suspect and that antique dealer until she had information to bring her mother home. It was the fiercest and scariest we’d ever seen Faith until lately. Love and guilt, both powerful motivators, fueled her. Faith Utilized Her Natural Skills to Be a GBI Leader (Disney/Daniel Delgado Jr.) It’s not that Faith hasn’t always been a badass boss. But she usually seemed like second in command, with Will in charge. When he disappeared and only reluctantly returned, she had her chance to shine, beginning in Will Trent Season 3 Episode 1. It was like a new Faith, beginning from throwing a rock in Rafael Wexford’s window and clobbering Lincoln Sterling with a golf club. She no longer took crap from anyone, including Will, thus the stapler. However, loyalty still ran deep, and while she was angry at him, she wouldn’t let Captain Cromwell shoot him in the middle of a mall. That fight scene was epic, as was how she saved him. Faith Went Old-School to Defend Herself at a Wedding . (Disney/Daniel Delgado Jr.) Watching Faith and Will eliminate multiple gunmen on Will Trent Season 2 Episode 7 felt like a James Bond movie. Only Faith was better than a Bond girl. She initiated most of the action and had some killer moves. Who knew you could beat someone with a sock filled with decorative stones or stab them with a fondue fork? These are weapons you would find only at an Atlanta wedding. Faith exhibited killer moves while fighting Stede until she threatened Jeremy’s life. That was the last straw. As we well know, nobody threatens Jeremy Mitchell and gets away with it. Those gunmen and Stede realized Faith was dangerous, so they locked her and Jeremy in a cell, not realizing that she had alerted the APD or that she could unlock that cell. Sending an old-school fax was genius and not often done anymore. While Faith hoped her son would never witness her attacking an assailant, she saved them. It’s likely why he feels his mom is such a hard act to live up to. Faith Mitchell Could Run a Cell Block at Prison (isney/Wilford Harewood) After seeing his partner in action at the prison on Will Trent Season 2 Episode 2, Will joked that Faith could have been in charge of her cell block within days. We would never want Faith Mitchell in prison, but she possesses the skill and power to get people to spill the needed dirt. That’s a valuable skill and one we admire. When the prisoners were afraid to talk, she knew to write questions instead. Since Will was too emotionally involved with having James involved, Faith deduced how another inmate and nurse were killing people. It showed how she and Will made such a winning team when they read each other’s minds. Faith Teamed Up With a Hostage to Outsmart a Dirty Cop (ABC Promo (Screenshot)) During Will Trent Season 1 Episode 9, we first noticed that Faith Mitchell was a fierce badass with grit. Faith proved she had good instincts and wasn’t just along for the ride when Sam LaPorte kidnapped her. Part of her wanted to believe he was innocent, especially since she was on the run with him. That was preferred since a dirty cop tried to frame them for murder. Faith called all the shots, and that was obvious from the way she handcuffed Sam to the freezer in a remote cabin.  She needed to be the strong, capable cop and in charge of the situation, but Faith wouldn’t let Officer Grillo wreck their reputation or kill them. Faith knew enough to alert Will of their location, and the cops knew, too. Seeing her take down a dirty cop was memorable. Even though she saved many people, killing someone still weighed on her. We often wondered if we would ever see Faith interact with Sam again, as she always has chemistry with the bad boys. Faith Showcased Iantha Richardson’s Killer Dance Moves (Daniel Delgado Jr/ Disney) I also appreciate it when a series incorporates an actor’s talents. Iantha Richardson is a talented ballet instructor trained in modern dance. It wasn’t until Will Trent Season 3 Episode 10 that Faith revealed she gave up her dancing dreams because of her teenage pregnancy and needed to become practical. She made it sound like she resented her mother when she really may have resented the Atlanta Society since they rejected her when they learned of her pregnancy. It was considered a scandal, and she never attended her cotillion.  Therefore, attending a Bellrose cotillion in her yellow dress was a big deal for her character. It was one of the first times she’d let loose and had fun. We were impressed by those killer moves and amazing dips on the dance floor. She and Elijah Buckley had smoking chemistry, and I hope they dance together again. Rafael Wexford Learned Not to Mess With Mama Bear Faith (Wilford Harewood/ Disney) Mothering a young adult is a fine line, and Faith tried to give Jeremy the freedom to make his own choices. She even looked proud when he created the music for a new song, but she drew the line at her son working for Rafael Wexford on Will Trent Season 3 Episode 9. While we respect Faith for threatening Rafael Wexford to stay away from her son, that was the emotional domino of many recent events. Jeremy wanted to show his mother that he could succeed, so he agreed to prove his loyalty to Rafael Wexford, while Faith left Jeremy a message stating she would always be proud of him. While she may be angry at her son, I wouldn’t want to be Rafael Wexford since Faith Mitchell will come for him. Over to you, Will Trent Fanatics. What are your favorite Faith Mitchell moments?
