  "text": "Donald Trump is plucking his new Secretary of Defense straight from the Fox News studios. The President-elect will nominate Fox News host Pete Hegseth to be the Secretary of Defense in his new administration, Trump announced on Tuesday. (Hegseth will still need to be confirmed by the Senate before assuming the Cabinet position.) A veteran of the Army National Guard, Hegseth served as an infantry platoon leader in Iraq and as a captain in Afghanistan; he was awarded two Bronze Stars for his service overseas. Hegseth joined Fox News as a contributor in 2014 and currently co-hosts the weekend edition of morning show Fox \u0026 Friends. He’s been a consistent champion of Donald Trump and his policies since Trump’s first election in 2016. His last show aired this past weekend, a network source tells The Hollywood Reporter. “Pete Hegseth has been an exceptional host on FOX \u0026 Friends and FOX Nation and a best-selling author for Fox News Books for nearly a decade,” a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement. “His insights and analysis especially about the military resonated deeply with our viewers and made the program the major success that it is today. We are extremely proud of his work at Fox News and wish him the best of luck in Washington.”",
