There’s more to come, but there’s also new hope as someone comes to Salem claiming to be related to Doug. Life will also slowly get back to normal, with other stories coming back into the fold, but first, Doug will get the epic send-off he deserves. (Peacock/Screenshot) Doug’s Death Will Bring Back Several Old Characters Doug’s death coincides with Days of Our Lives‘ 15,000th episode (no, that’s not a typo!), so it’s fitting that several characters from the distant past are coming for his funeral. Of course, they’re coming because they loved Doug and wanted to support Julie. However, it’s a silver lining to the heartbreaking loss that we’re getting visits from people who haven’t been seen in over four decades. Liz Chandler, Marie Horton, and Julie’s brother, Steven, will all attend the funeral in Salem. Marie was a main character during Days of Our Lives’ first few seasons. She’s Alice’s daughter who became a nun after learning that the neighbor she had fallen in love with was really her brother, Tommy. (Yes, even in those days, there were weird plot twists involving amnesiac people!) Unfortunately, Marie and Liz don’t get along. Years ago, they feuded over Neil Curtis, who they both were in love with, and Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 12-02-24 say that they will rekindle their old animosity. (Peacock/Screenshot) That is not the kind of drama that Julie needs during Doug’s funeral. It’s bad enough that she lost the love of her life without family members fighting over ancient history! Doug’s Final Goodbye Will Be Among Days of Our Lives’ Saddest Stories Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 12-02-24 say that Doug’s funeral will take place during the first two days of the week. These scenes will be intense. (Peacock/Screenshot) Funerals on Days of Our Lives always get to me because the casket displays a big photo of the person. When I went to a close friend’s funeral in real life, that’s what got the tears flowing, and I’m sure it’ll be the same here. Julie will deliver a eulogy that I am sure will be twice as heartfelt and heartbreaking as usual because Susan Seaforth Hayes and Bill Hayes were married in real life for almost as long as their characters were on-screen. I already feel like I lost another grandparent from the scenes we’ve had so far. I couldn’t stop crying during Friday’s episode, and writing about those scenes got me upset all over again. (Peacock/Screenshot) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 12-02-24 Promise It Won’t All Be Depressing Shawn, Lucas, and Ciara are returning for Doug’s funeral, and Ciara has some good news amidst the sadness. Remember that time capsule Julie couldn’t get open? Ciara has finally figured it out. Or maybe Ben did. There’s no word on why he’s not coming to the funeral, but he’ll probably be mentioned. Anyway, everyone will be excited to find out what is in that time capsule, including the people watching! It was annoying that Days of Our Lives started that storyline and didn’t finish it. Having something to laugh about in the middle of grieving is important. It’s also realistic. When my grandmother died, we were all sitting in her house grieving when my cousin found out she’d been accepted to her top-choice school, and all of a sudden, everyone was laughing. We needed that release, and Julie and her family will need it too, so these scenes will be a welcome relief from the pain. (Peacock/Screenshot) Could Doug Live On… In A Long-Lost Grandson? A stranger shows up soon after Doug’s death, looking for Julie. According to Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 12-02-24, the newcomer is Doug’s grandson, Doug Williams III, who came out of nowhere when he heard his namesake had died. I’m not sure what to think of this spoiler. The idea of a pop-up relative keeping Doug’s memory alive is a nice one. (Peacock/Screenshot) Although it is not a soap opera, Blue Bloods has done this effectively with Joe Reagan’s son, Joe Hill, whom the family didn’t know existed until he was an adult. Still, Days of Our Lives has a poor track record with these types of stories. The chances are 50-50 that this guy is a con artist who has his own reasons for claiming to be Doug’s grandson. In a way, that would be a tribute to Doug, since his relationship with Julie began with him pretending to be in love with her as part of a con, but it still would be seriously uncool. (Peacock/Screenshot) Spoilers for Days of Our Lives during the week of 12-02-24 say that Leo will meet the new guy, too. If anyone can see through a con, it’s Leo, who used to be a top con artist himself. Still, I fully expect Leo to use this guy to make Javi jealous. If he does, the chances of the new guy being a con artist increase, as Javi will likely have to rescue Leo from him, leading to true love. (Peacock/Screenshot) Life Slowly Returns to Normal After The Funeral Although Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 12-02-24 promise that the funeral will take up the beginning of the week, the soap will slowly reintroduce other storylines afterward. Xander’s feud with Philip will continue. That’s a relief, as everyone who had been at the Pub seemed to be pretending that Philip didn’t completely disrupt Thanksgiving with his announcement that he’s taking over Titan. We’ll return to that storyline this week, with Xander trying to convince Stephanie to drop Philip as a client. This should be interesting. (Screenshot/Peacock) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 12-02-24 Unfortunately Include More Body \u0026 Soul Nonsense We won’t be seeing any more of that stupid soap opera within a soap opera, at least. Thank God for small favors! But Joy is going to take EJ’s advice to leave town, or at least it seems that way. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 12-02-24 say that Joy decides to say goodbye to Alex first, while Johnny is furious with EJ for his interference, so it’s a logical conclusion. Chanel is supposed to have some family time with Paulina and Lani, but will she learn the truth anytime soon? She needs to before Joy goes anywhere.
