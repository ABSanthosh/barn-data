  "text": "Each week, the serial killers on The Hunting Party become more fascinating. Spoilers for The Hunting Party Season 1 Episode 4 tease that Doctor Ezekiel Malak used to be a hospital psychiatrist before becoming a terrifying serial killer. Since he escaped from the Pit, he’s been looking for new victims in Chicago, and the team must study his new methods to get ahead of him. (James Dittiger/NBC) However, Malak thinks he’s like a mighty God and makes a move no one escapes and kidnaps, as noted in the weekly promo. Bex is often like the glue that holds the team together, so tension will likely flare as the men blame each other before they plan a rescue mission. The Rivalry Between Hassani and Odell Heats Up, Making Bex More Conflicted That was some cliffhanger at the end of The Hunting Party Season 1 Episode 3. Who is that blonde? We suspect she’s Oliver’s handler, but it’s still unclear how much he knew about the explosion. (David Astorga/NBC) That reveal hints that Oliver is shady, and Nick Wechsler plays the part brilliantly. Unfortunately, Jacob Hassani is ready to pounce when another clue comes out. If it were up to him, he would get Oliver Odell out of the way as soon as possible. This makes things even more complicated for Bex because, in some ways, Hassani hired her, and she wants to keep her job. Despite their past, Bex doesn’t want to spy on Oliver. She wants to keep things professional with little drama, but that’s not likely. With these types of shows, more secrets spill out a little at a time, so hopefully, Bex won’t get hurt. (David Astorga/NBC) A Psychiatrist Turned Serial Killer Is A Deadly Combination on The Hunting Party Season 1 Episode 4 Every serial killer on The Hunting Party is dangerous, but having a hospital psychiatrist who became a serial killer is a deadly combination. After working in a hospital, Dr. Malak knew how much medicine to inject to kill his patients. That made him even more dangerous. Since escaping from the Pit, his methods and motives naturally have changed. He no longer merely killed patients. The team must decipher why Malak returned to Chicago and how he is selecting his new victims, which include a chaplain, a single woman, and more. (James Dittiger/NBC) Their objective is to discern what these victims have in common, how he met them, and how these attacks differed from the original ones since Malik used to murder only his patients. Like many of the serial killers on The Hunting Party, Malak escalates quickly, and in a massive city like Chicago, that’s even more dangerous. What Does Malak Want Bex to See? The weekly promo hints that Malak kills his victims and tortures them by bringing them back and repeating the process. The Hunting Party keeps repeating the same mistake of the team splitting up, so Malak will likely capture Bex that way. He seems to recognize her and is interested in what she saw during her near-death experience. Many people experience intense feelings during near-death experiences, including repressed feelings or blocked experiences. Bex has experienced lots of trauma in her life so that she could see something related to her teenage years again, or she could open herself to feel something related to Oliver. Since Kyra Leroux guest stars again as her daughter Samantha, perhaps she sees something related to their family. Many of these serial killers were worsened by their experiences in the Pit. We’re unsure if Malak was tortured similarly, and he’s responding by doing as he was taught. (James Dittiger/NBC) This will be an interesting theory to watch as the season progresses. The Supporting Cast and Dynamics Needs More Development, and a Crisis May Help Except for Bex, the rest of the team lacks development. Without her around, we may see what they are made of. Jacob Hassani and Oliver Odell will likely blame each other for Bex’s disappearance, igniting their rivalry even more. This makes this the ideal opportunity for Shane and Jennifer Morales to mediate and show off their skills. They’re both often overlooked, but the series needs to better use their military background and intelligence. (James Dittiger/NBC) Both of them think of ways the serial killers think and places they would go before the others do. This could be the key to saving Bex. Ideally, Jacob Hassani and Oliver Odell will bury the hatchet temporarily until they rescue Bex. Team dynamics can make or break a show. The Hunting Party is slowly forming stronger bonds between Bex, Shane, and Hassani, but the rest need work. While we know The Hunting Party wouldn’t survive without Bex, we can’t wait to see who rescues her and how the team defeats the next serial killer. (James Dittiger/NBC) Over to you, The Hunting Party Fanatics. Are you anxious to investigate the latest serial killer on “Doctor Ezekiel Malak”? Will the team work together to rescue Bex? Who will be the mediator? We would love to hear your thoughts, so please share them with us below. The Hunting Party airs at 10/9c on Mondays on NBC and Peacock the following day.
