  "text": "The Bachelor will be handing out more roses on ABC: The primetime reality staple has been renewed for Season 30, TVLine has confirmed. (Our sister site Deadline first reported the news.) The long-running dating competition is also getting a new showrunner: Scott Teti, who serves as showrunner for spinoff Bachelor in Paradise, will take the reins on The Bachelor next season as well. Teti takes over for Claire Freeland and Bennett Graebner, who exited as co-showrunners in March following accusations of fostering a “toxic” work environment. There was some concern about The Bachelor’s future when a renewal wasn’t announced as usual at ABC’s May upfront presentation. But the delay was due to the search for a new showrunner, Deadline says, and the new season “is believed to be targeting its usual midseason window” of January. A specific premiere date — and a star — will be announced at a later date. Bachelor Nation has seen some major shake-ups lately: In February, it was reported that The Bachelorette would skip the summer season for the first time since 2007 (not counting 2020, when COVID delayed it until the fall). Plus, the most recent season of The Bachelor — with Grant Ellis handing out the roses — was down 25% in the ratings versus 2024, averaging 3.3 million total viewers and a 0.6 demo rating (with Live+7 playback). That 0.6 demo rating, though, only trailed Dancing With the Stars, Survivor and The Amazing Race among all reality/game shows that aired on broadcast TV this past season. (Grant’s engagement to Juliana, alas, fizzled out after just three months.)
