  "text": "Did a bad seed just spoil the bunch on Grosse Pointe Garden Society? The NBC dramedy — which has yet to be renewed for a Season 2 — wrapped its freshman run on Friday with a twist: One of our gardeners has committed a surprising act of betrayal. Early in the finale, Alice learns the truth about her dog’s death (for real this time). It turns out, her mother-in-law Patty isn’t responsible for the murder, as we previously thought in Episode 11. The dog killer is actually Marilyn, the garden club’s president. And, like the other Grosse Pointe death, it wasn’t totally on purpose. Marilyn had found her cat being attacked by another animal in the dark and shot her gun in the direction of the threat, accidentally killing Alice’s furry friend. And once Alice learns the full truth, she gets a guilty conscience about all that has happened. She calls Brett, admitting there might be feelings between them, and then she does something that could change the course of the series: She heads to the police station. She says she’s done something they should know about, and prepares to give a statement. As she sits down to presumably confess about her father-in-law’s demise, Joel tries, but fails, to interrupt her. Meanwhile, the rest of the group finds Keith’s body — which had been moved by Kenny — and relocates his corpse to the compost bin in the garden. The episode ends with one final time jump, and this time, a carved pumpkin signals the shift, reading: “Next Season.” We see our three faithful gardeners — Birdie, Brett and Catherine — chastising someone for breaking their trust. The person’s identity is concealed by a costume, but it seems like it’s probably Alice. Then again, we didn’t predict Quiche would be Keith, so the series could throw a curveball. After all, we don’t know exactly what happened with Alice at the police station, and we aren’t sure if “that tweaker gas station guy” has said anything more about the night of the gala and that stolen bracelet. Is it actually Kenny? Could it be Joel? Gas station guy? It’s anybody’s guess! Did the Grosse Pointe Garden Society finale successfully plant a seed for a second season? Hit the comments with your thoughts, then grade the episode — and Season 1 overall — in our polls below!",
