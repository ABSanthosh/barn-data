  "text": "CBS did the unthinkable when it canceled Blue Bloods after 14 seasons. As we debated why the network would make such a controversial decision, reality started to set in: Blue Bloods was an expensive series because it was on the air for so long. (CBS/Screenshot) The cast had to take pay cuts for the show to snag renewals in its final years; otherwise, many of them may not have been asked back. CBS isn’t afraid to fire countless cast members from a beloved series. (CBS/Screenshot) Eleven of the thirteen cast members from Bob Hearts Abishola were not asked back for the fifth and final season, which sent the comedy in an unimaginable direction. With Blue Bloods off the air for good, CBS announced that NCIS: Sydney would join the Friday line-up. Since Fridays have been good to many CBS series, there was a case to be made for the latest NCIS entry to perform well. But since the broadcast networks are known to be ever-changing, we wouldn’t get much of a guide on how they would hold up until we saw some ratings date. (Daniel Asher Smith/Paramount+) NCIS: Sydney Season 2 Episode 1 premiered earlier this month on the night and pulled in 4.3 million viewers and a 0.26 rating in the demo. These numbers put it just slightly behind Blue Bloods Season 14‘s averages (5.1 million viewers and a 0.29 rating in the demo). NCIS: Sydney Is More Cost-Effective Than Blue Bloods The reality is that NCIS: Sydney is a far cheaper show to produce because it’s made for Paramount+ in Australia, so CBS is paying a fraction in fees to air the series stateside. Recently, broadcast networks have turned to more cost-effective programming to keep the lights on amid declining TV ratings. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) FOX has had a great season with Murder In A Small Town, which has pulled in comparable numbers to its other scripted dramas at a fraction of the cost. The CW has been doing it for years and is finding more success with Sullivan’s Crossing and Wild Cards, so it’s a trend that we expect to continue because it may be the only way for scripted to survive on broadcast TV. NCIS: Sydney is like the black sheep of the NCIS franchise because it wasn’t originally produced for CBS. Many took the move to Fridays, where expectations are lower, as a sign that the network didn’t have faith in it. Since it’s cheaper to produce, it would have been financially feasible if it flatlined in the ratings. (Daniel Asher Smith/Paramount+) However, since the premiere washed up with numbers comparable to many other more expensive CBS dramas, we could see more international entries in the network’s most prominent franchises. To drive home how well NCIS: Sydney’s Season 2 premiere held up, it’s currently averaging more viewers than. The Broadcast TV Industry Is Changing The demo tally is identical between the two shows, making CBS ponder whether it’s time to scale back on the shows it produces. It’s a shame that the ever-changing market has put once-hot shows in the crosshairs of execs desperately trying to keep profit margins up. (CBS/John Paul Filo) Blue Bloods getting to 14 seasons is a miracle when you consider that CBS has cut many beloved shows short with much shorter runs. Initially, there was a lot of confusion about why Blue Bloods got canceled because the entire cast had been vocal about wanting it to continue for more episodes. Plus, CBS reversed its decision to cancel S.W.A.T., so the same could have happened for Blue Bloods. Looking at the bigger picture, the price tag killed Blue Bloods, and if drastically cheaper programming is pulling in comparable results, it could be the shape of things to come for CBS. (CBS/Screenshot) The only realistic way to bring Blue Bloods back is with a spinoff or sequel series that drastically scales back the cast to come in with a budget that makes more financial sense. It wouldn’t be a bad idea to bring it back as a Paramount+ exclusive, with second-window rights on CBS in the summer or something similar. CBS Wants Newer Shows In Established Franchises CBS seems to favor new series over legacy fare because new shows set in established franchises are cheaper. Elsbeth is the latest entry in The Good Wife franchise, while Georgie and Mandy’s First Marriage keeps fans of Young Sheldon tuning in at a much lower price tag. (Sonja Flemming/CBS) There’s a good chance that it could come down to NCIS: Origins vs. NCIS: Sydney for a spot on the 2025-26 TV season, and my bet goes on the latter to secure a pickup because it costs a fraction of the other to air. The network is also prepping a third FBI spinoff, which means either FBI: International or FBI: Most Wanted are about to get the pink slip. Of those two, FBI: International films in Europe with a cheaper price tag, so Dylan McDermott’s spinoff will inevitably be the one to get the chop. There’s no telling what the TV industry will look like in a few years because all signs point to a streaming-first strategy. (Daniel Asher Smith/Paramount+) But for now, NCIS Sydney’s performance has highlighted why Blue Bloods lost its spot on the airwaves. What are your thoughts on NCIS: Sydney’s surprising performance?
