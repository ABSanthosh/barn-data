  "text": "Prepare to get Happy again. Netflix has released the full trailer for Happy Gilmore 2, the sequel to Adam Sandler‘s hit 1996 golf comedy that hits Netflix on Friday, July 25. (Press PLAY above for a sneak peek.) In a previous teaser trailer, which Sandler shared on Instagram in December, Happy mourned the loss of his pal “Chubbs” Peterson — played in the first Happy Gilmore film by Carl Weathers, who died in February 2024 — before crossing paths with sworn nemesis Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). Netflix first announced the movie pickup as part of its Upfront presentation to advertisers last year, affirming that “Adam Sandler will reprise his iconic role in a brand-new movie, Happy Gilmore 2.” It was McDonald, via a radio interview — and then Drew Barrymore, somewhat randomly — who first got the Happy Gilmore 2 buzz going. During an episode of Barrymore’s syndicated daytime talker, she received, in real time via text, confirmation from Sandler that a sequel script was in progress. Sandler co-wrote the original 1996 motion picture and also starred as the titular Happy Gilmore, a lovable loser who only ever wanted to be a professional hockey player. But when Happy discovers he actually has a talent for playing an entirely different sport, golf — and after his grandmother learns that she will lose her home unless she ponies up $270K for the IRS — he joins a golf tournament to try and win enough money to save the day. The Happy Gilmore cast also included Christopher McDonald as a rival golfer, Julie Bowen as Happy’s love interest, the late Frances Bay as Grandma and the late Carl Weathers as retired pro “Chubbs” Peterson, while the late game show icon Bob Barker had an instantly iconic cameo as himself. Among the Happy Gilmore 2 castings, you have Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce doing “something” and Josh Safdie, who directed Sandler in Uncut Gems, in “a juicy part.” Are you looking forward to seeing Happy Gilmore hit the links again?",
