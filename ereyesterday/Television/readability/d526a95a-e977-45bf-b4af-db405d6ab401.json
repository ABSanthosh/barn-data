  "text": "The following contains spoilers from the Silo Season 2 finale, now streaming on Apple TV+. The future is looking bright(er) for Apple TV+’s Silo. Or should we say “the past” is? Given the shocking, flashbacky finish to the Apple TV+ adaptation’s Season 2 finale — and in the wake of season-long viewer complaints about the post-apocalyptic drama being too dark in scenes — showrunner Graham Yost affirmed for TVLine that Season 3 will be easier on the eyes. Or, at least parts of it will. That’s because as teased in the final sequence of Season 2, large chunks of next season will be set 300 years prior, in a near-future, pre-dystopian Washington, D.C. and other cities. In actual buildings that experience actual daylight and weather. When TVLine asked Yost if Season 3 indeed will be brighter and easier to see, he shared a story of how his location scouting for Season 3 puzzled a peer. “I met someone at the Austin Television Festival, who was doing a show in England, and I said, ‘Do you have a good location scout, a good locations person?’ And she looked at me and said, ‘Locations? In Silo??’ I said, ‘Locations, in Silo,'” he recalled with a laugh. “So yes, we will be outdoors, and we will be in the world, and there will be sunshine,” Yost said, speaking to the parts of Season 3 that will be brighter. That said…. “We do go back to Silo 17” in Season 3, he noted. “And remember, they’ve got a very big power issue there, so they don’t have a lot of light.” But when Silo does shine in Season 3, shine bright it will. “Something that [executive producer/writer] Fred Golan said was, ‘Let’s make every effort to make the world that we see outside beautiful, so that we’re reminded of what’s been lost.'” Yost — like Criminal Minds showrunner Erica Messer, when TVLine pressed her on a similar issue — had no simple explanation for why Season 2 scenes appeared so dimly lit for some. (Of course, there is the fact that the show is almost-exclusively set underground, and one of the two silos featured this season had barely any electricity.) “Listen, I’m not going to defend it. It’s just the way it plays. And sometimes stuff looks one way in a dark editing room,” Yost said. “When we showed the first episode on a big screen in London, it looked fantastic, because motion picture screens are very bright. So I just encourage everyone to crank up the brightness [at home], and you’ll see a difference.” Want scoop on Silo, or for any other TV show?
