  "text": "The Old Man Cancelled at FX After 2 SeasonsThe Old Man‘s mission is over: FX has cancelled the international thriller starring Jeff Bridges and John Lithgow after two seasons, TVLine has confirmed. (Our sister site Deadline first reported the news.) A source emphasizes that FX is proud of the show and Season 2 was strong qualitatively, but the show struggled to maintain its momentum with a two-year gap between seasons. Based on the Thomas Perry novel, The Old Man starred Bridges as former CIA operative Dan Chase, who gets called back into action when a shadowy organization looks to eliminate him for what he knows. Lithgow co-starred as FBI official Harold Harper, who has a decades-long history with Chase and begins as his adversary but ends up becoming his ally. Alia Shawkat co-starred as well as FBI agent Angela Adams, who is Harper’s protégé… and Chase’s daughter, it turns out. The Old Man debuted on FX in June 2022 with a seven-episode freshman season, with production delayed first by the COVID pandemic and then due to Bridges’ battle with lymphoma. The premiere became the most-watched cable series premiere in more than a year, and Season 1 earned a number of award nominations, including an Emmy nod for Bridges and Golden Globe nods for Bridges and Lithgow. The series was renewed for a second season the same month it premiered, but production on Season 2 was delayed as well, this time for last year’s dual Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes. Season 2 didn’t debut until this September, with the eight-episode season wrapping up in October. (Read our season — and now series — finale recap here.)
