Just as we’re reeling from the on-screen death of Doug Williams a year after Bill Hayes’ passing and the more recent off-screen death of Drake Hogestyn, Deadline reports that Wayne Northrop has passed away. Northrop played an additional role on Days of Our Lives and appeared on Dynasty, but he will forever be known to DAYS fans as the actor who originated the role of Roman Brady. (NBC/Screenshot [enhanced]) Wayne Northrop Was Roman Twice On Days Of Our Lives Wayne Northrop’s Roman Brady famously fell off a cliff in a fight with Stefano Dimera in 1984. Soon, Roman was recast with Drake Hogestyn, leading to one of the most famous stories and the one that makes me saddest about both Northrop and Hogestyn passing away within months of each other. Several years after Hogestyn was hired, it was revealed that he wasn’t Roman — the real Roman had survived the fall from the cliff and taken several years to find his way back home. This story would not have worked if Northrop had not been willing to come back. Sure, John could have learned he wasn’t really Roman, but it would have been less powerful without Roman in Salem. I suppose Josh Taylor could have been hired earlier, but having ANOTHER new actor take over the role from the one who thought he was Roman for years would have been silly, especially since Taylor was wrapping up his role as Chris Kositchek on Days of Our Lives at the time. As it is, there are some fans who consider Wayne Northrop to be the “real” Roman Brady, even though Josh Taylor has played the role since 1997. In any case, Roman and Marlena fans were devastated by this plot twist because it permanently ended the original super couple, but considering that Hogestyn’s version of Roman/John had played Marlena’s love interest for years and the two had significant chemistry, it was for the best. (NBC/Screenshot [enhanced]) Wayne Northrop Also Played Another Role On Days Of Our Lives The actor switcheroo was not over, as 20 years later, Wayne Northrop returned to Days of Our Lives once more to play the villainous Alex North. I don’t really remember Alex North very well, but from what I’ve heard, he’s considered one of the worst villains. He appeared in Salem as an amnesia expert who claimed to be trying to help Marlena recover her memory, but in actuality he was an old flame who was supposedly still married to her and wanted to steal her from John. That sounds like an evil version of Roman, especially because Northrop again ended his run by his character falling to his death off a cliff, this time after a fight with John. Was this meta-commentary or what? (NBC / Screenshot) Wayne Northrop Also Had A Larger Body Of Work Although Northrop was best known for Days of Our Lives, he also appeared in several other shows. He was mostly known as a soap star, having appeared on Dynasty and Port Charles, but he also appeared in three episodes of the legal drama LA Law. Sadly, Alex North was Northrop’s last role, and he disappeared from the TV landscape after that, which might be one reason that he is best known today as the first Roman Brady. I wish I knew why he had stopped acting. He seemed like he had it made in the 1980s, as he was everywhere then, only to disappear permanently after his last stint on Days of Our Lives. (Hulu/Screenshot) Wayne Northrop’s Death From Early Onset Alzheimers Is Painful For Days Fans Northrop died of complications from early-onset Alzheimers at the age of 77, after a six-year battle with the disease, and 18 years after his last performance on Days of Our Lives. Still, despite how long it has been, his death is heartbreaking for Days of Our Lives fans. The soap has lost several of its veteran actors in the last few years, which is an occupational hazard of being on for 60 years. (ABC/Screenshop [enhanced]) Because fans watch these actors day in and day out, it often feels like losing a parent, grandparent, or best friend when one dies. Even though Wayne Northrop hadn’t been on Days of Our Lives for a long time, it’s still a lot to take so soon after Drake Hogestyn’s passing. Do you remember Wayne Northrop on Days of Our Lives?
