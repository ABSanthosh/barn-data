The series is based on the New York Times bestselling novel and Reese’s Book Club pick of the same name by Marissa Stapley. Taylor-Joy stars as “a young woman who left behind the life of crime she was raised in years ago, but must now embrace her darker, criminal side one final time in a desperate attempt to escape her past,” according to the official description. “It is incredibly rewarding to be able to amplify these female-centric stories and their authors, see our community connect with them, then see them take on a whole new life on screen,” executive producer Reese Witherspoon said in a statement. “We couldn’t be more excited to partner with Apple TV+ and the incomparable Anya Taylor-Joy, plus our brilliant creator Jonathan Tropper and his wonderful co-showrunner Cassie Pappas, to bring this compelling series — based on Marissa Stapley’s fantastic novel — to audiences around the world.” Added Taylor-Joy: “[Witherspoon’s production company] Hello Sunshine continues to do a fantastic job of championing women’s voices and I’m thrilled to be joining the team alongside Jonathan, Cassie and Apple TV+ to bring Lucky to life.” Taylor-Joy is a Golden Globe and SAG Award winner, and Emmy Award-nominee for her work in the Netflix limited series The Queen’s Gambit. Her other TV credits include Peaky Blinders and a voice role in The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance. In 2025, she will star in Apple Original Films’ upcoming movie The Gorge alongside Miles Teller, Sigourney Weaver and William Houston. Thoughts on Taylor-Joy’s next project?
