  "text": "My last article about genre shows got me thinking: what were the best TV shows about witches? I’m not talking about shows containing witches but those where witches are the focus. After all, witches have always cast a spell on TV fans, bringing magic, mystery, and mayhem to our screens. Whether it’s the charming chaos of Bewitched, where Samantha Stephens tried to blend her magical powers with suburban life, or the dark, broody drama of Charmed, where the Halliwell sisters used their powers to fight evil and protect their family legacy, there’s something captivating about witches. (The WB/Screenshot) These shows invite us into worlds where anything feels possible, where spells can fix problems or create even bigger ones, and where characters grapple with the power and responsibility of their gifts. From lighthearted humor to dark, atmospheric thrills, witches on TV show us a little bit of everything: the joy of magic, the weight of secrets, and the strength of connection. Maybe that’s why they’ve always been so irresistible. Who wouldn’t want a peek behind the curtain of a world where magic is real? Before we get to the voting, here are the shows you will choose from (including, against my will, as if I’m under a spell to include it), a reboot. There’s also a retelling and two related shows. May the best witch show reign supreme! A Discovery of Witches (SundanceNow/Shudder/Sky) Think forbidden love, ancient secrets, and a dash of academic charm. A Discovery of Witches whisks you into a world where historian Diana Bishop discovers a bewitched manuscript that unlocks centuries-old mysteries — and maybe a war. With breathtaking scenery, layered characters, and a romance that transcends magical, this show asks: What happens when history and destiny collide? The answer unfolds over four unparalleled seasons. It’s a spellbinding ride for anyone who loves their witches with a side of sophistication. Agatha All Along (Courtesy of Marvel 2024/Chuck Zlotnick) Who doesn’t love a sassy, slightly sinister witch who steals the spotlight? Agatha Harkness, from WandaVision, became an instant icon with her Agatha All Along anthem. Witty, powerful, and always one step ahead, Agatha gives us a glimpse into Marvel’s magical underworld while keeping us guessing about her true motives. Ever wonder what happens when a witch with a knack for mischief goes full throttle? Agatha delivers. American Horror Story: Coven (Michele K. Short/FX) This one was for fans who like their magic dark, moody, and laced with social commentary. Coven took us to a New Orleans school for young witches struggling with power, rivalry, and legacy. With unforgettable performances (Jessica Lange as Fiona Goode is chef’s kiss) and themes that challenge tradition and hierarchy, it’s not just a tale of witches — it’s a masterclass in how power shapes destiny. Are you ready to join the coven by casting your vote? Bewitched (ABC/Screenshot) The OG of TV witches, Samantha Stephens, made magic a household thing in Bewitched. Whether twitching her nose to fix dinner or to undo some magical mishap, Samantha charmed her way into our hearts. This show isn’t just about spells — it’s about blending magic and mundanity with heart and humor. Can love conquer all, even a mother-in-law who’s a total witch? Samantha sure gives her her all, even giving up her magic regularly to accomplish it, and she’s still the quintessential TV witch over half a century later. Charmed (The WB/Screenshot) Sisterhood meets supernatural in Charmed, where the Halliwell sisters take on demons, warlocks, and their complicated personal lives. This show balanced kickass battles with touching family moments, proving witches don’t have to go it alone. Whether you were Team Prue or Team Paige, it’s a classic for anyone who loves strong women using their powers for good. Wouldn’t you want the Power of Three on your side? Charmed (2018) (The CW) The reboot of Charmed aimed to bring a modern twist to the beloved Halliwell sisters’ story, introducing the Vera sisters — Macy, Mel, and Maggie — who discover they are the new “Charmed Ones” after the mysterious death of their mother. With updated themes like social justice, inclusivity, and tech-savvy villains, the show tried to capture a new generation while honoring the original’s legacy. While opinions about the reboot vary (and original fans might have strong feelings), it offers a fresh take on the magical sisterhood dynamic. Whether you loved it or found yourself missing the original, it’s still part of the witchy TV tapestry. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (Diyah Pera/Netflix) Forget the bubbly Sabrina you knew in the ’90s — this Sabrina was darker, sassier, and grappling with some serious demonic drama. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina served up a world of gothic intrigue, hellish dilemmas, and a protagonist torn between her dual natures. It was a must-watch if you like your witches bold and fearless. Good Witch (©2021 Crown Media United States LLC) If cozy, feel-good vibes are more your thing, Cassie Nightingale in Good Witch was there to warm your heart. She was not casting flashy spells or battling dark forces; instead, she used her gentle touch to make Middleton a little more magical. It’s the perfect show for those who want their witches wise, kind, and oh-so-relatable. Couldn’t we all use a little more Cassie in our lives? The Magicians (James Dittinger/SYFY) Magic got a grown-up twist in The Magicians, where Brakebills University teaches the next generation of spellcasters. But don’t let the academic setting fool you — this show was full of dark secrets, complex relationships, and a whole lot of magical mayhem. It’s for anyone wishing Harry Potter had more edge and less innocence. If only we could all pass the Brakebills entrance exam. Mayfair Witches (Skip Bolen/AMC) Anne Rice’s lush, gothic world comes to life in Mayfair Witches. Neurosurgeon Rowan Fielding discovers her family’s witchy legacy, complete with a haunting (and possibly seductive) spirit named Lasher. With its rich storytelling and dark intrigue, this show is a perfect blend of spooky and seductive. What would you do if your family legacy came with a curse? Motherland: Fort Salem (Freeform) Witches met military might in this alternate history, where magical women were conscripted into the U.S. Army. Motherland: Fort Salem was as much about sisterhood and duty as it was about epic magical battles. It was a fresh take on witches, combining modern power with ancient tradition. The Order (DANIEL POWER/NETFLIX) College life got a magical upgrade in The Order, where secret societies, werewolves, and witches collide. It was a wild, fast-paced ride full of mystery, family secrets, and epic magical showdowns. If you were looking for twists, turns, and just the right amount of camp, this was the coven you wanted to join. Sabrina the Teenage Witch (ABC/Screenshot) Light, fun, and full of magical mishaps, this ’90s sitcom gave us a bubbly teenage witch figuring out life with the help of her aunts and a sarcastic talking cat. Sabrina the Teenage Witch was the perfect blend of humor and heart, with spells that sometimes go hilariously wrong. Wouldn’t you trade your teen troubles for magical ones? Salem (WGN America) This show flips the infamous Salem witch trials on its head, revealing that real witches were pulling the strings all along. Salem blends political intrigue with supernatural horror, making it a must-watch for anyone who loves dark, edgy tales. It was the first time that sorcery was taken seriously on TV, and the results were mesmerizing. The Secret Circle (The CW/Sergei Bachlakov) When Cassie Blake moved to a new town, she discovered her magical destiny as part of a secret coven. With teen drama, forbidden love, and powerful spells, The Secret Circle was a fun and moody dive into witchcraft. When I first got into this line of work, The Secret Circle’s cancelation was conjuring up a firestorm of desire to bring it back — it just didn’t work. WandaVision (Disney+) Blending sitcom nostalgia with Marvel magic, WandaVision gave us not only the heartbreaking story of Wanda Maximoff but also the unforgettable reveal of Agatha Harkness. Packed with wit, creativity, and an Emmy-winning song, this show is a game-changer. Of course, there was more to Agatha’s story than we knew. Witches of East End (Lifetime/Screenshot) Family drama meets magical destiny in this series about the Beauchamp family. The cast alone was worth watching. Giving them powers was almost criminal. Witches of East End served up romance, betrayal, and plenty of spellbinding moments, all while exploring the bonds of sisterhood and the weight of magical heritage. The cast was incredibly easy on the eyes, and the show’s romantic elements had us all aflutter, too! Whether you prefer witches who tackle everyday struggles with a twitch of their nose, like Samantha in Bewitched, or ones who dive into the shadows to fight their demons, like those in American Horror Story: Coven or Motherland: Fort Salem, there’s a witchy show out there for everyone. These stories remind us of the power of imagination, the strength of bonds, and the thrill of escaping into a world just a little more magical than our own.
