The network shared the news Tuesday afternoon via a press release. (Sonja Flemming/CBS) “This reconceived MATLOCK was devised by Jennie Snyder Urman with a brilliant surprise plot twist, and we knew we had something very special the moment we saw the first episode brought to life by the incredibly talented Kathy Bates,” said Amy Reisenbach, president of CBS Entertainment. “The audience reception and critical acclaim for it has been overwhelming. We can’t wait to get started on a second season.” Yes, if you haven’t yet caught the Matlock series premiere, you’re missing out on one of the most memorable pilot twists in recent memory. We won’t spoil it for you here. But you might want to jump on the Matlock train before someone else does exactly that! (Sonja Flemming/CBS) “Matlock stars Emmy and Academy Award winner Kathy Bates as Madeline ‘Matty’ Matlock, a brilliant septuagenarian who achieved success in her younger years and decides to rejoin the workforce at a prestigious law firm where she uses her unassuming demeanor and wily tactics to win cases all while investigating a deeply personal secret of her own,” reads the series’ official logline. “Skye P. Marshall, Jason Ritter, David Del Rio and Leah Lewis also star.” The renewal announcement is an early one, but it certainly comes as no surprise. Both the show and its star have been drawing rave reviews, and Matlock has had no trouble finding an audience. (Sonja Flemming/CBS) In fact, Matlock’s September sneak peek delivered record ratings for CBS. The episode attracted 7.73 million viewers, making it the network’s strongest non-post-Super Bowl series premiere in more than five years. Clearly, like her sharp-as-a-tack title character, Kathy Bates has still got what it takes. And we hope we’ll get to see her do her thing for many seasons to come! Over to you, TV fanatics.
