  "text": "Critic's Rating: 4.7 / 5.04.7 I’ve watched many Hallmark holiday films, and Hanukkah on the Rocks stood out as one of the best. It was charming, witty, and fun, making viewers smile. Around 2019, the Hallmark Channel started integrating Hanukkah into their Countdown to Christmas line-up to celebrate how others celebrate the holidays. While the previous movies were terrific, there is something special about Hanukkah on the Rocks, and part of that is the cast. Stacey Farber (Virgin River) and Daren Kagasoff (The Villiage) star in this holiday film. (Courtesy of Hallmark Media) Farber was in A Season For Family in 2023, but this is Kagasoff’s Hallmark debut, and they had instant chemistry. Farber plays Tory, a corporate lawyer who gets laid off right before the holidays. Kagasoff portrays Jay, a radiologist, who returns home to try and convince his grandfather Sam to retire in Florida. The importance of traditions and family relationships makes Hanukkah on the Rocks unique. Sam and Jay’s close bond and Tory’s relationship with her Bubby (grandmother) take center stage and are often paralleled. That’s what kicks off the film. Sam and Bubby want a set of Cohen candles for their menorah and send their grandchildren to find it, who are clueless about the difference between candles. Naturally, since this is Hallmark, Jay and Tory meet at the store and debate over the last set of available candles. (Steven Ackerman/Hallmark Media) Farber and Kagasoff Feature an Instant Connection That Lures Viewers In I was hooked as soon as Tory (Farber) and Jay (Kagasoff) bumped into each other at the party store with an adorable meet-cute. Hallmark is known for cheesy holiday rom-coms, but they’ve expanded on that to build character arcs with substance. In some ways, Tory feels lost since she got laid off from her first career job, and she doesn’t know how to tell anyone. Jay is similar because he recently ended a long-term relationship before coming home. Initially, Jay is wary when his grandfather offers Tory a job at Rocky’s to fill in as a bartender through Hanukkah, but soon, he admits she fits in with the rest of them. It’s almost amusing watching Tory and Jay fight their feelings as Sam, Tory’s family, and Rocky’s regulars are teaming up to intervene. (Steven Ackerman/Hallmark Media) Of course, it wouldn’t be a Hallmark Channel film without some pesky secrets hindering their relationship, but you’ll have to watch to see how things turn out. The Family Relationships are the Heart of Hanukkah on the Rocks Sam and Jay’s relationship and Bubby and Tory’s bond are the heart of Hanukkah on the Rocks. The film did a fantastic job of paralleling the relationships, especially near the beginning, when explaining Jewish traditions or dating values. Even though Jay swears he came home to help his grandfather, Sam knows him well and thinks he’s running from something. While Kagasoff is an excellent leading man, he excels in family scenes. When he’s opposite Marc Summers (Sam), it’s reminiscent of him on The Village. Jay genuinely wants to help Sam but doesn’t always know how. (Steven Ackerman/Hallmark Media) Bubby (Marina Stephenson Kerr) also has a strong relationship with Tory. She’s the only one who senses that Tory isn’t happy and that Tory makes time for when she’s working nonstop. Tory is terrified to tell her family that she lost her job since her family’s approval and support mean everything, and she needs to learn that sometimes you can make new dreams. The Quirky Characters and Hanukkah Traditions Supplement the Charming Film We don’t want to spoil too much, but we’d love to hang out at Rocky’s Bar. Hallmark excels at creating entertaining bars with memorable characters, and Rocky’s takes the win. Tory is lucky when she follows Jay into Rocky’s since she meets many new friends, and they alter each other’s lives. The head chef, Lottie (Lauren Cochrane), is Sam’s partner in crime, but she is initially afraid to try riskier recipes. (Steven Ackerman/Hallmark Media) Anthony, one of the regulars, is in love with Lottie but stumbles over showing her. Then there’s Stacy-Lynn, an aspiring actress better at assisting Tory in planning events. In fact, Stacy-Lynn names Tory’s inspired Hanukkah celebration Hanukkah on the Rocks. It starts with a themed drink and lights the menorah each night, then moves on to Hanukkah games, happy hour, and Jewish speed dating. Sam’s love of the holiday and Tory’s party-planning skills bring joy to this film as the community comes together to celebrate. The group scenes are some of the best in the movie. Sam is the heart of Rocky’s Bar, and no one wants him to retire to Florida, which means Jay has a fight on his hands. Will he see the appeal of this quirky bar where everyone loves his grandfather? Hanukkah on the Rocks Features a Talented Cast and Crew (Steven Ackerman/Hallmark Media) Sam (Marc Summers) is the film’s MVP. Summers typically hosts game shows, but his humor shines through as he acts opposite Kagasoff and Farber. It quickly becomes apparent that Sam wants to match his grandson and Tory, and he’s one of those older men who says whatever he thinks. Another fun treat was that Hanukkah on the Rocks reunited Stacey Farber and Cora Matheson, who guest starred on The Spencer Sisters. This time, she portrays Tory’s older sister, Becca, and they are familiar as they banter. (Steven Ackerman/Hallmark Media) The ultimate treat was that Julie Sherman Wolfe wrote the script. She’s like Hallmark Channel royalty and has written numerous films, including Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story. In 2022, she also penned Hanukkah on Rye, so she is versed in combining these traditions with family relationships and blossoming romance. Hanukkah on the Rocks is about finding new possibilities when life tries to take you down. After you watch the film, please comment here or on social media with your thoughts. Hanukkah on the Rocks premieres on the Hallmark Channel on Friday, December 13 at 8/7c.",
