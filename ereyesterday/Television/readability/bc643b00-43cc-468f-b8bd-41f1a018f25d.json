Duell, who has played Michael Corinthos on the ABC soap since 2010, announced he would be leaving the series in an Instagram post on Saturday. TVLine has reached out to ABC for confirmation. “After many incredible years with General Hospital, I’ve decided to step away from the show,” he wrote. “This wasn’t an easy decision for me, but it feels like the right time in my life.” He continued: “I’m beyond grateful to [executive producer] Frank Valentini, the cast, crew, and everyone behind the scenes who have been like family to me throughout this amazing journey.” Duell ended his note with a message to fans. “Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your unwavering support and for letting Michael Corinthos be a part of your lives,” he shared. “Your love and encouragement has meant the world to me. This isn’t a goodbye—it’s a see you later.” Since taking over the role of Carly and Sonny’s son from Drew Garrett, Duell has been nominated for six Daytime Emmy Awards. He won once in 2015 for Outstanding Supporting Actor. ABC has not yet announced whether anyone will replace Duell in the role. Will you miss him? Hit the comments to share your thoughs.",
