  "text": "Alisyn Camerota is leaving CNN after a decade with the cable news network. “Big news, everyone! Today is my last day on CNN,” she announced on Instagram Sunday, telling her followers to tune in at 4:50 pm ET for her “sign off.” Camerota worked for 16 years at Fox News before joining CNN in 2014, spending more than six years co-anchoring New Day. During her tenure on the cable network’s morning news program, she reported on the COVID-19 pandemic, the first Trump presidency and the 2020 election, Hurricane Harvey in Houston, the Paris and Brussels terror attacks, and the Parkland school shooting. Since leaving New Day in 2021, she has hosted and co-hosted CNN Newsroom with Victor Blackwell, and CNN Tonight with Jake Tapper and Laura Coates. She has also become a floating political commentator for the network, and a correspondent for The Whole Story With Anderson Cooper. Camerota has also anchored primetime specials, including Tipping Point: Sexual Harassment in America, The Hunting Ground: Sexual Assault on Campus, TOXIC: Britney Spears’ Battle for Freedom and The Baby Business. The Emmy-winning journalist published her debut novel, Amanda Wakes Up, in 2017, followed by her 2024 memoir, Combat Love. Are you sad to see Camerota go? Hit the comments with your reactions!",
