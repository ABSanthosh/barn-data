  "text": "I love this show as much as the next fan, but the promo for next week’s episode has me anxious. We’re digging into Chicago Fire Season 13 Episode 4 spoilers, so buckle up! It’s a very brief 30-second clip showing Violet and Novak doing what they do best: saving a life. But thanks to a risky move on Violet’s part to save a pregnant woman and her baby, our girl may have landed in hot water. (Peter Gordon/NBC) Immediately, the promo reminded me of two iconic Grey’s Anatomy scenes. In both, resident Ben Warren performs crash C-sections on patients in environments that are less than ideal. It looks like that’s exactly what Violet is going to do in Chicago Fire Season 13 Episode 4. If anyone on this show can pull something like that off, it’s Violet. She’s more than capable of delivering this baby, especially with Novak’s steady hand and clear head in a crisis to back her up. Our short preview doesn’t indicate whether or not the patient and her baby live, but it does show that Violet will be facing consequences for this impromptu surgery. (NBC/Peter Gordon) Granted, there are lots of things paramedics are not qualified to do, no matter how talented they are. I’m no expert on the laws governing the job, but my guess is that they are not exactly authorized to perform major abdominal surgeries. So, sure. Legally, maybe what Violet did was wrong. Username or Email AddressPassword But ethically? She knew what needed to be done, and she knew how to do it. Doesn’t she have an obligation to do everything in her power to save her patient? Hopefully, the suspension she gets slapped with is temporary because, in my book, Violet is a hero. (NBC/Peter Gordon) The Stellaride of it All The promo doesn’t give us much more to go on, but Chicago Fire Season 13 Episode 3 left us with some big questions. First, now that Jack has been fired, will he still manage to come between Stella and Severide? After Damon hurled what was possibly the worst insult imaginable at Kelly, I’m betting we’re about to see poor Severide have an identity crisis. Since the conversation about a Stellaride baby is up in the air, could this actually lead us closer to that? Severide represents the “ready” half of the couple, while Stella still has reservations about becoming a mother. But what if being compared to Benny makes Kelly so scared of fatherhood that Stella realizes she’s ready after all? (NBC/Peter Gordon) Hear me out.  We’re talking about a couple who supports each other through their best and worst. If Severide starts to spiral about Damon’s comment, Stella will have to talk him down. She’ll remind him of all the ways he’s twice the man Benny ever was, and she’ll convince him he’ll be an incredible father. And in the process, maybe she’ll realize that her own anxieties aren’t as impossible to overcome after all. I’d love to see Stella work so hard to prove to  Kelly that he’ll be a rockstar father that she can’t contain her excitement about experiencing parenthood with him. (NBC/Peter Gordon) Chicago Fire Season 13 Episode 4 Spoilers: Pascal’s Deep, Dark Secrets At least one moment from the last episode gave me the ick, and it was watching Monica (KaDee Strickland) get turned on after learning about Pascal’s violent display of jealousy. Red flags are flying, and the award for most toxic relationship on Chicago Fire has officially been claimed. Moving forward, we should find out more about Pascal’s history, including his past with Monica. Whatever happened between them can’t have been healthy. Plus, we know something major happened in Miami that caused Pascal to leave, so maybe that event will shed some light on his anger issues. Considering that one of 51’s strengths is how it embraces wholesome masculinity and healthy male friendship, Pascal is really bringing the vibe down. (NBC/Peter Gordon) I don’t say that lightly. As a lifelong Dermot Mulroney fan, any time he plays an unsavory character, I’m both horrified and impressed. (I’m not kidding when I say lifelong. My Best Friend’s Wedding came out when I was four, and it was one of my first favorite movies!) It’s getting increasingly hard to watch Pascal’s arc develop, and that’s because the writers have done such a great job with this character. His misogynistic tendencies and the violent side he’s trying to hide from the firehouse are deeply concerning. I’m honestly really hopeful that we’re not going to find out he’s been physically violent toward Monica.    (NBC/Peter Gordon) Don’t get me wrong, KaDee Strickland is a phenomenal actress. This wouldn’t be the first time she played the part of an abuse victim. On Private Practice, her character was attacked and violated by a stranger. Strickland gave an Emmy-worthy performance in her portrayal of Charlotte King, especially during that storyline. I just don’t know if I can handle a storyline like that on Chicago Fire. That’s not to say there haven’t been plenty of hard-hitting plots, but it feels like we’re in an era of peace. I’m sure the showrunner knows that, though, and can’t wait to shake things up. (NBC/Peter Gordon) Some Burning Questions About Next Week’s Episode A few other random questions I have ahead of next week’s episode: Will Carver find out Tori is sneaky, manipulative, and jealous enough to delete his texts? Will he care enough to break it off with her? Is the chemistry between Lizzie and Violet leading anywhere? Can we please get more scenes with Ritter, Dwayne, Novak, and Violet? Those four have the best energy together. Remember when Eamonn Walker left Chicago Fire, but they said he would still make appearances sometimes? Can that happen soon? Please?! It’s going to feel like a long wait between now and Wednesday. (NBC/Peter Gordon) Do you have theories about next week’s installment? Let’s talk about it in the comments!  Chicago Fire Season 13 Episode 4 will air Wednesday, October 16 at 9/8c. Watch Chicago Fire Online",
