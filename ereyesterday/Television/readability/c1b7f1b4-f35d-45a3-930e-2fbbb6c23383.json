  "text": "Hallmark is bidding farewell to Peacock. (We hope they sent a card, at least.) Hallmark’s library of content is leaving the NBCUniversal streamer on May 1, TVLine has confirmed. That means original series like When Calls the Heart and The Way Home, as well as Hallmark’s extensive selection of holiday movies, will no longer be available to stream on Peacock. (Vulture’s Josef Adalian first broke the news on Bluesky.) Hallmark content began streaming on Peacock in 2022, with a source terming it “a successful partnership.” But now that Hallmark has its own streaming service, Hallmark+, it’s decided to move all of its content there. (Hallmark+, which rebranded and relaunched in September, currently costs $7.99 per month, or $79.99 annually.) In November, Hallmark announced that its popular drama The Way Home would debut its new season exclusively on Hallmark+, with a plan to eventually air it months later on Hallmark Channel. But after a fan protest, Hallmark reversed its decision, moving Season 3 of The Way Home back to Hallmark Channel for a January premiere. The Way Home was renewed for Season 4 in March. Will you miss watching Hallmark content on Peacock? Will this inspire you to switch over to Hallmark+? Let us know what you think in the comments.",
