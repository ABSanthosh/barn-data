  "text": "Finally, the Zoe case is returning. We’ve been on pins and needles about what happened with that young girl, Zoe, and the serial killer situation Ruzek stumbled upon during Chicago PD Season 12 Episode 10. Ruzek and Intelligence will make some headway in this case during Chicago PD Season 12 Episode 14. (Lori Allen/NBC) Young Zoe is Missing, and Intelligence Races to Find Her The promo teases that the infamous serial killer from the unresolved Zoe case has now taken young Zoe. We don’t know who the person is, but we know she has a clouded history that puzzled the unit. They couldn’t figure out where she came from if Zoe was her real name, and why the killer had an affinity for her. Somehow, the latest break in the case is this precocious eight-year-old disappearing, as Ruzek concludes it’s an abduction. However, Zoe doesn’t disappear without a fight. The promo teases that she’ll leave notes and clues, begging Ruzek, the others, and anyone listening for help. They also find footage of someone abducting her. (Lori Allen/NBC) The race is on to find Zoe, and the photos show that it may take the unit to some seedy and unsavory places. However, it’s a full-blown group effort, as the entire team will be on this case with Ruzek leading the charge. It promises to be an action-packed hour based on a possible car chase resulting in an accident and Ruzek busting down a door, gun drawn and ready to pounce into action. After a Clumsy Episode, Chicago PD Season 12 Episode 14 is Back in Top Form (Lori Allen/NBC) We’ve had some mixed feelings about Chicago PD Season 12 Episode 13. The long-awaited Atwater-centric fell short and had some clumsy writing and execution. Fortunately, by returning to Zoe’s case, we’re back on track with the strong Chicago PD Season 12 pacing, storytelling, and character-building. It’s exciting that the entire team is on this case, and we’ll likely see more of these great dynamics mixed and matched. Some of the stills feature Burgess and Ruzek together in the field. (Lori Allen/NBC) We also see a moment that may suggest Ruzek works closely with Kiana again. She is settling into this unit so effortlessly that it’s hard to believe she wasn’t there the entire time. We glimpse her at her desk following up on a lead, but she’s also in the field, including on the passenger side of one of the unit’s SUVs. Torres is on the scene during some of the action when he, Ruzek, and others stumble upon destitute-looking infrastructure that they may feel gives them a clue about Zoe’s whereabouts. And there’s a fantastic group shot of Voight, Torres, Atwater, and Cook. (Lori Allen/NBC) Ruzek’s Attachment to this Case is at the Forefront We know that Ruzek grew attached to this case and Zoe. Becoming a father has influenced how he approaches cases with children, and he has a lot happening in his personal life to make him more sensitive. He knows Zoe trusts him, so the clues she leaves are likely for him. And he doesn’t want to let her down. We hear how concerned Ruzek is, and his determination to find Zoe is palpable. When Ruzek is on a mission, we know nothing will get in his way. Interestingly, the hour is titled “Marie,” which makes one wonder if that may be Zoe’s real name or connected to the case. Ruzek Struggles with His Father’s Declining Health (George Burns Jr/NBC) The hour will also focus significantly on Disco Bob’s Alzheimers and how the Burgess-Ruzek family grapples with it. We see many pictures of Ruzek at home. In one, he and Burgess are speaking to their daughter, making me wonder if they’re explaining in more detail what’s happening with Grandpa. In others, we see Disco Bob cozy in their home and chatting with Burgess and Ruzek. Perhaps they’re coming up with a game plan on what’s next. (George Burns Jr/NBC) It’s a compelling development for Ruzek, balancing the difficulties of this intense case with the painful and personal reality of his father’s declining condition. I genuinely look forward to seeing the series continue to explore this deeper, and we can already anticipate another fantastic and powerful performance from Paddy Flueger. He does exceptionally well when the series gives him heavier material of this caliber, and he evokes so many emotions in viewers. If Disco Bob’s condition is fading, it’ll have to push Ruzek and Burgess to figure out some next steps to help him. (George Burns Jr/NBC) Ruzek isn’t keen on a facility, as moving Bob into their home was his response to Bob’s plan. However, with two working parents with unpredictable schedules and a child in the house, Bob’s rapidly declining condition may be too difficult for them. Perhaps they’ll look into new coping methods, like an at-home nurse or facility. The hour will likely explore these personal conflicts and moments and the harrowing bits regarding the case. (George Burns Jr/NBC) Over to you, Chicago PD Fanatics. What are your theories about what’s upcoming? How do you feel about Bob’s declining condition? Will Ruzek find Zoe? Let’s hear it all below!
