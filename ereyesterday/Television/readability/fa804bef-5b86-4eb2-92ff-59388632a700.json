Himesh Patel starred as Daniel, the first assistant director on a big-budget superhero movie that’s part of a Marvel-esque cinematic universe. Daniel Brühl co-starred as pretentious director Eric Bouchard, with Aya Cash as producer Anita and Billy Magnussen and Richard E. Grant as actors Adam Randolph and Peter Fairchild. Armando Iannucci (Veep) and Oscar winner Sam Mendes (American Beauty) served as executive producers, with Mendes directing the pilot. Debuting in October, The Franchise aired its season (and now series) finale on Nov. 24. The cancellation caps the show’s run at a total of eight episodes. “We’re so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with the tremendously talented team behind The Franchise, especially Sam Mendes, Jon Brown, Armando Iannucci, and this hilarious ensemble of actors,” an HBO spokesperson said in a statement. “While we won’t be moving forward with another season, we look forward to collaborating with all of them in the future.” Were you hoping to see The Franchise expand on HBO?
