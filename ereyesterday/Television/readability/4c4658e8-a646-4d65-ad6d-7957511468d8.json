Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-17-25 offer an exciting return, but it’s for a heartbreaking reason. No one does families coming together to support each other through tragedy better than Days of Our Lives, but that won’t make these scenes any easier to bear. (Peacock/Screenshot) Usually I’d Be Super Excited For Shane, But These Scenes Are Going To Be So Heartbreaking Marlena and Steve’s visit to Shane will set off a devastating chain reaction. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-17-25 say that after Marlena and Steve’s visit, Shane shares devastating news with Theresa, while Brady tries to comfort Tate. There’s only one thing that could mean. Shane gets confirmation of John’s death. He either knows already when Marlena walks in or learns soon afterward. Either way, I’m sure Marlena will be the first to find out. Deidre Hall will rock these scenes, especially because so much of the emotion mirrors her real-life grief over Drake Hogestyn’s untimely death. That won’t make them any easier for the audience to bear, though, especially coming so close to Doug’s death. It’s not anyone’s fault that these two legends passed on so close to each other, but it certainly is heartbreaking! (Screenshot/Peacock) As sad as it is, I’m glad that John is getting the sendoff he deserves. It would be wrong on so many levels if Days of Our Lives didn’t acknowledge the tremendous loss the soap world went through when Hogestyn passed away in September 2024. I’m also glad that Theresa’s involved in this story. So far, her return has been ridiculous. She’s been competing with Amy Choi to see who can be the worst television mother. At least being there to share in Tate and Brady’s grief gives her something worthwhile to do. (Peacock/Screenshot) Meanwhile, We Have To Pray That The Grief Doesn’t Send Belle Back Into EJ’s Arms (Again) I’m sick of this Belle/EJ nonsense. She’s acting like a sex addict, jumping into bed with EJ any time he flatters her, only to get angry at him and herself when she realizes he hasn’t magically turned into Prince Charming. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-17-25 say that Belle and Brady will confide in each other. Both of them are being idiots. That’s nothing new when it comes to Brady’s love life, and I guess Belle isn’t that far behind. (Screenshot/Peacock) She has jumped into bed with Philip before instead of working out her marital problems, after all. The one silver lining is that Sami is probably returning for the funeral—Alison Sweeney is supposed to make a guest appearance sometime soon—and she’s much better at being completely unhinged and impulsive than her little sister. Hopefully, Sami can put Belle in her place if no one else does it first. Brady needs only talk to a lawyer about protecting Rachel before he helps Ava press charges against the Blakes. That’s it. Done. Finito. But that’s too easy a solution, I guess, because instead Brady is acting like his only choices are to drop all charges or lose his daughter forever. (Peacock/Screenshot) Days Of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 3-17-25 Continue The Johnny Story I’ve Been Waiting For Forever Days of Our Lives has come a long way. Instead of continuing the lie that EJ and Sami were some great romance, the soap has finally acknowledged that EJ is a rapist. Whether Sami will go back to him anyway (even though she can’t forgive Lucas for kidnapping her to keep her safe from EJ) is another story. The exciting thing is that Johnny knows — and he’s not letting it go. Spoilers promise that he won’t forgive EJ, at least not right now. (Screenshot/Peacock) Johnny will reject EJ altogether — that’s already started, as the cliffhanger was him punching EJ hard enough to knock him over. He’ll also turn to Rafe for comfort. That makes sense since Rafe was Johnny’s stepfather, and the only reason that marriage fell apart was the stress and trauma of the original Arnold Feniger story. The only thing left on my wishlist is for Johnny to have a man-to-man talk with JJ Deveraux. In 2013, JJ faced a similar traumatic experience when he learned Jack had once raped Kayla. Like Johnny, he pushed for answers and was devastated when he finally got them. JJ ended up in jail for throwing a chair at a display of Jack’s book, but so far, the only difference between his story and Johnny’s is that Johnny took his anger out on a very-much-alive EJ instead of a storefront display that contained his photo. If anyone understands what Johnny is going through, it’s JJ, and Casey Moss and Carson Boatman would rock those intense scenes. Sadly, though, I doubt the writers have made that connection, so this will likely remain a missed opportunity. (Peacock/Screenshot) Still, Johnny’s scenes with EJ and Rafe should be Emmy-worthy material. After waiting for this story for YEARS, I can’t really complain, even if leaving JJ out would be a major missed connection. In between these two intense stories, there are some other, less important things going on. Gabi is supposed to be “displeased” with Javi. (Yes, that’s the actual wording of this spoiler!) (Screenshot/Peacock) It’s not difficult to figure out what that’s about. Gabi hates Leo. Javi invited Leo to live with them. “Displeased” shouldn’t begin to cover how Gabi feels. The girl is only a step below Sami in terms of the chaos she leaves in her wake when she’s pissed off. Meanwhile, Julie spies Melinda Trask walking around with Alice’s necklace around her neck. I feel like I SHOULD care about this, if only because Julie is a legacy character and one of my favorites. But this whole story is ridiculous. Melinda Trask may be a horrible person, but she used to be a DA who did the wrong thing for the right reasons. Now she’s nothing more than the criminals she used to hate with a passion! The only good thing about Julie catching her is that this annoying necklace story is almost over. (Peacock/Screenshot) Finally, Xander overhears Philip and Stephanie talking. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-17-25 make it sound like Xander is about to uncover their secret, but I doubt it. Knowing the way things usually go down in Salem, I’m expecting Xander to think Stephanie and Phillip are having an affair, which he couldn’t care less about. This storyline would make more sense if Xander overheard Philip and SARAH talking. At least then, the misunderstanding would be meaningful — Xander would think that his wife was cheating on him!
