  "text": "The New York Yankees’ crucial first win against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night drew 16.3 million viewers on Fox alone, making it the most-watched World Series Game 4 since 2016 (when Cleveland-Cubs delivered 16.7 mil). The Game 4 audience peaked at 18.2 million, from 10:15-10:30 pm ET. Factoring in FOX Deportes and FOX streaming services, the Game 4 audience rises to 16.7 million. Fox’s coverage of the 2024 World Series between the Dodgers (now up 3 games to 1, heading into tonight’s third and last Yankee Stadium match-up) and Yankees is thus far averaging just shy of 15 million total viewers (across Fox, Fox Deportes and Fox Sports streaming services), marking the Fall Classic’s best numbers since 2017. Game 1 last Friday drew 15.2 million viewers — the most-watched World Series opener since Astros-Dodgers 2017 (which delivered 15.3 mil) — and had a peak audience of 17.8 million from 11:30 pm ET to its gut-punch of a conclusion. Saturday night’s Game 2 delivered 13.8 million total viewers, marking the biggest audience for a World Series Game 2 since Dodgers-Red Sox 2018. The Dodgers’ 4-2 win peaked with an audience of 16.4 million, from 11 pm until the Yanks’ failure to capitalize on a based-loaded top of the 9th. Monday’s Game 3 averaged 13.2 million on Fox, which was a six-year high (since Red Sox-Dodgers, 13,3 million viewers).",
