  "text": "Frasier Star Jack Cutmore-Scott and EPs Address Our Burning Q: Will We Ever See ‘Goth Freddy’ Again?Frasier fans have known Freddy Crane his whole life… and they do have a particular fondness for one phase of his adolescence. In a memorable Season 11 episode of the original Frasier, a teenage Freddy — then played by Trevor Einhorn — shocked his father by arriving at his Seattle door in full Goth makeup and attire. (He was doing it to impress a girl, it turns out.) We haven’t seen it yet on the revived Frasier, but is there a chance that a now grown-up Freddy might break out the eyeliner at some point? “Listen, I’m game,” Jack Cutmore-Scott, who plays Freddy on Paramount+’s Frasier revival, tells TVLine with a laugh. He adds that Freddy going Goth again is ultimately in the hands of the writers, but he does concede that Freddy’s Goth phase is an “iconic” piece of Frasier lore. So we turned to Frasier executive producer Joe Cristalli, who is equally enthusiastic about bringing back Freddy’s Goth look: “If we can figure out a way to do it, yes. There’s nothing I would like more than to see Jack in Goth attire and eyeliner and moody… I would kill for that.” He then spitballs an idea where a future episode of Frasier flashes back to Freddy “being like 18, and [we] give him a funny wig and put him in some Goth makeup. And he’s just upset about it the whole time.” He admits “I don’t know when” it will actually happen, but he is adamant: “The answer is yes. We’ll get him in Goth makeup.” How are you liking Freddy’s evolution on Frasier so far? And would you welcome a return of his Goth phase? Let us know in the comments below.",
