  "text": "Reacher in Season 3 of the Prime Video hit has his XL hands full with not one or two but three different bad guys. Who is the foulest of them all? Short of having a mirror, mirror on the wall handy, TVLine posed that question to Reacher Season 3 co-stars Anthony Michael Hall (Bosch), Olivier “The Dutch Giant” Richters (Black Widow) and Brian Tee (Chicago Med). ZACHARY BECK, ‘RUG’ IMPORTER “I play Zachary Beck, who is a ‘rug exporter/importer,'” Hall recounted (yes, using air quotes). “We realize that he’s operating within a criminal network and, while I don’t want to give away spoilers, he’s living like a boss — like the Great Gatsby or something. “But as the story unfolds, we see other things that make him sort of more human,” Hall continued, alluding to Beck’s strained bond with son Richard, who has been the target of one, seemingly two kidnapping attempts. “So, to go from playing someone who’s intense and has a real goal with respect to his criminality, to playing the other stuff as a father that’s kind of broken and realizes that he wasn’t there for his son, it was powerful stuff.” OK, Anthony, but give us a cold, hard number. On a scale of 1 to 10, how eeeeevil is Zachary Beck? “Oh, I’ve got to give it a 10, man…,” he answered. “But I haven’t seen [Season 3] yet. I might’ve failed horribly. We’ll see!” PAULIE MASSERELLA, ‘FREAK OF NATURE’ Richters was quick to self-assess Paulie, the oversized guard manning the gate at Beck’s estate. “Nine out of 10” on the evil scale, he said. “I had to hold back a bit to make it realistic, but yeah, he’s a freak of nature, ‘made in a lab,’ as he is called in the book, and Reacher’s first real physical nemesis.” Paulie and Reacher (played by Alan Ritchson) stared each other down upon first meeting, and Reacher got in the first lick by tricking the none-too-swift gatekeeper into punching himself with his own fist. Each and every encounter between the beefy bros will only up the animosity, leading to multiple actual slugfests. “From the first time we meet, Reacher doesn’t listen, and that gives the first irritation. And the second scene is more irritation,” Richters recalled. “Scenes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7… it’s a total build-up between two titans that eventually collide, and people love seeing titans collide!” Brian Tee (Quinn), Olivier Richters (Paulie) XAVIER QUINN, THE ‘SOCIOPATHIC’ BLAST FROM THE PAST First glimpsed in a days-prior flashback that set Reacher’s Season 3 mission in motion, “Quinn is a nemesis from Reacher’s past that comes back to haunt him,” Tee said. “What I love about Quinn is that he’s an intellectual villain, and that’s what we love about Reacher, right? He’s big and brawny, but also extremely, extremely intelligent.” As such, when Reacher and the incredibly elusive (oh, and “dead”) Quinn draw closer and closer to each other’s orbit, “it’s like chess moves are happening, and we’re out trying to out-wit each other.” But make no mistake, Quinn is “a bad dude,” Tee emphasizes. “He’s a narcissistic, sociopathic psycho in every sense of the word. So, if there’s a scale from 1 to 10, this dude would be a 12.” Having read the novel on which Season 3 is based, and seen the flashbacks to Reacher and Quinn’s past that are coming up on the TV series, I was glad to see Tee go higher than Hall’s 10. “I went two higher than Anthony. That’s how bad Quinn is,” Tee noted. “I mean, Beck’s got a heart, and I don’t think Quinn does at all, except for himself.” Want scoop on Reacher Season 3 or 4, or for any other TV show?
