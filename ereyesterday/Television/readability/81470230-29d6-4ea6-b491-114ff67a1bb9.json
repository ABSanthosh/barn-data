  "text": "The first season of Mid-Century Modern was always going to open with a funeral, but creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan never expected it to also end with another. Now streaming, the Hulu comedy begins with three gay best friends — Bunny (Nathan Lane), Jerry (Matt Bomer) and Arthur (Nathan Lee Graham) — moving in together after the loss of their group’s fourth member. Because they decide to reside in Bunny’s Palm Springs abode, the boys get his mother Sybil (Linda Lavin) as a bonus roommate… until her sudden death from a heart attack in Episode 9. This, of course, was written in response to Lavin’s real-life death midway through production on the season. The process of writing Sybil’s death, as well as the characters’ response to it, is one Kohan recalls as being “terrifying. Just really, really terrifying.” “We so wanted to honor her in the way that she deserved to be honored, so the question was, well, are we up to the task?” Kohan tells TVLine. “What do we have? Well, we have the truth. We have the person that we knew and we have the truth of her experience.” Adds Mutchnick, “Linda said to us at the very end that she wanted us to write everything that was going on for her into the show. She certainly didn’t think it was going to take the turn that it did, but it allowed us to think of it that way when sat down to write. Let’s actually write what happened to her and to us, and what it’s like to have such a jarring, horrifying experience and then have to still pick yourself up and move on. That’s what we tried to do with that episode.” Now for another difficult question: What’s next? If you’ve seen any amount of Mid-Century Modern, you know how important Lavin is to the DNA of the show. Heck, it would be like if Estelle Getty’s character suddenly disappeared from The Golden Girls. Enter Pamela Adlon as Bunny’s sister Mindy, who inherited more of her mother’s qualities than she cares to admit. Mindy recurs throughout the first season, and even though she turns down the boys’ offer to move into Sybil’s now-vacant room in the season finale, she’ll remain in their orbit. “Fingers crossed, we’ve already set it up,” Mutchnick says of Sybil’s replacement. “It was a happy accident that Mindy was written into the show. Pamela Adlon is a friend and a brilliant actress and just a great sound for this show. We’re hoping that, in the event we’re lucky enough to come back, that she will come back with us.” If you’ve been bingeing Mid-Century Modern, let’s hear your thoughts: Are you enjoying your time with the Desert Queens? How do you think the show handled Lavin’s death? And what are you hoping to see in a potential second season? Grade the Hulu comedy in our poll below, then drop a comment with your full review.",
