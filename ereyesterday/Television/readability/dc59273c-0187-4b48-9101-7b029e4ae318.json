  "text": "ABC‘s Shifting Gears ended Season 1 with a kiss… just not the one audiences might’ve anticipated. During Wednesday’s finale, an inebriated (and newly single) Riley attempted to plant one on Gabe, but he resisted, explaining that, if they ever were to become more than friends, he would want it to happen at the “right time.” Meanwhile, back at her dance studio, Eve admitted that she dinged Matt’s car in an effort to get his attention, then locked lips with Riley’s dad — who, just a few weeks ago, was still overcome with grief surrounding the loss of his wife, Diane. Though ABC has not yet committed to more Shifting Gears, a Season 2 renewal is a sure thing. So, rather than just ask series boss Michelle Nader to unpack the events of the finale, we also inquired about her plans for the next batch of episodes, presumably airing this fall. Her answers are as follows: TVLINE | Now that Matt and Eve have kissed, is it safe to assume Jenna Elfman will be back in a big way in a hypothetical Season 2?Yes to more Eve! We are so lucky to have Jenna in the show. And Eve and Matt are such unlikely animal friends. Their chemistry is very spicy so I am personally dying to see where this goes. TVLINE | Having spent so much of this relatively short first season focused on Matt’s grief, was there ever any debate in the writers’ room about whether this kiss should have waited until Season 2?I love this question. Yes! We weren’t sure if it was too soon. But that is from Matt’s perspective. Eve is on a different timeline. Hers. And she’s impulsive. So she went in for the kiss. Raymond Liu/Disney TVLINE | How important was it that Eve be the one to make the first move?It was always going to be Eve making the first move. She is not passive. She started to see a different side of Matt and from that point it was on.  TVLINE | Matt seems surprised by his reaction to the kiss. He clearly likes it! But does that necessarily mean that he’s ready to pursue something? How much of a question will that be in Season 2?Matt was very in love with his wife and was in a relationship for his whole life. Dating another woman is going to be a hard for a guy like him. But yeah, he definitely is intrigued by Eve. How could he not be.  TVLINE | Beyond the whole “opposites attract” trope, what is it about Eve that you think makes her such a viable match for Matt? They are seemingly opposites but they are both self-made business people with lots of integrity and strong core beliefs in what’s right and wrong. They are two sides of the same coin in some ways. Raymond Liu/Disney TVLINE | Gabe had an opportunity to kiss Riley but knew it wasn’t the right time. Now that he knows that she’s interested as well, will he actively pursue a relationship with her in Season 2? We are rooting for Riley and Gabe but timing is going to be the issue for them. I’ll leave it at that for now!  TVLINE | Riley and Jimmy are officially divorcing… but he did get that rental nearby. Can we anticipate that he will remain a part of her and the kids’ lives, post-divorce, and that we will see more of Lucas Neff moving forward?Jimmy is touring with the Foo Fighters but he’s definitely still in love with Riley and wants to see his kids. We love Lucas so he would be a part of season 2.  Raymond Liu/Disney TVLINE | You have alluded to Matt and Diane’s son — Riley’s brother Sam — in multiple episodes. Is that a character you intend to introduce when the show (inevitably) returns?We hope to introduce Sam in Season 2.  We think he will be another fun casting opportunity and a great character for everyone to complain to!  What did you think of the Shifting Gears finale — and Season 1 overall? Weigh in via the following polls, then leave a review in the comments.",
