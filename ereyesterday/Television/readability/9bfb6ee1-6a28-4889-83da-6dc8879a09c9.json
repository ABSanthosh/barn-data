  "text": "Mom and Dad are fighting. It’s not often that we see discord between Sam and Jay on Ghosts, but this Thursday’s episode reminds us that although they’re couple goals, Sam and Jay also have arguments just like any other married pair, much as we dislike it. The cause of the marital tension is Kyle (guest star Ben Feldman, Superstore), who can see and talk to spirits like Sam after a giant bird hit him in the face on a rollercoaster. Pete happens upon Kyle while exploring a Montreal diner and brings him back to Woodstone B\u0026B, where the other ghosts first insult Kyle’s appearance, not realizing that he can hear them. Once they find out about his ability, they’re thrilled to have another living to converse with. (“This is incredible! Ooh, it’s another freak,” Hetty exclaims.) Sam is also excited to have another person around who can answer ghost questions and who understands her gift/burden, but her hubby Jay is being left out of their conversations and jokes. Bela pours salt into the wound, pointing out that Kyle is hot and has a unique connection with Sam. Still, Jay insists that he’s happy that Sam has someone to talk to — until Sam extends Kyle’s stay by hiring him as the B\u0026B’s new assistant, while also assigning him ghost duties like turning on the TV and buying magazines with Jason Momoa content. After a little digging, Jay discovers that Kyle spent six months in prison for breaking and entering, and confronts him in front of everyone. Kyle reveals that he did, indeed, spend time behind bars… for breaking into a house to get a hidden family heirloom at the request of a very old ghost. Awww. An upset Sam accuses Jay of being jealous of Kyle, who was actually helping their relationship by taking ghost stuff off her plate. She also liked having someone around who is going through same stuff she’s dealing with. “Whatever, you don’t understand,” Sam says, walking away. It’s difficult to watch the couple fight on such an emotional level, especially since most of their disagreements are usually about outside factors like the B\u0026B or ghost shenanigans. This, however, is about their relationship, which is usually so steady and supportive. And when Sam says Kyle’s presence was going to be “good” for her and Jay, it kind of makes you wonder how much of their difficulties we’re not seeing. As Kyle prepares to leave the B\u0026B, his tells Sam that it was a relief to find someone he can be himself around, and when she returns the sentiment, he leans in to kiss her. Sam facepalms him in response, and I’m feeling very vindicated for Jay… but also surprisingly sorry for Kyle, who explains how challenging it is to date with this ability. There’s not a lot of people out there willing to put up with this “gift.” His partner couldn’t handle his power. So while Kyle and Sam have a kinship, what Sam and Jay have is also very special. Restoring our belief in love, Sam and Jay apologize to each other, and Sam thanks him for being so patient and understanding. Elsewhere in the episode, Sasappis and Joan decide that instead of passing their time by just sitting around and waiting for a branch to fall, they’re actually going to do something. And by “something,” we mean sex, just to be clear for Sas. Thor, Flower and Trevor’s hype talk ends up making Sas more nervous, and he almost calls off his and Joan’s plans. Trevor offers Sas use of his room, where Sas tries Thor’s tossing move a little too aggressively and throws Joan through wall to the ground downstairs. She later assures him that this cool guy that he’s trying to be is not who she’s crazy about. Downstairs, Sam, Jay and the rest of the ghosts wait around, wondering what’s taking Sas and Joan so long. Just as Flower offers to go help out the pair, Sas comes downstairs. So did he and Joan do the deed? “Oh yeah,” he says with a big grin as everyone starts rejoicing. Ghosts fans, what did you think of the episode?
