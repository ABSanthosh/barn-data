  "text": "Critic's Rating: 4.5 / 5.04.5 What a premiere! The Cleaning Lady is back, and dare I say, better than ever. FOX has teased for months that the series would be shifting gears considerably, and boy, The Cleaning Lady Season 4 Episode 1 sent every single storyline in fascinating directions. (Jeff Neumann/FOX) It grabbed my attention from the first scene and didn’t let go until the end, which is the mark of a good show in my book. The Cleaning Lady Season 3 meandered for episodes before reaching an abrupt conclusion that promised a reset of sorts, so the pay off so far seems worth that season. (Jeff Neumann/FOX) Thony gets harder as the seasons go by, and she was on her A-game throughout the premiere as she faced continued adversity. Liza Weil’s return was kept well under wraps, which made it even more surprising that Russo was open to sponsoring the De La Rosa family and help them get visas. The Cleaning Lady Dangled a Perfect Life In Front of Thony and Fiona Nothing is ever easy on this show, and with an entire season to go, it was inevitable that Thony, Fiona, and the rest of the family’s dreams of becoming U.S. citizens would be put on hold in some capacity. In many respects, the series’ focal conflicts remain, but compelling new storylines have rejuvenated everything around them. (Jeff Neumann/FOX) While I don’t think Russo had to die to reiterate to Thony that Ramona was still pulling the strings of the Cartel, it was an effective way to show our heroine that she needs more skin in the game to succeed. I can sympathize with Thony’s initial reaction to flee America for Cambodia. You have to look at it from her perspective: Her entire family could be picked off, one by one, if she remained in the U.S. I never would have guessed Luca would be the person to make his mom understand that running wasn’t the best call. Looking at the bigger picture, would Ramona have allowed Fiona and the rest of the family to skate on by? (Jeff Neumann/FOX) Thony’s back was against the wall; when these situations arise, it’s all about fighting or fleeing. But the ordeal has taught Thony that the only way forward is to reclaim some form of power and play Ramona at her own game. Could Ramona Emerge Victoriously? Ramona is somehow deadlier from behind bars because she portrays this act on the inside that hints she’s given up and allows people to talk back to her. In true Ramona fashion, that couldn’t be further from the truth. She knows how to work many angles; somehow, she’ll rise like a phoenix when we least expect it. (Jeff Neumann/FOX) I’m unsure what her end goal is with Jorge, but she won’t give him a minute’s peace if he doesn’t visit her. The series wants us to think that she sent the gunmen that showed up in his new event space, but they shot a bit too close to the heart, leading me to believe that someone else entirely has it out for him. Perhaps one of Ramona’s enemies has returned and wants some revenge by going after those associated with her. A part of me wonders whether Ramona knows someone will appear out of the woodwork and try to take her down. (Jeff Neumann/FOX) She’s had a significant fall from grace, and the only way back up is to lead through a culture of fear. If people fear her, they won’t cross her. She’s a wonderfully complex character, and you never know what you’ll get with her, which throws a healthy amount of uncertainty into the narrative. Ramona’s Motivations Are Murkier Than Ever Her motivations now appear to be to control her brother and Thony from the inside, and being in prison may be the best place for her if someone has it out for her. There has to be a reason why she seemed content about being in prison when she chatted with Thony. (Jeff Neumann/FOX) While the premiere was excellent, Chris was the weak link and I’m sure you can surmise why. I get that he wanted to make some quick cash, but that was not the way to do it, and could have landed him and his family in a lot of trouble. The officer’s arrival at the house could have gone horribly wrong if Fiona had not quickly understood the gravity of the situation. She spent so long wearing the jewelry and not considering its worth that she was floored when she heard how much it was valued. (Jeff Neumann/FOX) But even in that moment, she knew the only way to keep her family intact was to imply that she allowed him to sell it and have it valued. Fiona has been caught up in some sticky situations with Thony over the last three seasons, but she has this renewed outlook on life and knows that she wants to provide for her family without breaking the law. Could Thony and Fiona Come to Blows? My best guess is that it will put her on a collision course of sorts with Thony, who is finding it difficult to say goodbye to the life of crime she’s been caught up in since the series premiere. That’s all I got, The Cleaning Lady Fanatics! (Jeff Neumann/FOX) What did you think of Russo’s deadly comeback? Were you surprised she was open to helping the De La Rosas? What’s your take on Ramona’s current situation? Is she really sitting pretty while people target the Cartel? What did you think of Thony electing to run to Cambodia and having her son talk some sense into her? Hit the comments below.
