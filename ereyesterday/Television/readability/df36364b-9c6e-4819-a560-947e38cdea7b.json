  "text": "The beloved Natasha Lyonne comedy Poker Face will be playing with even more of a stacked deck in its second season. Peacock announced today that Method Man, Awkwafina, Simon Rex, and Corey Hawkins will be joining the cast for the show’s sophomore outing. In other words, the series will continue to rival Elsbeth and SNL in terms of big-name guest stars. (Photo by Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) Though best known for his work with the Wu-Tang Clan, Method Man is no stranger to the world of acting. In addition to his performances in films like How High and Garden State, he also appeared in 13 episodes of HBO’s The Wire, considered by many to be the finest show in recent TV history. The legendary rapper is currently a regular on Power Book II: Ghost. As for Awkwafina, in addition to her signature series, Awkwafina is Nora From Queens, she also starred in Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, and she’ll appear in the upcoming season of Black Mirror. (Photo by Robin L Marshall/Getty Images) Rex is an industry vet who made a comeback with his stellar performance in the 2021 film Red Rocket, and Hawkins is best known for his role in Straight Outta Compton. Fun fact: The guy who played Dr. Dre and attended Julliard is the only member of this quartet who hasn’t released a hip hop single! The latest additions to Poker Face Season 2 will join a lengthy list of previously announced guest stars, including (deep breath!): Giancarlo Esposito, Katie Holmes, Gaby Hoffmann, Kumail Nanjiani, Sherry Cola, Kevin Corrigan, Ben Marshall, Kathrine Narducci, and Cynthia Erivo. (Photo by VALERIE MACON / AFP) Oh, you want more? How about BJ Novak, Margo Martindale, John Mulaney, Ego Nwodim, and Sam Richardson? Yep. This show doesn’t mess around when it comes to A-list murderers and stiffs. Sure, Elsbeth might have more of a bubbly personality, but clearly, Charlie Cale rubs shoulders with just as many big-name suspects. No premiere date has been announced for Poker Face Season 2. (Peacock (Promo Screenshot)) The show is expected to drop sometime in early- to mid-2025. Over to you, TV fanatics! Are you psyched about the return of Poker Face following a two-year hiatus?
