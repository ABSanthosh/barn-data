  "text": "Jay North, who played the title character in CBS‘ Dennis the Menace, has died. He was 73. The news of North’s death was confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter by Jeannie Russell, who played Dennis the Menace’s Margaret Wade. Russell said North died in Lake Butler, Fla., after a years-long battle with colon cancer, and called him her “otherworldly brother.” North starred as the iconic menace in CBS’ TV adaptation of Hank Ketcham’s Dennis the Menace comic strip. The series ran for four seasons from 1959 to 1963, and followed North’s Dennis as he created mischief targeted at his elderly neighbor Mr. George Wilson (Joseph Kearns). The series also starred Gloria Henry, Herbert Anderson and Gale Gordon. North’s other TV credits included Maya, Jericho, My Three Sons, The U.N.C.L.E. Show and Wagon Train. He also lent his voice to animated series Arabian Nights, Here Comes the Grump, The Banana Splits Adventure Hour, The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show and The Flintstone Comedy Hour. On the film side, North starred in The Teacher and appeared in Pepe, Wild Wind, Scout’s Honor and Lassie: Joyous Sound. His most recent credit was in 2003 for Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star.",
