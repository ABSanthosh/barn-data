  "text": "A daytime veteran is scrubbing out of General Hospital: Eva LaRue, of All My Children fame, is leaving the ABC soap after a year as Natalia Rogers-Ramirez, TVLine has learned. The exit is due to storyline reasons; LaRue’s final appearance on GH will air this week. “Eva’s been a dear friend for years, and I am so pleased we found an opportunity to work together!” General Hospital executive producer Frank Valentini said in a statement. “What originally was meant as a guest star arc turned into a longer and more satisfying arc, in thanks to Eva’s terrific work and chemistry with our cast. I was thrilled Eva was available to us in this extended role. I wish her all the best in her upcoming projects.” LaRue’s character Natalia was introduced in February 2024 as the mother of Blaze (Jacqueline Grace Lopez), just as Blaze was entering the early stages of a romance with Kristina (played by Daytime Emmy winner Kate Mansi). Natalia did not approve of the same-sex relationship, and fans “just hated my character so much,” LaRue admits to Soap Opera Digest. In Monday’s episode, Natalia ingested a lethal combination of pills and alcohol — a hint that she may be on the way out. LaRue is best known to daytime fans for playing neurologist Dr. Maria Santos Grey on All My Children on and off for 18 years, earning a Daytime Emmy nomination in 1997. (She later won a Daytime Emmy for her guest work on The Young and the Restless.) LaRue also co-starred alongside David Caruso in the long-running CBS procedural CSI: Miami, debuting as DNA expert Natalia Boa Vista in Season 4.",
