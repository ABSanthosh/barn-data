  "text": "Critic's Rating: 4 / 5.04 Tyson got very lucky. For now, Tyson remains a free man in his conscience; he is not yet a killer. Joining forces with Dwight means the possibility is always within reach, but for now, he’s free of that guilt. How long will this dynamic last amidst so much chaos? (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) Dwight’s Loyalty Runs Deep – But At What Cost? Tulsa King Season 2 Episode 8 solidifies one of Dwight Manfredi’s strongest traits: loyalty. Dwight’s brand of loyalty isn’t just lip service — it’s a core part of his identity.  “Under New Management” illustrates how he treats his crew as a found family, with Tyson as a prime example.  Dwight saw something in Tyson from the beginning, and despite Tyson’s youth and inexperience, he’s kept him close. But loyalty isn’t free, and Dwight drives home to Tyson what it means to be part of his inner circle.  When Tyson made a reckless move that could’ve ended disastrously, Dwight didn’t let it slide. In any other “family,” that sort of half-baked decision-making would have spelled the end for Tyson, but Dwight operates differently.  (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) Dwight makes sure Tyson understands the gravity of his actions without discarding him. What’s especially interesting is the contrast between Dwight’s crew and the traditional mafia structure, where one mistake could end in a hit.  Dwight treats loyalty with a measure of fairness that’s rarely seen in organized crime dramas. And yet, his dedication to Tyson and the rest of his crew has limits.  If this keeps happening, we could see Dwight grappling with the balance between being supportive and enabling dangerous behavior — a balance he has to master if he’s going to survive in this messy web of alliances. (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) Of course, Dwight’s loyalty to his found family isn’t without its costs. His daughter, Tina, is slipping further out of his life, and he’s justifying it as protecting her from the chaos of his world.  Yet, it’s clear they have unfinished business, and their strained relationship feels like a missed opportunity. Tina’s character has the potential for so much depth — she’s got the grit and determination that would make her an ideal ally for Dwight or at least a source of meaningful conflict.  But as it stands, the show seems intent on keeping her at a distance. Is this the last we’ll see of Tina? I can’t help but hope there’s more in store, especially given how thin the female cast is on Tulsa King. Where Are Tulsa King’s Women? Here’s the elephant in the room: where are the fully fleshed-out women in Tulsa King?  (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) Look at shows like Yellowstone, where Beth Dutton is a powerhouse, or 1883 and 1923, where the Dutton women hold their ground and shape the narrative as much as the men. Even on Lioness, a female-driven series, the focus on women is sharp and complex.  But here in Tulsa, it’s a different story. Women are barely more than set pieces, and it’s honestly baffling.  We’ve got Stacy, whose motivations seemed to change with the wind, Manny’s wife Clara, who’s written as a strong woman but is largely sidelined, and Tina, who’s always a step away from the action. The irony? Tulsa King could benefit hugely from a character with the same ruthless determination we see in Beth Dutton or the moral complexity of Dwight’s sister, Joanne. But instead, we’re left with a “boys’ club” setup that doesn’t add anything fresh to the genre.  Even the FBI angle, which could have introduced a formidable female antagonist or ally, defaults back to male agents confronting Dwight. (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) Imagine the dynamic if a woman had been leading that charge, using a feminine connection to Dwight, as Stacy did, to play on his weaknesses.  This show is practically crying out for a female character who’s as layered and unapologetically ambitious as the men. A Tangled Web of Betrayal and Power Struggles Now, let’s talk about the power struggles tearing Dwight’s world apart. Vince in New York has his eye on Chickie’s position, Chickie’s got it out for Dwight, and Bill is out for blood over Cal’s mess with Jackie Ming.  It’s a recipe for chaos, and at least one life was already lost. RIP, Jimmy. (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) Each character tries to pull strings, but no one seems to understand how tangled this web has become. And, of course, Dwight is smack in the middle, somehow managing to keep his head above water. Tyson thought it was Bill who ordered the hit on Dwight, but as it turns out, nefarious Jackie Ming is behind the chaos. Jackie’s a wildcard, and he’s different from the other gangsters in Dwight’s world.  Most of these men have a softer, more human side, which is part of what makes Tulsa King work — it’s gritty but with a hint of vulnerability in its characters. Jackie, though? He’s ruthless, with no regard for the code that the rest of these men live by.  His presence brings a colder, more cutthroat element into the series that throws everything out of balance and puts everything we hold dear in jeopardy. He’s not just another villain; he’s a disruption to the entire dynamic of the show, and it makes me wonder how long he’ll stick around. (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) An Ending That Keeps Us Guessing With every passing episode, Tulsa King seems to ratchet up the stakes, and this one is no exception.  The constant betrayals and shifting alliances keep you guessing, and it feels like we’re careening toward an explosive showdown.  Dwight faces threats from every angle — New York, Tulsa, and even within his own crew. If these men could put aside their egos for a minute, they might be able to find a way forward, but as it stands. Was the talk between Cal and Bill a hint that this might be accomplished? Manny’s recent heist at the casino is just one more wrench in an already dysfunctional machine to the point that this episode leaves us with the question: who will come out on top? (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) Dwight’s position is more precarious than ever, and with every choice he makes, he risks alienating someone else in his life.  Watching him try to navigate this maze of betrayal and ambition, I can’t help but wonder who will be standing beside him when the dust settles.  This show keeps us on our toes, and just when we think we’ve got a handle on things, another twist gets thrown into the mix. With everything going on, it’s safe to say that wherever Tulsa King takes us next, it will be anywhere but boring. Username or Email AddressPassword Watch Tulsa King Online",
