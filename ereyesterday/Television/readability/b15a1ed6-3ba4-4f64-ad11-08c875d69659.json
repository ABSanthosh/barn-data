  "text": "Warning: This post contains spoilers for the first two episodes of The Summer I Turned Pretty Season 3.  A major bombshell has nearly torn Belly and her soulmate apart, but is Jeremiah to blame? Let’s recap. The Summer I Turned Pretty‘s third and final season — which debuted its first two episodes on Prime Video Wednesday — is already delivering a heavy dose of drama. We begin with a time jump, fast-forwarding to Belly’s junior year of college, where she and Jer have been dating blissfully for the past three years. That is, until Belly learns devastating news: Jeremiah slept with another girl while on Spring Break in Cabo. But there is some complexity here. The couple had gotten into a fight before Jer left for the trip, prompting them to “break up.” To Belly, this was hardly a real break. She figured they’d repair things upon his return — which they ultimately did. But to Jer, much like Ross in Friends, they were on a break! Relationship rules did not apply. He claims he didn’t cheat on her, while she claims he betrayed her trust, and they have an explosive fight where they end things for good. (Well, for now.) During their time apart, we learn Belly is keeping her own secrets: Deep down, she knows a part of her will always love Conrad. After all, he was her first love, and the two even recently shared a romantic run-in at Cousins, which she conveniently has kept from Jeremiah. Knowing she has made her own mistakes, Belly begins to question if she’s being too hard on her beau. Meanwhile, Taylor and Steven face problems of their own. The two are seeing other people, trying to ignore their feelings for each other, but are still secretly sleeping together. Steven finally gets the guts to end things with his girlfriend and drives to Taylor’s house to tell her he wants to be in a real relationship with her. When Steven arrives at Taylor’s, she hops in the car and they go for a drive, where Steven eventually tells Taylor how he feels. But after seeing the devastating effects love has had on her bestie Belly, Taylor isn’t interested. She gets upset, and demands that Steven let her out on the side of the road — she can’t spend another second in the car next to him. He complies, but immediately has a change of heart, and makes a U-turn to follow her. Then, Steven is T-boned by a truck. He ends up being fine (yay!), but he wakes up from a medically induced coma with a new sense of clarity: He tragically breaks things off with Taylor just as she has decided to be with him. (Boo!) And Steven isn’t the only one who has a change of heart after the accident; Belly and Jeremiah have some epiphanies of their own. The two reunite in the waiting room and, overcome by just how precious life can be, immediately make up. As if nothing had ever happened, Jeremiah pops a surprising question, the question, as a matter of fact: Will Belly marry him? Yes, she says, before he can even finish asking. The two hug, kiss and appear to have their whole happy lives before them. But we can’t help but wonder: Should Belly be more cautious in the wake of Jer’s betrayal, or was his Spring Break adventure an honest mistake?
