  "text": "John Erwin, who voiced childhood characters like He-Man and Reggie Mantle from The Archie Show, has died at the age of 88. Erwin passed away of natural causes “around Dec. 20” in his home in Camarillo, Calif., per a statement released by his PR firm Celebworx. “Working with John Erwin was a ballad of irreverence, professionalism and surprise,” Alan Oppenheimer, who voiced the evil Skeletor on He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, said in a statement. “He was a series actor, writer, performer of commercials, musician, painter and an all-around lovely gentleman, an indelible addition to my life.” In a Facebook post titled “A Letter to My Brother,” Melendy Britt, who voiced She-Ra, said, “Aside from being friends in real life, for 40 years we had been a team. We were He-Man and She-Ra. To have “my brother” pass on is a tremendous sorrow even though I know life is not infinite. The tears I have are because John was such a special quiet man and we shared a very special relationship in those roles as twin brother and sister. Your body of work will live in the hearts of so many people to whom you gave love and strength and hope and laughter in times of difficulty and the need to be calmed by laughter and hope.” Born in Cambridge, Mass., Erwin got his start on TV in 1959 as the character Teddy in Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood’s American Western series Rawhide. He shifted gears in 1968 becoming a voice actor starting with the role of Reggie in the animated sitcom The Archie Show. Erwin later voiced several characters in Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Groovie Goolies. In 1983, he voiced He-Man in He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, also voicing Prince Adam and Beast Man. Erwin continued voicing the characters throughout the series until its conclusion in 1985, as well as for the 1986 movie. When the original series ended, he reprised his roles for the He-Man Christmas special and She-Ra: Princess of Power, and made one final return to the character of He-Man in 2005 for an episode of Family Guy. Erwin also appeared in various TV commercials, known for voicing Morris the Cat for the 9Lives brand of cat food. Erwin is survived by “his loving family of children and grandchildren.”",
