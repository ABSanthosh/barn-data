  "text": "Apple AirPods Are on Sale for Less Than $170 on Amazon — Shop NowAmazon is celebrating the holidays with a major Apple AirPods sale. Here’s how to get a pair of AirPods Pro, which are perfect for on-the-go streaming from a tablet or phone, or listening to a favorite TV podcast, for less than $170. Courtesy of AmazonApple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen)On Sale 32% off An Apple AirPods sale is a rarity, so you’ll definitely want to claim this early Black Friday deal.: You can now purchase the Apple AirPods Pro for just $169.99! Whether it’s with the Lightning case or USB-C model, there isn’t a better headphone for on-the-go streaming. The AirPods Pro offer active noise cancellation so you can silence the world around you and the Adaptive Transparency mode can adjust in real-time to intense noises, so you can still be attuned to necessary sounds such as sirens. What makes AirPods so unique and worth the splurge, however, is the case. Anytime your pods are put away while not in use, they’ll automatically charge. The fully charged case gets you 30 hours of total listening time with Active Noise Cancellation enabled, and the fully charged headphones can enjoy up to six hours of listening time with Active Noise Cancellation enabled. (Be sure to pay attention to which charging case you prefer: The USB-C style or Lightning style. Both are on sale!) If you want the perks of the Apple AirPods Pro without the price tag, try another model. There is currently an additional Apple AirPods sale for the AirPods 4. This style doesn’t feature customizable earpieces, but it still is comes with the charging case and a high-quality listening experience.
