  "text": "This week in the Big Brother house, Jimmy’s move to try to get Keanu ousted more than blew up in his face. Despite the exhaustive (and very shady) work he put in, when Thursday’s live eviction episode begins, the only “bro” on the block is Zae, and he’s sitting next to Rachel’s bestie Amy and Vince’s No. 1 Kelley. I feel like I’m taking crazy pills here. Season after season, people refuse to learn: Pawns go home! Is the best move for Head of Household Vince to… put his closest ally on the block just to save some face? No. Absolutely not. Return to sender. But that’s exactly what he did. Sigh. So how did Vince’s HOH ultimately shake out? Let’s recap. THE STRATEGY | After the Veto meeting, Keanu and Vince compare notes about Jimmy’s big play. Keanu then approaches Jimmy directly, saying that he was told Jimmy was coming after him and wanted him on the block. So what’s Jimmy do? He lies, lies, lies his way out of it! (You can bounce checks in the BB house.) Of course he was gunning for Keanu! But he’s not going to tell him that. Zae attempts to lock down an alliance he thinks will protect him moving forward. That group: Rylie, Zach, Vince, Will and himself. And they’re calling themselves: Burger Boys! (Get it? Five guys?) Kelley says she “thought she could do something cool” by offering to go up as a pawn. (Ma’am, Tucker, you are not.) This massive favor for Vince could pay off, or it could be her one-way ticket out the door. Rachel obviously wants Amy to stay, so her goal is to get Zae out of the house this week. (Zae’s chess skills have been clocked by multiple houseguests — but all you feedsters know all about that.) Zae tells Rachel that if he wins HOH, he’s going to put up people who vote against him. He says the odds that he would put her up are high, and Rachel reacts… exactly how one would expect Rachel Reilly to react. Later Zae tells her: “As long as I’m in this house, there’s no way you win two seasons of Big Brother.” Fighting words and we love to see it! THE BB BLOCKBUSTER | For the first BB Blockbuster comp, players must unscramble four words that will form a phrase. That phrase will lead them to a specific object in the room, and the first person to snag it and hit their buzzer will save themselves from the block. Kelley figures out that the item in question is a crown. She grabs it, hits the buzzer and wins the season’s very first BB Blockbuster! The vote will now be between Zae and Amy. Vince, ya just got very lucky, my man. THE VOTE | In her speech, Amy explains to the house that Zae is a way bigger threat, physically and mentally. Zae, however, tells the house that keeping Amy gives Rachel a second vote in the game and a clear path to coast to the Final 5. After everyone goes into the D.R. to give “Auntie Julie” their vote, it’s official: Zae is evicted from the house with nine votes to his name. Surprised by tonight’s outcome?
