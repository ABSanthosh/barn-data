  "text": "This day was always going to come, but that doesn’t make it any less sad. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-03-25 promise the beginning of the end for a beloved character. Yep, Marlena and Steve are going to set out in search of John — who we all know is not coming home alive. (Peacock/Screenshot) John Has Been Missed Since Drake Hogestyn’s Real Life Death Although John hasn’t been declared dead yet, it’s been glaringly obvious that he’s gone. There have been so many stories that could have used his presence. Marlena had to try and fail to get ahold of him to tell him that he didn’t kill Katerina — she was still alive, and he actually played a role in helping her escape a violent situation. Tate’s needed him too. Does anyone doubt that if he could have, Drake Hogestyn would have filmed scene after scene after scene of John helping Tate figure out what to do about this messy pregnancy situation with Sophia? He’d have been right there with Steve working on cases for Black Patch, too, and refereeing Marlena’s fights with Belle about EJ. It doesn’t make it any easier to watch his exit story, but some of the shock of Drake Hogestyn’s untimely death has worn off by now. Mostly what I feel is relief that it isn’t taking an entire year to get to his on-screen death. (Peacock/Screenshot) The timing sucks, as death’s timing usually does. It hasn’t been that long since Bill Hayes’ death was acknowledged on-screen, and Julie is first overcoming depression and heartbreaking grief. And now her dear friend Marlena will go through the same thing. Fortunately, we’re not quite at the point of realizing John is dead yet. Marlena and Steve will first be searching for John this week. Still, we know where the Days of Our Lives spoilers during the week of 3-03-25 are going, especially since we’ve had so many hints that Sami’s coming back. (She’ll probably wreak havoc in Salem during John’s funeral). (Peacock/Screenshot) Will Rafe’s Amnesia Be Short-Lived? As I predicted in my Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-24-25, EJ and Rita switched Arnold and Rafe just in time for the Salem PD to arrest the wrong guy. Apparently the writers weren’t ready to let go of this ridiculous story yet because Rafe has total amnesia. One of the only lines Galen Gering has had in recent days is “Who’s Rafe?” I’m afraid to hope this story will end soon, but Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-03-25 say that Jada will pull out all the stops to get Rafe back to himself. Hopefully, that means that Jada realizes Rafe is Rafe, but with amnesia. So far, she thinks he’s Arnold faking amnesia to get out of trouble. With Gabi having demanded a DNA test on Fake Rafe’s hair, though, I’m afraid the test will come back Arnold and cause more confusion. Then again, DNA tests in Salem are so unreliable that Kayla should tell Gabi that this one shows the opposite of whatever it claims. So maybe things will work out. (Peacock/Screenshot) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 3-03-25 Suggest EJ Will Have A Terrible Week The walls are closing in on EJ. I love when evil plans unravel. It often makes for exciting drama. From the spoilers, it looks like EJ is going to get it from all sides. He’s already reeling from Belle breaking up with him and warning him that she intends to prosecute,Jada knows he replaced Rafe with a doppelganger to mess with her, and Gabi wants her brother back. About that last one… this might be the week that EJ gets shot. The Days of Our Lives promo video for the week of 3-03-25 has her storming into Chanel and Johnny’s meeting with the Chois, gun in hand. Yep, Gabi wants to know where her brother is and she is ready to force the issue. This is stupid on her part. Gabi was in prison for months because EJ had evidence that she killed Li Shin, and she won’t forgive him for it. If she shoots him, she’s likely headed back to prison for the same thing she served time for unfairly. Johnny and Chanel have another problem, too: this is all happening in front of Amy Choi! (Peacock/Screenshot) Is All This Chaos Karma For Sophia’s Lie? I’m still not sure why Amy has any say over who adopts her granddaughter. Sophia will be 18 by the time the baby is born, so it should be up to her. But this is the story that’s been written, so I have to go with it. When we left off, Sophia had impulsively and stupidly told her mother that Chanel is extremely religious and runs women’s Bible study groups at her church. I was expecting a comical but ridiculous sequence where Chanel has to pretend to be uber religious to get past Amy’s gatekeeping. Judging from Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-03-25, what’s going to happen will be SO much worse. Gabi and her gun will walk into the middle of this luncheon where everyone is pretending to be a good Christian — or, at least, an upstanding citizen. (Peacock/Screenshot) I think it’s safe to say that Johnny and Chanel are not getting that baby — at least not right now. Paulina is going to go into Mama Bear mode if Amy says anything negative about her daughter and son-in-law, and if Amy really refuses to let them adopt… watch out. Honestly, though, if Amy Choi is that religious, they weren’t getting the baby anyway. Johnny and his grandmother were both possessed by the Devil. Ms. Uber Religious will veto this so quickly she gives everyone whiplash if she finds out about that. Plus, the Dimeras aren’t known for being highly moral — in fact, pretty much every crime in Salem can be traced to them somehow. So, no, unless EJ kidnaps that baby for his son, this isn’t happening. (Peacock/Screenshot) There are several, less interesting spoilers in store this week: Surprise, surprise (not!) Joy might be pregnant with Alex’s baby. As if we need another accidental pregnancy right now. However, Alex is likely to misunderstand and think Stephanie is the one pregnant. Holly is trying to clarify her feelings about the two guys who are into her. I think she gels better with Doug III, but that stolen necklace seems to be more of a dealbreaker for her than Tate having a baby with Holly’s ex-BFF. Philip and Xander will make some dubious hiring choices in an effort to please Wei Shin, who will be back this week. I wonder who they have in mind. Finally, Kristen’s mother must fulfill her promise to her wayward daughter. Whatever that is, it’s something that’s sure to cause more trouble.
