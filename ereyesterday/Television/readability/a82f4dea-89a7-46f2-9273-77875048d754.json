  "text": "Life in Ransom Canyon will never be the same by the end of the Netflix western’s first season. The sexy, soapy series lassoed plenty of drama in its first 10 episodes, from a devastating tornado to the tragic loss of a town staple — Cap Fuller, played by the iconic James Brolin. Unfortunately, it’s Brolin’s status as an icon that ultimately led to his character’s demise in Episode 10. “We wanted someone who was kind of iconic like Jim to [play Cap], but we weren’t sure if he’d really sign up to do multiple seasons,” showrunner April Blair tells TVLine. “So I always had in my head that his passing would be the thing that sort of [changed everything]. Once Jim came, he was like, ‘I would stay!’ But we were sort of already in the process of killing him off, which was sad.” And Cap’s death wasn’t the only major development in Ransom Canyon‘s first season finale. Despite exposing Paula Jo and basically saving the town, Staten could still be removed as his ranch’s sole trustee due to his loose-cannon behavior; Quinn accepted a position with the New York Philharmonic; Margaret was arrested for her involvement in Randall’s accidental death; Lucas received acceptance letters from Columbia and Princeton; Lauren repaired her relationship with her father, though repairing her shoulder will take more time; and after turning down Yancy’s proposal (for now), Ellie was approached by a woman who introduced herself as — wait for it — Yancy’s wife. Below, showrunner April Blair explains how these twists could impact the show’s future in a not-yet-ordered second season: A ‘NEW MISSION’ FOR QUINN | As planned, Quinn will indeed head to the Big Apple for a stint with the New York Philharmonic — and she will return. “She comes back with a new mission” in Season 2, Blair says. “Quinn has spent a lot of her past trying to save other people, and she comes back changed by this experience. Season 2 for her is really about saving herself and doing what’s right for her.” DID SOMEBODY SAY ‘TIME JUMP’? | The question is: Will we get to spend time with Quinn in New York, or will we pick up upon her return to Texas? “The beauty of Ransom Canyon is Ransom Canyon,” Blair says. “If we started in New York, I’m not sure it would be the same show. So I think we’re going to pick up when Quinn returns home after her stint in New York, and that will give us time to see what has changed. Quinn’s return is our reentry into Ransom Canyon. We’ll see and experience it with her.” MRS. YANCY GREY REVEALED | I don’t know too much about where the storyline with Yancy’s estranged wife is headed — other than it being bad news for Ellie — but I can reveal this fun behind-the-scenes secret: the woman who played his wife in the finale was actually Erica Dasher, who previously starred on Blair’s then-ABC Family series Jane by Design. “I don’t know that she’ll actually play the wife [in Season 2],” Blair says. “That’s why we only showed her from behind. But she was visiting me in New Mexico, and I was like, ‘Can I make you the back of a mystery head?'” REID’S ‘LOYALTY’ IS TESTED | If you enjoyed watching Lucas and Reid’s unlikely bromance develop throughout Ransom Canyon’s first season, you’re going to love what Season 2 has in store. “They hit some roadblocks, but they definitely maintain a friendship,” Blair says. “Reid evolves into someone who’s conflicted about life. He knows the sacrifices his dad made to save their ranch, but he also doesn’t agree with all of his dad’s moves. His dad moves a little wild sometimes. He has a loyalty to his father and a loyalty to his friendship with Lucas, and how he navigates those in Season 2 is fun — and a little heart-wrenching.” A ‘FRESH MYSTERY’ | With the truth about Margaret’s accidental involvement in Randall’s death finally exposed, Lauren’s mom is now behind bars and “that mystery has been put to bed,” Blair says. “You never move on from the loss of a child, but we wanted Staten to be able to start growing emotionally and letting go of that ghost.” But with a new season comes new drama — and a new question mark for the people of Ransom Canyon. “In Season 1, the pipeline was threatening to come in. In Season 2, it’s being laid and constructed. There’s a whole new, fresh mystery and engine to Season 2.” OK, let’s talk: Did you enjoy your trip to Ransom Canyon? Are you hoping for a (very likely) Season 2 renewal? Who are your favorite and least favorite characters? Whatever’s on your mind, drop it in a comment below.",
