  "text": "We have some incredible news if you’re still reeling from all that Amy and Jake sweetness on Doc Season Episode 1 Episode 8. The hit FOX medical drama scored a season two renewal! We could not be more thrilled about it, but the good news doesn’t stop there. (FOX) Doc Season 2’s 22-episode Order is a Rare Find Among Shortened Seasons If you’ve been following along with our Doc Reviews, you’ll recall that one criticism of the series is not having enough time to properly expand on and explore all of its complex, rich characters. That problem won’t exist during Doc Season 2, as FOX has greenlit a full 22-episode season order. It’s massive and, frankly, a rarity these days. Most network series have been drastically trimmed to shortened seasons, much to the chagrin of diehard viewers and fans. FOX’s commitment to a full season feels like television formatting at its finest is returning to the small screen again. It also demonstrates the network’s faith in this series, its cast, writers, and the viewers who have faithfully watched every episode. (Courtesy of FOX) Doc Breathes Life into FOX’s Scripted Fare And Saves the Network Doc’s Renewal is no surprise to anyone as the hit series’ premiere scored over 16 million viewers, making it FOX’s most-watched debut in over five years! FOX hasn’t seen those numbers for its original scripted programming and for some time, so it’s no wonder they’re stepping fully behind this juggernaut series. It’s particularly a great sign after FOX’s hit 9-1-1 moved over to ABC, and the spinoff, 9-1-1:Lone Star, signed off with a disappointing fifth season. “We are thrilled that audiences have embraced Season One of Doc. Barbie and Hank have done an outstanding job bringing one of the most emotionally powerful series on television to life. Renewing for a second season was an easy decision, thanks to this incredible team, our partners at Sony, and an exceptional cast led by the talented Molly Parker,” FOX’s president Michael Thorne shares. (FOX) “We’re ecstatic Doc has been picked up for a second season – a testament to the exceptional writing, captivating performances from our talented cast, and the incredible reception from audiences,” said Katherine Pope, President of Sony Pictures Television Studios. “We’re so grateful to our partners at FOX for their unwavering support as we continue making more episodes of this show!” Doc Boasts INCREDIBLE Numbers Thanks to Viewers! In short, because of you, Doc Fanatics, the series has pulled such incredible numbers and inspired the network to commit fully. FOX hasn’t seen a scripted premiere score those types of numbers since 9-1-1: Lone Star. Also, Doc is FOX’s most streamed premiere episode across 7-day viewing in over a year. In L+7 viewing, the second episode of Doc was up +40% in A18-49, marking the most significant Week Two increase (among A18-49) for any 4-Net entertainment show season-to-date. (Courtesy of FOX) Thus far, Doc is one of only two new broadcast shows this season to grow in its second week in both adults 18-49 and total viewers. From the unique formula of this medical procedural to the storytelling and strong cast, viewers keep coming back for more and bringing friends along with them. Doc is run by Barbie Kligman, who serves as showrunner and executive producer. Hank Steinberg and Erwin Stoff are executive producers. Doc’s Inspiration and Unique Concept Revitalizes the Medical Drama Genre The series is, of course, inspired by the true story of Italian doctor Pierdante Piccioni, who lost his memory in 2013 thanks to a car accident. His memoir Minus Twelve: Losing My Memory and Regaining It inspired the sensational Italian series Doc — Nelle tue mani. (FOX) Doc is the American rendition of the series. It follows Dr. Amy Larsen, a brilliant, complex, and beautifully flawed former Chief of Internal and Family Medicine at Westside Hospital. Amy navigates her new reality after a shocking car accident leaves her with a TBI and erases the past eight years of her life. Of course, so much has changed in her life in those eight years that she cannot remember, leading to rich, complex, raw, and wonderfully human conflicts and storytelling. Amy must adjust to her new position at work, navigate a place she called home but has been missing for eight years, and face all the ramifications of her behavior during a time she cannot remember. Doc’s Compelling Characters Can Evolve More in Sophomore Season (FOX) She faces off with colleagues, leans on dear friends, and learns that her love and family life are more complicated than ever before. Doc is a reinvention of the traditional medical drama, balancing procedural storytelling with medical cases and character-rich stories. As a result, the series has so much heart and soul, which is why it connects with so many people. We’re beyond thrilled about this renewal news and look forward to bringing you more Doc content in the future. Doc stars the esteemed Molly Parker (House of Cards), Omar Metwally (The Affair), Amirah Vann (How to Get Away with Murder), Jon Ecker (Queen of the South) and Anya Banerjee (The Blacklist). Can Doc Sustain Itself with a Super-sized Second Season? (Courtesy of FOX) The first season also features recurring guest stars Scott Wolf (Party of Five) and Patrick Walker (Lessons in Chemistry). If you haven’t been tuning into this wonderful series already, hopefully, this renewal news will put your mind at ease, and you can catch up with the knowledge that there is plenty more to come. Some have wondered if, with Doc’s unique premise, the series could maintain the storytelling it delivers. Fortunately, we’ll find out how much further they can go with 22 episodes in a season. (FOX) I’m excited about it; how about you, Doc Fanatics? Celebrate in the comments below! Are you excited about the full-season pickup? Do you have some concerns or fears about Doc pulling it off? Let’s hear from you! Doc returns with an all-new episode on March 11 at 9/8c on FOX. Stay tuned for our exclusive interview with Amirah Vann and other Doc related news! Watch Doc Online",
