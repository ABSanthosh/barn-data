  "text": "Your patience is being rewarded. It’s time for more margarita nights in Serenity. Sweet Magnolias Season 4 will be released on Netflix on February 6. Sweet Magnolias’s third Season was the weakest, so Netflix must improve the narrative. Hopefully, it listened to the fans and repaired several relationships. This trailer gives us some hope. (Netflix/Screenshot) We wish they had released the trailer earlier since it looks so hopeful, and we love going home to Serenity. Good promotion is essential, and Sweet Magnolias still has a devoted fan base who wants to tune in. (Netflix/Screenshot) The streamer finally released the Sweet Magnolias Season 4 trailer as it follows lifelong best friends Maddie Joanna Garcia Swisher) Helen (Heather Headley) and Dana Sue (Brooke Elliot) as they navigate the next of their lives. The women’s friendship was always the strongest part of the series, so we’re relieved to see it’s stronger than ever as they weather all kinds of storms. Intense meteorological and political storms affect Serenity and bring the Magnolias and the community closer together. We see the Magnolias celebrating the holidays together, from Halloween to Christmas, and joining hands as they repair the town. Did anyone else notice Cal’s dancing moves? (Netflix/Screenshot) We’re excited about these because Serenity always feels like home. However, we’re a bit worried because the synopsis mentioned unexpected heartbreak and loss, and we saw church scenes and toasts. Who died? Losing a main character affects the canvas and allows them to grow, but we’d hate to lose anyone. Sweet Magnolias Season 4 Must Add More Romance We got our wish since the promo highlighted scenes from almost every couple. (Netflix/Screenshot) It sounded like the Magnolias wanted to plan a Cal and Maddie wedding, so this could be a significant season for them. Additionally, TVLine teased that Jodi Benson will guest star on Sweet Magnolias as Iris Maddox, Cal’s mom. We don’t know what’s coming for the other couples, but the synopsis hinted that the Magnolias and their men all deal with life choices. The teenagers grapple with decisions as they evolve into adulthood, so Ty and Annie’s fans may also enjoy this season. (Netflix/Screenshot) Sweet Magnolias Season 4 sounds more balanced because it will focus on most of the couples instead of just one or two, and we’re excited about that. In addition to Swisher, Headley, and Elliot, Sweet Magnolias Season 4 stars Justin Bruening as Cal Maddox, Brandon Quinn as Ronnie Sullivan, Dion Johnstone as Erik Whitley, Carson Rowland as Ty Townsend, Logan Allen as Kyle Townsend, and Anneliese Judge as Annie Sullivan. Jamie Lynn Spears, Chris Medlin, and Caroline Lagerfelt also star. Over to you, Sweet Magnolia Fanatics What was your favorite part of the trailer? What are you most looking forward to seeing?
