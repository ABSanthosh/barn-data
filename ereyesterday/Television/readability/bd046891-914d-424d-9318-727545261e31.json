  "text": "Lester Holt has officially left the anchor’s chair. The veteran newsman delivered his final broadcast as the anchor of NBC Nightly News on Friday, and as usual, the bulk of the half-hour was devoted to delivering the day’s news. Holt did take time at the end, however, to commemorate his time behind the desk: “As an anchor, it’s been an honor to lead this program, and an honor to be welcomed into your homes. I’m so grateful for your trust.” Holt added that “around here, facts matter, words matters, journalism matters… and you matter.” He brought out the entire Nightly News staff to join him on stage, and he urged viewers: “Please continue to take care of yourself and each other, and I’ll do the same.” That led into a montage of Holt’s most memorable moments as anchor, including touring the sites of natural disasters and interviewing newsmakers. When the montage ended, Holt was clearly emotional as he said: “It has been quite a ride. Thanks, everybody.” Holt announced in February that he was stepping down as NBC Nightly News anchor, a role he’s held since 2015. Moving forward, he will focus on NBC News‘ Dateline, which he has anchored since 2011. “After 10 years, 17 if you include my years on the weekends, the time has come for me to step away from my role as anchor of Nightly News,” Holt said in a statement to NBC staffers. “It has truly been the honor of a lifetime to work with each of you every day, keeping journalism as our true north and our viewers at the center of everything we do.” Holt will be replaced by Tom Llamas, whose ascension to the Nightly News anchor chair was first reported in March. Llamas has served as a senior national correspondent for NBC News and reported for NBC Nightly News alongside Holt. He also anchored Top Story with Tom Llamas, a daily primetime newscast for NBC News NOW, and contributed to various NBC News outlets, including Today. His first broadcast as NBC Nightly News anchor airs this Monday, June 2. Will you miss Holt? Let us know what you think of NBC’s big anchor swap in a comment below.",
