  "text": "The Voice Needs to Re-Sign Snoop Dogg ASAP: Is There a Gangster Holy Ghost of a Chance He’ll Come Back? The Rapper Says…How high are we on Snoop Dogg? Let us count the ways. Over the course of Season 26 of The Voice, we have discovered that the rookie coach is as smart as he is funny, sweeter than we could have imagined the owner of Death Row Records being and as sensitive as any emo artist.  Yes, some of us are so out of touch that previously we mostly knew him from his 19 Crimes wine and Rap Snacks. We may have disagreed strongly with Uncle Snoop’s decision to keep country singer Christina Eagle over R\u0026B star-in-the-making Aliyah Khaylyn in the Playoffs, but he endeared himself to us so much that we’re willing to let it go — and pray that he’ll come back. Do we stand a gangster holy ghost of a chance that he’ll reclaim a red swivel chair? Bringing back Snoop? It’s a no-brainer! Courtesy of NBC We already know that the erstwhile Calvin Broadus Jr. will be MIA in Season 27. (Its coaching panel is made up of returnees Adam Levine, John Legend and Michael Bublé, and first-timer Kelsea Ballerini.) But maybe after that?  During Tuesday’s finale (recapped here), the hip-hop legend, who won an Emmy for his Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show performance, told host Carson Daly, “Man, this has been a great experience for me. I didn’t know what I was signing on to, but I do know… it feels like I could come back and do it again.” 2024 in Review: The 20 Sexiest Scenes We’ll raise a gin and juice to that! Is there anyone out there who wouldn’t be thrilled to have Uncle Snoop back on The Voice?",
