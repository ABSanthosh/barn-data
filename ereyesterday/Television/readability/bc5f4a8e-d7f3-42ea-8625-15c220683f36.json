I recently had the thrill of chatting with Kelly Reilly and Cole Hauser, and let me tell you, the excitement in the air was almost palpable. They’re just as magnetic off-screen as they are on it, and getting to talk to them about the final chapter in the Dutton saga was a true gift. (Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images) The secrecy surrounding this season is intense — no spoilers allowed! But when I asked Kelly about what “coming full circle” means for the Dutton family, her answer hinted at something big. “it’s going to be a very cathartic, satisfying ending for the fans. It certainly was for us playing these characters for all these years. “It’s very raw, it’s very intense, it’s very emotional, it’s very dramatic, and we see these characters go through something massive” she said, her voice reflecting the weight of this season’s journey. (Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images for Paramount) Cole jumped in to talk about the unique challenges this season presented on set, especially with everyone in the dark about upcoming scenes. “Honestly, it was tougher on the crew,” he shared. “The reality is that after seven years, this crew is beyond professional. And so as we rolled through the year, they got used to it like anything, but it was not easy to start with for anybody. It’s just a different style of doing things. “But I think everybody adapted and … I’m proud of everybody,” he said of the crew tackling this new approach like the pros they are, keeping the show’s heart and soul intact. As for Beth and Rip? Their relationship is the standard for intense passion and unwavering loyalty, and fans are eager to know how this bond will evolve. Kelly gave a glimpse into Beth’s vulnerabilities this season, saying, “This is probably the most vulnerable we’ve seen Beth… I’ve never seen her rocked before, ever.” And Cole backed her up, adding that Rip “is there more for her than ever this year.” The depth of their connection is about to hit new levels, and I think we’re all in for some unforgettable moments. (Courtesy of Paramount) As for the future? I had to ask — are there more fireworks in store? If this chapter is ending, will there be more ahead for this dynamic duo, breathing more life into TV’s greatest love story? “If people want to see a sort of middle-aged Beth and Rip,” Kelly mused with a laugh, “I’m looking forward to seeing Beth as a matriarch, sat on the porch…” But Cole cut in with a grin, “That’s not entertaining, honey.” On a more serious note, Kelly stressed the importance of honoring the story as it currently stands. “Nothing has been confirmed yet,” she shared earnestly. “We’ve just finished this season. Seriously. We just finished filming a month ago. We just need to catch our breath. We need to honor the ending of what this is.” For Kelly and Cole, it’s clear that stepping away wouldn’t be easy, but they’re committed to respecting the story’s natural conclusion rather than forcing it forward. Still, they remain open to exploring more of Beth and Rip’s journey — if, and only if, the story is driven by genuine inspiration. (Paramount Network) “If there is more story to be told… it has to come from a spark of inspiration and truth, the same way Yellowstone came to be,” Kelly explained, emphasizing that it should “resonate and make sense… We want it to be really good if we do more.” It’s clear that while they’re ready to let Beth and Rip’s current chapter close, they’d be equally thrilled to see where Taylor Sheridan’s vision could take them next — if he finds that spark to dive back into the Yellowstone universe. To Kelly and Cole, we’d watch you pull off watching paint dry because you two are just that electric on screen. This season, fans are in for a heart-pounding, gut-wrenching finale. So grab your popcorn and get ready, because Beth and Rip are about to leave us breathless once again. Yellowstone Season 5 Part 2 premieres Sunday, November 10 at 8/7 on Paramount Network and encores two hours later on CBS. Watch Yellowstone Online",
