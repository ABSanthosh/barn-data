Although the barometer for success has changed considerably in recent years, surprise cancellations still occur when we least expect them. As a result, there are a handful of broadcast dramas we’re more worried about than usual. (Mark Schafer/CBS ) Let’s dive in. The Equalizer (Courtesy of CBS) The action-tinged Queen Latifah drama returned in the fall, down quite a bit from the previous year. CBS recently buried it in the 10 p.m. time slot to give freshman dud Watson the better hour. Since the move, the numbers have dwindled further, leading to speculation that we could be approaching the series finale of The Equalizer. Plus, news has spread that producers are crafting a season finale that could work as a series finale. Additionally, a spinoff is in the works that will air as a backdoor pilot later this season. (Courtesy of CBS) It certainly sounds like CBS executives are considering saving some money by focusing on a spinoff. Given that The Equalizer failed to secure an early renewal alongside many of the network’s other offerings, we won’t be surprised if the next news piece about the show concerns its cancellation. Grey’s Anatomy has been one of TV’s most resilient dramas for over two decades, but it is finally showing its age during Season 21. (Disney/Anne Marie Fox) As a result, the prognosis is not good. The series has dipped almost 50% in the demo this season vs. last year, but that erosion can be attributed to the move to 10 p.m. Grey’s Anatomy has aired in earlier time slots for most of its run, and it’s just not the kind of show to air so late. But perhaps ABC and Disney are well aware that the show’s passionate fanbase will stream to remain in the loop for everyone at Grey Sloan Memorial. However, the diminished live + same-day ratings make it the network’s least-watched and lowest-rated scripted series. (Disney/Tina Thorpe) Add in the fact that ABC is having a great season with breakout High Potential and soaring viewership for Will Trent, how long will Grey’s Anatomy be allowed to skate by with reduced ratings? FBI: Most Wanted FBI: Most Wanted, the first spinoff of FBI, has been plagued with casting and storytelling woes since early in its run. Despite numbers for Season 6 keeping it in contention for a Season 7 renewal, CBS is already prepping a fourth entry in the franchise. (Mark Schafer/CBS) With FBI already renewed, the fellow spinoff FBI: International is expected to snag a renewal because it’s far cheaper to produce because it is filmed internationally. With declining on-air ratings, TV shows need to be produced at a cheaper cost to remain on the air. FBI: Most Wanted hasn’t had the best time over the last few years, and we’re convinced it could be the NCIS: Hawai’i-level shock cancellation of the season. Found (NBC/Screenshot) The Shanola Hampton-fronted drama has dipped in ratings this season, even with a far more compatible lead-in from Law \u0026 Order: SVU. The series is like Criminal Minds meets Without a Trace and deserves to continue for years. Found Season 1 was a rip-roaring success on Peacock, so the only saving grace this season could be if it’s keeping that up. NBC already shipped Law \u0026 Order: Organized Crime to Peacock, so maybe Found could also be shipped there. (Matt Miller/NBC) It’s very watchable and has excellent acting, so we’re intrigued to see where the show goes next. Brilliant Minds The Zachary Quinto medical drama broke through with a compelling plot, but the numbers were probably not as strong as NBC had anticipated. It lost over half of its lead-in from The Voice in the demo and ultimately averaged a hair over a 0.2 rating in the demo. (Rafy/NBC) In today’s TV climate, those numbers are expected for a 10 p.m. drama but not one with a decent lead-in, meaning that cancellation could be on the horizon. That said, Brilliant Minds could miraculously get a renewal if Grosse Pointe Garden Society, The Hunting Party, and Suits LA don’t get renewals. The trio of midseason dramas haven’t set the ratings on fire, but the coming weeks will be crucial for assessing what’s about to happen. S.W.A.T. S.W.A.T. is one of broadcast TV’s fiercest dramas. By that, we mean it has been canceled and uncanceled twice. (Bonnie Osborne/CBS) One rescinded cancellation is an anomaly, so we’re unsure what to say about it happening twice. CBS has been moving it around a bit this season, and the numbers are dropping, leading to fresh concerns that it won’t make the cut for the 2025-26 season. Renewals typically come down the wire for S.W.A.T., but we’re starting to get the impression that it may not be picked up because CBS has already renewed plenty of shows. The network has also picked up spinoffs of Blue Bloods and Fire Country. Will there even be enough room for any of the bubble shows? (Bill Inoshita/Sony Pictures Television/CBS) Over to you, TV Fanatics! Which of these bubble dramas do you think should come back next season? Are there any you believe should be make it to cancellation? Hit the comments.",
