  "text": "NBC’s The Hunting Party has the potential to become the next popular procedural since it examines the psyches of serial killers and includes the overall mystery of why they escaped the secret prison called the Pit. It’s fascinated viewers weekly with different serial killer arcs, how the team will catch them, and what secrets each member harbors. TV Fanatic chatted with Patrick Sabongui about what attracted him to the series, why Jacob Hassani despises Oliver Odell, working together toward a common goal, and the fantastic dynamics between Hassani, Bex, and Shane. (David Astorga/NBC) He also teased what’s to come, beginning with reuniting with David Ramsey for The Hunting Party Season 1 Episode 6. He shared some spoilers about what’s coming and how long the series could last. Check out the interview below. Hi Patrick. What intrigued you about The Hunting Party? I thought it was an original concept. I loved that it pulled in things currently prevalent in culture, like serial killers. There are so many podcasts, documentaries, and shows about trying to understand the psychology and minds of people who would do these things. I love that it was a show that explored some of those ideas but was wrapped up in this fun, high-concept, action-driven package. It’s also an entertaining way to engage in some fascinating intellectual ideas. It has, indeed. And how do you think it differs from other crime procedurals? (David Astorga/NBC) What’s unique about The Hunting Party is that there’s more of a serial arc in figuring out precisely what the Pit is. What happened with that explosion? Who are the players behind the scenes that are manipulating the situation? I think that element of the overarching mystery surrounding The Hunting Party is unique. Absolutely. Speaking of that, it seems that Jacob Hassani thought Oliver Odell was behind the Pit explosion. Why was that belief so strong? He’s a shady dude, man. Even as new information comes forward and we learn more, I still think Hassani operates in a world where being mistrustful has served him well. In the counterterrorism world and this shady government operative world, keeping your secrets close to your chest and not trusting anybody is a defense mechanism. (David Astorga/NBC) I think not trusting Odell or trusting even the evidence that comes out in support of him is clever spy craft. It’s a quality in Hasani that mistrusting people can actually protect him. It’s been hinted by the EPs that Hassani, Bex, and Odell will work together in the back half of the season to solve this mystery. When will we see this? How will these two men work together, considering they can’t stand each other? I think anybody with a day job who has to work on a team daily can identify with coming to work to get the job done, whether you get along with your colleagues or not. We all have our own ways of navigating that. It could be in an office or out in the field. Just because you’re working together as a team doesn’t mean you have complete trust or necessarily like each other, but you will do what it takes to accomplish the mission. Right. So, how soon will everybody start working together on this mission? Can you tease any of that? In the next couple of episodes, we will team up to follow some clues to get some answers. (David Astorga/NBC) If it wasn’t for Bex’s convincing nature and our trust, I don’t know if Odell and Hasani would come together, but I think Bex will facilitate that in the next couple of episodes. Can’t wait to see that. The team dynamics have been one of my favorite parts of the series. Great. Mine, too. So, what will we see with Hassani and Bex’s relationship? Will we get to see it develop more? Will we see the two with Shane in on this mystery anytime soon? Oh, that’s interesting. One thing I love about the story as it develops in The Hunting Party Season 1 is Hassani and Bex’s relationship. It’s a family bond. Hassani feels like an instinctive protector and takes responsibility for leading the team. So, that kind of leadership protector role strengthens their bond. (David Astorga/NBC) I think that, at least interpersonally, Shane becomes part of that. Hassani sees him as the goofy little brother he has to look out for and tease occasionally. However, more will be revealed about the Pit, how it works, and who was behind it. We try to keep Shane out of it as much as possible because I think he’s already overstepped professionally where a prison guard and his security clearances should be allowed to go. Hassan will remain protective about keeping him in the dark about certain things. But we’re also going to learn, as the story has hinted at, that Shane has his own secrets and connections to the Pit that we aren’t privy to. The clash of everybody’s secrets is something to look out for. I can’t wait for that. Can you tease anything about how the season will wrap up, and is there a potential for a second season? The mystery continues to ramp up as we uncover how deep the conspiracy goes behind the Pit and the explosion. There’s an escalation there. The serial killers continue to be twisted and scary. The psychological machinations of some serial killers are exciting to anticipate. (David Astorga/NBC) There’s so much left unexplored for a second season. We don’t know how many of these serial killers escaped or where. All of the first season happens in the space of a few weeks. There’s only so far and so entrenched that these serial killers could have gotten. But the longer the gap between where we are and when the explosion was, these serial killers will become more prolific. They’re going to become more challenging to find and more well-hidden. It will get more challenging for us to uncover, find, and put them away. You’ll need at least another season or two to round them all up. That is encouraging to hear. So just for fun, what has been your favorite serial killer arc so far? We can also include Monday’s episode. (James Dittiger/NBC) I loved working with David Ramsey again. He’s such an incredible talent and a great performer. He’s also a director and so accomplished in his career. Being able to work with him again was a real treat. His killer is one of my favorites because, without giving too much away, it includes a cult-like storyline, and he can center himself at the center of a group. He is a meditative character, but he’s also very physical. So, there’s additional opportunity for physical altercations, and there might be a bit of an action sequence that we get to participate in. That’s exciting to look out for. The mindset and psychological dimension he brings to the serial killer are fascinating to watch. So, this Arlo Brandt episode, which airs on Monday, March 10th, is one of my favorites. ( Lindsay Siu/NBC) I will be sure to put that in. It was fun to have an Arrowverse reunion. I think so, too. The director of that episode, James Bamford, was also an Arrow EP and director and started as a stunt coordinator. It was a reunion for us, too. It was great to work with David Ramsey and James Bamford again. Thank you again for your time. I do hope you guys get another season. The Hunting Party airs at 10/9c on Mondays and on Peacock the following day. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Being able to work with him again was a real treat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHis killer is one of my favorites because, without giving too much away, it includes a cult-like storyline, and he can center himself at the center of a group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe is a meditative character, but he’s also very physical. So, there’s additional opportunity for physical altercations, and there might be a bit of an action sequence that we get to participate in. That’s exciting to look out for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe mindset and psychological dimension he brings to the serial killer are fascinating to watch. So, this Arlo Brandt episode, which airs on Monday, March 10th, is one of my favorites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2025/03/Patrick-Sabongui-as-Jacob-Hassani.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2025/03/Patrick-Sabongui-as-Jacob-Hassani-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2025/03/Patrick-Sabongui-as-Jacob-Hassani-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2025/03/Patrick-Sabongui-as-Jacob-Hassani-641x960.jpg 641w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2025/03/Patrick-Sabongui-as-Jacob-Hassani-721x1080.jpg 721w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2025/03/Patrick-Sabongui-as-Jacob-Hassani.jpg 740w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2025/03/Patrick-Sabongui-as-Jacob-Hassani.jpg\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003e ( Lindsay Siu/NBC)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI will be sure to put that in. It was fun to have an Arrowverse reunion.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think so, too. The director of that episode, James Bamford, was also an \u003ca href=\"https://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/arrow/\"\u003eArrow\u003c/a\u003e EP and director and started as a stunt coordinator. It was a reunion for us, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e It was great to work with David Ramsey and James Bamford again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you again for your time.
