  "text": "Guess they didn’t want to wait for their lives to be over. Dawson’s Creek alums Katie Holmes and Joshua Jackson are reuniting to star in Happy Hours, an upcoming film trilogy, it was announced on Monday. Holmes will also write and direct the trilogy, with her and Jackson playing “two people navigating their relationship within the challenges of careers and family responsibilities and the pursuit of love despite life’s inevitable obstacles,” per the official description. Happy Hours, which has begun filming in New York City, “is a character-driven dramedy that explores the emotional journey of young loves who reconnect as adults, with the connective thread of shared joys, loss, and hope.” Holmes and Jackson are joined in the cast by Mary-Louise Parker (Weeds), Constance Wu (Fresh Off the Boat) and Joe Tippett (The Morning Show), among others. Holmes and Jackson, of course, starred together on the seminal WB teen drama Dawson’s Creek, alongside James Van Der Beek and Michelle Williams. Holmes and Jackson played teens Joey and Pacey, who started a romance in Season 3 and rekindled things in the series finale. Since Dawson’s Creek signed off in 2003, both Holmes and Jackson have been busy on the small screen. Holmes played Jackie Kennedy in the 2011 miniseries The Kennedys and recurred on Ray Donovan; she guest-starred in a Season 2 episode of Peacock’s Poker Face earlier this year. Jackson starred in the Fox sci-fi series Fringe and Showtime’s The Affair; his ABC medical drama Doctor Odyssey was recently axed after one season. Are you excited to see Joey and Pacey… um, Holmes and Jackson on screen together again? Let us know in the comments.",
