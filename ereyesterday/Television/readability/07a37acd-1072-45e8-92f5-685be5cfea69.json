  "text": "By the time High Potential wrapped its first season on ABC, Kaitlin Olson‘s character was basically drowning in eligible bachelors. Many fans are pulling for Morgan to end up with Karadec (Daniel Sunjata), her new partner at the LAPD, while others are curious to see where things go between Morgan and Tom (JD Pardo), the janitor-turned-nurse with whom she was getting hot and heavy before he relocated to San Diego for work. Heck, people are even ‘shipping Morgan with David Giuntoli’s mystery character, who has only gotten about 30 seconds of screen time — and we don’t even know his name yet! I’ll be happy for Morgan no matter which lucky guy she ends up with, but I also think there’s one very important name being left out of this conversation: Ludo, Morgan’s DMV instructor ex and the father of her two younger children. Played by Taran Killam, Ludo seems perfectly nice, easy to get along with and a huge help around the house. So what the heck happened between him and Morgan that ended their relationship, especially just after she’d given birth to baby Chloe? And does he have any interest in rekindling their flame, or is he perfectly happy being a platonic co-parent? Those questions and more will be answered when High Potential returns for Season 2, showrunner Todd Harthan tells TVLine, explaining that there simply wasn’t enough time in the procedural’s 13-episode first season to properly delve into Morgan and Ludo’s backstory. “I think the audience has a real appetite to find out what really happened,” Harthan says. “What was it like the day they sat down and had a conversation about what wasn’t working? How did they decide how they should co-parent? What caused that? So now it’s our job to come up with a story.” 15 TV Pairs That Need to Couple Up As Harthan points out, there are a number of possible avenues to go down here. Perhaps Morgan will get a case “that hits a certain nerve and reminds her of that period in their lives.” Or maybe “a new love coming into one of their lives where they have to sort of explore that chapter.” Either way, Harthan says, “We absolutely will tell that story. What happened between them? I think we’re going to answer that question this year.” Are you you curious about Morgan’s history with Ludo? And where would you like to see the friendly exes go from here? Drop a comment with your thoughts on High Potential Season 2 below.",
