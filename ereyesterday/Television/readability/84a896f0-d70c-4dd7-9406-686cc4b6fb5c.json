  "text": "Netflix’s YOU repeated atop Nielsen’s U.S. ranking of streaming originals for the week of April 28, amassing nearly 1.8 billion minutes viewed across 50 total episodes. In its first week of eligibility, Netflix’s The Four Seasons made its chart debut in the No. 2 spot with 1.3 billion minutes viewed/eight episodes, followed by Disney+’s Andor (with a new weekly high of 821 million minutes viewed across 18 available episodes), Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale (612 million minutes/62 available episodes), and Netflix’s Ransom Canyon (504 million minutes viewed/10 episodes). Rounding out the Top 10 originals for the week of April 28 were Netflix’s Black Mirror (482 million minutes viewed), Netflix’s Battle Camp (473 million minutes), Netflix’s The Eternaut (473 million minutes), Hulu’s Good American Family (376 million minutes) and Paramount+’s MobLand (352 million minutes). Of note, Disney+’s Daredevil: Born Again — now in the second week following the release of its ninth episode/Season 1 finale — still has yet to land on the Nielsen Top 10.
