  "text": "Warning: This post contains spoilers for Friday’s Severance Season 2 finale. Gemma saw her dreams of escaping Lumon come true in Severance’s season finale — and then it turned into a nightmare. Friday’s finale ended with Innie Mark helping free Gemma from her time-loop hell on the testing floor and guiding her to an exit door — but instead of joining her, he turned back to stay behind with Helly. His decision made a certain amount of sense to Gemma, though, Dichen Lachman (who plays Gemma) tells TVLine in the video above: “My feeling was she was piecing together that he had gone through this procedure, because Mark would never do that.” But she’s still “hoping and praying that she can get through to either his Innie or his Outie to come out with her. It’s heartbreaking.” (She does concede that it was a “thrilling” moment for all those viewers rooting for a Mark and Helly romance, “but one would hope that they’re a little bit torn!”) Gemma was torn, too, when Mark found her in the Cold Harbor room and convinced her to come with him, even though she was totally severed and didn’t know who he was. Why did she trust him, then? “I think all of the Innies have parts of their Outies,” Lachman theorizes. “There’s things that they feel that they don’t quite know how to explain… On some level, all of Gemma’s little Innies would probably have this instinct to trust Mark, even though they have no recollection of who he is or their relationship.” So where does Gemma go from here in the just-announced Season 3, now that she’s away from Lumon’s evil clutches but still without Mark? “I mean, there are so many possibilities,” Lachman teases, reminding us that Gemma has dozens of Innies that are now left stranded inside Lumon as well. “I am reluctant, usually, to ask too many questions” of series creator Dan Erickson, she says, but she did ask him about Gemma’s Innies, “and I think Dan just kind of raised his eyebrows at me.” Hmmm… she may be onto something there. Press PLAY above for more inside scoop on the Season 2 finale, and hit the comments to share your thoughts and theories.",
