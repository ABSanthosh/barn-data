  "text": "Morgan Gillory’s latest relationship could already be over before it even got off the ground. Janitor-turned-nurse Tom charmed his way into Morgan’s heart in the first season of High Potential, but with actor JD Pardo‘s recent casting as a series regular on Netflix’s Trinity, the potential for a relationship between Morgan and Tom has become, well, considerably less high. It was already difficult enough for the new couple to maintain a long-distance relationship after Tom relocated to San Diego for work, as we saw in the Season 1 finale when he nearly missed the police gala. Living in different cities is one thing, existing on entirely different shows is another. Could they make it work? Sure, it’s technically possible that we haven’t seen the last of Tom, even if it’s just a quick guest spot. High Potential is already in production on Season 2, whereas cameras likely haven’t started rolling on Trinity. But do we see them staying together long-term? Not so much. Prior to Pardo landing his new Netflix gig, High Potential showrunner Todd Harthan was hopeful that we would see Tom again in Season 2. “I love the guy, and I love the character,” he told TVLine back in February. “There’s a lot of affection, and nobody did anything bad to each other. There’s a lovely thing there, so who knows?” This will probably come as a relief to those viewers who are impatiently waiting for Morgan and Karadec (Daniel Sunjata) to succumb to one of television’s most time-honored tropes — the will they/won’t they dynamic between flirty co-workers. Of course, Tom and Karadec aren’t the only important men in Morgan’s life. Let’s not forget about Ludo (Taran Killam), whose past with his ex remains a bit of a question mark… for now. “I think the audience has a real appetite to find out what really happened,” Harthan tells us. “What was it like the day they sat down and had a conversation about what wasn’t working? How did they decide how they should co-parent? What caused that? So now it’s our job to come up with a story.” High Potential fans, how do you feel about the current state of Morgan’s love life? Are you hoping for more Tom in Season 2, or are you ready for her to test the waters with Karadec? Drop a comment with your thoughts below. Everything We Know About High Potential Season 2 So Far",
