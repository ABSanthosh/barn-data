  "text": "There’s something about being an ’80s kid that feels different. And no, it’s not just nostalgia talking. I’m a product of the latch-key generation, those of us who came home from school to empty houses and managed homework, chores, and the dinner prep our parents left us to handle. I am a proud GenXer, born into a world that didn’t cushion or coddle us. (NBC/Screenshot) We faced all kinds of challenges, from navigating schoolyard bullying and dodgeball bruises to growing up fast in households where single parents often worked double shifts to make ends meet. I learned resilience the hard way — through personal trials and grit. My mom worked nights and went to school during the day, determined to better herself and build a better life for us, even if it meant time was always tight. I saw a lot as a kid: family abuse, hard life lessons, and, yes, even racism up close. My grandparents were Mexican, dark-skinned, and proud (my grandpa was a WWII hero and Purple Heart recipient), while I was a blonde-haired, green-eyed little girl who felt like an outsider in both worlds. But all these moments, from the painful to the empowering, shaped me. I survived, grew tougher, and learned that life doesn’t wait for you to feel “ready.” (ABC/Screenshot) These experiences made me who I am — able to handle some of life’s hardest knocks, like watching my husband pass away suddenly and raising a five-year-old son alone. Why? Because when you’re built with grit, you handle it and move on. That’s what our generation did. The TV That Raised Us Growing up, TV was more than just background noise; it was part of our DNA. We didn’t have endless streaming options or carefully curated content designed to make us feel “seen.” Instead, we had heroes like Hannibal from The A-Team, Michael Knight from Knight Rider, and MacGyver — characters who taught us to roll with the punches, make do with what we had, and figure things out on the fly. These guys weren’t waiting around for a rescue; they were taking action, teaching us to do the same. (ABC/Screenshot) Watching MacGyver (the original) whip up lifesaving gadgets out of duct tape and a paperclip taught us that resourcefulness was sometimes all you needed. Life’s problems weren’t solved with the latest tech or endless options—they were solved by being creative and quick on your feet. Today, it’s easy to Google your way out of a problem or call in help with a single tap, but back then, it was all about figuring it out yourself. Watching MacGyver, we learned that you could make things happen if you just had the will and the right tools (even if it was only a Swiss Army knife). Then there were icons like Cagney and Lacey, two strong women who determinedly and resiliently took on the gritty world of police work. They were tough as nails, handling everything from dangerous cases to personal challenges in an era when women were still fighting for their place in the workforce. (CBS/Screenshot) Watching them showed us that anything was possible if you had the guts to push forward. Cagney and Lacey taught us that toughness isn’t just a guy thing — it’s a mindset, one we can all embrace. Characters like Hannibal from The A-Team took a different approach, bringing tough love and grit into every mission. They didn’t wait for things to be perfect, didn’t ask for permission, and certainly didn’t expect a safety net. They took on the odds with grit, a cigar, and a wink. This was a generation that didn’t whine, didn’t make excuses, and certainly didn’t demand perfection. They taught us to get out there, get a little dirty, and make things work — even if it means bending a few rules. (NBC/Screenshot) Then there was Family Ties, which hit us with a blend of humor and real-life issues in a way that felt fresh and relatable. Alex P. Keaton’s unapologetic ambition and drive perfectly captured the spirit of 80s individualism and the rising “yuppie” culture. The Keatons’ mix of free-thinking parents and a hard-driven kid showed us the balance between independence and family support. They weren’t a perfect family by any means, but they loved each other through every challenge, teaching us that family dynamics could be complicated and still work. Taking Accountability and Moving Forward The way we saw it on TV, our heroes didn’t need to lean on support groups or pour their souls out to therapists (not knocking it, but it wasn’t part of the culture then). Instead, they carried their baggage with them, handling issues as they came up and moving on without looking back. (NBC/Screenshot) Michael Knight didn’t have a team of therapists dissecting his every move — he had KITT, and together, they tackled whatever came their way, no hand-holding required. It wasn’t about pushing down emotions but learning to face them, handle them, and keep going. Watching these characters, we learned that life wasn’t going to slow down for us, and sometimes, you had to pick yourself up, dust off, and keep moving forward. Fast-forward to today, and it’s no surprise that these lessons resonate even more. Rewatching these shows, I find the simplicity of their approach refreshing. There’s no overanalyzing, no lengthy debates about motives — just action. (NBC/Screenshot) These characters took on life without apologies, teaching us to trust our instincts and to solve problems rather than dwell on them. In a world where self-doubt and indecision seem to run high, these straightforward, decisive characters feel like a breath of fresh air. Built to Last: Why ’80s TV Heroes Are Still Role Models TV has changed, and so have the heroes it brings to our screens. Today, we’re more likely to see characters wrestling with complex emotional layers, grappling with trauma, and even attending therapy, which is undeniably important. But ’80s characters? They were here to get things done, not dwell on the “why.” (NBC/Screenshot) Watching The A-Team or Knight Rider, you got the message that life was about finding a way forward, not sitting around waiting for the perfect conditions. These characters didn’t ask permission, and they didn’t waste time worrying about the gray areas. They made their decisions, faced the consequences, and kept moving. In the end, these characters taught us something valuable — when you’ve been through a lot, you don’t wait for permission to live your life. You take action, make tough choices, and don’t overthink the “what-ifs.” There’s something empowering about that kind of clarity, and maybe that’s why these characters hold such a strong place in our hearts. (ABC/Screenshot) They remind us of a time when things felt a little more straightforward, a little tougher, and a lot more resilient. So here’s to the shows that raised us on grit, problem-solving, and a good dose of self-reliance. They might not be the flashy anti-heroes of today, but they’re role models in their own right — built to last, just like the generation that grew up watching them.
