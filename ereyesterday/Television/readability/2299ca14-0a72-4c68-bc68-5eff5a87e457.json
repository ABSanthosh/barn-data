  "text": "Critic's Rating: 4.7 / 5.04.7 Will Trent has always excelled at balancing action-packed cases and emotional arcs, but the season finale upped the stakes even more. Will Trent Season 3 Episode 18 felt like a movie as the installment featured a terrorist organization targeting the GBI and putting multiple characters in danger. These threats changed Will’s perspective on family since so many of his “found family” were in danger, while he had to lean on his new birth father to help him solve the case.  (Zac Popik/Disney) This case also showcased many heroes who risked their lives to save their own..  The Founder’s Front Terrorist Organization Showed How Dangerous They Were By Dividing and Conquering We’ve seen other crime procedurals cover terrorism, but the Founder’s Front demonstrated how strong and dangerous they were by having the GBI and APD divide and conquer. This case affected almost everyone Will loved, and devastated him that he couldn’t be in multiple places. He wanted to be at the hospital to comfort Nico and stay at the command center to protect Amanda. There were too many members of this group, and they infiltrated every part of law enforcement as they tried to stop the bio toxin from spreading. They couldn’t keep up, especially when they wanted to negotiate Vince’s life for Amanda’s. (ABC/ Screenshot) It seemed difficult to believe that an older man would run this organization, but he instilled loyalty and strived to destroy the city of Atlanta. Both Will and Amanda felt Caleb brought these terrorists to their city, yet Caleb struggled with believing his old friend could actually be this evil. Will Felt Torn Between His Loyalty to Amanda and Solving the Case and Curiosity About Caleb In Will Trent Season 3 Episode 17, I mentioned that I was unsure why the writers revisited Will’s paternity.  It made sense to address it after Will finally felt secure in establishing his “found family,” even though almost every member was in danger. While he worried about all of them, it was an excellent parallel to see Amanda, who’s been like a mother to him, in danger as he’s forced to team up with his new birth father, Caleb. (ABC/ Screenshot) Even though they’re not demonstrative, Will and Amanda would do anything for each other, yet she ordered him to solve the case instead. That only made him resent Caleb’s involvement even more. Will assumed that Caleb had used his mother, Lucy, after his experience with James Ulster. He had difficulty believing that Caleb genuinely cared for Lucy or that Caleb was interested in getting to know Will. Since the series began, Will has mainly dealt with opinionated and fierce women. He hasn’t had much of a male role model, except for the few months he interacted with his uncle Antonio, who helped him face some hard truths. Eventually, Will seems begrudgingly ready to see where this newfound relationship with Caleb may lead, and we’re anxious to see. (Zac Popik/Disney) Angie and Will Showed That They’re Family, Not a Couple Sometimes, platonic relationships are sweeter than couples. At the beginning of Will Trent Season 3, I feared that Will and Angie would be polite strangers, if not mortal enemies. They both felt betrayed by the other’s actions, but there is nothing like a crisis to bring people closer. When Will accidentally shot Marco, Angie comforted him because they always went through crises together. It was the experience that cemented them as a family. While many probably assumed Angie would have difficulty moving on, she found a healthy relationship with Seth.  It seemed like they were a fun relationship, but when Seth feared he might lose Angie because of that bio toxin, he admitted he loved her. That affected her since he saw her, faults and all. (ABC/ Screenshot) Angie struggled with wanting a baby with Seth because of her destructive relationship with her mother, but when she thought she might lose her baby, she panicked. She and Will almost have something nostalgic and bittersweet about them now. They both dreamed about having a future and a baby together, so it had to hurt Will to see Angie’s sonogram with another man. While he broke up with her, he pined for her now, calling her his person and family. Part of me will always wonder what might have been, while another appreciates that they can be friends. However, Seth will have to get used to that bond and Will being a part of their lives if Seth (Scott Foley) returns next season. Ormewood Cheated Death Twice, Only to Have His Tumor Worsen The series tried to inject humor into Ormewood’s brain tumor arc, and his scenes with Nico in the last few episodes helped. (ABC/ Screenshot) I’m unsure if they ever interacted much, but it helped having someone with him at the VA. Hopefully, things aren’t that chaotic, but being a good Samaritan to Roy caused Nico and possibly Ormewood to contract that biohazard. Faith deliberately kept Angie away from the hospital, but being exposed could have made his health deteriorate.  Ormewood and Faith were the ideal agents to be stuck with a girls’ archery team because, as parents, they knew how to deal with feuding teens. It also helped that the girls thought Ormewood was hot. They wanted to impress him and were eager to assist by launching flaming arrows and nuking a truck, similar to Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games. Naturally, they only angered the terrorists more. Ormewood was ready to take one for the team until Will arrived, hitting the gunman with his car. I love that Will and Ormewood are friends now, and Will protected him. It only made it sadder that Ormewood’s tumor worsened, and only part of the team knows what’s wrong with him. (Zac Popik/Disney) Those Cliffhangers Highlight How Much the Team Means to One Another and Could Impact Will Trent Season 4 Those cliffhangers gutted me. While Will Trent has often ended the season with an action-packed finale, the series hasn’t left multiple characters’ lives in jeopardy before. Fans may worry all summer about whether Amanda and Ormewood will survive.  When Erika Christensen teased that Angie had emotional scenes with Amanda in the Will Trent Season 3 finale, I never dreamed she meant they were fighting one of the gunmen. It looked too good to be true that Angie rescued Amanda from that crazed maniac, and they escaped, but then he shot Amanda. While Amanda doesn’t show affection much, her entire team respects her. However, this crushed Will. (Zac Popik/Disney) Amanda has been his family since she brought him into the GBI. They may not discuss it much, but they love each other and would defend each other to the ends of the earth. He’s very similar to Amanda, so he was pivotal in admitting he wanted to be there for her, as she had helped him. I doubt the series would kill off Amanda, but perhaps this experience will change them and help them have more open communication. I also doubt Will Trent would eliminate Ormewood, since so far the series has portrayed the emotional aspect of his brain tumor realistically. He is a strong soldier type who strives to care for others, so naturally he would prefer to die a hero saving Faith and a girls’ archery team rather than from his tumor. (Zac Popik/Disney) It seemed unfair that Ormewood cheated death twice, only to collapse in his own house. Thankfully, Faith lives with him now, but how will this change things in the future? Their newfound friendship has been one of the best parts about Will Trent Season 3, and assuming Ormewood survives, Faith and his children may be a crucial part of that recovery.
