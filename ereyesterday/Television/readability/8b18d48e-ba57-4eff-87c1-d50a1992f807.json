  "text": "Spoiler alert: We’re about to break down the final moments of Netflix‘s YOU. Haven’t finished yet? Lock yourself in a cage (or your room) and get to bingeing! The title of Netflix’s YOU has referred to a number of different individuals over the course of its five-season run — namely the myriad women unlucky enough to cross Joe Goldberg’s path — but it takes on a whole new meaning in the series finale. Following his final showdown against Louise, in which she shoots him in the genitals before turning him over to the police, Joe closes out the last episode with another dramatic voiceover, this time from behind bars. With his head freshly shaven, he pores over his latest fan mail, letters from “admirers” of his work. “Why am I in a cage when these crazies write me all the depraved things they want me to do to them?” he says to himself. “Maybe we have a problem as a society. Maybe we should fix what’s broken in us. Maybe the problem isn’t me. Maybe it’s… you.” Lest you doubt that Joe is in fact referring to you, the viewer, Penn Badgley looks right at the camera when he says this final line. More specifically, co-showrunner Michael Foley tells TVLine, Joe is addressing “society” with his closing speech. “We lump ourselves in with the audience in terms of people who’ve rooted for Joe for 50 episodes, and it was about waking us all up to the fact that he’s a horrific monster,” Foley says. “We wanted him to blame us. Despite getting his quote-unquote comeuppance, and even being made to see himself as a monster, he still won’t take the blame for it. It was very much intentional that he would break the fourth wall in that final moment.” The series finale, in no uncertain terms, confirms Joe’s status as an abusive monster. But unlike Taylor Swift, whose song “Anti-Hero” famously closed out the show’s fourth season, Joe is unable to admit that he’s the problem — it’s him. Hit PLAY on the video above for Badgley’s additional thoughts on the final season (as well as the fates of Joe and… little Joe), then drop a comment with your own review of YOU‘s swan song below.",
