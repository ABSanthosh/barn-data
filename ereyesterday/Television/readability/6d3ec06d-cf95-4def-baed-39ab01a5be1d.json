  "text": "The NCIS franchise is expanding exponentially. You’d think it would run out of stories after over 20 years on the air. But despite NCIS: Hawai’i, NCIS: Los Angeles, and NCIS: New Orleans ending their runs, we have the mothership, NCIS: Origins, NCIS: Sydney, and the upcoming NCIS: Tony \u0026 Ziva. (CBS/Screenshot) Simply put, it’s more alive now than it was a few years ago, which I never envisioned, given the recent hurdles the entertainment industry has faced. Now, with the news of LL Cool J reprising the role of Special Agent Sam Hanna, it’s hard to be too excited, given that the character has had countless appearances in the broader franchise. (Sonja Flemming/CBS) He spent 14 seasons on NCIS: Los Angeles and has already made some appearances on the mothership. Then there was his 12-episode arc on NCIS: Hawai’i last season, which took valuable screen real estate from the other cast members. Sam Has Returned One Too Many Times to the NCIS Universe Granted, I loved the mystery of Sam’s presence in Hawaii, but what am I to think with NCIS: Hawai’i getting canceled without so much as a goodbye? Sam even got a satisfying goodbye on the spinoff, while everything was left up in the air for the rest of the characters. (Sonja Flemming/CBS) It’s a surprise that he’s set to appear in an upcoming episode of the original series because what else is there to do with the character? I’d be more interested in watching LL Cool J focus on new roles. His NCIS: LA co-star Chris O’Donnell just booked 9-1-1: Nashville. While there are concerns that it will be a reheat of 9-1-1: Lone Star, I can’t wait to see Chris in a new role. Maybe they’ll both share the screen again on the new entry in the 9-1-1 franchise down the line because cameos are undoubtedly possible, well away from the NCIS universe. (Sonja Flemming/CBS) NCIS has such a rich tapestry of characters that producers should dig into the vault to bring back people we haven’t heard of for years. Pauley Perrette would be a good pick because Abby Sciuto hasn’t been seen for years. Abby Sciuto Should Stage a Comeback Given her issues with Mark Harmon, it seemed damn near impossible for her to return in any capacity, but Mark is no longer on the show. Remember the surprise of Ziva (Cote de Pablo) reappearing? It never seemed possible, but the show and CBS went all in to craft a meaningful arc. (Courtesy of CBS and Paramount+) Without it, we wouldn’t have NCIS: Tony \u0026 Ziva, so I’m thankful. Given that the broadcast networks are struggling for viewers, you’d think CBS would be mandating the creatives to lure back legacy characters that viewers want to see because they haven’t been around in a long time. I don’t know what the future holds for Sam and if there’s potential for a spinoff down the line, but I can’t get on board with his return when he was back on-screen last season. Alright, I’ve said my piece, NCIS Fanatics! Now, it’s time for yours. (CBS/screenshot) What are your thoughts on LL Cool J’s comeback? Do you think the character has been overexposed in recent years, or do you think Sam still has some potential? Which legacy cast member would you like to return, even if it’s just for a short cameo?
