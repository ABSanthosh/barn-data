  "text": "Murder in a Small Town is the ideal cozy mystery series, but it could improve in several ways if it gets a second season. Even though Fox airs the series in the United States, the show feels like a Canadian procedural with a twist. It featured prominent Canadian actors and was filmed primarily in Gibsons, which has the same name as the series. The series typically uses a murder-of-a-week format instead of a lingering case throughout the season. It’s been compared to classics like Murder She Wrote and Columbo. (FOX/ YouTube Screenshot) While the series has been entertaining, Global TV and FOX must address some issues to renew it for a second season. Adapting the Source Material So Cases Breathe Better Book-to-screen adaptations, especially mystery procedurals, are often challenging when the series strives to cover an overlying theme and a case-of-the-week. They also need to balance character dynamics and interpersonal relationships. While some book-to-screen adaptations seem similar, others are only loosely inspired but keep the heart of the source source material. Even this often upsets diehard fans of the book series. I’ve grown used to the fans’ uproar with Murder in a Small Town and Will Trent, which also loosely adapts a series of mystery novels. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) Murder in a Small Town needs to learn from Will Trent and let certain storylines breathe better. There is no reason to cram an entire novel into one episode when the storyline could be expanded over a few episodes. Each mystery felt rushed since it was resolved in around 44 minutes. That didn’t leave much time for fleshing out subplots, so there is still a wealth of information to delve into, even from the books they covered. If Murder in a Small Town gets a second season, they only have three L .R. Wright novels they haven’t adapted yet — Strangers Among Us, Mother Love, and Acts of Murder. That makes it more challenging unless they flesh out each book in several episodes or consult with the Wright family to create new storylines. Involving the Wright Family in Storylines to Ensure Accuracy Series writer Ian Weir knew the Wright family for years and worked tirelessly to bring the Karl Alberg mysteries, written in the 1980s, to modern times. ( Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) Online dating apps and cell phones weren’t a thing back then, but the story remained intact. It also helped that L. R. Wright’s daughters, Katey and Joanna, were enthusiastic about the series and excited that producer Nick Orchard also knew their mother. Since it was a family affair, Katey appeared in Murder in a Small Town Season 1 Episode 3 as Ruthie, the motel clerk. Both of them knew their mother’s novels firsthand and would be able to assist in adapting material to honor her memory. They love it so far and think she would have as well. (Hulu/ Screenshot) Keep Karl and Cassandra’s Romance in the Forefront Karl and Cassandra’s romance is the best part of the series. Murder in a Small Town took a massive risk with “A Touch of Panic” and having Gordon Murphy kidnap Cassandra. She was so traumatized that it may have ruined her relationship with Karl. While the couple needed internal drama, that may have been a bit much, they could be happy again if the series time-jumps to another book, and we would miss the two reconciling. That’s just as bad. We must witness Karl and Cassandra’s little moments to stay invested in their happiness. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) Flesh Out Supporting Characters Besides Karl, most other characters need to be fleshed out more. Murder in a Small Town has done a fantastic job establishing his personality, his motives for moving to a quieter town, and introducing his daughters. It also started building Cassandra since it established her passion for working with books and the arts. However, it’s still surface-level compared to Karl’s development, which is disappointing since she’s the show’s co-lead. Cassandra does not have much of a support system, except for Phyllis. The series still hasn’t introduced her mother, which is disappointing since her mom was a huge part of why she returned to Gibsons and a more significant part of the book series. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) The rest of the supporting characters need a lot more work. The series has begun fleshing out Sid by introducing his wife and establishing a friendship with Karl. But what makes Sid tick? Why is he more excited about his job now? The newbies have been developed the least. The series has tried to make Corporal Yen and Isabella relevant, but there is only so much time in each episode to focus on them. Most of Andy Kendrick’s arcs seem misplaced, although his blossoming friendship with Corporal Yen has been entertaining. He needs more mentoring, but he’s not a bad cop. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) Positive Aspects of Murder in a Small Town We don’t want to sound negative. Murder in a Small Town has many things going for it. Not many procedurals feature a lead couple so prominently and so soon. That has allowed the fans to invest in Karl and Cassandra’s future and how they’ll weather these cases and drama together. Rossif Sutherland and Kristin Kruek have a believable connection. While she’s been a leading lady several times, this is his first time leading a series. However, he’s ruggedly handsome and romantic, paired beautifully with Cassandra’s (Kreuk) fierceness. Sutherland’s instant connection with costar Aaron Douglas (Sgt. Sid Sokolowski) also worked in their favor, as the men became fast friends on and off-screen. (DramaClubFOX Twitter/ Screenshot) Douglas discovered Sutherland loved pigs, so he hid little rubber pigs in his jacket as a prank on set. We need more of these witty moments on-screen to balance with the serious drama. While I’d love the cases to be better developed, having a new case each episode allows viewers to drop in and pick up the series whenever they can or whenever their favorite actor guest stars. Yes, Murder in a Small Town excels in bringing well-known Canadian guest stars. ( Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) These have included James Cromwell, Stana Katic, Erica Durance, and Devon Sawa.
