  "text": "Prime Video is revving up for a Formula One racing series from the team behind The Expanse. Amazon MGM Studios is developing One, a drama set within the racing world with Felicity Jones (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) attached to star, our sister site Variety reports. The actress will also executive-produce alongside The Expanse showrunners Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, who will write the project. As Formula 1’s first officially sanctioned scripted series, the show will center around “a failing family-owned racing team, led by Jones’ character, as it contends with fierce personalities, ever-changing rivals and multi-million-dollar stakes,” per Variety. Ready for some more recent newsy nuggets? Well… * Apple TV+’s Severance will open PaleyFest LA 2025 on Friday, March 21, 2025, with an advance screening of the Season 2 finale and a panel with the cast and creative team at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood. The full festival lineup will be announced on Jan. 27. * Summer House Season 9 will premiere with a supersized episode on Wednesday, Feb. 12 at 9/8c on Bravo. * Camilla Luddington (Grey’s Anatomy), Ana Navarro (The View), Melissa Peterman (Happy’s Place) and Max Greenfield (The Neighborhood) will be among the Celebrity Jeopardy! players when the new season premieres Wednesday, Jan. 8, on ABC, EW.com reports. * Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight’s A Thousand Blows, set in the perilous world of illegal boxing in 1880s Victorian London, will premiere Friday, Feb. 21, 2025 on Hulu. * Netflix is in production on an eight-episode series that follows college football’s most dominant conference, the Southeastern Conference (SEC), during the 2024 season.
