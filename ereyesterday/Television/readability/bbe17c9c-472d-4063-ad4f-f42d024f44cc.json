  "text": "This post contains spoilers from Landman‘s Season 1 finale, which began streaming Sunday. Proceed accordingly. Throughout Landman‘s first season, we’ve had a question that’s burned hotter than the flame atop an oil rig: Why cast Demi Moore in the Paramount+ series, then not give her a lot to do? As Cami, the wife of Jon Hamm’s Monty, most of Moore’s brief Season 1 scenes involved chiding the MTex Oil boss for working too hard. We learned that she and Tommy have known each other for quite some time (and seem to like each other), that she likes to swim… and that’s about it. The Season 1 finale, however, shed some new light on her character: When heart issues incapacitated Monty and Tommy was named head of the company, Cami urged him to forge ahead with the very risky but potentially very rewarding deal her husband had gotten started, so that their family could leave a true legacy behind. By the time the episode ended, Monty died, cementing Tommy’s new role as MTex president. (Read a full finale recap here.) Though Paramount+ has not yet renewed the Taylor Sheridan series for Season 2, we wondered what this new world order would mean for Cami — and newly minted Golden Globes winner Moore — if the show continues. So we took our query to the source: series co-creator/executive producer Christian Wallace. When Is Your Favorite TV Show Back? An A-to-Z List of 300+ Scripted Series “Cami is definitely a force to be reckoned with, and we haven’t exactly gotten to see her, like you mentioned, really exert that power and influence, because she’s been in a very different role in the first season,” Wallace tells TVLine. “And so, if the story were to continue, it would be very interesting to see what Cami’s role would be in this world when she’s the person closer to the top and is making these decisions in a world that is still mostly populated by men.” He adds: “There are more and more women in the oil field, including women who are now occupying C-suites in some of the biggest companies in that industry. So Cami wouldn’t be entering that world alone. But it’s definitely more male-dominated, and so that would be just a very interesting role for her to play, moving forward. And especially having Demi play that character, who is also at the peak of her powers? I think that would just be kind of incredible to watch.” What do you think: Would you like to see Cami take a bigger role in a potential Season 2?
