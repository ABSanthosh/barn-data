  "text": "NBC is diving into the murderous world of a suburban garden club with Grosse Pointe Garden Society. Based on the trailer alone, we’re already invested.  It’s hard to get a read on a show from a 60-second trailer, but the hook is compelling, and the cast is an embarrassment of riches, meaning we should be in for one of the more buzzy shows of the 2024-25 TV season.  (NBC/Screenshot) According to NBC, the new one-hour drama “follows four members of a suburban garden club who find their lives intertwined by scandal, mischief, and a shared secret — a murder no one wants to talk about.” Oh my! “As dark truths begin to rot their lives under the surface, they try to struggle to remain as perfect as the flowers blooming in the garden above.” (NBC/Screenshot) Grosse Point Garden Society is set to premiere on Sunday, February 23, at 10/9c on NBC. Episodes will be made available on Peacock, too, which we’re sure will be how many viewers find this show.  The excellent cast includes Melissa Fumero (Brooklyn Nine-Nine), AnnaSophia Robb (The Carrie Diaries), Ben Rappaport (For the People), Matthew Davis (Legacies), Alexander Hodge (Insecure), Aja Naomi King (Lessons in Chemistry), Nancy Travis (Last Man Standing), and Felix Avitia (Raven’s Home). Check out the full trailer below.  King is, of course, best known for playing Michaela Pratt opposite Viola Davis on all six seasons of How to Get Away with Murder.  When we first heard about her casting, we were concerned that it would be in a similar role, but her character is actually a complete 180 from what we first expected. She was a tour-de-force on Lessons in Chemistry, so we highly recommend it if you haven’t watched it.  Grosse Pointe Garden Society Comes From The People Who Brought Us Desperate Housewives The series comes from Jenna Bans (Desperate Housewives, Scandal, Good Girls) and Bill Krebs (Good Girls).  (NBC/Screenshot) All three of those shows had wonderfully soapy hooks and deeply woven mysteries, so we’re intrigued to see the finished product of their collaboration with Grosse Pointe Garden Society.  All signs point to it being a hit, and boy, this TV season sure needs a breakout hit.  Matlock and High Potential both brought decent viewership to their respective networks in the fall, but the broadcast networks typically save the main attractions until midseason.  NBC Is Bringing Out Big Shows In 2025 NBC also has the Melissa Roxburgh-fronted The Hunting Party on deck for later in the year. The series focuses on an underground facility called The Pitt, which houses some of the most notorious criminals.  The inciting incident is when The Pit is blown up, and — gasp — the criminals make a run for it, forcing a group of agents to try to apprehend them before reoffending. There are hints of The Blacklist in it, and we’re not upset about it.  (David Astorga/NBC) Like many other networks, NBC has had a rough season thanks to continued erosion in on-air TV ratings, which have left the likes of Found and The Irrational on the bubble. Could Grosse Point Garden Society and The Hunting Party steal their spots on the schedule next season? It will all come down to the numbers.  What are your thoughts on Grosse Point Garden Society? Are you all in after the trailer like us? Let us know in the comments below!",
