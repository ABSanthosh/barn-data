  "text": "TVLine Items: Hawaii Five-0 Vet Joins Silicon Valley Series, Love Is Blind Reunion Date and MoreMeaghan Rath has found a techy new role. The Hawaii Five-0 vet has joined AMC and AMC+’s untitled Silicon Valley series, starring Billy Magnussen (Made for Love) and Sarah Goldberg (Barry), our sister site Deadline reports. The forthcoming show — from writer and showrunner Jonathan Glatzer (Succession, Bad Sisters, Better Call Saul) — is set inside the bubble of Silicon Valley, “amid misguided corporate cultures, moony innovation labs and cutthroat private high schools,” the official synopsis reads. “In our story, a scandal is sparked by the exploitation of personal data which unravels out of a rift between a self-appointed ‘inventor of the future’ tech CEO (played by Magnussen) and his self-serving ‘performance psychologist’ (Goldberg).” Rath — whose credits also include Children Ruin Everything and Being Human — will play the Chief Ethicist at a Cupertino-based tech company and the former mistress of Magnussen’s character.
