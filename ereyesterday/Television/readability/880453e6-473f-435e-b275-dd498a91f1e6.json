  "text": "With the release of its long-awaited Season 2, Squid Game unsurprisingly dominated Nielsen’s U.S. streaming ranking for the week of Dec. 23. Netflix‘s most-watched series ever amassed 4.92 billion minutes viewed across 16 total episodes, marking the largest weekly haul of any 2024 series and landing it squarely atop both the streaming originals and overall charts. Nielsen notes that the South Korean thriller attracted a young, diverse audience that was 34% Hispanic, 11% Asian, 15% Black and 39% White. Additionally, nearly two-thirds (64%) of viewers fell into the 18-49 range. Netflix’s Virgin River in turn slipped to a distant second place on the originals ranking, with 2.25 billion minutes viewed across 64 episodes. Paramount+’s Landman came in at No. 3 with 1.1 billion minutes viewed/eight available episodes, followed by Netflix’s Black Doves (448 million minutes/six episodes) and Netflix’s No Good Deed (446 million minutes/eight episodes). Rounding out the Top 10 streaming originals for the week of Dec. 23 were Netflix’s La Palma (435 million minutes), Prime Video’s Beast Games (406 million minutes), Netflix’s latest Nate Bargatze special (394 million minutes), Paramount+’s Lioness (372 million minutes) and, with the launch of its final season, Disney+’s What If…? (367 million minutes) — whereas Disney+’s Skeleton Crew once again failed to chart, in its fourth week of eligibility. Want SCOOP on any of the above?
