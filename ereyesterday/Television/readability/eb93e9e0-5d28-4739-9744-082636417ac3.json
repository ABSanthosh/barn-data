  "text": "Donald Whitfield is an awful man. He wonders why Banner isn’t using the house in town, but Banner doesn’t trust town. Whitfield makes fun of Banner for caring for his flock, only for them to have fallen due to “flukes,” aka worms. Livestock is for peasants, and Banner is no peasant. The Norwegian miners are skiing on the side of the mountain. Donald has vision. The Sheriff and Jacob meet with, Roy, a judge, to discuss Zane’s plight. Roy just says his wife is guilty, plain and simple. The guy calls Zane’s family mongrels and worries about all of the state expenses. Jacob says he’ll remit them all to his custody — the whole bunch — the flapper, the mongrels, and the invalid.  The guy calls Zane’s home a “flophouse.” Zane and his wife can’t be seen in public together lest they face jail time. They must identify the priest, but Jacob isn’t playing that game. He’s been pushed too far already. The judge is married to a Crow woman, and two states over, that law applies to him, and he’s the one being judged. Jacob says they’ll supply the preacher’s name when he provides the name of his liquor contact. Blackmail? You’re damn right. There’s a reason it works. Elizabeth finds a wolf in the henhouse. It has killed all the chickens, and despite her quick thinking, locking him in the house behind her, he escaped, and a ranch hand comes to her rescue. The wolf stares her down as if to say, “I’ll be back.” Cara left the door open while getting meat from their outdoor icehouse, and that worried me. Thankfully, it’s full, but it won’t last if all of their food keeps getting taken. Cara sends the ranch hand to get the doctor. She’s worried the wolf could be rabid. Cara chuckles. If it weren’t for bad luck, she’d have no luck at all. Giving her that face was the only favor she got from God. Cara thinks it’s worth the trouble. Zane is in a bad way and has little hope, but we’ve seen miracles before when Jacob was almost left for dead. Zane doesn’t understand why this happened now when they’ve been left alone before. Because Whitfield told them to care, Jacob says, and come spring, they will do some chopping of their own. Runs His Horse is worried after learning about the cowboy. Teonna and Pete want to stay and work with the rancher rather than put their faith in another reservation where there are police and priests. Father Renaud and the mean Marshal Kent visit Mamie Fossett, who calls him a bigot. Father Renaud says she killed three nuns and two priests. The Marshal says she joined up with a gang. Mamie is skeptical, but she’s willing to work with them by placing posters around. Spencer and Luca arrive on shore in the free state of Galveston (Texas?). It looks so modern compared to Montana. Luca greets his cousin Cugino. Luca told Cugino he likes to fight, but Spencer disagrees. He keeps running into people who like trouble, and that trouble is him. Cugino says Luca was worth saving, so they’ll celebrate Spencer tonight for his trouble. Spencer sees and eats his first pizza. He sends a telegraph home before going to his hotel. Spencer doesn’t want to celebrate, he wants to go to the train station. But Cugino Maceo showed him great hospitality, and to refuse him is an insult. The only way around the guy is through him, so Spencer uses his fists. Spencer walks across the bridge from Galveston to the mainland, but he’s waylaid by more of Cugino Maceo’s goons, who beat the tar out of him. This is beginning to feel like a romance novel. Cugino wants to give Spencer the very thing he needs for his cause. Does he have time to discuss that? Jacob, Jack, and the men are trying to get everyone back to the Yellowstone, but the blizzard is raging. It’s incredibly beautiful but very dangerous. They’ve got to put the horses’ asses to the wind and flip the wagon. Dear God, please don’t let the horses die because they didn’t time this right. Everyone takes cover under the wagon. Jack doesn’t want the horses frozen in place and talks Jacob into releasing them.  The scariest part is that if that thing gets buried, it will be impossible to get out from under it. Dr. Miller arrives to check on Elizabeth. He’ll be staying a while. I didn’t realize they had the rabies vaccine already. That’s good. Elizabeth doesn’t want to take the giant needle in her stomach, though. She puts up quite a fight. Elizabeth doesn’t like living there. She’s miserable. This isn’t living, and when the storm passes, she’s going home. Banner meets with someone named Clyde in a local bar. He’s impressed with how Whitfield can see business out of the strangest things. He’s a man of vision, the other man says. But Banner disagrees. Whitfield sees through us, sees the greed in our hearts. Whitfield is the first man in his life who has ever scared him, and Whitfield scares him to death. Marshal Kent is reading the paper. The Republicans plan to introduce the Indians Citizenship Act to congress, which would give citizenship to all Indians in the US. Father Renaud says it’s the effect of assimilation, and if they want them to abandon their pagan ways, they must be given equality.  Kent thinks Renaud is bullshit because he’s seen the graves in his backyard. Father says that as long as they accept, he does as well. He also notes that black men ruled parts of Europe for 800 years, and Andalusia has some of the most magnificent architecture in the world. Blacks and whites marry there to no adverse consequences.  As Kent and the other fellow giggle, arrows begin raining down on them. They’re under attack. Somehow, these two dudes manage to kill all of the Indians, which are only children. Father Renaud is shocked. Alexandra is in the middle of the ocean, terrified as the rough waters are tossing women all over the place. She can’t wait to bring him the life growing inside her who shall bear her name. She cannot wait for him to look into her eyes, pulling her close so they can make another and another — a whole army of them. It is her dream, her only desire, his eyes upon her and his arms around her; their bodies pressed together as if they are one. Cugino Maceo gives Spender a truck full of whiskey to take to Fort Worth. Luca is going with him. They have guns and a map of roads Cugino owns. If they make it, Spencer can have the truck and hopefully get home quickly. He knows what it means to want to help family. Cara hears a scream. There is snow covering the floor of the main room. Elizabeth is, by all appearances, dead, a wolf feasting on her gut. Cara shoots.",
