  "text": "There are only two episodes left of Murder in a Small Town Season 1. The final two episodes are the season finale, and the spoilers for Murder in a Small Town Season 1 Episode 7 suggest a high-stakes murder is in play. This is the second episode without source material, but the final episode is from one of L. R. Wright’s novels, so they’re probably related. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) The Team Finds a Body in the Forest There is something eerie and frightening about finding a dead woman in the forest. To make matters worse, she had flowers placed around her. This suggested that someone cared enough to redress the body and pose the victim. While the set-up initially reminded me of a demented fairytale, it was very sick and violent instead. The weekly promo almost suggests the victims were hung from a tree and attacked. That piercing scream haunts me. It also suggests that the victim was attacked so badly that her cheek was cracked and her bones were fractured. This killer meant business, and Karl seemed positive he would kill more women. This Serial Killer Storyline Seems Oddly Familiar This serial killer storyline seems oddly familiar. Granted, I watch way too many procedurals, but it feels oddly similar to the serial killer storyline in Will Trent’s Season 2 finale. How this one will differ is these are female victims that a male perpetrator is obsessed with. It’s disturbing that these bodies are violently dismembered with either a hammer or a carving knife. Could that be a hint? I wonder if he’s a butcher. He’d know how to carve animals. People would be an easy next step. As the bodies pile up, Karl is positive that they’re looking for a serial killer and turns to someone else for help. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) Karl Reaches Out To Cassandra for Help We have a special treat for you this week. FOX gave TV Fanatic an exclusive clip that teases Karl, asking Cassandra to help solve the multiple murders. We don’t want to spoil too much, but we’re relieved that he felt he could still ask for assistance after they broke up and that she teased him about needing an artist recommendation when that’s his specialty. Often, the police use sketch artists to help identify suspects, so Karl is taking it further by ensuring they have the best to catch the serial killer. Cassandra recommends high school art teacher Tommy Cummins. Viewers will recognize the actor Noah Reid from Schitt’s Creek. Since they have an amicable conversation, does that mean there is hope for these two? Check out the exclusive clip, and weigh in with your thoughts. Combining Artistic and Detective Skills to Solve the Case Previously, Karl mentioned that you could discern a lot about someone by their eyes. He learned that from his mother, who used to paint portraits. I suspect that is why he wants to hire a portrait painter. He wants someone to paint various suspects. The official Murder in a Small Town promo showed Karl painting a portrait to examine various gazes to find their suspect. Combined with Corporal Yen’s investigative skills, that could narrow down the suspect field. We saw in Murder in a Small Town Season 1 Episode 6 how quickly she saw through mind games. Edwina is a pro at deciphering actual suspects, and we can’t wait to watch her continue to shine. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) This Murder Affects Corporal Yen The Most Most murders upset the police force, but there is something about finding dismembered women that hits female cops. Corporal Yen has seen her share of murders, but this one is pure evil. They need to learn why he attacked these women or if the victims knew each other. It looked like a passionate killing by the amount of violence. It also suggests the murderer was working with a partner or someone else found the bodies since they were redressed with care. Since this is a two-part finale, the team will likely still be putting the pieces together near the end of this episode. (FOX/ YouTube Screenshot) Why is Roger Galbraith Back? According to the cast sheet, Roger Galbraith (Lucas Bryant) returns for the two-part season finale. Was I the only one hoping we had seen the last of him in Murder of a Small Town Season 1 Episode 3? While we have no spoilers for why Roger has returned, he’s a pro with small-town gossip and likely heard that Cassandra and Karl broke up. I suspect he returned to make another play on Cassandra. Hopefully, she’s smart enough to realize he’s still playing games and that it is not right for her. I’d rather Cassandra stay single while considering what she needs before reuniting with Karl. (FOX/ YouTube Screenshot) Hopefully, Roger didn’t have anything to do with the murders. While he’s an annoying gossip, I didn’t peg him as a murderer. Over to you, TV Fanatics. What are you looking forward to in Murder in a Small Town Season 1 Episode 7? Are you intrigued by the multiple murders? Are you relieved that Karl and Cassandra are still talking? Let us know in the comments. Murder in a Small Town airs on FOX at 8/7c on Tuesdays and streams on Hulu the next day. Watch Murder in a Small Town 2024 Online",
