  "text": "The following post contains spoilers for All American Season 7, Episode 7. Yeah, we suppose that All American breakup was inevitable. During Monday’s episode of the CW drama, long-distance lovebirds Coop and Patience decided to permanently call it quits, punctuating an on-again-off-again relationship that dates back to the show’s first season. Patience, who’s been away performing in a Broadway show, revealed she’d been invited to star in a brand-new stage production coming to London’s West End. Coop recognized that she’s fully thrown herself into her law school studies. And in a tearful-but-amicable breakup scene that paid sweet tribute to the couple’s series-long romance, Patience and Coop ended things for good. Logistically, at least, the writing was on the wall for these two. Bre-Z, who plays Coop, returned as a series regular this season — one of only three All American OGs to do so — while Chelsea Tavares did not. With that arrangement, it’d be tough to keep even the strongest TV couple alive. In some alternate CW universe, maybe this pair could have gone the distance, but they seemed destined to separate in this one. With Patience now out of the picture, though (and hardly on Coop’s mind when she was in the picture), All American appears to be speeding toward another narrative inevitability, and it’s one that we’re giving some preemptive side-eye: a potential romantic something between Coop and her law school professor, Breonna Strong. Breonna, who teaches Coop’s torts class, first showed up in Episode 2 of the current seventh season, skillfully talking Coop down from a first-day-of-law-school panic attack. At the time, neither woman realized that Coop would be a student in Breonna’s classroom — but that revelation hasn’t squashed their chummy dynamic, either. In fact, the lines have only gotten blurrier since then: Coop watches Breonna’s class lectures on repeat, even when she attended them in person; they’ve spent time alone in Breonna’s office, including a long hangout that involved alcohol; and Breonna recently dropped the news that she’s into women, which seemed to pique Coop’s interest. It’s possible we’re off-base with our assumptions here. Maybe nothing will come of Coop and Breonna’s increasingly friendly vibe. Maybe something briefly will — they’re both single now, after all — but one of them will have the good sense to end it. (Ideally Breonna, for obvious reasons.) Maybe Layla, who’s already picked up on Coop and Breonna’s unusual closeness, will find a way to insert herself more forcefully as the voice of reason that Coop’s been tuning out. But the show has already dropped enough clues that something is starting between these two, something that might not be extinguished until they’ve acted on their whatever-is-going-on-here — and we’re worried about that. For one? It’s weird and inappropriate. Sure, Coop is in her 20s and capable of making her own romantic decisions… but a power imbalance is a power imbalance, and even a student-professor fling that seems mutual won’t shake out evenly in the end, especially when said student is rebounding from a long-term love. That’s especially worrisome for Coop, a character who’s currently enjoying a richly deserved “look how far she’s come!” arc, one that we’re concerned will get tarnished by this potential tryst. Coop has thus far taken law school extremely seriously — she’s unsatisfied with any grade lower than an “A” — and Breonna is not only a potential distraction, but a possible liability to Coop’s success, should word get out around GAU about those after-hours office visits. We’re already a little nervous for Coop, now that she’s likely moving in with Amina and Preach, and circling some uncomfortable truths about what really happened to Amina’s mom years ago. This yet-to-be-defined situation with Breonna only makes us more concerned for, and protective of, Coop’s hard-fought stability — and though All American might very well overrule us in the weeks to come, this is one objection we’ve got to raise. All American fans, I hand it over to you. What are your thoughts on Coop’s breakup with Patience, and whatever’s brewing with Breonna? Drop a comment below.",
