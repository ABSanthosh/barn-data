  "text": "The following post contains spoilers for The White Lotus‘ Season 3 finale. Don’t scroll unless you’ve watched! Once again, the fictional behavior of The White Lotus’ Timothy Ratliff has caught the attention of a real-life brand. The home appliance company Bosch has responded to the use of one of its blenders in a few pivotal — and disconcerting — scenes from Sunday’s White Lotus Season 3 finale, pointing out that the blender “was not provided or placed by the company” on the show. In a statement provided to TVLine, a spokesman for BSH (the home appliances division of the Bosch Group) said: “While we’re very appreciative of the creative flair and immense popularity of the show in the United States, BSH is clarifying that the Bosch product featured was not provided or placed by the company. However, we can confirm that the production team did purchase the product on their own while filming abroad.” Actually, that particular Bosch blender is not even available in North America and “can only be purchased in other select global regions,” the statement added. But “we appreciate the attention the Bosch brand is receiving as a result of this pop culture moment.” The Bosch blender in question previously popped up more innocuously throughout Season 3, as Patrick Schwarzenegger’s Saxon Ratliff concocted protein smoothies for himself at Thailand’s White Lotus resort. But in Sunday’s final episode — again, spoilers ahead! — the blender was used for more disturbing purposes, as Jason Isaacs’ Timothy whipped up poisoned piña coladas that he intended to drink with his family (save for younger son Lochlan). Timothy ultimately couldn’t let his wife and children go through with drinking the toxic beverages… but Lochlan did make himself a protein drink in the same blender the next morning, notably choosing not to rinse out the still-poison-coated appliance before filling it with his own ingredients. (Read our full finale recap for the details of Lochlan and his family’s ultimate fates.) This is the second time a prominent brand has weighed in on its own White Lotus appearances, after Duke University decried the choice to put Isaacs‘ character in a Duke T-shirt as he contemplated his own suicide earlier this season. “The White Lotus not only uses our brand without permission, but in our view uses it on imagery that is troubling, does not reflect our values or who we are, and simply goes too far,” the university’s VP for communications, marketing and public affairs Frank Tramble said in a March statement. “Suicide is the second-leading cause of death on college campuses. As imagery from the show is being shared widely across social media, we are using our brand to promote mental health awareness and remind people that help is available.” TVLine readers have thus far given The White Lotus‘ finale an average grade of “B,” while Season 3 overall earned a “B-“; weigh in below if you haven’t already!",
