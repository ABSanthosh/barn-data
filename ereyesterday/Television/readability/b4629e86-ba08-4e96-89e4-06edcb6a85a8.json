  "text": "It’s a good day for CBS viewers, as the network has renewed eight scripted series for the 2025-26 year. We know that CBS is your go-to for drama, and we couldn’t be more thrilled with this announcement. Get the full details below! (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) CBS announced today that it has renewed nine additional series for the 2025-2026 broadcast season. The renewed CBS Original series includes the number one entertainment series Tracker and the number one comedy Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage. But that’s not all! (Robert Voets/CBS ) Elsbeth, Fire Country, NCIS, NCIS: Origins, and NCIS: Sydney will also return. Additionally, the Network has ordered two more seasons of hit comedy Ghosts, taking the series through the 2026-2027 season. Previous series orders for the 2025-2026 season include the number one new series Matlock, starring Kathy Bates and Sheriff Country, the new drama expanding the universe of the hit series Fire Country, starring Morena Baccarin. And let’s not forget yesterday’s announcement about the new police drama Boston Blue (working title), starring Donnie Wahlberg as his Blue Bloods character Danny Reagan. (CBS / Best Screengrab Possible ) The original FBI series was formerly renewed through the 2026-2027 broadcast season. This brings the total number of series ordered for the 2025-2026 season to 16. “This season, our new and returning series continue to showcase CBS as the leader in launching and programming the biggest hits with mass appeal for broadcast and streaming viewers,” said Amy Reisenbach, president of CBS Entertainment. “These returning shows represent a mix of long-standing hits and a new generation of fan favorites. In collaboration with our extraordinarily talented partners in front of and behind the camera, we look forward to delivering another successful season.” Additional series orders and renewals will be made at future dates, but we’re not surprised that two of the shows we’re most concerned about are not on the list. (Erik Voake/CBS) We’ve talked a lot about FBI: International and FBI: Most Wanted and how they’re not quite up to snuff. Whether it’s International’s ever-changing cast of Most Wanted’s somewhat bleak approach to law enforcement, there is something that’s not quite scoring with fans of the OG. Honestly, we’re OK with that right now because the shows that have been renewed give us confidence that the people running the show over at CBS are really paying attention. What do you think of this spate of renewals? Share your excitement or disappointment in the comments below.",
