  "text": "It’s no secret that we’ve been truly enjoying Doc.  The series has so much heart, and it is buoyed by a talented cast that keeps us coming back time and again.  Amy is a compelling protagonist, and watching what she’s navigating leaves one transfixed at every turn.  (FOX) Doc Keeps Bringing All the Emotions When Secrets Are Revealed  In every episode, we learn something completely new about Amy and her life before or how her behavior and actions have deeply affected those around her.  One of the most emotional hours of the series to date was Doc Season 1 Episode 4, which saw the truth about how Danny died unfolding via flashbacks and a devastating admission by Michael.  My heart ached for this man as he recalled the day their son died in front of him, and he did all he could to save him, to no avail.  Worse yet, Michael’s testiness and anxiety over Amy learning the truth went back to his fear that he’d have to relive the past eight years all over again.  (FOX) Amy blamed Michael for Danny’s death despite it being something that was out of his control. Anyone familiar with grief knows how redirecting one’s pain to others is a common development.  Michael seemed to take the brunt of Amy’s anger and pain, and she doled out the rest to those around her. It’s no wonder their marriage collapsed.  Danny’s death and what happened that day was one of the season’s biggest mysteries thus far, so having that tidbit of information helps us make sense of these characters more than ever before.  Will Jake Spill the Beans to Amy About Their Romance? Of course, one of the biggest revelations now is that Amy and Jake were in a romantic relationship, and no one else knew about it.  (FOX/Screenshot) Since Doc Season 1 Episode 1, where we saw their endearing moments together, viewers have wondered how long it would take for this secret to come out.  Any romantic can’t resist the angst of this situation and the desire for something to click into place for Amy.  Jake hasn’t told Amy the truth. Like everyone in her life, Jake seems keen on gatekeeping information from her to spare her or not overwhelm her.  Frankly, it’s become too much, and it’d be better if everyone laid all their cards on the table, and Amy could figure out what she needs and go from there.  Given that most of the interpersonal conflict within the series relies heavily on this issue, that would be too easy.  We’ve been eagerly awaiting the moment when Jake and Amy’s secret relationship will come to the forefront, and it seems like we’ll be one step closer to that with Doc Season 1 Episode 5.  (FOX/Screenshot) Gina May Be the Barrier Between Jake Revealing the Truth to Amy In the hour, titled “He Ain’t Heavy,” the promo teases that Amy will be speaking to her best friend Gina about her non-existent love life since her divorce from Michael.  Amy doesn’t remember anything about her love life in the past eight years, and she doesn’t have any evidence or indication that she’s dated or had any other relationships since her divorce.  Interestingly, Gina has been tight-lipped about so much of Amy’s life. She’s supportive of Amy, but she also hasn’t been too quick to give her information and often redirects her to someone else in some attempt to stay out of things.  But from what we’ve gathered, Gina was clueless about Jake and Amy‘s relationship with him.  Granted, the two were only together for five months, but it still feels odd that Amy never told Gina about that relationship at all.  Why not? What did it mean that she kept such an important and juicy part of her life from her best friend?  Does it suggest that Amy still wasn’t all-in on Jake despite finally admitting she loved him before her accident?  There are a lot of questions revolving around Amy and Jake’s romance, and we cannot wait to see what the upcoming episode may reveal about them.  How Will the Truth Hurt or Help Amy While Navigating a Difficult Workplace? (FOX) In the promo, it appears that Jake will go to Gina and break the news that he and Amy were involved.  We don’t see her reaction, so there’s no way of knowing if this surprises her or confirms some suspicions she may have had but didn’t confirm.  All it takes is being in the room with Jake and Amy for more than a few moments to notice that he cares about her deeply and they have some inexplicable chemistry, even if Amy doesn’t remember it just yet.  Jake is in a difficult position with Amy not remembering anything about him and still adapting to her new place in life.  He also knows that she harbors feelings for Michael because, for her, the love she has for Michael is as fresh as it was nearly a decade ago when they were happily married.  Understandably, Jake has been trying to lean more toward professionalism, but it has to be too much for him.  (FOX) Do You Want Amy to Know the Truth About Jake, Or Is It Too Soon? He told Sonya about their relationship, but that hasn’t boded well. If anything, it only added to Sonya’s animosity toward Amy.  But we haven’t seen Jake talk about it any further until now. Approaching Amy’s best friend is a good start, especially if he’s trying to gauge whether it’s the best call to tell Amy the truth or keep it secret.  On the one hand, this new bit of news could be confusing and overwhelming for Amy, and it maybe could cause some other issues with her past of dating a subordinate and Richard on a crusade against her at every turn.  However, they genuinely loved each other, and Amy deserves to know the full truth.  (FOX) Would it change anything? How does it affect their love story?  Would you rather Amy figure out their connection all over again so that if it was meant to be, it would naturally happen?  Do you think Amy knowing the truth would influence her too much and prevent her from living her life and making fresh decisions for herself in an effort to reclaim the past?  So much is at stake with this possible revelation. Do you think Amy will learn the truth about Jake in the new episode? Do you want her to know the truth?  Let us know below!  Watch Doc Online",
