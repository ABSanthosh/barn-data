  "text": "Another video game series is headed to Prime Video. A TV adaptation of Mass Effect is officially in development at Amazon MGM Studios, with Daniel Casey (F9: The Fast Saga) attached to write, our sister site Variety reports. No plot details are currently available for the potential series, which was first reported to be in negotiations in November 2021. Casey will also executive-produce alongside Karim Zreik (via his Cedar Tree Productions), Ari Arad and Electronic Arts’ Michael Gamble. The Mass Effect video games are set in a distant future where humanity and several alien civilizations have colonized the galaxy. At the center of the franchise is Commander Shepard, who is out to save the Milky Way from ancient, hibernating machines known as the Reapers. Ready for some more recent newsy nuggets? Well… * The comedy special Bill Maher: Is Anyone Else Seeing This? will premiere in January on HBO. * Sam Nivola (The Perfect Couple) will star opposite Connie Britton in the Hulu comedy pilot Phony, per Variety. The potential series follows “a teenager (Nivola) who wakes up in the hospital after a car accident to discover his mom (Britton) — his only parent and his best friend — appears to have been replaced by an impostor.” * Dave Annable (Special Ops: Lioness, Brothers \u0026 Sisters) will recur in Kevin Williamson’s upcoming Netflix family drama The Waterfront as a developer whose interest in Maria Bello’s character goes beyond just business, our sister site Deadline reports. * The Gilded Age Season 3 has added Dylan Baker (The Good Wife) in the role of Dr. Logan, “a family doctor who treats a number of high society families,” per Deadline. * Paramount+ has released a trailer for Dear Santa, an original holiday comedy movie from the Farrelly Brothers, starring Jack Black and premiering Monday, Nov. 25: Which of today’s TVLine Items pique your interest?",
