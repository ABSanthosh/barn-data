  "text": "We Were Liars may have wrapped its first season, but the Sinclairs’ story is far from over. In addition to its central tragedy (R.I.P., half the cast!), the Prime Video series also drops several major hints about another skeleton in the wealthy Sinclair family’s closet: the tragic death of Penny, Carrie and Bess’ younger sister Rosemary at just 10 years old. Details about her drowning are revealed gradually, but one moment in the finale confirms that we still only know a fraction of the story. While discussing the deaths of their own children, Bess tells Carrie, “Sometimes I think losing them was our punishment, like that one tiny ember was sent from God or the universe or Beechwood Island.” When Carrie asks Bess what they’d be punished for, she chillingly replies, “For what we did in Summer 16, the summer I was 16. But then I think, if it was our punishment, Penny wouldn’t have been spared, right?” With that simple exchange, a seed has been planted for a potential second season, and there’s plenty of source material for it. Just as Season 1 was a largely faithful adaptation of E. Lockhart’s 2014 novel We Were Liars, Season 2 would pull from Lockhart’s 2022 follow-up Family of Liars, which turns back the clock to explore the aforementioned Rosemary tragedy. Needless to say (but we’ll let them say it anyway), the cast is game for a return to Beechwood Island. “Because we know the prequel and the origin story of these three complicated women, it would be really fun to go back and do that,” Caitlin Fitzgerald tells TVLine of adapting Family of Liars for the screen. And if you’re at all on the fence about wanting another season, allow Candice King to pitch the heck out of it: “Who doesn’t love a throwback to the ’90s?” she asks TVLine. In fact, that’s only the start of her and Fitzgerald’s A+ pitches for the show’s future. Hit PLAY on the video above to watch our full interview with King and Fitzgerald, then drop a comment with your own thoughts below. Did you enjoy Season 1 of We Were Liars, and what are your questions leading into a possible Season 2?",
