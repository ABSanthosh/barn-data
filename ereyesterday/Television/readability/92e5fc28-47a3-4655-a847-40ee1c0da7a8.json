  "text": "(The reveal of) Death becomes Agatha All Along. This Wednesday’s Episode 7 of the Disney+/Marvel series generated 4.2 million views globally, after just one day of streaming. That marks a 35% increase from first-day views of the series premiere episode — and nearly a series high, TVLine hears. (Disney+ rightly defines a “view” as total stream time divided by runtime.) Agatha All Along‘s Sept. 18 series debut went on to deliver 9.3 million views globally, in its first seven days of streaming. Marvel TV Status Report: The Latest on Daredevil, the Vision Series and 10 Others The Kathryn Hahn-led WandaVision spinoff has also been putting up good numbers on Nielsen’s weekly U.S. ranking of streaming originals. In its first week of eligibility, Agatha All Along racked up 426 million minutes viewed, in the U.S., for its first two episodes (which totaled 86 minutes, credits included); that was good for No. 8 on the Nielsen Top 10. For the week of Sept. 23, Agatha All Along added 365 million minutes viewed for three available episodes. Agatha All Along finishes up its season next Wednesday, Oct. 30 at 9/8c — on Halloween Eve, natch — with its final two episodes.",
