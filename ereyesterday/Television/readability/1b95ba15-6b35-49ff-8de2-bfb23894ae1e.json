News broke on The Boys’ social media channels Wednesday afternoon that Misha Collins and Jared Padalecki had landed guest starring roles on the Prime Video hit’s fifth and final season. (Colin Bentley/The CW) They join Jensen Ackles, who has been a prominent character over the last few seasons as Soldier Boy. The character’s popularity has opened the door for Jensen to co-lead an upcoming spinoff with Aya Cash. (Bettina Strauss/The CW) But we’re sure viewers will be most excited about seeing Jensen, Misha, and Jared together on-screen again because they were a formidable trio on the former CW drama Supernatural. Despite ending after 15 seasons in 2020, the series remains talked about thanks to its passionate fanbase, who have fiercely lobbied for more projects with some of the show’s best characters. Of course, Jared and Jensen played brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester, with Misha joining the series a bit into its run as Castiel, but their dynamic on-screen was unmatched. Given that The Boys is from Supernatural creator Eric Kripke, we are not concerned about their appearances together in episodes. We think it’s fair to say they will all share the screen, but perhaps things will not go as expected. That’s all part of the fun, and it will be interesting to see how these scenes come together. Wouldn’t having them all take a ride in a 1967 Chevrolet Impala be fun? Maybe that would be too on the nose, but we’d be thrilled about it. The Boys has broken through because it consistently flips the script on audiences, but there are many ways things can go in the final season. (Dean Buscher/The CW) Jeffrey Dean Morgan could return in some capacity to make this Supernatural reunion a bit more lively. Details about The Boys Season 5 are scarce. Still, we expect that Karl Urban, Jack Quaid, Antony Starr, Erin Moriarty, Jessie T. Usher, Laz Alonso, Chace Crawford, Tomer Capone, Karen Fukuhara, Colby Minifie, and Cameron Crovetti will be a part of the cast. News that The Boys Season 5 would be the final season broke last summer ahead of The Boys Season 4’s debut, with Kripke stating that five seasons were always the goal. The franchise successfully expanded with Gen V, a college-set spinoff that focused on the next generation of supes. (Bettina Strauss/The CW) What are your thoughts on supernatural team-ups?
