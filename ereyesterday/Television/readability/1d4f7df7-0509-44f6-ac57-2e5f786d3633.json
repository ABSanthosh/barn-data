  "text": "Critic's Rating: 4.8 / 5.04.8 Was anyone surprised by that ending? I hate that Will suffered even more, and Ramon Rodriguez gave his most emotional performance on Will Trent Season 3 Episode 11. They knew how to lure the audience in by showing a broken, bloodied Will being questioned. He looked so traumatized, and you needed to know what happened. (Zac Popik/Disney) It hurt that Faith learned about his and Jeremy’s partnership during this crisis and that Marion was more businesslike than comforting. As a result, it shouldn’t be surprising that only two people staunchly defended Will. If You Thought Will Was Traumatized Before, Will Trent Season 3 Episode 11 Took It To A New Level Will Trent has experienced so much trauma on the series, but he seemed like he could survive it. This time, I’m not so sure. Will’s core values are about protecting others, especially children. While he remembered the suspect pointing a gun at him, it didn’t mean he wanted to be cleared. Will almost acted like he wanted to punish himself because the captain and Angie reminded him that he needed to think of protecting himself. (Zac Popik/Disney) I’ve watched many police procedurals, and it’s always difficult to see a cop on the other end of the spectrum, but Will looked like a deer in headlights. He couldn’t process the severity of the situation or what might happen to him, and Marion worsened the problem by throwing questions at him. Will: Don’t tell me it’s my job to be sure! You don’t think I know that. You don’t think I’m going spend the rest of my life thinking about this day over and over again, wondering if there was something, anything I could have done differently. It was one of the few times we’ve seen how Will processes things differently. Usually, it’s related to his dyslexia, but when he’s traumatized, he needs more time to understand the crisis. It explained why he blocked out shooting his abusive foster father in Will Trent Season 2, trying to protect his foster mother.  Only Amanda and Angie understood that. (Zac Popik/Disney) Everyone else wanted to wrap up the case quickly, and that meant rehashing details that repeatedly hurt Will as he wondered if anything could have been prevented. I hated that they implied Will was upset and might have mistaken a gun for something else. He’s such a caring man and would never hurt a child. This will haunt him for life. Ramon Rodriguez showed every depth of emotion in “Best of Your Recollection” and deserves an Emmy for his performance. While The Investigator Seemed Harsh, She Ultimately Was Fair Everyone else seemed to revere Will. The investigator’s only objective was to prove the truth, and initially, she seemed harsh with her questions. I was surprised by how kind the captain and Angie were, though saying anything mean to Will would have been like kicking Betty. (Zac Popik/Disney) Her methods seemed invasive, implying that Will or Faith were off their game and prying into Faith’s medical history, but I know that a prosecutor would have been even worse. As they reviewed the facts, you could see Faith’s hesitation. She would never admit it, but she started questioning whether they stayed together and whether she could have seen something. Again, Will looked lost because he was sure there was a gun and thought he had made the correct decision. He knew EMS didn’t care about helping that neighborhood, and he was right based on Angie’s experience with the witnesses. We’ll never know if Will’s decision to rush Marco to the hospital hindered his survival chances. He had good intentions, but he’ll need to live with it. (Zac Popik/Disney) The investigator only cared that the suspect had pointed a gun at him, and he had probable cause to shoot his weapon for her report. That’s heartbreaking, but it’s the way the world works. Is This the End of Will and Faith’s Partnership? Will and Faith’s partnership is one of the best parts about Will Trent. I would hate to see it disintegrate since that emotional argument made perfect sense. Will tried to protect Jeremy and keep him out of prison because he cared about Faith and Jeremy, but he should’ve consulted her. That’s her son, and Rafael Wexford can be dangerous. The best fights often are when both parties have a valid point, like this one, and emotions get in the way. (Zac Popik/Disney) Everyone knows not to mess with a fierce mama bear, and Faith proved that again. She was furious with Will but determined not to let Jeremy go down with him. That scene was so powerful as she pleaded with him not to mention Jeremy in their statements. Hopefully, Faith will eventually forgive Will. I’d hate to see them partnered up with anyone else since they mesh so well together. Luckily, she stuck by him in her interview, and that was a testament to their relationship, which gave me hope. The series would not be the same without their bantering through cases. (Zac Popik/Disney) Only One Person Understood The Trauma Will’s Trauma I think Angie should become a lawyer. Since Will Trent Season 3 began, she’s fought for the underdog and found the evidence to prove their innocence. Of course, it’s different with Will. She knows what type of person he is, and he would never hurt a child. Even after what happened between them, Angie rushed to prove his innocence and begged him to fight for himself. She knew better than anyone how this case would make him fall apart because even if he wasn’t deemed guilty, he had to live with killing an innocent kid. (Wilford Harewood/ Disney) People die on the job frequently, but it’s not often children, and they don’t usually die in your arms. That’s an image that will haunt Will for years. While I tried to like Will and Marion together, Marion was too businesslike in this case. She didn’t know how to comfort and support Will as he needed. That’s something Angie was well-versed in. They have been through so many crises together. Sometimes, you need to fall apart in someone’s arms. This was similar to the ending scene of Will Trent Season 2 Episode 7, when Will fell apart after being held hostage at the wedding. (Zac Popik/Disney) Angie shows up to comfort him at the perfect time, and this could be the catalyst that reunites them or at least brings their friendship back on track. It’s obvious how much they still care for each other. Over to you, Will Trent Fanatics. How long will it take Will to heal from this crisis? Will he and Faith mend their relationship?
