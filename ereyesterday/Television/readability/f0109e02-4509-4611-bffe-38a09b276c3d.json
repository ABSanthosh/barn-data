  "text": "We were starting to wonder whether Grey’s Anatomy forgot that Amelia and Monica were almost a thing. But the preview for Thursday’s “Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone” reveals that the colleagues and occasional flirtmates are back in one another’s orbit. That’s the good news. And the bad? The circumstances that bring the docs back together aren’t exactly romantic. As we are told by the official logline for the episode (which airs on ABC at 10/9c), Caterina Scorsone’s on-screen counterpart undertakes an extremely risky procedure on a young patient — whose anxious mother is played by Yellowstone alum Piper Perabo. Natalie Morales’ character tries to step up and reassure Amelia. Monica has already seen her friend do the impossible. So what’s doing it once more? Alas, Amelia isn’t in a place where she can hear that. “She is 9 years old, and whether she lives or dies is in my hands,” she says. “When I say I need a minute, I need a minute.” Elsewhere in the hour, Winston (Anthony Hill) and Jules (Adelaide Kane), who may or not be starting their own something, disagree about the best way to handle a trauma patient’s family, and Link (Chris Carmack) and Jo (Camilla Luddington) face as much difficulty in planning their wedding than they ever have performing a surgery. To watch the preview, press PLAY on the video at the top of this post.",
