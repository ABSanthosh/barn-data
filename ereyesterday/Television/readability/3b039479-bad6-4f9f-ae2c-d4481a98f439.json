  "text": "Jealousy is an ugly thing. And if you’re Tate Black, it’ll make you do the one thing that’ll ensure you lose your girlfriend to your romantic rival. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-24-25 suggest Tate’s latest move will only push Holly into Doug III’s arms — and there may be no coming back from this one. (Screenshot/Peacock) Tate Tells Julie What Doug III Did The Days of Our Lives spoiler video shows Tate calling Julie to tell her that Doug III stole her necklace. Tate will probably justify it to himself by saying that Doug III committed a crime and Julie deserves to know what happened to the precious family heirloom that disappeared minutes after she discovered it in the time capsule. And yes, Doug III did steal the necklace and should be held accountable. Still, how the hell is this any of Tate’s business? There’s such a thing as doing the right thing for the wrong reasons, and that’s what Tate is doing here. There are times to break your silence no matter who’s going to be pissed off about it, but this is not one of those times. No one is going to die if Tate keeps his mouth shut. This is all about playing dirty to eliminate the competition, and Tate should be above that. This plan is also not terribly well thought out. Holly and Doug III know Tate is the only person who knows their secret, so it won’t be hard to figure out who tipped her off. Holly will be furious at Tate, too, and when she’s mad at him, who does she usually turn to? Doug III. Plus, Doug will be heartbroken if Julie disowns him without as much as listening to his side of the story, making him vulnerable and in need of comfort — and with feelings for Holly he’s been trying to suppress so he won’t interfere with her and Tate. It’s not hard to figure out where this is going. What’s wrong with Tate that he can’t see that all he’s doing is shoving Holly into Doug III’s arms? (Peacock/Screenshot) Sorry, Doug III, But Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week Of 3-24-25 Say Julie Will Believe Tate Julie should question why Tate is telling her this, how he knows, and if it’s even true. However, she probably has a gut instinct about that last question. Things didn’t add up with Doug III from the beginning. Jennifer even warned Julie that something was off with this grandson. Julie knows Doug III isn’t on the up-and-up, even if she didn’t know the specifics. She will believe Tate because she can no longer deny what she suspected to be true. (Peacock/Screenshot) Tate Should Have Bigger Things On His Mind With John’s Disappearance and Kim’s Illness Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-24-25 have Andrew admitting to Steve and Marlena that he knows more about John’s disappearance than he’s said. As great as it was to catch up with legacy character Shane Donovan, Andrew always made more sense as a point person in the John-is-missing story. Shane should be near retirement, if not already retired, by now. Now that Kim is sick again, he will likely finally give up the spy business. Andrew should be affected by both pieces of bad news since Kim is his mother and John is his father-in-law, but Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-24-25 don’t say anything about him reacting to the news about Kim. (Peacock (Screenshot)) That’s a shame, especially when you consider that Tate’s story is mostly about his jealousy over another man who is interested in Holly, while his grief over his grandmother’s illness and grandfather’s disappearance is more or less an afterthought. What a disrespectful way to treat legacy characters like Kim and John, even if John will get a tribute later in the year. Days of Our Lives Spoilers Promise That Paul and Marlena Reminisce About John Paul is one of my favorite characters. I always love it when he pops up, though I wish it was for a less sad occasion this time. Still, at least we’ll get some nice tributes to John out of these scenes. I bet Paul will remember how John joined in on a Pride celebration when he visited Paul on Beyond Salem 2. Marlena has years’ worth of memories to choose from. I hope there will be a montage, though Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-24-25 don’t promise one. (Peacock/Screenshot) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 3-24-25 Add More People To The List Of Suspects When EJ Gets Shot The winter spoiler video showed EJ getting shot, and we’re getting close to that point. Johnny, Rafe, Jada, Kate, and Belle all have motives to hurt EJ now, and we can add a couple more people to the list after this week. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-24-25 have EJ getting into a heated argument with Ava and Kristen swearing revenge. Kristen already has the gun her mother left behind, so she’ll be the first one suspected. (Screenshot/Peacock) Hopefully, this murder mystery (or attempted murder mystery, since there hasn’t been any confirmation that Dan Feurreigel is leaving Days of Our Lives) is better than some previous ones. Most such mysteries in Salem involve the cops arresting one person after another, only to let them go when a better suspect comes along. The story ends when a random person who hasn’t been on canvas in months pops up and is shown to be the real killer. As a mystery author myself, that nonsense aggravates me no end. Among other things, how can the DA prosecute anyone when there were four other people arrested for the crime first? (Screenshot/Peacock) Last But Not Least: Another Secret Falls Apart Spoilers for Days of Our Lives during the week of 3-24-25 promise significant movement on the Philip forgery secret. It’s too bad Theresa left town. I’d love to hear her reaction to someone else getting caught for forging a letter related to Victor’s will. Instead, Stephanie will finally tell someone the truth — Alex. It’s not because she’s had a moral epiphany. Xander misunderstood what he heard when he was eavesdropping on her and Philip. (Peacock/Screenshot) As a result, Stephanie is forced to tell Alex the truth so that he doesn’t think she’s having an affair with Philip. Will Alex tell Xander? Who knows. But Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-24-25 say Sarah and Philip will panic, so it’s probably the beginning of the end of this story. Meanwhile, elsewhere, Kate has a secret of her own that she’s keeping from Roman, but I expect it’s only that EJ came into the Pub throwing his weight around and threatening her, Roman, and her children. That doesn’t seem like a big deal. (Screenshot/Peacock) Over to you, Days of Our Lives fanatics. What do you think of these Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-24-25?
