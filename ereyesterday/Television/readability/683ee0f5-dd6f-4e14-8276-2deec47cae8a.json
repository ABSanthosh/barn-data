  "text": "Buckle up, Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune fanatics, because a legal battle is brewing over the distribution rights for the beloved syndicated game shows. Those two shows are ingrained in pop culture, but the tension is spilling off-screen, and, quite frankly, it’s not a good look for either party. It’s not like either of these shows needs any more drama. There is a great deal of confusion about what’s happening, so TV Fanatic has searched for answers to assess what’s happening and what it could mean for the future of both shows. (Youtube/Screenshot) Given their impressive ratings, there’s no way either of the shows will be axed if the legal drama continues. Sony Pictures Television came out swinging on Monday and said it would take over CBS’s distribution of the shows beginning on February 10, which surprised the latter. (Youtube/Screenshot) The two sides have been stalemated in recent months after Sony filed a lawsuit alleging that CBS broke its contract by entering into unauthorized syndication deals for the shows. The Drama Could Drive Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune off the Air Temporarily CBS fired back with a countersuit, alleging Sony was trying to use the courts to escape their years-long deal. The Hollywood Reporter shared a statement from Sony stating that CBS failed to “live up to its contractual obligations.” But CBS isn’t taking the latest round in this battle lying down and is claiming that Sony’s admission that the distribution agreement has been terminated is categorically “false.” (Youtube/Screenshot) It’s a complicated and ever-changing web, but it sounds like the two sides will need to reach some agreement before this vendetta goes to court. It’s far more interesting than the Justin Baldoni-Blake Lively public squabble that’s been dominating the headlines for the last month. Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune have experienced remarkable changes in recent years, so any more could be the straw that broke the camel’s back and sent viewers fleeing. Both shows have endured for many years because of their legions of fans, who devour new episodes, reruns, and any primetime spinoffs that creep up when we least expect them. There was a year or two when we thought Jeopardy! was headed for cancellation. The series’ quality nosedived as it struggled to pick between Ken Jennings and Mayim Bialik. (Youtube/Screenshot) Thankfully, it made it out of that rut by picking one host. Still, there is a chance that Mayim could stage a comeback for some of the primetime editions. Each host brought some new energy to the series, but after Mike Richards’s short scandal-filled reign as the lead of Jeopardy!, producers wanted to get the show back to its former glory. Ken had big boots to fill, but he’s stepped up to the challenge in recent seasons, allowing the show some much-needed stability. After countless woes that plagued production, the series has found its footing again, so any more changes or forced breaks from new episodes could ruin the momentum. (Youtube/Screenshot) Similarly, Wheel of Fortune underwent an overhaul last fall when Ryan Seacrest took over from longtime host Pat Sajak, who retired the prior season. Ryan Seacrest Had a Shaky Start as Host Given Pat’s tenure and pizazz, Ryan would never have an easy road to winning over fans. Initially, some awkward moments in his first episodes led to questions about whether he and Vanna White could successfully steer this new era of Wheel of Fortune. Truthfully, we firmly believe that Vanna should have been promoted to host of the show. She’s more than earned her stripes over the years, and her infectious personality would have changed the series’ dynamic considerably. Fortunately, Ryan, who still hosts American Idol, has garnered some fans. Recent episodes indicate that he just had some jitters at the beginning of his reign as the face of Wheel of Fortune. (Youtube/Screenshot) When you think about the media attention surrounding his casting, it’s no surprise that there were some early issues. The poor man knew the show’s fate likely hinged on how fans received him. Now that the series has settled down creatively, the last thing it needs is a legal battle between two warring companies to spin it out of shape. The drama between the two sides is already ugly, so things will probably worsen until a resolution is reached. While we’d like to declare that episodes will be delivered to broadcasters in business as usual, there’s a chance that episodes could be halted if the two companies can’t agree on who should distribute them. It’s quite a conundrum for fans because they’re only getting accustomed to Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune’s behind-the-scenes dramas slowing down. (Youtube/Screenshot) With such big ratings for both shows, it’s not a shocker that neither CBS nor Sony is willing to back down. A lot of money is on the line, and it’s a rarity in today’s TV climate that shows that were some of the top-rated a decade ago are still up there. Alright, Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune Fanatics. What are your thoughts on the beef between these two sides? Are you bracing for both shows to be on hiatus as CBS and Sony go through the legal process? Let’s spin the wheel and have a conversation about it.",
