  "text": "Shameless had an impressive run on Showtime from 2011 to 2021. For 11 seasons, the comedy-drama charted the trials and tribulations of the bombastic Gallagher family and those in their orbit. Like many series, it has had a second life in streaming, thanks to a lucrative Netflix deal that brought it to homes around the globe. (Paul Sarkis/SHOWTIME.) It’s not too surprising that the show resonated during its initial run and beyond. For the most part, Shameless tackled issues plaguing people on low incomes and the lengths they go to make ends meet. (Paul Sarkis/SHOWTIME) As a remake of the hit British series of the same name, it broke free from the original by taking the characters markedly different directions. Initially, concerns were that it was too similar to its British counterpart, leading to questions about its long-term viability. Shameless Tackled Many Controversial Storylines But Shameless excelled because it was unafraid to tackle storylines other series wouldn’t touch with a barge pole. While I loved Shameless, I’m not blind to the fact that it had many lulls in the storytelling department throughout its run. (Paul Sarkis/SHOWTIME) Had the series ended with Season 8, or at a push, Season 9, I would have looked back on it much more fondly because by the end, it was all about provoking a reaction from viewers because of the outlandish happenings on-screen. I imagine Emmy Rossum was glad to be away from it before the final two seasons because they deviated so significantly from what the show was about in the first place. Any long-running show runs the risk of veering too far off course, but Shameless had little to say in its latter seasons. The series was primarily held together by its incredible ensemble, who got pitiful material that was a 180 from what they would have gotten in the earlier seasons. (Paul Sarkis/SHOWTIME) Shameless Season 11 ended without closure for any of the characters. The consensus was that the creatives wanted us viewers to believe that life goes on for the Gallaghers and their friends. As someone who watched it for a decade, I think it was more of a slap in the face because Showtime promoted the series’ ending like crazy and implied that the stories for the characters would come full circle. Shameless Ran Out of Gas Long Before Its Finale It was evident that the creatives felt there was still life in the show and weren’t writing it like it was the end, perhaps holding out for a revival down the line. Showtime has released new iterations of its legacy series, including Dexter and The L Word, which suggests that another show set in the Shameless universe is likely. (Paul Sarkis/SHOWTIME.) Given the series’s success on streaming, it’s clear there is still an audience for the show, but what could a new entry realistically cover that the original didn’t? The series finale also killed Frank Gallagher (William H. Macy). There’s a case for watching how the family would react in his absence. But when you think about how absent he’s been in their lives throughout the years, there isn’t much to be mined from that. Frank should have been written out far earlier because, by the end, the character was going in the same circles, and there was nothing compelling for him to do. (Paul Sarkis/SHOWTIME) Then there’s the cast. Many of them, such as Emmy and Jeremy Allen White, probably wouldn’t be interested in an encore. Since her departure, Emmy has moved on, while Jeremy is receiving critical acclaim for his work on The Bear. The Cast Remains In Demand Then there’s Shanola Hampton, currently headlining NBC’s addictive drama Found. The cast of Shameless was outstanding, but I’m enjoying watching them spread their wings elsewhere. Many TV shows have come back and excelled with reboots, but Shameless doesn’t strike me as a show that should be considered for a spinoff. (Paul Sarkis/SHOWTIME) If a reboot featuring an entirely new cast of characters in a different location were possible, I’d be moderately intrigued.
