  "text": "Don’t wait up, Wongers. Madisynn King wants to party with Eve Tessmacher, in what could be the most awaited Marvel/DC crossover since Deadpool/Batman #1. WHO IS EVE TESSMACHER? Coming out of the first wave of showings for James Gunn’s Superman movie, many were abuzz about Sara Sampaio as Eve Tessmacher. Supervillain Lex Luthor’s superfashionable girlfriend is seen forever snapping selfies, and allegedly has “mutant toes” (per Jimmy Olsen’s Caller ID for her) that “look like someone spilled shrimp cocktail on the floor.” Without spoiling much of anything, Eve ends up playing an important role in the scheme of things that belies her daffy persona. A fun-loving, borderline-annoying and ultimately scene-stealing young woman in a comic book-based property? It’s no small wonder that there has been a call on social media for DC Studios co-CEO Gunn and his Marvel counterpart Kevin Feige to make happen a crossover between Superman’s Eve and She-Hulk: Attorney at Law‘s resident party girl, Madisynn King. WHO IS MADISYNN KING? Played by Patti Guggenheim, Madisynn was introduced as a slightly tipsy volunteer assistant to stage magician Donny Blaze, and later appeared in court to testify against him — after she had gotten sucked into an inter-dimensional hellscape and made a blood pact with a talking goat/demon named Jake. Madisynn, who, yes, spells her name with two Ns and one Y (though it’s not where you thiiiiink), wound up forming a sweet connection with Mystic Arts master Wong (MCU vet Benedict Wong), and last was seen accidentally spoiling The Sopranos for him during a cozy binge-watch at Kamar-Taj. (Since then, Madisynn was “heard” but not seen in a panel from the comic book What If… Venom? #3.) Guggenheim recently got wind of the wish for a Madisynn-Tess team up, and promptly shared her endorsement on Threads: “Honestly, in. Love her.” Interestingly, Guggenheim’s Madisynn almost crossed over with Agatha Harkness and her coven, but Agatha All Along head writer Jac Schaeffer just couldn’t make it work. “I really wanted to include Madisynn because I think she’s so deeply funny, and she talked about Jake the goat,” Schaeffer recalled in a November House of R podcast. “We were all banging our heads against the wall trying to figure out, ‘How do we make the goat our literal and figurative gateway to getting Madisynn on the [Witches] Road?’ and it just didn’t work. It was shoe-horning, and I had to let that go.” Superman cast member Sampaio’s previous acting credits include an episode of Showtime’s Billions, while Guggenheim since She-Hulk‘s one-and-done run has guested on shows such as Matlock (in Season 1’s two-part finale), The Spiderwick Chronicles and the upcoming second season of Peacock’s Twisted Metal.
