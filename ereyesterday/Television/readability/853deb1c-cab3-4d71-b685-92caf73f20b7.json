  "text": "If you want to see some Handmaid’s Tale costumes and props up close without actually going Under His Eye, The Paley Center for Media in New York City has you covered. The museum is currently hosting an exhibit titled “The Legacy of The Handmaid’s Tale: June’s Evolution from Handmaid to Rebel.” The curated collection features clothes worn, and props used, by actors in all six seasons of Hulu‘s dystopian drama. June’s red cloak and white, winged bonnet. Aunt Lydia’s severe brown uniform. Commander Lawrence’s scarf — all are on display, alongside props like Commander Waterford’s Scrabble board and June’s map of Boston. “This is a show that, when it debuted in 2017, immediately there was this excitement about it,” says Paley curator Jason Lynch. “And that has really continued for every season of the show. I think that’s what’s so fascinating about it. It’s also one of the rare shows that has kind of broken through the pop culture discourse into the political discourse.” As longtime Handmaid’s fans know, the series is currently in its sixth and final season. Costumes from these last few episodes are part of the exhibit, as well: Janine’s Jezebel’s outfit, complete with scarlet eyepatch, is one of the first dresses visitors see. “This is a great way to celebrate this last season of the show, but also look back on all seasons,” Lynch adds. “The Legacy of The Handmaid’s Tale runs through Sunday, June 8, at The Paley Museum, 25 W. 52nd St., New York City.",
