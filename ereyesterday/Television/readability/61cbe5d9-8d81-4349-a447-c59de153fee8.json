  "text": "“She’s alive!” Mark S. announced that to a congregation of “outie” Mark Scout’s family and friends, as Severance Season 1 came to an abrupt end. Alas, he may come to regret his economy of words. In the acclaimed Apple TV+ drama’s freshman finale, which was released way, way back in April 2022, Lumon wonks Mark S., Helly R., Irving B. and Dylan G. came to realize that by sneakily seizing access to the Overtime Contingency Protocol, they could insert themselves in their “outie” lives. It fell on Dylan to semi-gymnastically keep the OCP switch literally flipped in the security room, while his coworkers took stock of their outside existences. We learned that Helly’s Helena Eagan is the daughter of Lumon CEO Jame Eagan, and had undergone severance as a demonstration of support for the controversial procedure. Irving Bailiff pored over his (suspicious) stacks of intel on Lumon employees to find out where workplace soulmate Burt lived — with another man. And Mark S. was dealt two whammies — that boss lady Harmon Cobel is Mark Scout’s neighbor, Mrs. Selvig, and that Lumon wellness counselor Miss Casey is Mark’s “dead” wife Gemma! That was the news Mark S. bellowed at the close of Season 1, but as portrayer Adam Scott and executive producer Ben Stiller note in the TVLine video above, “She’s alive!” will be met with some confusion by Mark Scout’s sister and friends. Severance Season 2: Everything We Know Ahead of Mark S.’ declaration, Ms. Cobel — having realized that the OCP had been triggered — called colleague Mr. Milchick and ordered him to race to the security room, while she herself sped to Lumon to stop Helly R. from spilling ugly severance secrets to a room full of gala guests. In the video above, Patricia Arquette previews just how successful (or not) Cobel was in that regard, and how severe the blowback will be. As for Irving showing up on Burt’s doorstep just ahead of the OCP being shut off, Christopher Walken in the video above confirms that a perhaps-unexpected amount of the retired O\u0026D chief will be seen in Season 2, despite Irving B. being cut off anew from his outside life. At the 2:30 mark, Severance creator Dan Erickson talks about the decision to open Season 2 with a pair of uniquely structured episodes that respectively pull us back into the MRD team’s “innie” and “outie” lives, all of which undoubtedly are changed by the 39-minute duration of their season-ending “awakening.” Lastly, Britt Lower (who plays Helly R./Helena) talks about the “fun part” of “unpacking” Severance mysteries, after which castmate John Turturro gave us a firm warning about spilling any spoilers from the first six episodes (of Season 2’s 10) made available to press.
