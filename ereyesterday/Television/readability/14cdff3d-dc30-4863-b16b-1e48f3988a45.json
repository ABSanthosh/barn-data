  "text": "NFL great Aaron Rodgers is opening up about his life, on the field and off, in a new Netflix documentary. The streamer has released a trailer for Aaron Rodgers: Enigma, premiering Tuesday, Dec. 17, with the New York Jets quarterback chronicling his return to football after suffering a devastating injury last season. We see Rodgers experiencing a sound bath and other spiritual remedies as the 41-year-old explains, “I’m trying to beat back Father Time, and the expectations.” He undergoes a grueling rehab to get back on the field as the sports media voices serious doubts about his ability to play again. But the documentary also takes a hard look at Rodgers’ controversial views on vaccines and other issues, which he admits led to “losing friendships, family… It was heartbreaking.” We see him share a friendly exchange with famed anti-vaccination advocate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who asks Rodgers, “Have you thought about going into politics?” As Rodgers goes deeper into alternative treatments, he shares that “once I started in my spiritual journey, everything shifted… The metamorphosis is happening.” Rodgers gets emotional, too, and makes it clear that he’s already thinking about what’s next for him after his playing days are over: “When that ride comes to a stop, who are you gonna be?” Press PLAY above to get a sneak peek at Aaron Rodgers: Enigma, and then tell us in the comments: Will you be watching?",
