  "text": "Warning: This post contains spoilers for Thursday’s And Just Like That. Seema’s trip to the bank this week on And Just Like That… may have given Sex and the City fans a serious case of déjà vu. In Thursday’s episode, Seema went to the bank to apply for a business loan so she can start her own real estate firm, and she found a sympathetic ear in a loan officer named Linda, who related to Seema’s struggles with male bosses. And if Linda seemed familiar, she is: Linda, played by Stephanie Cannon, is the same banker Carrie asked for a loan on Sex and the City! In the Season 4 SATC episode “Ring a Ding Ding,” which aired in 2002, Carrie’s apartment building was going co-op, and she went to the bank to apply for a loan to buy it, but Linda the loan officer cast a skeptical eye on her meager finances. (We’ll never forget Linda telling Carrie she’s “not a desirable candidate for a loan.”) Carrie shouldn’t feel too bad, though: Seema didn’t get the loan, either. Yes, the return of Linda was a conscious callback to Sex and the City, executive producer Julie Rottenberg tells TVLine: “We were like, ‘We’ve gotta get Stephanie Cannon back.’ She lives in L.A. doing something else, but she flew in, and she’s our banker.” The casting is “a little Easter egg for people who are paying attention,” Rottenberg adds. And Just Like That’s showrunner Michael Patrick King, a Sex and the City veteran himself, “goes way back with” Cannon, EP Elisa Zuritsky notes, “and he loves nothing more than to pull something like that back.” That’s not all, either: “There will be other Easter eggs like that” later this season, Zuritsky teases. So keep your eyes peeled! Did you spot that Sex and the City Easter egg? Let us know in the comments.",
