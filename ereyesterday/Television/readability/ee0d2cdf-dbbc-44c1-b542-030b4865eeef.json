  "text": "It’s been five years since the last One Chicago crossover, so Chicago Fire, Chicago Med, and Chicago PD are pulling out all the stops to craft a disaster that will have ripple effects on all three shows for the foreseeable future.  It’s always interesting when these worlds collide, but it’s poised to be a very different event this go-around because there’s been so much cast turnover on each show since their last crossover.  The sad part about the event is that we’re convinced we may lose several characters because that’s one way to make these episodes more memorable.  (NBC/Screenshot) In a newly released trailer, Chicago Fire’s Stella Kidd and Chicago PD’s Adam Ruzek are trapped underground in a train following a gas explosion.  Despite having some experience in saving lives, they’re battling against time as air is running out, meaning that several civilians’ lives rest in their very hands.  Will they be able to work together to keep people alive and morale up until the emergency services above can reach them?  Killing Off Stella Kidd Would Be A Big Blunder It will be the ultimate test, for sure, but Stella’s career has been building up to this very moment, and we’re convinced that she’ll gel with the calm and collected Adam.  The hope is that they emerge victoriously and successfully save everyone, but there’s no telling what hurdles will be thrown in their way.  A lot can happen in three episodes. The interesting part will be how their spouses react to the news that they are trapped below the ground amid a slew of explosions.  We see Severide springing into action after learning the news. Still, we know he can’t resist putting himself in harm’s way, so we fully expect him to get caught up in many precarious situations during the event.  Severide would struggle to lose Stella, and given how far they’ve come together, it would be cruel to throw in such a development for the sake of the drama.  Then there’s Platt, who collapses, and things get even worse when she arrives at the hospital. Platt has been such a constant on Chicago PD that her loss would be felt across the rest of the series.  (NBC/Screenshot) She’s always been present to offer her unfiltered two cents on any situation and has been with the show since the beginning, so we can’t imagine it going on without her.  We highly doubt the trailer will confirm any of the fatalities.  The more likely scenario is that the show will take a different direction from what has been revealed because those crafty editors like keeping viewers on their toes.  How Does The Disaster Begin? (NBC/Screenshot) The official synopsis teases that the gas explosion rocks a high-rise and that hundreds of people are in mortal danger.  “It’s the calamity beneath the surface, however, that sends our heroes on a race to save 40 people trapped deep underground, including two of their own,” the ominous tease concludes.  We can only tune in to find out what’s coming because NBC hasn’t released any photos for the crossover.  Typically, we have a wealth of photos for episodes before now, but there’s an air of secrecy, which leads us to believe big series-changing swings are on the horizon.  (NBC/Screenshot) NBC has switched up the order of the shows for the crossover event, with Chicago Fire kicking things off at 8/7c, followed by Chicago Med and Chicago PD. What do you think will happen during the big meet-up? Should we prepare for the worst for some characters? Hit the comments with your theories!",
