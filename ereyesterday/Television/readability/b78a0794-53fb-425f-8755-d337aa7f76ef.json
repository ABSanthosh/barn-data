  "text": "This season of Sweet Magnolias focused a lot on Maddie Townsend (Joanna Garcia Swisher). Maddie and Cal had a Halloween-themed wedding and then dealt with her ex-husband’s death shortly after. Through it all, the Townsend-Maddox family dealt with it together. This was also the first season the series explored more career options for Maddie. Therefore, we were eager to chat with Joanna Garcia Swisher since she teased that this was her favorite season. As always, it was enjoyable talking to her as she talked about her love of Sweet Magnolias Season 4 and her pride in her TV children. (Courtesy of Netflix) She loved how they approached Bill’s death and the epic storylines that came from that. Check out the interview below. Hi, Joanna. It’s great to see you again. So, Sweet Magnolias Season 4 felt like Maddie’s season. You teased it was your favorite earlier. What did you love most about it? Oh, it is nonstop. It’s like a roller coaster ride. So much happens from every end of the spectrum. It’s extraordinary. It’s a fun season.  It is, indeed. Fans waited a long time for a Cal and Maddie wedding. Tell me what you thought about filming that Halloween-centric event. It was fun. It was a remarkable entry into it, and it was super celebratory. I was worried about how much trouble Maddie would face with Helen and Dana Sue. So, I had that little bit of fear of thinking they were going to kill me. (Courtesy of Netflix) But I thought it was romantic, lovely, and a cherry on top for Maddie and Cal. Do you and Justin Bruening like Halloween? I like Halloween for my kids. I don’t usually dress up, but it was fun for everyone to dress up in different characters. Everybody would walk out at various times out of their hair and makeup trailer, and they were feeling it. It was like they were embodying it, and everyone looked fantastic. So, if I had someone to prepare me for Halloween and show me how our hair, makeup, and wardrobe department got us ready for the Halloween episode, I would always dress up like that. But it was like Halloween 2.0. It was an extra entertaining Halloween.  It was so much fun — especially the dancing scenes. Yes, those were the best. Do you think the series realistically depicted a blended family? I liked some of those scenes throughout the series. (Courtesy of Netflix) I don’t know if there is any realistic way to blend a family. I think it’s always a dance. The beauty is that it’s unexpected, and you must make it your own. Everybody’s story is different, and all the circumstances and things constantly change. Part of what I love so much about it and why I think it works so well is that it’s honest. It’s rapid-fire, real-life happening at all times, so all the dynamics work that way. But I’m proud of how we navigate our blended family on Sweet Magnolias. Yes. What were some of your favorite family moments from this season? Maddie saw tremendous growth in her kids this season, which was exceptional. I had individual moments with each of them that gave me great pride, but they were also heart-wrenching. Part of what made Bill’s death so difficult for me, portraying the character, was thinking about what this was going to do to my kids and watching them navigate that. Many of those moments were really about being in awe of my children and the people they were growing into. (Courtesy of Netflix) I noticed that you had more moments with all the kids this season. Usually, you have a lot with Ty. Yeah, it was lovely. They’re getting older, so a lot is happening in their world, and more parenting is happening right now. Absolutely. Were you surprised that they killed off Bill and then revealed that he was Isaac’s birth father nearly at the same time? It didn’t surprise me because Maddie knew that Bill was Isaac’s father. What probably doesn’t surprise Maddie is that things will always come out most absurdly, as they always do in Serenity. There’s always a lot of drama attached to that. I was surprised that he was gone, but I also thought that it worked for the journey of everyone’s relationship with Bill, how he betrayed them, and how he navigated the fallout of all of that. Ultimately, you see that he genuinely tried to change his life. (Netflix/ Screenshot) The family experienced a lot of closure with his death because he was gone. But, it lent itself to good storytelling and an opportunity for everyone to explore that closure and come to terms with that and their relationships with him. I was sorry he died, but I enjoyed the epic storytelling that resulted from it. I’ve always liked Chris Klein, so I missed seeing him. I felt the same way. He’s a wonderful person. But the stories were great. I also liked how Sweet Magnolias Season 4 focused on conquering everybody’s dreams. Yes. It sets them up for the future. People realized and became aware of their dreams, so fully formed thoughts were happening. I think the future is bright with watching them come true. Absolutely. We see you have more of a career as both a writer and a publicist this season. Yeah. How did it feel to be Serenity’s spokesperson? It was organic. It happened naturally for Maddie. That’s the beauty of it. It was something that she had not connected with necessarily, but it came naturally to her. So, when she had the opportunity, she kicked into gear. (Netflix/ Screenshot) A lot of Maddie’s journeys have been about surprising herself. She thought her life would be certain, and she was good at ensuring all that happened. But then life blew up, and it was about navigating the ups and downs and the roller coaster of all of that. Watching her gain confidence within all of that has been gratifying. Absolutely. I enjoyed seeing everybody fight for the town of Serenity when it was in financial trouble and during the storm. They banded together. It’s about community and pride in their town. Do you think Maddie’s new job will affect the Magnolia’s friendship? In terms of proximity and geography, that might be the new normal. They’ll still stay close and connected, and they’ll always be family. That will also lend itself to some great storytelling. But it’s going to be beautiful. (Courtesy of Netflix) Do we think we’re going to see this? Do you think there will be a fifth season? I would love to do a fifth season of the show, and I think that, given the opportunity, everybody would agree. A lot of thought has gone into it, and it would be another great season. So, you believe there are still more stories to tell? The journey isn’t over? The journey is not over. Hallelujah. That’s what I want to hear. I’m still in love with Serenity and all of you and all the stories. I feel the same way. So, I’m right there with you. I want it as much as everybody else does. The friendship between the Magnolias will always be my favorite part of the series. I love watching the three of you. Me too. They’re my favorite scenes. We have so much fun together. The margarita nights are big scenes, so they’re always a lot of work, but being with Brooke Elliot and Heather Headley fills my cup. So, we do many scenes together, but those are just ours. (Courtesy of Netflix) The vibe is so fun, and we love being on set. Those days are enjoyable, and we have a lot of laughs. A lot goes on to the cutting room floor, but it’s fun. What would you like to see for Maddie if there is a fifth season? Anytime I imagine it, I get told an idea and think, “I never even thought about that. That’s so good.” You can always guarantee that there will be continued growth and those realizations checking back in. I don’t think she’ll ever entirely lose her way again. If she does stumble in the direction of the unknown, you’ll see her recalibrate, and that comes with all of the trauma she’s experienced. I do not doubt that there will be curveballs and things to dodge and navigate in the future here. But I take great pride and joy in watching how she does it. It’s fun. (Courtesy of Netflix) If she takes the job, I hope she’ll return to Serenity so we can see everything. I don’t think these bonds can be broken, so I imagine you will get your fill of Helen, Dana Sue, and Maddie on the same screen. That’s a relief. I can see why this season was your favorite. I wasn’t kidding. I’ve been teasing that since we were shooting it for a year. I said this is the best season yet. But what a joy it is that we can be this far in, and I could still be enjoying it this much and saying that. Sweet Magnolias Season 4 is streaming on Netflix. Stay tuned for more exclusive interviews with Heather Headley, Dion Johnstone, and Anneliese Judge. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Watch Sweet Magnolias Online",
