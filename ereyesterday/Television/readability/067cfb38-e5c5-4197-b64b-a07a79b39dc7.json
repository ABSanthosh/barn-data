Episodes will then stream next day on Hallmark+. Watch a sneak peek below, then read on for more: Season 1 of Mistletoe Murders — in which Drew plays a Christmas shop owner who uses “unique talents from her past life” to solve murders, and Mooney’s Detective Sam Wilner helps her out — will make its linear debut on Hallmark Channel ahead of Season 2.  In other recently announced scheduling news: * Demascus — the sci-fi comedy that got axed by AMC in January 2023 before it ever saw the light of day — has been “saved” by Tubi, to premiere Thursday, Aug. 7. Created by Tearrance Arvelle Chisholm (Boomerang), the series follows the title character (Station 19 vet Okieriete Onaodowan) on his “mission of self-discovery, and the burgeoning field of digital psychiatry that might be the key to defining his truest self.” The cast also includes Janet Hubert (The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air), Caleb Eberhardt (Judas and the Black Messiah), Shakira Ja’nai Paye (Single Drunk Female, black-ish) and Martin Lawrence (in a recurring role).  * Alice in Borderland Season 3 hits Netflix Thursday, Sept. 25.
