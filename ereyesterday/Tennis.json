    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/zverev-bellucci-shanghai-2024-saturday",
    "description": "Alexander Zverev is back to winning ways in Shanghai. The German registered a comfortable 6-4, 6-2 victory over Italian qualifier Mattia Bellucci at the Rolex Shanghai Masters in the pair’s first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting to advance to the third round on Saturday. He was the last of the Top 4 seeds in action on Stadium Court, wrapping up the star-studded lineup after Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, and Novak Djokovic also won their opening matches. After withdrawing from the China Open due to pneumonia last week, the 27-year-old won his first match in Shanghai since 2019 in one hour and 36 minutes. In 2023, he lost to Roman Safiullin in straight sets in the opening match. \"I didn’t practise, I didn’t do anything really. So, of course, I am happy with the level,\" Zverev said, admitting there was uncertainty leading up to the tournament due to illness. [ATP APP] Competing in his first match since the Laver Cup in September, Zverev showed some signs of rust early on and made 12 unforced errors in the first set. Bellucci, playing his maiden Masters 1000 event, gave the German a good fight by saving six of seven break points. Eventually, Zverev’s experience prevailed as he broke the spirited lefty in the seventh game to take the lead. As the match progressed, the 22-time tour-level titlist found his groove and made only two unforced errors in the second set. Zverev broke the Italian twice and surrendered only two points on serve in the set. Overall, he made 71 per cent of his first serves and won 83 per cent of his first-serve points. With the win, he improved to 24-0 against left-handers since 2023 Roland Garros. \"He is actually a very good player. He surprised me a lot for his size. His serve is incredible. He gets quite a lot of speed on that, and from [the] baseline he is very, very aggressive,\" the German said about Bellucci. “All in all, he is a very talented player, and I think he is going to get up the rankings quite quickly now, and we’ll be seeing him on these kinds of courts more regularly.” The victory marked Zverev’s 58th win (58-18) this season according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He sits behind World No. 1 Sinner, who beat Taro Daniel earlier in the day, leading the tour with 60 wins. Chasing his first title in Shanghai after making the final in 2019, Zverev won the ATP Masters 1000 event in Rome and reached the final at Roland Garros and Hamburg earlier this year. The No. 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings will face either Jordan Thompson or Tallon Griekspoor in the third round. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/djokovic-michelsen-shanghai-2024-saturday",
    "description": "Novak Djokovic began his quest for a 100th title Saturday after overcoming a sluggish start to defeat Alex Michelsen 7-6(3), 7-6(9) in a pulsating second-round clash at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Returning to China's business and finance hub for the first time in five years, and playing just his second match since the US Open, 37-year-old Djokovic was thoroughly tested by the #NextGenATP American, who held two set points in the deciding tie-break. \"It was the first match against Alex and I also hadn't played in a while, so it took me a little time to get the rust off,” said Djokovic, who boasts a record 35 match wins in Shanghai. “He started off terrifically; big serves and an aggressive style of tennis... he's not afraid to step it up and take it to his opponent. \"It was a very close encounter and I thought a high level of tennis in both sets. I'm just glad to keep calm when it mattered in the second-set tie-break.” [ATP APP] Still wearing a protective sleeve over his right knee, on which he had meniscus surgery, Djokovic will next play the winner of 28th-seeded Flavio Cobolli or longtime rival Stan Wawrinka. Djokovic won just four points in the first three games against the #NextGenATP American, who raced to a 4-1 lead in the pair’s first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash. Putting 16 of his first 18 first serves into play and frequently moving to net, a confident Michelsen played with aggressive intent and appeared comfortable in baseline exchanges with the four-time Shanghai champion. But when the 20-year-old struggled to put his first serve into play in the seventh game, Djokovic broke back and ultimately took the set when he won his 11th tie-break from 15 played this season. Like Michelsen in the opener, Djokovic led 4-1 in the second only to allow his opponent back onto even terms at 4-all. But the Serbian held his nerve in the decisive tie-break after saving set points at 7/8 and 8/9 to close out the win after one hour and 55 minutes. \"I was 4-1 up, 15/40 and he hit the let-cord that went over. It could easily have been 6-1 for me in the second,” Djokovic said. “But at this level, things can change very quickly. \"I'm glad to really be challenged by a young player and I'm looking forward to the next one.\" In a high-quality match, Djokovic hit 34 winners to 23 unforced errors, with Michelsen notching 30 winners to 19 unforced errors according to Infosys ATP Stats. Novak Djokovic, you have got to be kidding 🤯@DjokerNole | @SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/u2mJE0RrUY — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 5, 2024 Djokovic is the only player in history (since 1990) to win all nine ATP Masters 1000 titles, a feat he has achieved twice en route to his record haul of 40 titles at this level. He is yet to reach a final in the series this year. Djokovic last year won Masters 1000 titles in Cincinnati and Paris, and collected a record eighth Nitto ATP Finals crown. But in 2024 he has won just one title, the Paris Olympics, as his semmingly inevitable march towards 100 career titles has been delayed. Improving to 33-8 on the season, Djokovic was playing just his second match since a third-round loss to Alexei Popyrin at the US Open. The victory saw Djokovic overtake the injured Alex de Minaur in eighth place in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin and move inside the cut for the Nitto ATP Finals (10-17 November). Michelsen, who is third in the PIF ATP Live Race to Jeddah, is at a career-high ranking of 43 after last week reaching the Tokyo quarter-finals, where he upset Stefanos Tsitsipas in the first round after qualifying.     [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Three days after beating Jannik Sinner in a three-set epic to claim the Beijing title, Carlos Alcaraz picked up where he left off Saturday at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. The Spaniard earned his 10th consecutive win with a 6-2, 6-2 result against Chinese #NextGenATP star Shang Juncheng. \"I'm not used to playing against players younger than me,\" said the 21-year-old Alcaraz, two years Shang's elder. \"He has been playing good tennis lately, lifting his first ATP [title in Chengdu], so I'm pretty sure he's going to climb the rankings. I'm just happy to to be able to win these kinds of matches. \"At the net he told me that it's a pleasure share the court with you. So these kinds of things that I hear from [younger players], it's great.\" [ATP APP] Always eager to put on a show, Alcaraz drew gasps from the Shanghai crowd on the third point of the match when he followed a daring net approach with great anticipation and soft hands to bring up 0-40 in the opening game. The Spaniard won the first nine points on the stadium court and never looked back, winning four of seven break points and all seven of his net points, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Welcome to the @carlosalcaraz show 🤩@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/PZtEpXoPPX — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 5, 2024 The moment of the match came early in set two, when a backtracking Alcaraz pulled off a backward flick to rescue a point. Alcaraz escaped to win that lengthy exchange, then wriggled out of trouble on the scoreboard by saving his lone break point to lead 3-1. As he closed in on the victory, a booming return drew a laugh from the overmatched Shang, who was bidding to become the first Chinese man to beat a Top 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. Alcaraz will meet another Chinese star in the Shanghai third round, when he opens his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Wu Yibing. The third seed has not lost since his shock second-round defeat to Botic van de Zandschulp at the US Open. Having played just three matches on the North American hard-court swing across Cincinnati and New York, the Spaniard said he is feeling fresh for the home stretch of the ATP Tour season. #NextGen ATP Czech Jakub Mensik improved to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Andrey Rublev when he upset the sixth seed 6-7(7), 6-4, 6-3. Repeating his victory over Rublev in Doha earlier this year, Mensik was strong on return, winning 64 per cent of second-serve return points and earning 19 break points, converting seven. Mensik is fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race to Jeddah and likely to make his debut at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in Saudi Arabia from 18-22 December.   [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Can Andrey Rublev qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the fifth consecutive year? The 26-year-old is well positioned to do so and after Casper Ruud was upset Friday at the Rolex Shanghai Masters, Rublev has a chance this fortnight to improve upon his current seventh position in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Ruud leads Rublev by just 225 points. Should Rublev reach his fourth ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final of the season, he would be within striking distance of passing sixth-placed Ruud. But Rublev will need a semi-final run in Shanghai to leapfrog the Norwegian. [ATP APP] PIF ATP Live Race To Turin (as of 4 October)  Player  Points  1) Jannik Sinner*  9,340  2) Carlos Alcaraz*  6,520  3) Alexander Zverev*  6,125  4) Daniil Medvedev  4,670  5) Taylor Fritz  3,900  6) Casper Ruud  3,805  7) Andrey Rublev  3,580  8) Alex de Minaur  3,305 *Sinner, Alcaraz and Zverev have secured qualification. Daniil Medvedev is aiming to become the next player to secure qualification for the season finale. The 28-year-old is fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin while the three players ahead of him have already qualified: Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev. US Open finalist Taylor Fritz is well placed to earn his spot at the Nitto ATP Finals for the first time. The American, sixth in the Race, played the event in 2022 as an alternate. Alex de Minaur is not competing in Shanghai, providing a path for Novak Djokovic to slide up to eighth should the Serbian win his opening match at the ATP Masters 1000 event. Grigor Dimitrov is enjoying a resurgent year that has placed him 10th in the Race. The Bulgarian won the 2017 Nitto ATP Finals with a 5-0 record, but has not been back to the eight-player event since. To start 2024, Dimitrov won his first title (Brisbane) since that Nitto ATP Finals stunner. He also reached the Miami final. American Tommy Paul has an opportunity to qualify for Turin for the first time. The 11th-placed Paul has earned two titles this season (Dallas, Queen's Club). With only two ATP Masters 1000 tournaments remaining this year, Stefanos Tsitsipas will look to make ground starting in Shanghai, where he beat former No. 4 Kei Nishikori on Friday. The Greek, 12th in the Race, is seeking to qualify for Turin for the sixth consecutive year. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "title": "Sinner: I wake up in the morning trying to understand how to beat Alcaraz",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-shanghai-2024-preview",
    "description": "Many tennis players dream of reaching the top of the PIF ATP Rankings, envisioning ‘World No. 1’ next to their name. They wake up and train countless hours, chasing the opportunity to become the best in the sport. For Jannik Sinner, that dream has become a reality this season, but the Italian believes there’s still room for growth. The 23-year-old has been the most dominant player in 2024, having won six tour-level titles and 59 matches. But Sinner has a barometer for further improvement. He has lost three consecutive matches against Carlos Alcaraz, who leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 6-4. The top seed at this week’s Rolex Shanghai Masters, Sinner is finding motivation from his rivalry with the Spaniard. “I feel like — at least talking from my side — he pushes me to do better. I wake up in the morning trying to understand what I can do better trying to beat him next time, which is something nice for me as a player,” Sinner told ATP Media. “It’s nice that we are rivals on the court and then friends off the court.” Sinner’s rivalry with Alcaraz has rapidly blossomed into one of the most gripping matchups in recent memory. Anytime they meet, it is almost a guarantee for exciting shotmaking and a display of world-class court coverage. Such was the case in Wednesday’s China Open final, which Alcaraz narrowly won in a third-set tie-break. The back-and-forth contest thrilled Beijing fans for three hours and 21 minutes. Could a rematch happen in Shanghai? Sinner and Alcaraz are seeded to meet in the semi-finals. Even in the midst of a fierce on-court rivalry, the two remain close friends. “I feel like off the court we are quite similar because we are surround ourself with our close ones, we like to stay with the team. There are many, many similar things. On the court, we are different,” Sinner said. “He is the one who brings the firepower, the hot shots, he involves the crowd. He’s a bit different. I am more like the solid player, quite calm, so it’s like fire and ice a bit. But it’s a nice combination. “It also shows that everyone is different. I believe that I have to take something from him as a player, trying some different shots sometimes, which I feel like makes me grow as a player.”[ATP APP] Making his second appearance in Shanghai, Sinner will look to improve upon his fourth-round run last year. A lot has changed for the 16-time tour-level titlist in the past 12 months. Not only has he become World No. 1, Sinner has also claimed two ATP Masters 1000 titles (Miami, Cincinnati) and as many major trophies (Australian Open, US Open). “The confidence level is in a different moment now. I feel like when I go on court, I feel more safe on the court,” Sinner said. “Playing on a centre court now, let’s say, it’s normal. Before, it was still something new and this, ‘Wow’ effect when you go out. Now, it’s still amazing, but I enjoy it more. It’s a place where I feel very, very safe.” Sinner is aiming to become the first player to win three ATP Masters 1000 titles in one season since Rafael Nadal in 2018. Should he lift his fourth ATP Masters 1000 crown, Sinner would join Novak Djokovic (2015) as the only player to win Shanghai while holding World No. 1 honours. “I am at a good level now, but we will always try and aim for something more,” said Sinner, who faces Taro Daniel in the opening round.[NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Daniil Medvedev was in no mood for a second upset loss to Thiago Seyboth Wild at the Rolex Shanghai Masters Friday. Down a break in the first and second sets, the former World No. 1 dug in at the baseline and allowed the flashy Brazlilian to author his own demise with 40 unforced errors to Medvedev’s 23, according to Infosys ATP Stats, in the 7-5, 7-5 result. [ATP APP] Last year, Seyboth Wild stunned Medvedev in the first round of Roland Garros, when his high risk/high reward strategy of 69 winners and 77 unforced errors underpinned his victory. \"I'm happy I managed to stay composed in tough moments. He had a break in both sets. I managed to put on a lot of pressure and both times it worked at 5-all,” said Medvedev, who is fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin and next in line to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals. \"I love Shanghai and I feel the people love me back. I enjoy it a lot so I want to stay as long as possible here.\" Medvedev next meets 29th-seeded Italian Matteo Arnaldi and is seeded to meet Tsitsipas in the fourth round.   Earlier, Stefanos Tsitsipas collected his 200th hard-court win and avenged a recent loss to Kei Nishikori when he defeated the former US Open finalist 7-6(6), 6-4 to reach the third round. The 26-year-old Greek fell to Nishikori in the second round in Montreal in August but emerged victorious this time around to level his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with the Japanese to 2-2 and improve to 5-0 in Shanghai opening rounds. The Greek saved one set point in the first-set tie-break. Tsitsipas is 12th in the PIF ATP Race to Turin and endeavoring to return to the eight-man Nitto ATP Finals, which he won in 2018. Tsitsipas finds himself outside the Turin cut after costly early exits at the past three Masters 1000s hard-court tournaments; he won just one match across Miami, Montreal and Cincinnati. In the third round, Tsitsipas will play Frenchman Alexandre Muller.Australian qualifier Aleksandar Vukic earned the biggest win of his career in convincing fashion. The 28-year-old upset eighth Casper Ruud 6-4, 6-4 after dropping just six points behind his first serve. Vukic struck the ball confidently in key moments and took an aggressive court position against the Norwegian. Vukic, who next faces 30th seed Tomas Machac, fended off all three break points he faced and closed out both sets by holding to love. Entering Shanghai, Vukic had last four of his past five matches across all levels. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/fearnley-top-100-challenger-2024-feature",
    "description": "When Jacob Fearnley was competing on Court 9 in his first-round match at Wimbledon, he could see the Centre Court score in the corner of his eye. Why did that score matter to Fearnley? Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic was beginning his campaign and the Serbian would become Fearnley’s second-round opponent. “When I was close to winning the match, I kept looking up at the scoreboard and I saw that Djokovic was rolling,” Fearnley told ATPTour.com. “I was like, ‘Okay, I’m definitely going to be playing Novak’.” Then came a couple of sleepless nights. Fearnley, then ranked World No. 277 in the PIF ATP Rankings, would soon stand across the net from one of the sport’s icons on the sacred Wimbledon grass, at his home Slam. Fearnley’s phone began to light up with so many messages that the 23-year-old asked his friend Luke Swan to manage his social media. “My phone was going crazy. I remember I gave my Instagram to Luke because it was too much for me,” Fearnley said. “It was a little bit overwhelming how many messages I was getting. I left my Instagram up to him to reply to some messages. I was really appreciative of everyone who messaged me because I had people message me who I hadn’t talked to in years. It was quite cool to see that side of it.”[ATP APP] Winning a match at Wimbledon and facing Djokovic was an early chapter in the Briton’s monstrous rise since he finished a standout five-year career at Texas Christian University in May. What has happened since has been a whirlwind. Shortly after helping TCU claim its first NCAA team championship in school history, Fearnley was playing in just his second ATP Challenger Tour tournament in Nottingham. He entered the week without a match win at the Challenger level, but he claimed the grass-court title as a qualifier. Fearnley received a wild card into the season’s third major and made his dream debut even sweeter by taking the third set off Djokovic, who eventually won 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 7-5. “When I won the third set, I looked up at my box and I saw my teammates there, my family, and I felt a bit of a buzz in the crowd. That was kind of when it really sunk in that I’d just won a set and that I was playing on Centre Court at Wimbledon,” Fearnley said. “A moment that I’ll remember for the rest of my life for sure.” Photo Credit: Francois Nel/Getty Images Since then, Fearnley has won three ATP Challenger Tour titles: Lincoln, Rennes and last week in Orleans, where he secured his place in the Top 100 of the PIF ATP Rankings. The Edinburgh native has won 15 consecutive matches at the Challenger level. Fearnley’s breakthrough is one of the best Challenger seasons in recent memory and he is having fun in the process. ‘Jake’ and his coach Juan Martin made an agreement that, whenever possible while travelling, they visit a different coffee shop every morning. “We try to find the best coffee. That’s something we’re definitely making an effort to do. I love going to coffee shops, try to find new ones and that’s kind of what I do in my spare time,” said Fearnley, who ranked a coffee shop in Rennes, France as one of his favourites thus far. “It changes the scenery, it gives you something to do in the morning before matches and I think it’s working well so far.” What is undoubtedly working well is Fearnley’s game at the pro level. He has still only played six Challenger tournaments and he has lifted the trophy at four. Highest win percentage in a Challenger season (min. 20 matches played) Player Record Win Percentage Janko Tipsarevic (2017) 20-0 100% Jacob Fearnley (2024) 23-1 95.8% Leander Paes (1999) 20-1 95.2% The four-time ITA All-American reflects on the Wimbledon match against Djokovic as a pivotal point in his season. It was not only a fond memory, but also a teaching moment. Fearnley has since implemented specific tactics in his game based on what he saw from the 99-time tour-level titlist. “That was a very cool experience and I learned a lot how to deal with the fans, deal with playing on a big court and also I learned a lot from Djokovic, the way he plays the game is incredible and he is the model for every tennis player,” Fearnley said. “[I’m] taking things from what he was doing; his serve, his depth, his decision making. All that stuff is stuff that I still talk about today.” Fearnley may have been a relatively unknown player in Wimbledon’s main draw, but ever since, he is putting the tennis world on notice with his fast rise. Last October, Fearnley was World No. 1,893 in the PIF ATP Rankings. He is now at a career-high World No. 98. “In terms of tennis, it’s been the best past 12 months I’ve ever had,” Fearnley said. “It’s been 12 months that I’ve thoroughly enjoyed. I’m super grateful to have the opportunity to play at this level and get to the ranking I’m at now.” British No. 1 Jack Draper, who shares a close friendship with Fearnley, posted a picture on social media to celebrate Jake’s rise into the Top 100. The photo was of Draper and Fearnley as young kids at Wimbledon’s Centre Court. Draper wrote: “A great friend from young, but we went on our own paths. An amazing guy and incredible player. You deserve this!!! Only the beginning.” So happy for Jacob Fearnely…. Top 100 !!! A great friend from young but we went on our own paths. An amazing guy and incredible player. You deserve this !!!

    "title": "ATP's OneVision strategy powers record player compensation surge in 2023",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/record-player-compensation-surge-2023",
    "description": "The ATP has confirmed record player compensation for the 2023 season, following the completion of the ATP Masters 1000 profit-sharing calculation, a key element of its OneVision strategic plan. A total of $241.6 million was distributed to players across the ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour through On-Site Prize Money, Performance Bonus Pools, and Player Retirement Plan contributions. An additional $104.5 million in Grand Slam men’s prize money brought total men’s compensation to an unprecedented $346.2 million for the year. ATP-associated events accounted for 70 per cent of overall men’s player compensation, with 30 per cent coming from the Grand Slams. The ATP Masters 1000 events, in particular, saw substantial increases under OneVision reforms. On-Site Prize Money at ATP’s top-tier tournaments rose to $70.4 million, up from $55.6 million in 2022, driven by the expansion to 96-player draws at Madrid, Rome and Shanghai (which was not held in 2022 due to the pandemic). The bigger draw sizes provide more money to more players, aligning with ATP’s goal of increasing the number of players who can make a sustainable living from tennis. The Masters 1000 Fixed Bonus Pool, paid out according to performance and participation across the category, rose to $20 million in 2023. Meanwhile, the profit-sharing model, first introduced in 2022, will deliver an additional $6.6 million to players through the Variable Bonus Pool for 2023. The calculation, based on detailed financial audits of all nine Masters 1000 tournaments, ensures that profits generated by the events — above on-site prize money — are shared equally, with 50 per cent allocated to players. Total player compensation across the ATP Masters 1000 events and the Nitto ATP Finals, including Bonus Pools, reached $112 million. Combined with the Grand Slams ($104.5 million), the sport's 14 biggest events delivered $216.5 million in men's player compensation for the year. ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi commented: \"Through OneVision, our goal is clear: to align the interests of players and tournaments, strengthen premium events, enhance the fan experience, and drive long-term growth for the entire sport. We are unlocking new investment and laying the foundation for a true partnership between players and tournaments, sharing equally in tennis's success. “This is just the beginning, and we continue to work with other entities in tennis on a shared vision for the sport's future. We remain committed to advocating for unified governance, fair player representation, and a centralised commercial strategy — all with the aim of providing a better experience for fans.\" [ATP APP] OneVision has also driven unprecedented investments in tournament infrastructure across the Masters 1000 category, highlighted by multi-million-dollar renovation projects in Cincinnati, Madrid, Rome, and Shanghai. In Paris, the Rolex Paris Masters will relocate to La Défense Arena in 2025. Elsewhere, a new $1.3 million Bonus Pool was also introduced for the ATP 500 category, further enhancing player earnings. The ATP 500 tournaments will also undergo full financial audits in 2024 with a view to moving to a profit-sharing formula in future years. On the ATP Challenger Tour, prize money surged 75 per cent, reaching $21.2 million in 2023, alongside a 170 per cent increase in the number of Challenger 100 and 125 events on offer to players.  The ATP Player Retirement Plan distributed approximately $19 million to 165 eligible players in 2023, following a record year in 2022 ($28 million) that was driven in part by the transfer sales of the Madrid and Cincinnati tournaments.  The 2024 player compensation levels will be released in 2025, following a comprehensive financial audit of this year’s nine ATP Masters 1000 events, which will determine the profit-sharing calculation for 2024.

    "description": "Ben Shelton improved to 11-0 in his opening rounds at the ATP Masters 1000s and Grand Slams this season with a strong showing against fellow left hander Denis Shapovalov Friday at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. The 21-year-old American did not face a break point in a 6-3, 7-5 victory that extended his perfect Lexus ATP Head2Head record to 3-0 against the Canadian qualifier. All three of those meetings have come this season, including a five-set win for the 2022 NCAA champion and University of Florida standout in five sets at Wimbledon. Shapovalov changed up his tactics in Shanghai, but he could not change the result. \"I think some of the tendencies and things that I expected, he changed it up today,\" Shelton said, referring to his opponent's serving patterns and directional play from the baseline. \"I was looking for a few things and was surprised by some of the things he did on the court.\" [ATP APP] The American was in control throughout the one-hour, 17-minute match and made it a point to stay even-keeled on the stadium court, forgoing some of the boisterous celebrations fans have grown accustomed to seeing when Shelton puts on a show. \"I'm trying to work on being a little bit more calm and focused on the court,\" explained the No. 17 in the PIF ATP Rankings. \"I think that it's important for my evolution, and in the evolution of my game, that I continue to be able to focus for extended periods of time and and really lock in to play at a higher level for more than one set. I thought I did a great job of that today. I'm happy with the way that I stayed committed to my game style and stayed focused out there.\" Shelton missed out on two break chances at 4-4 in the second set but quickly made amends by breaking for the second time on the day at 5-5, a Shapovalov miss on a serve-and-volley attempt sealing his fate. The American hit 21 winners in the match according to Infosys ATP Stats, mixing in deft touch and nine net approaches to go along with his trademark power plays. He executed two successful drop shots to hold for 5-2 in the opening set, stretching for a tough volley winner to back up the first.   Shelton will next meet 21st seed Arthur Fils or Spain's Roberto Carballes Baena. He could see a Shanghai rematch with Jannik Sinner in the last 16, one year after beating the Italian in a third-set tie-break in what was their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. Solid day at the office 💼@TommyPaul1 moves through to Round 3 in Shanghai, d. Fognini 6-1 6-3.@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/IpnpG7jZJk — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 4, 2024 Tommy Paul also opened his Shanghai campaign with an early Friday win, beating Fabio Fognini 6-1, 6-3 in an hour flat. The result earned Paul his 40th win for the second consecutive season, after he notched 41 in 2023. Eleven of his victories this season have come at the ATP Masters 1000s, highlighted by semi-final runs in Indian Wells and Rome. Other early action saw Alexandre Muller upset 18th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-3, 6-2, while 19th seed Alejandro Tabilo beat Arthur Rinderknech 6-3, 6-2 to set up a meeting with Paul.

Berrettini clipped 33 winners, including 11 aces, according to Infosys ATP Stats, in a 7-6(9), 7-6(6) win over World No. 71 O'Connell to claim his first win of the season at ATP Masters 1000 level. The match lasted two hours and 13 minutes.

I've never played him so didn't know what to expect,\" said Berrettini, who fought off two sets points in the first-set tie-break. \"Mentally it's been tough...

It was great to be here, so much support here, so I'm enjoying my time in China.\" The Swiss hit 13 aces and saved all three break points he faced to advance after one hour and 49 minutes.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/shang-juncheng-next-gen-influences-feature-2024",
    "description": "Shang Juncheng has become one of the breakout stars on the ATP Tour this year. The Chinese lefty won his first ATP Tour title in Chengdu, reached two more tour-level semi-finals and the third round at the US Open and Australian Open. Speaking to ATPTour.com as part of our Next Gen 'My Influences' series, the 19-year-old recalled his memories of playing against Carlos Alcaraz in Melbourne, the support his former-professional athlete parents have had on him, and much more. Which former Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion did you enjoy watching most when growing up? I think definitely Carlos Alcaraz. There were some insane shots and because Next Gen, there are only singles lines and there's no doubles lines and the net is really close, it helps with around-the-net shots. With Carlos, he is one of the quickest players, so I think that helps him a little bit hit the exciting shots. Last year, Hamad Medjedovic was cruising through, very powerful. He was playing very well and just [I enjoy] the tournament and all the players are really fun. Which former Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion do you most identify with? [Hyeon] Chung won the first year and I think he kind of plays like Novak. He said his idol was Novak and he tries to play like him. It is kind of similar to me as well. Try to be flexible on the court, kind of counter-punching. Chung is a lot stronger [than me], but maybe I’m a little bit quicker on the court. I would say he is the most similar to me. [ATP APP] Who out of the former champions is your biggest idol and do you remember your first encounter with them? I played Alcaraz at the Australian Open. Unfortunately, I had to retire after two sets, but that was such a fun experience to play him on Rod Laver and to see someone just two years older than me competing at the highest level. He's one of or the best player in the world at the moment, so that was just really fun. Who have been your other biggest influences? I think my parents. They were both athletes and dad played football. Mom was a professional table tennis player as well, so I think they have some connection to tennis. With sports, they're all kind of related. My dad has been with me every day — in practise, day in, day out, to tournaments since I started playing tennis. We just grew up together as a family and as a team to learn the sport. What have you learned this past year on Tour? I would say I have learnt about time. Time is difficult sometimes. You don't have too much time to think about other things. Sometimes it's just in a few seconds that you have to make a decision. Some decisions are tough. You lose some and then sometimes you win. I think it's just [important] to keep a calm head and have a good attitude towards everything. What sort of attributes do you look for when bringing people into your team? I think first of all, in a team you have to get along. It doesn't matter the ability of the person or how well they work. You need to have a fun environment that everybody is used to. Also maybe the coach, the physio, the fitness coach, they need to like the environment so they can work 100 per cent and be 100 per cent focused. I think it's like a family that you're building. You have to give it a try and sometimes some people you just don't connect [with] too well. For me, it's just connecting and having fun. That is the most important thing.  [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "title": "Why Alcaraz’s personality resonates with Chinese fans",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-shanghai-2024-preview",
    "description": "Carlos Alcaraz may be making only his second appearance at the Rolex Shanghai Masters this week, but the Spaniard has already forged a strong connection with Chinese fans. “They are very passionate. The energy that they bring to me, to the matches, is insane. I like it,” Alcaraz told ATP Media. “I feel like they like when someone tries different shots or the match is becoming crazy in a certain way. It fits pretty well for my style, my personality on the court.” The 21-year-old demonstrated that manner of fearless hitting and exciting shotmaking most recently in China’s capital city Beijing, where Alcaraz won an epic three-set final against rival Jannik Sinner on Wednesday. Fans will be looking ahead to a potential sequel, looming in the Shanghai semi-finals. “I always think that when we play against each other, we put the level to the top. We bring a really high level of tennis,” Alcaraz said of his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Sinner. “I think that’s good for tennis, to bring some fans to tennis who have probably never watched tennis before… “I always try to enjoy playing against Jannik. He pushes me to the limit every time. He makes me be a better player on court and try to find solutions. I think that’s the beauty of tennis.” Alcaraz, who last year fell to Grigor Dimitrov in the Shanghai fourth round, boasts a 48-9 season record, according to the Infosys ATP Stats Win-Loss Index, with four titles: Indian Wells, Roland Garros, Wimbledon and Beijing. After a shocking second-round exit at the US Open, the 16-time tour-level titlist quickly regrouped. Alcaraz is on a nine-match winning streak entering the season’s eighth ATP Masters 1000 event. [ATP APP] “I’m enjoying when I’m playing. I wanted to travel again, play tournaments. I’m excited for what’s next… After [the American hard-court swing], I had my days off and put myself on the [court] again, working hard again for the next tournaments and try to be healthy, to be ready, strong physically, mentally,” Alcaraz said. “I think I did pretty well. The last month has been a really good month for me with my team. When I’m feeling great off the court and travelling, I enjoy playing on court and I can show my best tennis.” Seeded third, Alcaraz faces a tough test in his opening match. The five-time ATP Masters 1000 champion meets home favourite and #NextGenATP Shang Juncheng, who recently won his first tour-level title in Chengdu. The 19-year-old lefty is at a career-high No. 51 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Alcaraz and Shang met in the third round of this year’s Australian Open, but the Chinese teenager was forced to retire due to injury in the third set. Should Alcaraz win the Shanghai title, he would become the youngest champion in tournament history and first Spaniard to lift the trophy. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "title": "Was an umbrella what motivated Butvilas to achieve pro dream?",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/butvilas-challenger-2024-feature",
    "description": "The players were awarded their trophies, one for the champion and one for the runner-up. Then came an additional prize: a big box of juice, reserved for the titlist, and an umbrella for the finalist. For a pair of eight-year-olds, this was a drastic difference. Edas Butvilas was brought to tears when he received the umbrella. It was a punch to the gut while his close friend, Vilius Gaubas, left the Lithuanian city of Palanga with the bigger trophy and coveted juice. Years later, that moment stands out as both Butvilas and Gaubas are now rising #NextGenATP stars who are enjoying promising starts on the ATP Challenger Tour. “I lost the final and I remember exactly. I cried for a long time because I wanted the big box of juice and at that time I didn’t care about the umbrella at all, I gave it away to my parents,” Butvilas told ATPTour.com. “The loss wasn’t that painful, but I saw what he got for the prizes, it was really sad. I still remember it. I talk about it sometimes with Vilius.” Entering the 2024 season, there had only been two Lithuanian winners in Challenger history (since 1978): Ricardas Berankis and Laurynas Grigelis. Butvilas, who won last week’s Charleston Challenger, and Gaubas have each secured their maiden title at that level in the past two months. Gaubas is ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, five spots ahead of Butvilas. They are both aiming for maiden qualification for the 20-and-under Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. For Lithuania, a country with a relatively small imprint in tennis history, the future is bright. “This is one of the best things that can happen, that we dreamed of,” Butvilas said of his rise alongside Gaubas. “We grew up together. We are the same age so we were dreaming together, playing together and now rising up like this, it’s just a dream come true.” Butvilas, who grew up in Klaipeda, began playing tennis aged two alongside his father Tomas, who is a tennis coach. When Butvilas was around age 11, his mother, Dana, began taking him to international tournaments.[ATP APP] “I remember going with my mom in the car and we were driving a lot of kilometres together, just playing many tournaments,” Butvilas said. “Around Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, really close. Poland, sometimes Germany, Austria. Sometimes going to Iceland, I’ve been there two times, I think to play Tennis Europe.” Butvilas grew up idolising Roger Federer and former World No. 50 Berankis, whose 15 Challenger titles leads Lithuanians. “He showed that even from a small country like Lithuania, we can do really good in tennis,” Butvilas said. At age 15, Butvilas moved to Alicante, Spain to begin training at the Club Atlético Montemar. Butvilas met coach Ivan Navarro, who has been travelling with the Lithuanian for roughly two years. Butvilas last week earned a milestone victory when he claimed his maiden ATP Challenger Tour title on the hard courts of Charleston, South Carolina. It was just his ninth outing at the Challenger level. Edas Butvilas triumphs at the Challenger 75 event in Charleston. Credit: LTP Challenger Butvilas, now at a career-high World No. 261 in the PIF ATP Rankings, became the first lucky loser Challenger champion since February 2023. “It is still tough to believe it because I was so close to being out of the tournament,” Butvilas said. “I lost in qualies and I got the lucky-loser spot and then everything went my way. “It was really tough conditions there, so hot and humid. In the second round of qualies, I cramped in the last set and almost threw up. I was feeling really bad. Then I got the lucky-loser spot and I had to play the next day again and I won 7-5 in the third. Mentally, I fought a lot that week.” Still early in his career, Butvilas has already learned an important lesson: the tide will turn in your favour if you remain resilient. “I lost many close matches this year. My coach always told me that tennis can change really fast at any point,” Butvilas said. “I just was thinking, ‘Why not this time?’”Did You Know?Butvilas is a two-time junior Slam doubles champion. He won the 2021 Wimbledon boys' doubles event alongside Alejandro Manzanera Pertusa and the 2022 Roland Garros boys' doubles title with Mili Poljicak. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "title": "'Miracle' man Ritschard fuelled by girlfriend's nutritional plan",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/ritschard-top-100-challenger-2024-feature",
    "description": "Alexander Ritschard is powering through 2024 with a newfound edge, surging into the Top 100 of the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time on Wednesday. Behind the scenes, a key figure has quietly transformed his approach. The Swiss has been fuelled by a new nutritional programme, curated by his girlfriend, Kat Berglas. Ritschard, 30, has been dating Berglas for seven months, and in that short time, her expertise has helped him surge on the ATP Challenger Tour. “She was the missing piece I kind of needed to do what I’m doing now,” Ritschard told ATPTour.com. “She’s really helped me a lot with my nutrition, helps me feel more fueled and feeling [better]. Since I’ve taken her tips, I feel very healthy.” [ATP APP] In April, Ritschard was as low as World No. 209. He has since claimed three of his four career Challenger titles, including one last week in Lisbon, Portugal, where Ritschard had courtside support from Berglas. When Ritschard first met Berglas, he asked about her profession. Upon learning she was a nutritionist, he asked if she would be willing to help him and Berglas gladly agreed. She created a tailor-made nutritional plan. “I can’t give away all the secrets,” Ritschard joked. “Everyone has a different body, different metabolism. For me personally, I’m someone who burns carbs very quickly and sweats a lot, so I have to eat a lot of carbohydrates and take in a lot of salts and drink a lot of fluids. “She kind of has a whole programme for me. I eat a certain amount the day before, a certain amount the day of, I constantly eat when I play a match. My drink is a very heavy carbohydrate drink. Also, I’m eating a lot of bananas for the potassium and a lot of cereal bars for additional carbs. I’m just really, really carbing up and she keeps an eye on it.” One of two players to make his Top 100 debut Wednesday (Jacob Fearnley), Ritschard’s path to where he is now took an unexpected turn in 2015, when a blocked artery in his right arm cut off blood flow. Ritschard, then a student-athlete at the University of Virginia, was working out when he felt a sharp sting in his shoulder. What initially seemed minor quickly escalated, bringing Ritschard within minutes of potentially facing the unimaginable: the loss of his right arm. “I can only go by what they told me, they said they had to make a decision within the next five minutes and it wasn’t opening. I guess I got lucky, it opened, and blood started flowing again,” Ritschard said last year. Ritschard needed multiple operations to solve the issue. “One just to get the artery open, the second one to remove the problem, which was the rib that was too tight and then my lungs just filled with blood and I had to pump the blood out,” recalled Ritschard, who helped Virginia win three straight NCAA team titles. Post-surgery limitations left Ritschard questioning his future in tennis. He contemplated if he would quit the sport after college. But now he is among an exclusive group, boasting a double-digit number next to his name in the PIF ATP Rankings at World No. 99. Alexander Ritschard celebrates winning the Del Monte Lisboa Belém Open. Credit: Beatriz Ruivo/FPT Ritschard has occasional check-up appointments to ensure everything stays normal with his right arm, and thankfully, there have been no issues. Just last month, the week before he won the Lisbon Challenger title, Ritschard felt his arm going numb while he was sleeping. But doctors put to bed any concern. “That was just me sleeping funny,” Ritschard said. “At the check up, everything looked really, really good.” When Ritschard steps foot on court, or in the doctor’s office, he is reminded of his incredible fortune to even be playing the sport he began at age five. “I got really, really lucky. That’s really the only way I can put it,” Ritschard said. “Even now, I do a check up with the doctor who was part of the surgery and he always laughs when I walk in because he’s like, ‘Man, you are a miracle! This is crazy. I cannot believe you are able to do what you do with what we had to do’. “It’s always funny seeing him, he feels very prideful because he’s like, ‘Yeah, I saved this guy!’” Now, Ritschard is using that same arm — once at risk of being lost — to unleash heavy hitting from the baseline. What could have been a career-ending injury is instead a testament to Ritschard’s remarkable resilience. In the form of his life, Ritschard is the oldest Top 100 debutant since October 2022, when Emilio Gomez achieved the milestone. “I dreamt of being a Top 100 player since I was a kid,” Ritschard said. “So this for me is definitely a very special moment for sure.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
