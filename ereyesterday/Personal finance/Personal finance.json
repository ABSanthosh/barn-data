    "link": "https://affordanything.com/584-sahil-bloom-which-of-the-five-wealth-types-are-you-neglecting/",
    "description": "Think about how you spend an average day. Would the 10-year-old version of yourself be impressed? What about the 90-year-old version? These two powerful questions frame our conversation with Sahil Bloom, founder and managing partner of an early-stage venture fund with investments in over 60 startups and author of The Curiosity Chronicle, a newsletter that reaches more than a million readers worldwide. Sahil shares the story of his own wake-up call. While living in California and earning massive money as a venture inventor, he had a drink with an old friend who asked how often he saw his parents. When Sahil answered \"about once a year,\" his friend asked how old they were. Learning they were in their mid-60s, his friend calculated: \"So you're going to see your parents 15 more times before they die,\" assuming they'd live to about 80. That gut-punch realization led to massive change. Within 45 days, Sahil had left his job, sold his house, and moved across the country to be closer to family. This shift represents the core of Sahil's philosophy about the five types of wealth: 1. Time wealth: Control over your calendar and priorities 2. Social wealth: Deep, meaningful connections with others 3. Mental wealth: Curiosity, purpose, and personal growth 4. Physical wealth: Health and vitality 5. Financial wealth: Traditional money and assets Most of us focus exclusively on financial wealth because it's easily measurable. But Sahil argues that true wealth encompasses all five domains, and we should intentionally invest in each one. Sahil shares practical exercises for building each type of wealth: - For time wealth, create an \"energy calendar\" by tracking which activities energize versus drain you - For social wealth, map your relationships based on how healthy and frequent they are - For purpose, ask yourself what your world (family, community, etc.) needs from you - For physical wealth, focus on movement, nutrition, and recovery through simple practices - For financial wealth, clearly define what \"enough\" looks like for you These five domains aren't meant to be balanced perfectly every day. Instead, Sahil suggests thinking in seasons — some periods might emphasize financial growth while others prioritize family time. Sahil also discusses powerful concepts like goals versus anti-goals (what you're unwilling to sacrifice to reach your goals) and \"Memento Mori\" — the ancient Roman practice of remembering one's mortality to inspire present action. The conversation ends with a reminder that \"your life has seasons\" just like the weather — you don't expect to experience all four seasons in a single day, so don't expect perfect balance in every area of life simultaneously.

I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

Michael works as a project coordinator for a state behavioral health agency serving young people and has a side job as an advocate and disability leadership coordinator. Brian is a quality assurance manager for a state-run hospital. The couple’s been together since 2013 and looks forward to celebrating their 10-year anniversary in November. While Brian and Michael have achieved a lot, they feel as though their debt and lack of home ownership is holding them back.
