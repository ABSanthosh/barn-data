I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

It's clear to me (and to Kim) that above all else, I need to make 2023 the year of me. 2023 — The Year of Me More than a decade ago, I got into the habit of theming my years and months. It was fun! It was also fruitful. Whenever I decided to devote a span of time to one thing, I had great results, whether it was with fitness or writing or dating. This habit of theming lasted for a couple of years, then fell by the wayside.\u003c/",

A salesman had come knocking on our door. This was strange since the box factory was (and still is) located in a rural area. But somehow this guy had found us and he was there to make his pitch: He was a salesman who trained salesmen. (And, presumably, saleswomen although this wasn't part of the spiel in 1992.) Dad, amused, introduced this fellow to me. \"This is J.D.,\" Dad said. \"He's our salesman. Talk to him.\" So, this guy sat down with me in a back room of the shabby trailer house that served as company HQ. (This was the very trailer house I'd grown up in. And trust me when I say it was a pit, a sty. It was just as bad as you're imagining. Maybe worse.)",

    "link": "https://affordanything.com/610-your-goals-might-be-killing-you-literally-with-sebastien-page/",
    "description": "In 2005, Sebastien Page nearly died from a mysterious bacterial infection that doctors couldn't diagnose for a week. A single observant physician noticed cuts on his toes from running in wet terrain and connected the dots. The experience forced Page to confront mortality — and completely changed how he thinks about goals. Page, the chief investment officer at T. Rowe Price and author of The Psychology of Leadership, joins us to share why traditional goal-setting might be sabotaging your happiness. He explains how 80 percent of millennials say they just want to get rich, and 50 percent want to become famous. But research from Harvard's 80-year longitudinal study reveals something surprising: people who climbed the social ladder weren't meaningfully happier than those who struggled financially. The real predictor of long-term happiness? The quality of your relationships with others. We explore the dark side of goals through a concept called \"goal-induced blindness.\" Page uses Mount Everest as an example — climbers have a 4 percent chance of dying, the same odds as eating four poisoned gummies out of 100. Yet people still attempt the summit because they become blinded by the goal itself. Page shares his own experience with goal-induced blindness during his demanding career in money management. The relentless travel and pressure contributed to his near-fatal infection in 2005. He learned that working less actually made him more productive. We dive into Page's framework called the \"three Cs\": core beliefs, curves, and control theory. Core beliefs are the filters through which you interpret the world — like whether you trust people or believe money should be spent versus saved. Curves refer to stress management, based on research showing optimal performance doesn't happen at zero stress. Control theory teaches you when to exercise \"strategic patience\" versus making quick decisions. Page also introduces the PERMA framework from positive psychology: positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment. He calls the last four \"proteins for your soul,\" while positive emotions are more like a sugar high. The discussion covers practical applications for everything from hiring decisions to relationship choices, using mathematical concepts like net present value to make better life decisions.",
