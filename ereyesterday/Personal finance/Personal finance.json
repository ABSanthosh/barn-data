I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either.

    "link": "https://affordanything.com/596-first-friday-tariffs-grab-headlines-but-these-financial-changes-nobody-is-talking-about-will-impact-you-too/",
    "description": "Yesterday, the White House rolled out the biggest tariffs in a century, sending markets into their worst decline since the pandemic. While headlines focus on supply chains and inflation, there are important economic stories you're not hearing about. During the first half of this month's First Friday episode, we dig into what nobody's talking about. And in the second half, we grapple with the headlines. Student loan rules just changed again. The government added new limits to Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Right now, 9.2 million people — one in five borrowers — can't keep up with payments. Many folks don't even know payments started again after that four-and-a-half-year break. S\u0026P just dropped a new report that backs what smart money already knows: index funds crush actively managed funds 90 percent of the time. Even with all those tech stocks dominating the market, you still come out ahead with simple indexing. You know who's gobbling up the mortgage market? Rocket Companies. They just bought both Redfin and Mr. Cooper. They'll handle one of every six mortgages in America. They've positioned themselves at every step of the homebuying journey — from when you search for homes on Redfin to financing and monthly payments for the next 30 years. The White House just made a surprising move with Bitcoin. They're setting up a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to hold coins long-term. They're also creating a separate stockpile for crypto they seize in legal cases. Pretty clear signal that Bitcoin stands apart from other cryptocurrencies. In the second half, we dive into those significant new tariffs making headlines. The S\u0026P 500 dropped 4.8 percent on Thursday — we haven't seen a drop like that since the pandemic. The new rules put at least a 10 percent tariff on everything coming into the country. Then come the \"reciprocal\" rates: 20 percent for European goods, 27 percent for items from India, and a combined 65 percent for Chinese imports. We bring in Bob Elliott to make sense of this situation. His credentials are impressive — he spent 13 years at Bridgewater Associates (the world's largest hedge fund), served as head of Ray Dalio's investment team, and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard. During the 2008 crisis, he directly advised the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and White House. Bob offers a reality check about bringing back manufacturing jobs: you can't build factories overnight. These investments take years, and companies hesitate to make 30-year commitments when policies change every few months. Bob breaks down four economic forces all hitting at once: tariffs jacking up prices, government cutting spending, tax policies on hold, and the Fed moving like molasses. Put them together? Yikes. He doesn't sugarcoat it — the short-term outlook looks \"pretty negative.\"",

A salesman had come knocking on our door. This was strange since the box factory was (and still is) located in a rural area. But somehow this guy had found us and he was there to make his pitch: He was a salesman who trained salesmen. (And, presumably, saleswomen although this wasn't part of the spiel in 1992.) Dad, amused, introduced this fellow to me. \"This is J.D.,\" Dad said. \"He's our salesman. Talk to him.\" So, this guy sat down with me in a back room of the shabby trailer house that served as company HQ. (This was the very trailer house I'd grown up in. And trust me when I say it was a pit, a sty. It was just as bad as you're imagining. Maybe worse.)",
