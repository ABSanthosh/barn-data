I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

A salesman had come knocking on our door. This was strange since the box factory was (and still is) located in a rural area. But somehow this guy had found us and he was there to make his pitch: He was a salesman who trained salesmen. (And, presumably, saleswomen although this wasn't part of the spiel in 1992.) Dad, amused, introduced this fellow to me. \"This is J.D.,\" Dad said. \"He's our salesman. Talk to him.\" So, this guy sat down with me in a back room of the shabby trailer house that served as company HQ. (This was the very trailer house I'd grown up in. And trust me when I say it was a pit, a sty. It was just as bad as you're imagining. Maybe worse.)",

    "description": "Two school teachers in Ohio saved their entire lives for one dream — buying a farm. When they inherited $1.3 million and found the perfect property for $1.2 million, everything seemed perfect. Five days before closing, they received what looked like a legitimate email from their closing company with wire transfer instructions. They sent the money and showed up at closing, only to discover they'd been scammed. The email was fake, sent by hackers who had infiltrated the closing company's servers for months, waiting for exactly this type of high-value cash deal. That story comes from cybersecurity expert Dr. Eric Cole, who joins us to explain why ordinary people have become prime targets for cybercriminals. Cole, a former CIA hacker who served as cybersecurity commissioner under President Barack Obama and advises high-profile clients including Bill Gates' personal estate, has a message: if you think you're too small to be targeted, you're wrong. While billion-dollar companies deploy teams of 60 cybersecurity professionals, you have virtually no protection. Criminals know this. They're not trying to steal $100 million from one person anymore — they're stealing $50 from thousands of people every month. You probably won't notice the small amounts vanishing from your accounts. Cole calls it \"death by a thousand cuts,\" and it's happening right now. We talk through the most common attacks targeting your money. Bank hacking is simpler than most people realize. All criminals need is your account number — printed on every check you write — and your password. With that information, they can often perform electronic fund transfers of up to 50 percent of your account balance without triggering alerts. We also cover the China-TikTok connection, secure messaging options, and why Cole helped configure President Obama's smartphone to connect to fake cell towers that masked his actual location. Cole's bottom line: cybersecurity isn't just for tech companies anymore. Criminals are targeting ordinary people because we're easier prey than heavily protected corporations. Your money is under threat. Here's how to protect it.",
