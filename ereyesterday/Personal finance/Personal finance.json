I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

    "description": "Tax day is approaching, and if you're like most people, you might be overlooking deductions that could save you money. In our latest podcast episode, tax strategist Natalie Kolodij joins us to reveal common tax misconceptions and share strategies that could potentially lower your tax bill. \"The tax code is 70,000 pages,\" Natalie explains. \"There's so much. So I really like to have people focus on a handful of things to be mindful of.\" For W-2 employees who often have fewer tax advantages, Natalie highlights several overlooked deductions. If you live in a state without income tax (like Florida or Washington), you can deduct sales tax instead — especially on major purchases. Don't forget about personal property taxes on vehicles, boats or RVs either. Medical expenses can be deductible, but only amounts exceeding 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income. Natalie suggests consolidating elective procedures into a single tax year to maximize this benefit. Charitable deductions offer surprising opportunities too. Miles driven while volunteering, expenses from fostering animals, and even home renovation materials donated to organizations like Habitat for Humanity can all qualify. Natalie also explains how \"bunching\" donations in alternate years can significantly increase tax savings compared to giving the same amount annually. The interview tackles major misconceptions about selling your primary residence. While many believe living in a home for two years makes all gains tax-free, Natalie clarifies that any \"non-qualified use\" periods (like when it was a rental property) can still be taxable. For small business owners and real estate investors, Natalie recommends tracking all business-related expenses — even seemingly minor ones like industry-related books or educational materials. She emphasizes the importance of proper record-keeping and having separate accounts for business expenses. As we navigate tax law changes following the recent election, Natalie's advice rings true: maintain flexibility in your tax planning and consider working with professionals who specialize in your specific situation.",

A salesman had come knocking on our door. This was strange since the box factory was (and still is) located in a rural area. But somehow this guy had found us and he was there to make his pitch: He was a salesman who trained salesmen. (And, presumably, saleswomen although this wasn't part of the spiel in 1992.) Dad, amused, introduced this fellow to me. \"This is J.D.,\" Dad said. \"He's our salesman. Talk to him.\" So, this guy sat down with me in a back room of the shabby trailer house that served as company HQ. (This was the very trailer house I'd grown up in. And trust me when I say it was a pit, a sty. It was just as bad as you're imagining. Maybe worse.)",
