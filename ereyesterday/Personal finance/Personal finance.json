    "description": "The U.S. jobs market hit a surprising speed bump in October, adding just 12,000 new jobs — way below the expected 100,000. A mix of natural disasters and labor unrest explains the slump. Recent hurricanes in the Southeast wiped out somewhere between 40,000 to 70,000 jobs, while strikes at Boeing and other companies added to the slowdown. Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve looks ready to cut interest rates next week by 0.25 percent. Meanwhile, gold is having its biggest moment since 1979, but not for reasons you might expect. Central banks, especially in China and India, are loading up on physical gold like never before. Poland's central bank has grabbed 167 tons of gold and wants to keep 20 percent of its reserves in gold — a move that hints at banks preparing for possible global shake-ups. Remember when I-Bonds were the hot ticket in 2022, paying out 9.6 percent? Those glory days are gone. The new rate has dropped to 3.1 percent, making your standard high-yield savings account look pretty good in comparison. In the stock market, it's all about the \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla. These tech giants account for 62 percent of all S\u0026P 500 gains over the past year. The other 493 companies aren't doing too shabby either, with profits expected to grow 13 percent next year. As for the upcoming election, both presidential candidates' economic plans would push the federal deficit higher. The Wharton School of Business says Trump's proposals would add $5.8 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, while Harris's would add $1.2 trillion. There's also talk about tariffs that could spark inflation and maybe even kick off a global trade war. Here's the kicker: during the 2016 election, a 24-year-old Sam Bankman-Fried correctly predicted the outcome before anyone else and made $300 million in a single night trading on that information. But by morning, the markets had swung so wildly that he'd lost $600 million. The lesson? Even if you guess the election right, predicting how markets will react is a whole different ball game — one that you should avoid. Think long-term, buy-and-hold.",

    "description": "This is the third and final episode in a three-part series. Dr. Brad Klontz and Adrian Brambila join us to share 21 harsh truths about building wealth. This episode focuses on the final 11 harsh truths, following up on their previous conversations about the first 10 harsh truths. The conversation begins with a key distinction: poor people buy stuff, while rich people buy time. They explain how wealthy people focus on building passive income streams rather than trading hours for objects. Brambila shares how he learned this lesson personally, discussing his pickleball court purchase through investment income rather than active work hours. The duo challenges common assumptions about luxury brands, arguing that people who constantly show off designer items are usually compensating for insecurity. Klontz shares his own experience of buying an expensive watch early in his career to prove his success. They examine whether college, marriage, and homeownership are necessary for wealth building. While data shows these traditional paths often lead to higher net worth, they acknowledge these aren't the only routes to financial success. On the topic of retirement, both guests argue that completely stopping work can be psychologically harmful, sharing examples of successful people who stayed active well into their later years. They break down specific money-saving strategies like getting roommates, using public transportation, and cutting your own hair. Brambila demonstrates how women can cut their own hair during the interview. The discussion covers specific side hustle opportunities, with detailed explanation of how to make money doing Amazon product reviews. Brambila shares how his videos have generated significant income, including $2,000 in a single day during Black Friday. They address money myths about credit cards, particularly the misconception about carrying balances to improve credit scores. Real examples and personal stories illustrate their points. Klontz shares how his 11-year-old son is making $5,000 monthly doing Amazon reviews, while Brambila discusses living in a van while earning six figures to demonstrate that wealth isn't about outward appearances. The episode concludes by connecting financial security to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, explaining how building wealth enables higher-level personal growth and positive impact",

I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

The couple’s been together since 2013 and looks forward to celebrating their 10-year anniversary in November. While Brian and Michael have achieved a lot, they feel as though their debt and lack of home ownership is holding them back.
