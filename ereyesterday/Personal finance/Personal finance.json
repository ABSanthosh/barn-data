I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

    "link": "https://affordanything.com/572-your-last-thoughts-wont-be-about-money-with-dr-jordan-grumet/",
    "description": "At age 7, Dr. Jordan Grumet lost his father. This early loss shaped his career path — he became a physician, following in his dad's footsteps. But by 2010, feeling burned out from internal medicine, he took an unexpected turn: he became a hospice doctor. In this episode, Dr. Grumet joins us to discuss what he's learned from thousands of conversations with people in their final days. These discussions have revealed a pattern: people don't typically regret their bank balance on their deathbed. Instead, they regret not pursuing the activities and dreams that truly lit them up. Dr. Grumet explains the difference between what he calls \"Big P Purpose\" versus \"little p purpose.\" Big P Purpose involves major life goals like becoming president or curing cancer. Little p purpose, by contrast, focuses on the process — finding activities you enjoy regardless of the outcome. He shares the story of a young professional who loved competitive cycling. While working a demanding nonprofit job, this person started fixing bikes at races on weekends. This side project combined his skills and passion, eventually creating enough income for him to reduce his full-time hours. Dr. Grumet introduces three key concepts for building more purpose into your life: - Joy of Addition: Add activities that excite you, even if just for 15 minutes daily - Art of Subtraction: Remove activities that drain you - Substitution: When you can't add or subtract, swap one activity for another He emphasizes that money isn't the only tool for creating change. Youth, energy, relationships, skills and community can be equally valuable resources. A 22-year-old might lack funds but has the advantage of time and stamina that a 51-year-old doesn't possess. Dr. Grumet references the Harvard Adult Developmental Health Study, which found that strong relationships — not achievements or money — most strongly correlate with happiness. He suggests that pursuing activities you enjoy naturally leads to building these vital connections. The episode closes with a powerful story about his grandfather, who loved math and became an accountant in the 1950s. This passion influenced Dr. Grumet's mother to become a CPA, which in turn helped young Jordan develop confidence in math, despite his reading challenges. Years later, this mathematical thinking helped him diagnose a rabbi's rare condition — proving how small actions can create ripple effects across generations.",
