I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

    "link": "https://affordanything.com/570-the-compound-effect-of-52-tiny-financial-changes/",
    "description": "Grab your free copy of the 52-week guide to micro-improvements at affordanything.com/financialgoals _______ In 2012, the British cycling team pulled off what seemed impossible. After 76 years of losses, they won the Tour de France, took second place, and grabbed 8 Olympic gold medals. Their secret? Tiny improvements that added up to massive change. That's the philosophy behind \"One Tweak a Week,\" a year-long financial roadmap broken into 52 small, manageable steps. Each tweak takes less than an hour — many just minutes — but compound into significant financial progress over time. The plan breaks down into four quarters. Quarter 1 lays the groundwork with foundational habits like writing a financial motivation statement, calculating net worth, and choosing key metrics to track. It's about getting clear on where you stand and where you're headed. Quarter 2 shifts focus to optimizing your money. You'll track prices, adjust thermostat settings to cut energy costs, create a \"fun fund\" for guilt-free spending, and develop strategies for charitable giving. This quarter also tackles professional development and emergency medical expense planning. In Quarter 3, the focus turns to systematic improvements — maintaining proper tire pressure to save on fuel, capturing work-from-home savings, planning for seasonal expenses, and building a buffer for unexpected price increases. Quarter 4 wraps up with fine-tuning your system. You'll evaluate housing options, manage variable food costs, set micro-saving challenges, and create strategies for handling market uncertainty. The approach mirrors what British cycling performance director Dave Brailsford calls \"the 1 percent margin for improvement.\" He transformed the team by focusing on tiny details — everything from athlete hand-washing techniques to bringing specific mattresses to hotels for better sleep. Even painting the maintenance floor white to better spot problematic dust on bike gears. Like Brailsford's approach, these financial tweaks might seem small on their own. But together, they create a comprehensive system for building lasting wealth. The guide is available at affordanything.com/financialgoals.",
