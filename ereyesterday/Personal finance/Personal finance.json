    "link": "https://affordanything.com/576-the-worlds-richest-people-are-weird-by-design-with-william-green/",
    "description": "The world's greatest investors have a secret: they're weird. When one young fund manager met Bill Miller for the first time, he refused to shake hands. Instead, he locked eyes and declared: \"I'm going to beat you, man.\" William Green joins us to share what he's learned from decades of conversations with investing legends ‚Äî from the hyper-competitive to the deeply philosophical. These conversations reveal that success isn't just about strategy; it's about understanding yourself and playing to your strengths. The best investors are mavericks who think differently. They're willing to look strange, be lonely, and diverge from the crowd. Templeton demonstrated this during WWII. When Germany invaded France and markets crashed, he bought 104 stocks trading under $1 ‚Äî including 37 bankrupt companies. His contrarian bet paid off 5x when markets recovered. But Green emphasizes this isn't just about getting rich. His decades of interviews reveal deeper wisdom about building a good life: ‚Äî Great investors focus on what they can control. They can't predict markets, but they can manage their behavior and emotions. ‚Äî They embrace simplicity. Jack Bogle advocated owning low-cost index funds rather than chasing complex strategies. ‚Äî They understand odds and risk. Howard Marks asks \"What's the consequence if I'm wrong?\" before making decisions. ‚Äî They play to their strengths. Charlie Munger says if you're 5'3\", don't try to be a pro basketball player. ‚Äî They live below their means. As investor Tom Gaynor notes, \"If you're living within your means, you're already rich.\" Green shares a practical framework called HALT PS ‚Äî don't make important decisions when Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired, in Pain, or Stressed. This applies beyond investing to daily life. The conversation explores how to build resilience before market crashes through healthy habits, self-awareness, and preparation. Green notes that many successful investors practice meditation and read widely across disciplines. Even legends make mistakes. Bill Miller saw his assets drop from $77 billion to $800 million during the 2008 crisis. But he rebounded by staying true to his principles and learning from failure. Green's key message? Focus less on getting rich and more on building an \"anti-fragile\" life aligned with your values and strengths. The best investors aren't just good at making money ‚Äî they're skilled at creating lives of meaning and purpose.

    "link": "https://affordanything.com/574-the-hidden-psychology-of-financial-pressure-with-dr-sunita-sah/",
    "description": "What would you do if someone in authority told you to do something that felt wrong? Most of us like to think we'd speak up, push back, stand our ground. But research tells a very different story. In fact, when Yale researchers conducted a famous experiment in the 1960s, they found that 65% of people would administer what they believed to be deadly electric shocks to another human being... simply because someone in a lab coat told them to. Today's guest has spent over 15 years studying why humans comply with authority - even when every fiber of our being is screaming that we shouldn't. And when it comes to our money, this tendency to comply with authority figures - from financial advisors to real estate agents to car salespeople - can cost us dearly. Dr. Sunita Sah began her career as a physician in the UK's National Health Service. During one particularly exhausting period as a junior doctor, she agreed to meet with a financial advisor who had contacted her at work. That meeting sparked questions that would shape the rest of her career: Why did she feel pressured to trust this advisor, even after learning he had a conflict of interest? Today, she's a tenured professor at Cornell University, where her groundbreaking research on compliance and influence has been featured in The New York Times and Scientific American. She's advised government agencies, served on the National Commission on Forensic Science, and helps leaders understand the psychology behind why we say \"yes\" when we really want to say \"no.\" Whether you're meeting with a financial advisor, negotiating the price of a home, or discussing rates with a contractor, understanding the psychology of compliance could save you thousands of dollars - and help you make better financial decisions. Today's conversation isn't just about psychology - it's about protecting your wealth by learning when and how to say \"no.\"",
