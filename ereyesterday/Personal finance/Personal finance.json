I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

Michael works as a project coordinator for a state behavioral health agency serving young people and has a side job as an advocate and disability leadership coordinator. Brian is a quality assurance manager for a state-run hospital. The couple’s been together since 2013 and looks forward to celebrating their 10-year anniversary in November. While Brian and Michael have achieved a lot, they feel as though their debt and lack of home ownership is holding them back. They’d like our advice on how to unlock this next level of adulting and, crucially, how to be permanently debt-free. What’s a Reader Case Study?

A salesman had come knocking on our door. This was strange since the box factory was (and still is) located in a rural area. But somehow this guy had found us and he was there to make his pitch: He was a salesman who trained salesmen. (And, presumably, saleswomen although this wasn't part of the spiel in 1992.) Dad, amused, introduced this fellow to me. \"This is J.D.,\" Dad said. \"He's our salesman. Talk to him.\" So, this guy sat down with me in a back room of the shabby trailer house that served as company HQ. (This was the very trailer house I'd grown up in. And trust me when I say it was a pit, a sty. It was just as bad as you're imagining. Maybe worse.)",

    "description": "Economist Dr. Karsten Jeske talks with us about the current economic landscape. Karsten, who retired at 44, breaks down the Fed's recent decisions and how they might affect our finances. He explains how markets often anticipate interest rate changes before they happen. Karsten challenges traditional views on inflation and unemployment, telling us that textbook models don't always match reality. Karsten shares his personal investing experiences, covering both market highs and lows. He emphasizes the value of consistent investing regardless of market conditions. For those eyeing retirement, Karsten dives into safe withdrawal rates. He advises paying close attention to current market valuations when planning. On the topic of mortgages, he offers clear guidance on when refinancing makes sense. We also touch on economic history, discussing the Weimar Republic's hyperinflation. Karsten uses this to critique modern monetary theory, expressing skepticism about unrestricted money printing. Throughout our conversation, Karsten explains complex economic concepts in accessible terms. He draws on his background as both an academic and a Wall Street professional to provide well-rounded insights. Karsten, also known as Big ERN, is the author of EarlyRetirementNow.com, where he writes about safe withdrawal rates and personal finance while enjoying his retirement.",
