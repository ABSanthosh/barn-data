    "description": "Fear blocks smart money moves. Ask Harvard Business Review advisor Dr. Margie Warrell, who guides Fortune 500 companies through strategic risk-taking. Her client roster includes NASA, Morgan Stanley, and Google. Her understanding of courage started at home. Her 13-year-old daughter landed an Australian TV role. She flew to LA for acting classes. There, she learned the hard truth: Success meant waiting tables for 20 years. The daughter's verdict was clear: \"Mum, I don't want it enough.\" This reveals what Dr. Warrell calls the courage gap. It's the space between your current life and the life you could create through brave action. For investors, this gap appears daily. It's the distance between dreaming of financial independence and taking concrete steps toward building wealth. Drawing on her doctoral research and Fortune 500 consulting experience, Dr. Warrell outlines five critical steps to bridge this gap: 1. Focus on what you want, not what you fear. Our brains have a negativity bias ‚Äî we're twice as sensitive to potential losses as potential gains. This explains why market downturns feel more intense than upswings. 2. Rewrite your story. The narratives we tell ourselves shape our actions. Perhaps you see yourself as \"too risk-averse\" to start a business or \"not smart enough\" to understand investing. Reframe these stories so you can take smart financial risks. 3. Embody courage physically. Fear lives in our bodies ‚Äî whether it's anxiety about making your first investment or launching a side business. Try simple practices like deep breathing when facing big financial decisions. 4. Step into discomfort. Growth and comfort can't coexist. Every successful investor and entrepreneur started as a beginner. Financial literacy and business acumen develops through consistent practice. 5. Find the treasure when you trip. Market corrections, failed business ventures, and investment mistakes are learning opportunities. Dr. Warrell emphasizes that courage isn't about waiting until you feel confident ‚Äî it's about acting despite your fears. This applies whether you're making your first stock purchase, buying your first rental property, or quitting your job to start a business. The takeaway: While you can't control market conditions or business outcomes, you can control your response to financial fears.",
