    "link": "https://affordanything.com/613-rachel-rodgers-this-multimillionaire-started-with-330000-in-debt-and-a-41000-salary/",
    "description": "Rachel Rodgers graduated from law school with $330,000 in student loans. Her starting salary? Just $41,000. Most people would have accepted this crushing debt-to-income ratio. They'd slowly chip away at payments for decades. Rodgers had a different plan. She deferred her loans and started her own virtual law practice in 2008 — during the recession, when jobs were scarce and most lawyers were struggling to find work. Her mom thought she was crazy. Her first year, she made around $65,000 in gross revenue with only $300 in overhead costs. By year two, she was earning $300,000. The key to her success wasn't cutting expenses or living on rice and beans. Rodgers focused entirely on earning more money. We talk about the practical steps she took to scale her business. She waited until hitting $250,000 in annual revenue before bringing on her first full-time employee — an administrative assistant who immediately paid for herself by responding to client inquiries faster than Rodgers could manage alone. Rodgers also shares insights from a CEO's perspective on what employees should know when asking for a raise. Understand your company's goals. Know your boss's pain points. When you spot a problem, bring three solutions — not just the issue. She usually goes with whatever option her team recommends. \"You are the asset,\" she explains. This mindset applies whether you're an entrepreneur or an employee trying to maximize your career potential. Our interview covers her transition from solopreneur to multimillion-dollar business owner, her approach to leading employees, and her philosophy on building wealth through entrepreneurship rather than cost-cutting.",

I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

A salesman had come knocking on our door. This was strange since the box factory was (and still is) located in a rural area. But somehow this guy had found us and he was there to make his pitch: He was a salesman who trained salesmen. (And, presumably, saleswomen although this wasn't part of the spiel in 1992.) Dad, amused, introduced this fellow to me. \"This is J.D.,\" Dad said. \"He's our salesman. Talk to him.\" So, this guy sat down with me in a back room of the shabby trailer house that served as company HQ. (This was the very trailer house I'd grown up in. And trust me when I say it was a pit, a sty. It was just as bad as you're imagining. Maybe worse.)",
