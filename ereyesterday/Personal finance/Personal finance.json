    "link": "https://affordanything.com/555-madfientist-the-hardest-part-of-early-retirement-wasnt-the-money/",
    "description": "Brandon Ganch (known online as MadFientist) joins us from Scotland to share how his life has transformed since retiring in 2016 at age 34. “I thought retirement was an age, not a function,” he said. “And when I realized it was just a math function, it changed my entire life.” Eight years into retirement, Brandon talks about how his spending and lifestyle have evolved. While his investment portfolio has grown \"exponentially,\" he's had to push himself to spend more money. He and his wife have doubled their spending in the last three years, yet still haven't reached the 4 percent withdrawal rate that's common in early retirement. Having two young kids (a two-year-old son and one-month-old daughter) has changed their spending patterns. Restaurant bills and craft beer costs have dropped significantly, while they've invested in a house — their third, but the first one Brandon says he actually enjoys owning since he's no longer \"hyper-frugal.\" Brandon shares his few regrets from his journey to financial independence, mainly missing friends' bachelor parties in his twenties because he didn't want to pay for two transatlantic flights in one month. The book \"Die with Zero\" has shifted his perspective on spending, making him realize there are \"seasons in life\" for certain experiences. Brandon suggests trying to live your \"post-FI life\" before actually reaching financial independence. By traveling for three months straight, he learned that constant travel wasn't actually what he wanted. He emphasizes that financial independence isn't just about early retirement — it's about having choices and power in your career. You can find Brandon at madfientist.com or listen to his music at madfientist.com/album.",

    "description": "The U.S. jobs market hit a surprising speed bump in October, adding just 12,000 new jobs — way below the expected 100,000. A mix of natural disasters and labor unrest explains the slump. Recent hurricanes in the Southeast wiped out somewhere between 40,000 to 70,000 jobs, while strikes at Boeing and other companies added to the slowdown. Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve looks ready to cut interest rates next week by 0.25 percent. Meanwhile, gold is having its biggest moment since 1979, but not for reasons you might expect. Central banks, especially in China and India, are loading up on physical gold like never before. Poland's central bank has grabbed 167 tons of gold and wants to keep 20 percent of its reserves in gold — a move that hints at banks preparing for possible global shake-ups. Remember when I-Bonds were the hot ticket in 2022, paying out 9.6 percent? Those glory days are gone. The new rate has dropped to 3.1 percent, making your standard high-yield savings account look pretty good in comparison. In the stock market, it's all about the \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla. These tech giants account for 62 percent of all S\u0026P 500 gains over the past year. The other 493 companies aren't doing too shabby either, with profits expected to grow 13 percent next year. As for the upcoming election, both presidential candidates' economic plans would push the federal deficit higher. The Wharton School of Business says Trump's proposals would add $5.8 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, while Harris's would add $1.2 trillion. There's also talk about tariffs that could spark inflation and maybe even kick off a global trade war. Here's the kicker: during the 2016 election, a 24-year-old Sam Bankman-Fried correctly predicted the outcome before anyone else and made $300 million in a single night trading on that information. But by morning, the markets had swung so wildly that he'd lost $600 million. The lesson? Even if you guess the election right, predicting how markets will react is a whole different ball game — one that you should avoid. Think long-term, buy-and-hold.",

I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",
