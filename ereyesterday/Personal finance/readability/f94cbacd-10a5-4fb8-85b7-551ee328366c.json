It can help you stress less about bills, save more, and feel more in control of your future. Whether you’re trying… Do you want to learn how to make $6,000 a month? I’ve been making over $6,000 a month for a long time now, and I know how life-changing that kind of income can be. It can help you stress less about bills, save more, and feel more in control of your future. Whether you’re trying to make $6,000 a month as your main job or just want to make extra income, there are so many ways to get there, and you don’t have to do something complicated to start. You can earn this income by starting a blog, freelancing, selling digital products, flipping items, and more. And, most of the jobs are fairly flexible and don’t require a college degree or a big upfront investment. Best Ways To Make $6,000 a Month Below are the top ways to make $6,000 a month. 1. Start a blog Blogging is a good small business to start if you want to make $6,000 a month all from home. Blogging changed my life. I started my blog, Making Sense of Cents, over 10 years ago when I was paying off student loans. I had no idea what I was doing, but I stuck with it. That blog eventually helped me quit my day job and has brought in millions of dollars in income. With a blog, you can make money through affiliate marketing, sponsored content, digital products, ads, and more. There are so many different income streams that a blog can open up. It took me about 1 ½ years to earn $6,000 a month from my blog. Two years later, I was earning over $10,000 a month. Today, I earn more than that. And I love that I can do it from home or while traveling, on my own schedule. You can join my How To Start A Blog Course. In this free course, I teach you how to start a blog, and over 80,000 people have taken this! Recommended reading: How To Monetize A Blog: How I Grew A $5 Million Blog. 2. Sell digital products or printables Selling printables and digital products is a great way to make money online, and it can be semi-passive too. You create a product once (like a planner, party invitation, greeting card, packing list, baby shower game, template, worksheet, or wall art), and then you can sell it over and over again on platforms like Etsy, Gumroad, Shopify, or your own website. Some sellers make thousands of dollars every month and the startup cost is very low, so it is easy to get started if you don’t have a lot of money.

Bookkeeping Bookkeeping is a high-paying remote job that doesn’t require a CPA license or an accounting degree. Many small businesses need help tracking expenses and income, but they don’t need a full-time worker to do this. So, this is where an online bookkeeper comes in. All you need are some organizational skills, basic math skills, and a willingness to learn tools like QuickBooks. Recommended reading: How To Make $40,000 With Online Bookkeeping Jobs 10Bookkeeper Launch CourseThis free training will teach you what you need to know to become a virtual bookkeeper and make money from home. 4. Start a remote cleaning business Yes, you can start a cleaning business and not even do any of the cleaning yourself! With a remote cleaning business, you find the clients, schedule cleanings, and hire local cleaners to do the actual work. You run the business from your computer and phone. To learn more, check out this article I have: How To Start a Remote Cleaning Business and Make $100,000+ Each Year 5. Create an online course or membership If you have something you can teach, you can turn it into a course or a membership. This could be about anything such as: How to budget How to play the guitar How to speak a language How to start RVing How to write an ebook There are so many people who are willing to pay to learn a new skill. Once you create your course, you can sell it over and over again. Some course creators earn thousands of dollars each month semi-passively. I personally sell courses on affiliate marketing and sponsored posts. It’s one of my favorite ways to help others and earn income at the same time. You can learn more about my experience with online courses at How I’ve Made Over $1,000,000 From My First Course. 6. Manage Facebook ads for small businesses Many small businesses know they should be running advertisements online, but they don’t know how. If you learn how to do it, they’ll gladly pay you so that they can get more customers to their business. You can charge $1,000 to $2,000+ per month per client, so with just a few clients, you could be earning $6,000 a month or more. This can be great as a side gig with just a few clients or you can grow bigger, get a lot of clients, and earn a full-time income. If this sounds interesting, you can learn more through the FB Side Hustle Course. It’s run by my sister-in-law Ariel and my friend Bobby. 7. Become a virtual assistant Virtual assistants (VAs) help business owners with different tasks like scheduling appointments, managing their email inbox, social media (like scheduling Pinterest pins or managing Facebook groups), customer support, search engine optimization, and more. I’ve been a VA in the past, and now I have one who works for me. She’s amazing and a huge part of my business. Beginner VAs start at around $20 to $25 per hour. Experienced VAs can charge $50 per hour or more. Some VAs make $100,000 a year! Recommended reading: How To Find Virtual Assistant Jobs As A Beginner 10Proofread AnywhereThis free 76-minute workshop answers all of the most common questions about how to become a proofreader, and even talks about the 5 signs that proofreading could be a perfect fit for you. 8. Retail arbitrage or flipping items If you love finding deals, then retail arbitrage or flipping could be perfect for you. With flipping, you find undervalued items at garage sales, thrift stores, Nextdoor, local neighborhood groups, Facebook Marketplace, or even stuff that people are throwing away, and sell them for a profit. Retail arbitrage is similar, but you buy clearance items at stores like Walmart or TJ Maxx and resell them on Amazon or eBay. Many people use the Amazon Seller app to scan products and check prices in real time. I’ve personally done flipping many times over the years and have really enjoyed it. I’ve mainly resold clothing, but I know many people who sell all kinds of things like furniture, electronics, books, baby gear, sports equipment, tools, and more. You can learn more about this at How I Made $100,000 Selling Used Items. 9. Coaching or consulting If you’re great at something, like budgeting, fitness, career development, running a business, or parenting, you could become a coach or consultant. You can work one-on-one with clients, sell group coaching, or even create a program. Coaches can charge $100 to $300+ per session or sell packages that cost thousands of dollars. This is a great option if you want to help others while also earning a great income. 10. Real estate investing or rental income Real estate can be a great way to earn passive income and reach $6,000 per month in income. You could rent out a room in your house, turn a basement into an Airbnb, or invest in a duplex and rent out one side. I’ve met people who paid their entire mortgage this way. You can even rent out your RV on RVshare, extra storage space on Neighbor, or your swimming pool on Swimply. You can learn more at 23 Best Real Estate Side Hustles To Make Extra Money. 11. Start a YouTube channel Creating a YouTube channel can be a way to earn $6,000 a month, and you don’t even need a massive 1,000,000+ subscribers channel to earn money. You can start a YouTube channel on topics like: Personal finance and side hustles Minimalism Homesteading Home organization Parenting and family life Traveling Cooking With a YouTube channel, you can make money from ads, sponsors, affiliate links, or selling your own products. Like blogging, this takes time to build so it’s not a get-rich-quick scheme (and also not everyone will make money with a YouTube channel), but once you have an audience, it can become a full-time income source. You can learn more at How Much Do YouTubers Make? 12. Tech-focused freelance work Freelancers in all different niches are needed, and you don’t need to be a techy person to get started. If you’re willing to learn skills like web design, SEO, email marketing, graphic design, or editing, you can earn a lot. I know many people who simply stumbled upon learning these skills (such as by building a web design for themselves) and then turned it into a successful business. These types of freelance services usually pay $50 to $100+ per hour. You can find clients through job boards like Upwork, by networking, or even by selling your services to bloggers or local businesses by reaching out to them.

Many people in sales earn six figures or more. You could sell insurance, software, real estate, or even be a sales rep for a company. Some of these jobs can be remote, and many will give you training (they want you to succeed after all because that means you are making them money!). There are many places to find sales jobs, including: LinkedIn – This is a great place to find both remote and in-person sales roles. You can filter by industry, experience level, and location. Indeed – One of the biggest job search platforms. Search for terms like “commission sales,” “remote sales,” or “entry-level sales.” FlexJobs – This site focuses on remote and flexible work, and you may be able to find sales roles here that let you work from home. Company career pages – Many companies are always hiring for sales jobs and usually they have a job listings page. 14. Print on demand Print-on-demand is when you sell items like shirts, mugs, cards, candles, or tote bags without having to store inventory or actually physically make anything. You create designs, upload them to a site like Printify or Etsy, and they handle the rest. You earn money every time someone makes a purchase. I’ve bought many print-on-demand gifts myself, such as personalized teacher thank-you cards, funny mango shirts for my husband, and more! I recommend watching the How to Make Money with Print-On-Demand free training. In this training, you’ll learn how Emily made $500,000 in two years selling print-on-demand items, the best types of products to sell to maximize your earnings, and more. You can learn more at How I Make $7,500 Monthly Selling Print-On-Demand Gifts. 15. Freelance writing Freelance writing is one of the best ways to start making money online because you don’t need a degree and you can get started with just a laptop. When I first started as a freelance writer, I was making around $25 per article. Now, I’ve earned around $1,500 per article in some cases. I also know many other writers who earn $6,000 or more per month. You can write blog posts, newsletters, social media content, and more. You can work with bloggers, small businesses, or large companies. If you want to learn how to get started, check out my post: 14 Places To Find Freelance Writing Jobs – (How To Start With No Experience!). Bonus way to make extra money If you’re looking for something low-effort that you can do from home, Get-Paid-To (GPT) sites are a great option. These websites and apps pay you for simple tasks like taking surveys, watching videos, trying out games, and scanning your receipts. No, you won’t make thousands from GPT sites alone, but they’re a great way to stack extra income on top of your other side hustles. Many of them can be done in your downtime, like while watching TV or sitting on the couch. Here are a few of my favorite rewards apps and sites: Freecash – Get paid to play games and test new apps. I made $302 in just one week using this app – all from playing a game on my phone! American Consumer Opinion – Share your opinions and test products in quick surveys. They’re easy to qualify for and I’ve found them super beginner-friendly. Swagbucks – Earn rewards for things you’re already doing, like online shopping, watching videos, and using their search engine. I’ve earned over 100 gift cards over the years! Upside – Earn cashback when you buy gas or go out to eat. I recently got $44 in cashback from just one fill-up using this app. Fetch Rewards – Take pictures of your grocery receipts to earn free gift cards. I recently got a $50 gift card just for scanning receipts I already had. These are all apps I personally use and recommend. They’re not a get-rich-quick scheme, but they’re one of the easiest ways to increase your monthly income and get closer to your goals.

Now, if you’re not looking for a job, then the fastest way would be to sell items in your home that you already have, like electronics, jewelry, or furniture by pawning it or selling it online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I make $6,000 a month working from home?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes, you can make $6,000 a month working from home! I make over $6,000 a month from home, and I know many, many other people who do as well. Some ideas to do this include blogging, freelance writing, managing ads, and selling items through an e-commerce store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I make $6,000 a month passively?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaking $6,000 a month in passive income will take some time (usually), but some ways are affiliate marketing, renting out property, selling digital products, or investing in dividend-paying stocks. Another way that can help you reach a goal of $6,000 a month (not alone, as you’d most likely have to combine it with different side hustles) is saving your money in a high-yield savings account instead of a basic bank savings account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many hours do I need to work to earn $6,000 a month?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat depends on the job. If you’re making $30 per hour, you’d need to work 50 hours a week, but if you make $100 per hour, then it’s just 15 hours a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs $6,000 a month a good income?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes, $6,000 a month can be a good income! That adds up to $72,000 a year. It can support a comfortable life in many areas. Of course, though, it all depends on where you live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I make $6,000 a month with no experience?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many ways to make $6,000 a month, even if you have no experience, such as flipping items for resale, blogging, virtual assistant work, starting an online store, and more. You can even start small and build from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow To Make $6,000 a Month – Summary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI hope you enjoyed this article on how to make $6,000 a month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, there are many different ways to reach this income goal.
