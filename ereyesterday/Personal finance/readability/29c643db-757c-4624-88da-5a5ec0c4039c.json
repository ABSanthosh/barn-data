In this… Is Rover worth it? Have you been thinking about turning your love for pets into extra cash? Rover is a pet-sitting and dog-walking platform, great for people looking to get started in this side hustle. I have personally made money on Rover as a dog walker and sitter, so I know it’s real! In this article, I’ll go over: How much money you can make on Rover How to get started on Rover Benefits of using Rover Alternatives to Rover My personal experience on Rover as a dog walker Whether you’re looking for a flexible side hustle to make extra money or want to spend time with animals, I’ll go over everything you need to know. Is Rover Worth It? Below is everything you need to know about making money with Rover. What is Rover? Rover is an online platform and gig app that connects pet owners with pet sitters, dog walkers, and even dog trainers. You can also sell services like dog boarding, house sitting, drop-in visits, and pet daycare (also known as doggie daycare). The platform is amazing because you can find trusted people caring for your animals while on vacation. If you’re interested in starting a side hustle, Rover is a great place to start because you need very little to get started. Sitters can also set their rates, choose their schedules, and select the type of pets they want to work with. Rover is in charge of handling payment, insurance, and customer support, so that makes it easy. Rover is available in the US, Canada, the UK, and Europe. Their app is available on iOS or Android too. You can click here to sign up for Rover. Recommended reading: How To Get Paid To Walk Why do people use Rover to find pet sitters and dog walkers? People use Rover to find pet sitters because of how easy it is to find trustworthy people on the platform. You can easily browse profiles, check availability, and book services directly through Rover. Rover also does background checks on people before approving walkers and/or sitters on the platform. Pet owners love that Rover has many filters to choose sitters or walkers to match their pet’s specific needs. For example, a pet may require extra attention and need a sitter who is comfortable administering medication. As a dog owner myself who has hired a sitter on Rover, I loved being able to read other people’s reviews on the sitter, giving me that extra peace of mind that I was making a good decision. My sister has used Rover a ton as well for dog boarding services when she goes on vacations. She has always had a good experience on Rover and really likes the site. Recommended reading: 23 Best Ways To Make Money Without A Car Benefits of starting a Rover side hustle Starting a side hustle on Rover has a ton of side hustles, including: Flexible schedule Can work as little or as much as you want Choose your clients and only accept jobs you like (many Rover dog sitters will even “interview” the pet parents before accepting a job to make sure it’s a good fit for everyone) Low to no start-up costs Good earning potential, especially once you get consistent clients Get paid for doing something you love Supplementary income to help pay off debt or just have extra cash flow Recommended reading: How I Earned Up to $4,000 Per Month Baking Dog Treats (With Zero Baking Experience!) How much money can you make on Rover? The amount of money you make on Rover varies on several factors, such as how many dogs you walk or pet-sit at a time, if you’re based in a city or small town, and the frequency of jobs. On average, dog walkers charge between $15-$30 per 30-minute walk. With multiple clients, it’s possible to earn around $100 with a few hours of work. For pet sitting and boarding, rates typically range from $25-$75 per night, depending on location, level of care required, amount of dogs, and any special instructions or care required. Someone working Rover full-time can make between $1,500-$3,000 a month, depending on demand, rates, etc. If you’re doing this part-time, you can earn between $200-$1,000 a month by picking up a few dog walking jobs a week. Rover takes a 20% service fee from your earnings, which will obviously reduce your total income. For example, if you charge $30 for a walk, you’ll earn $24 after Rover’s fees. My experience with Rover I have been a dog walker on Rover and have hired pet sitters on the platform as well. As a dog walker, I made sure to set competitive rates in the beginning, especially since I had no reviews or references. This made sure people would hire me, and as I built 5-star ratings and references from pet owners, I started increasing my rates. As a pet owner, I love the functionality and ease of finding a reliable and trustworthy pet sitter on the platform.  So, I love both sides of the Rover app! How does Rover work? How do you become a dog walker or pet sitter on Rover? To get started as a dog walker or pet sitter on Rover, you need to follow a few steps before you can start earning money. Here’s a detailed guide on how to get started on Rover: Sign up for a Rover account. Create a Rover profile that shows your services and experience with pets (for example, you may want to share your pet care experience, such as if you have worked with pets in the past or if you have pets). Rover guides you to create a profile that showcases information that pet owners care about. Add high-quality photos of yourself or even pictures of you taking care of pets. Choose the services you want to offer, such as dog walking, pet sitting, boarding, drop-in visits, and pet daycare. Set your availability. You can choose specific days and hours you’re open for bookings and block days you’re not available, like holidays or weekends. Set rates. You have full control over your pricing. Rover gives suggestions based on your location and competition, but you set the final amount. Complete a background check. The cost of this is covered by Rover. If you have relevant experience, have the pet owner leave you a testimonial on your profile. Respond to messages quickly. Pet owners prefer sitters and walkers who respond quickly. Walk dogs and watch pets. You’ll want to do a great job as these are pets that people love (of course!), and also because you people who hire you can leave reviews and testimonials on your Rover profile for everyone to see. Get paid. Pros and cons of working for Rover Working for Rover has its pros and cons, like any job. Here are some of the benefits of working for Rover: Flexible schedule You get to choose which jobs you want to take Work as little or as much as you want (this can be a part-time or full-time job) Set your rates Low to no startup costs and expenses Do something you love Rover provides pet care insurance for sitters and walkers No need to find clients on your own, Rover connects you with a large audience Now, here are some of the downsides of working for Rover. Rover has a 20% service fee, which is taken from your earnings Competitive market depending on where you live Income can fluctuate based on demand, location, or season Limited earning potential in rural areas or smaller towns Takes time to build a reputation and trust to secure regular clients No benefits like health insurance, PTO, or retirement plans Clients may cancel bookings at the last minute, disrupting your plans and income Luckily, there aren’t many things you need to have in order to get started dog walking or pet sitting either. Some things you may want include dog poop bags and some sort of dog light in case you do any dog walking services at night time. Rover alternatives If you’re exploring this side hustle but want to look at other platforms, there are several alternatives similar to Rover. Each platform has its unique features, and depending on where you live, one platform might be a better fit for you. Wag – Wag is a well-known app that connects dog walkers with pet owners. It focuses heavily on dog walking but also offers boarding, sitting, and drop-in visits. The start-up process on Wag is very similar to Rover. However, Wag takes a 40% service fee, which is much higher than Rover’s.  Care.com – Care.com is primarily known for finding babysitters, nannies, and senior care providers. However, there’s also a section for pet care services, including dog walking, pet sitting, boarding, and grooming. You can set your rates and apply to job postings from pet owners in your area. Care.com does charge a membership fee. You can learn more at 7 Best Dog Walking Apps To Make Extra Money. Frequently Asked Questions Below are common questions for people who ask, “Is Rover worth it?” Do you actually make money with Rover?  Yes, you can actually make money with Rover. How much money you make depends on a variety of factors, like your location, the demand for pet services in your area, your rates, and how often you’re working. People usually make the most money on Rover with boarding, but dog walking is a great way to earn money, too.  Success on the platform requires you to build a good reputation through positive reviews. It’s definitely not a get-rich-quick scheme but can be a rewarding way to earn extra money. How much do you get paid on Rover?  How much does Rover pay per hour? On average, dog walkers typically charge $15-$30 per dog walking job. That number increases depending on how long the walk is, how many pets are walked, and if there are any other special needs on the job.  What percentage of profit does Rover take? Rover takes a 20% service fee from the total earnings of Rover pet sitters and dog walkers. This means if you charge $100 for a service, you’ll receive $80 after Rover’s cut. This fee can seem steep, but Rover does provide you with a lot of resources like insurance, paid background checks, and customer support.  Why does Rover take fees?  Rover takes fees to cover operational costs and provides services that benefit pet sitters and pet owners. The 20% service fee helps support payment processing, customer support, marketing, and managing the Rover app. The fees also help pay for insurance coverage for sitters, giving extra peace of mind to both parties involved.  Does Rover take money out of tips? Rover does not take a percentage of your tips. Tips are considered a direct appreciation from pet owners so you get to keep 100% of this as a pet care provider when dog sitting or walking. How long does it take to get paid by Rover? Rover usually processes payments within 2 days after a service is completed, but it can take an additional 3-5 business days for the funds to appear in your bank account.  How long does it take to get approved on Rover? The approval process on Rover typically takes less than 3 days, but it can sometimes extend to a week depending on how many applications are being processed.  Do you pay taxes on Rover? Rover does not take taxes out of your pay because you are an independent contractor. That means that you will need to set aside and save money for taxes on your own (do not forget!). What is the Rover Guarantee? The Rover Guarantee covers “up to $25,000 in vet care reimbursement for eligible claims related to injury to either the pet owner’s or sitter’s pets,” “property damage to the pet owner’s home caused by a sitter or dog walker,” and 24/7 support from Rover. However, the guarantee from Rover does not cover damage to the sitter’s property or home, injury to Rover sitters and dog walkers, injuries to family members or roommates, and vet care costs beyond 30 days. Is Rover worth it? – Summary I hope you enjoyed my Rover review and that I answered your questions about making money on Rover. After everything we’ve learned and my own experience as a dog walker on Rover, I’d say it’s worth it to be a Rover dog walker and pet sitter. If you enjoy working with animals and want to pick up extra income, this is a quick way to get started with a new side hustle. I like that you can set your calendar so there’s a lot of flexibility and I also like that I can meet new furry friends (I love animals!). You can click here to sign up for Rover.

It focuses heavily on dog walking but also offers boarding, sitting, and drop-in visits. The start-up process on Wag is very similar to Rover. However, Wag takes a 40% service fee, which is much higher than Rover’s. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCare.com\u003c/strong\u003e – Care.com is primarily known for finding babysitters, nannies, and senior care providers.

How much money you make depends on a variety of factors, like your location, the demand for pet services in your area, your rates, and how often you’re working. People usually make the most money on Rover with boarding, but dog walking is a great way to earn money, too. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSuccess on the platform requires you to build a good reputation through positive reviews.

That number increases depending on how long the walk is, how many pets are walked, and if there are any other special needs on the job. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat percentage of profit does Rover take?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRover takes a 20% service fee from the total earnings of Rover pet sitters and dog walkers. This means if you charge $100 for a service, you’ll receive $80 after Rover’s cut. This fee can seem steep, but Rover does provide you with a lot of resources like insurance, paid background checks, and customer support. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy does Rover take fees? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRover takes fees to cover operational costs and provides services that benefit pet sitters and pet owners. The 20% service fee helps support payment processing, customer support, marketing, and managing the Rover app. The fees also help pay for insurance coverage for sitters, giving extra peace of mind to both parties involved. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes Rover take money out of tips?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRover does not take a percentage of your tips.
