In addition to a small time commitment, your earnings can make a notable difference in paying the bills and saving up for upcoming purchases. I repeatedly use several of these money-making ideas to pad my wallet. 15 Real Ways to Get $20 Fast 1. American Consumer Opinion 2. Scan Receipts with Fetch Rewards 7. Sell Clothes on Poshmark 9. Rent Out Storage Space with Neighbor 13. Sell Your Stuff Online How to Get $20 Fast – Summary Here are several activities to help you get $20 quickly, online and locally. 1. American Consumer Opinion American Consumer Opinion rewards you for answering surveys, testing products, and sharing your thoughts on new advertising campaigns. Most opportunities take approximately 10 minutes to shape product ideas and optimize marketing strategies.  You will receive a monthly screener questionnaire to help you qualify for new studies. At a minimum, anticipate receiving several survey invites per year matching your interests and shopping habits. Depending on the topic and your background, you may be invited to participate in follow-up surveys or online focus groups. These opportunities pay more and delve deeper. After earning $10, cash payments are available through Hyperwallet or PayPal. 2. Scan Receipts with Fetch Rewards Grocery shopping can be a rewarding way to earn cash back by purchasing sponsored brands. I regularly use Fetch Rewards for its simplicity. You save time since you don’t have to activate offers before paying, as similar apps require. You only have to link your grocery delivery account or scan the store receipt to receive credit. Next, the app automatically awards bonus points for any qualifying products in your cart. This app has the most earning potential when you buy name brands.  You will also earn points for these transactions: Scan non-grocery receipts  Upload online orders (link to an email or shopping account)  Fill discounted GoodRx prescriptions Play mobile games Gift card redemptions start at $3 for Amazon.com and $5 for most merchants. Frustratingly, Visa prepaid cards are the only option for cash redemptions.    3. Fiverr Freelancing online through Fiverr can be a flexible way to make money online using your creative skills. You can charge as little as $5 per project and more for advanced packages. Popular services include: AI development Graphics and design Music and audio Programing Social media management Video and animation In total, over 200 gig categories are available, offering both full-time and part-time work. It’s free to join, and you can create a dynamic portfolio to engage with potential customers. Receiving good ratings from clients helps boost your profile exposure. While you must wait for customers to hire you, I like that you receive payment within days of delivering the final product and can earn tips.  4. Freelance Writing Becoming a freelance writer is one of the highest-paying ideas on this list, as you can utilize your professional experience or a long-time hobby. I’ve been writing online for a decade, and it’s been a rewarding way to educate others. Some of today’s most promising areas include: Copywriting Email newsletters Fiction Scriptwriting Technical Translation Start a blog and share your portfolio on social media networks like LinkedIn to network with fellow writers and potential clients. If you have no experience, Upwork is an excellent platform for entry-level assignments, and you can bid on openings. It is also effective after establishing an online presence by writing samples, choosing a niche, and cold-pitching publications and websites.  5. Ibotta Ibotta is an exciting grocery rewards app for in-store and online orders. The offers tend to have higher payouts as you activate them before paying. This can be a great way to make $20 fast. I use this app periodically. You can combine the in-app savings with your linked loyalty cards. You will see store-specific offers for your preferred retailers. It’s easy to compare potential savings if you shop at multiple supermarkets.   Using the mobile app or browser extension, you can also shop online for merchandise and book travel for cash rewards. The app offers a wider variety of offers than other receipt-scanning apps.  After earning a $20 balance, you can cash out through a bank account or a gift card. As a new user, you will also receive a cash bonus after successful shopping trips.    6. Rakuten Rakuten was the first cashback shopping app I used, and it remains one of my favorites due to its ease of use and competitive earning potential. By activating a shopping session through the app or browser extension, you can earn cash back at thousands of online merchants. The app can also automatically apply coupon codes and compare product prices. Thus, you can compound your savings without working harder to find a good deal. Their customer service team has the best response quality among shopping rewards apps. In-store cashback is available at participating department stores and restaurants when you pay with a linked debit or credit card. You activate offers before paying, and the app tracks your purchase activity. You can receive payments quarterly via PayPal or paper check after your balance reaches $5.01. Further, receive a $30 bonus after your first purchase. 7. Sell Clothes on Poshmark In my experience with cleaning out our wardrobe, you usually earn more by selling designer clothing on Poshmark, and it is an easy way to make $20 fast. The platform is excellent for listing these clothing and accessories:  Men’s Women’s Children’s Pets Select home goods can also be listed by quickly uploading snapshots from your phone and setting your sales price. The buyer pays shipping costs, and you receive a prepaid USPS expedited shipping label.  You will receive payment after the buyer confirms that they received the item. All transactions qualify for seller protection. Orders exceeding $500 qualify for free authentication. Cashout methods include direct deposit, PayPal, and Venmo. 8. Survey Junkie Online surveys are a quick and classic way to get $20 fast. I’ve tried many platforms over the past 20 years and Survey Junkie is one of my favorites since you can attempt several per day. Most studies require 20 minutes or less of your time, and the pay potential differs by length and topic. You can earn a few dollars per completed survey and more if you qualify for extended studies or follow-ups.  The platform also has a Surf to Earn feature, where you can anonymously share your web browsing activity to earn cash monthly. This perk also helps you qualify for exclusive studies, focus groups, and product tests. You can request payment by PayPal, bank transfer, or gift cards with a $5 balance.  9. Rent Out Storage Space with Neighbor Do you have extra storage space or an empty parking area? Neighbor lets you connect with community members to store their extra belongings or spare vehicles on a month-to-month basis.  You get to screen the renter, decide which possessions to store, and determine the access hours. Moreover, the platform provides $1 million in host liability coverage.   Neighbor.com collects a monthly payment from the buyer and automatically transfers it to your bank account. The platform also provides customer support and you can list your space in as little as 10 minutes. I like this side hustle because it requires less ongoing effort than short-term rentals and has no startup costs. 10. Swagbucks Swagbucks is one of my favorite micro-task sites, as you have multiple ways of earning supplemental income, such as: Games Product trials Surveys Shopping There are many free opportunities, although those with higher payouts require a purchase. Completing a paid activity only takes a few minutes.  I love shopping deals. I also love accumulating cash rewards by shopping online, collecting in-store savings, and getting up to 20% cash back on gift cards.  You can earn bonus rewards by completing weekly and monthly challenges. You earn redeemable points for gift cards or PayPal Cash starting at $5. 11. Pinecone Research Pinecone Research operates one of the most respected online survey communities, thanks to its high pay rates and unique study topics. The caveat is that you must apply for membership. You may have to join a waitlist for your age range. Most studies focus on your shopping habits and brand preferences with a brief online survey. You may also be able to try out grocery items, merchandise, and watch pilot shows, accompanied by a short survey.  Anticipate earning $3 per survey and cashing out immediately to your bank account. The number of survey invites you receive depends on your profile and current needs. Most panelists answer at least one per month. I think it’s worth applying as you can earn more per study than on similar sites. However, you should still utilize other survey apps for daily surveys and consistent income. 12. PrizeRebel Complete surveys and browse the PrizeRebel offer walls to earn cash, crypto, or gift card rewards. Daily login bonuses and weekly earning streaks help you progress up the loyalty program tiers and make your efforts more rewarding. I appreciate the ability to complete paid surveys from eight networks. Having multiple options helps you find the best balance between time commitment and pay rate. You also have more opportunities to complete several daily studies to increase your earnings. The offer walls primarily let you earn points by playing games and downloading free or paid apps. It’s worth comparing payout amounts to calculate your earning potential. You have affordable and flexible redemption options, starting at $5: Gift cards PayPal BitPay ACH bank transfer ($10) Venmo ($10)    13. Sell Your Stuff Online I use several apps to sell unwanted items locally and online instead of donating them or tossing them in the household trash. This is one of the easiest ways to make $20 fast. The best app for selling depends on the product category. For example, I like eBay for small items as it receives lots of traffic and offers discounted shipping rates. You can estimate your earning potential upfront and receive payment in a linked bank account. You should also try listing on specialized platforms for valuable items, such as:  Books Clothing Coins Jewelry Phones I also highly recommend trying to sell locally on apps like Facebook Marketplace. First, it’s fee-free to list. Second, you avoid expensive shipping for bulky items, like the dishwasher I recently sold.     14. Freecash Get $20 fast by completing surveys, games, and signup offers on Freecash.com. This get-paid-to site has over 500 offers on your mobile device or desktop. It’s free to join, and there are plenty of purchase-free opportunities. Most offers pay a few bucks when you sign up or complete in-game milestones, while advanced promotions pay $40 to $100. The tiered payouts help you cash out sooner and choose another offer when ready for a change of scenery.  Bank and PayPal transfers are available with a minimum balance of $5. New users can withdraw to a Bitcoin address after earning $2. Finally, Stake.com redemptions qualify for bonus cash if you prefer gaming rewards. Read our Freecash Review. 15. User Interviews Consider User Interviews for high-paying online research studies instead of your run-of-the-mill consumer opinion survey. Over 2,500 new studies open each month, with most being online surveys or interviews that require webcam and audio capabilities. The average study pays $50 and lasts 30 minutes to two hours. In-person interviews and multi-day online studies typically pay up to $300. Most require a webcam and audio capability for live interactions. Recent study topics include: Industry expert interviews Product testing Usability testing of websites and apps Healthcare, sales, and IT backgrounds will qualify for most studies. Applying for more studies helps you receive personalized invitations and higher qualification probabilities. All studies pay out with a gift card, and there are dozens to choose from. How to Get $20 Fast – Summary Making extra money doesn’t require getting a second job or having advanced skills. You can make $20 fast, even on a limited schedule. Consider starting with one income idea and gradually expanding to several more niches and platforms to find the most lucrative option.    Recommended Reading",
