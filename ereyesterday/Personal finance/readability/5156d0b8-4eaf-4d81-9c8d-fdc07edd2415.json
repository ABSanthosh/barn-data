  "text": "As Spirit Airlines emerges from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the ultra-low-cost carrier has quietly reinstated one of its infamous passenger fees. For tickets purchased after Feb. 5, 2025, cancellation and change fees will apply once more on “Go” fares, the airline’s version of basic economy. The move comes less than a year after the airline eliminated these fees as part of a larger brand overhaul. Now the fees are back — although they don't apply to all fare types, as they did previously.Still, in some cases, the change and cancellation fees charged by Spirit could eclipse the actual price of the tickets purchased.Here’s everything you need to know about this latest change and how you can avoid it altogether.Fees to change your ticketChange and cancellation fees are still waived on Spirit's more expensive fares, Go Savvy, Go Comfy and Go Big. And for flights more than 60 days or more in advance, change fees remain free on Go fares. But for travel within 60 days on Go fares, these are the fees you can expect to pay:Changing flights within 31–59 days of departure: $59.Changing flights within seven to 30 days of departure: $79.Changing flights within seven days: $99.These fees apply to tickets purchased on or after Feb. 5, 2025. If you bought your ticket before that date, these newly added fees don’t apply.Fees to cancel your ticketTo cancel a Go fare entirely, there is a $99 cancellation fee that applies to tickets that were purchased after Feb. 5, 2025. Tickets purchased before that date are exempt from this new surcharge. Bookings that are canceled 24 hours after the initial purchase for flights more than seven days out are still eligible for free cancellations and refunds to your original payment method, in accordance with federal requirements. Outside of that time frame, you can get a travel credit from Spirit. For Go fare cancellations, that credit will be reduced by the cancellation fee. If the cancellation fee exceeds the fare, you won’t get a credit.Travel credits must be redeemed online; phone or airport agents are unable to apply them. The credit covers everything from the base fare of the ticket to fees like checked or carry-on bags, seat assignments and government taxes.There are also fees to make a group name change to your ticket within 30 days of departure, which remain at $50. If you do not show up for your flight (either on purpose or due to another reason), you lose the entire value of the ticket, plus service charges, taxes and fees. If you do not plan on using the ticket, paying the $99 cancellation fee and getting a travel credit for future use might be cheaper than just not showing up.How to avoid Spirit change and cancellation feesIf you are uncertain about your plans, it is best to opt for a Go Savvy fare (or higher), to avoid fees for changes or cancellations. You'll still get a travel credit if you cancel more than 24 hours after booking or less than seven days out from your departure, but your credit won't be reduced by $99, as it would with a canceled Go fare.Other recent improvements remain, for nowDespite making this change to Go fares, the airline is still moving forward with an onboard experience overhaul announced in 2024 that added perks like free Wi-Fi for Free Spirit Gold elite status members or those that purchase a Go Big fare. Other changes included a more generous bag size, as well as extending the time limit that you can use most travel credits to a full year, rather than 90 days. (Credits issued because of flight cancellations or changes are valid for five years.) As of publishing, there are no changes to these improvements.How to maximize your rewards",
