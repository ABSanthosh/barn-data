  "text": "Regular users of the GasBuddy app, which helps you find cheap gas and snag discounts on fill-ups, may be interested in the Pay with GasBuddy+ charge card. It is the successor to the Pay with GasBuddy fuel card, which will be discontinued sometime in 2025.Issued by Fifth Third Bank, the Pay with GasBuddy+ card advertises savings of up to 33 cents per gallon. Such a discount is a great deal — but there are some caveats that make it unlikely you’ll get those savings every time. Here are five things to know about the Pay with GasBuddy+ card.1. It’s a charge card, not a credit cardImage courtesy of GasBuddyThe Pay with GasBuddy+ is a charge card, so you won't be able to carry a balance month to month as you would with a traditional credit card. Instead, you must pay off the balance in full — either with autopay or manual bill pay. The autopay option has some meaningful perks, which we discuss later. 2. A credit check isn’t requiredYou can get the GasBuddy+ card without a hard pull on your credit report, meaning you'll avoid the temporary ding to your credit scores that such an inquiry can typically cause. To qualify for the card, you must be at least 18 years old, live in the U.S., and have an eligible bank account. You will link your bank account to the GasBuddy+ card during the application process and use it to pay off the card’s balance.As noted earlier, GasBuddy cardholders can opt for automatic or manual bill pay. If you choose the latter, you'll get a statement every week and must pay off the balance within seven days.But if you choose autopay, you'll get the following benefits:A discount of 3 cents per gallon, which rises to 5 cents per gallon at select gas stations. The ability to earn an additional 3-cents-per-gallon discount for every $25 spent at the gas station convenience store.A spending limit of $100 per day and $400 per week. If you pay your bill manually, you’ll get a $50 weekly spending limit. The ability to sign up for a GasBuddy Plus or Premium membership. Both tiers offer additional savings on gas, and Premium members get roadside assistance that includes towing and lockout services. Plus costs $89 a year or $7.99 a month; Premium costs $99 a year or $9.99 a month.4. Getting the maximum discount on gas requires some workSaving 33 cents per gallon with the GasBuddy+ card is far from a sure thing. To get to that number, you’ll need to stack one discount on top of the other. Here’s how the math shakes out:As noted above, GasBuddy+ cardholders enrolled in autopay can get up to 5 cents off at select gas stations. Also per above, autopay participants get an additional 3 cents per gallon discount for every $25 spent on non-fuel purchases inside convenience stores. If you activate a Deal Alert in the GasBuddy app, you could get up to 25 cents per gallon off. Discounts from Deal Alerts and convenience store shopping stack on top of the 5-cents-per-gallon discount, equaling a maximum savings of 33 cents per gallon.Rewards earned on gas and convenience purchases are automatically redeemed at your next fill-up when you pay with a GasBuddy+ card. Unused rewards expire after 12 months.Earning rewards on gas doesn’t have to be so complicated. Consider the Citi Custom Cash® Card. It automatically earns 5% cash back in your top spending category on up to $500 each billing cycle, then 1% after hitting the cap. Gas stations are one of the eligible bonus categories. 5. It’s light on feesThe GasBuddy+ card doesn’t have an annual fee, and because it’s a charge card, there’s no APR or late fees, either. However, there’s a $3.50 card replacement fee and a $15 returned payment fee. Information related to the Citi Custom Cash® Card has been collected by NerdWallet and has not been reviewed or provided by the issuer of this card.",
