  "text": "Source: The College InvestorWarren Buffett, with a net worth of approximately $151 billion, has pledged to donate 99.5% of his wealth.Buffett emphasizes the importance of discussing estate plans openly with heirs, urging parents to explain their wills before signing to avoid posthumous confusion or conflict.Advocating against dynastic wealth, Buffett ensures his children inherit enough to succeed independently without fostering dependence. Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old investing titan and Berkshire Hathaway CEO, has revealed his most detailed plans yet for distributing his monumental fortune.In a letter released Monday, Buffett announced a new tranche of donations and shared timeless advice for estate planning.In a move reflecting his lifelong commitment to philanthropy, Buffett stated that 99.5% of his wealth will be donated, largely through annual gifts to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after his late wife, as well as foundations led by his children. The remaining wealth will be dispersed after his death.According to Forbes, Warren Buffett is currently estimated to have a net worth of $151 billion.About Warren Buffett And Berkshire HathawayWarren Buffett’s leadership of Berkshire Hathaway, an American multinational conglomerate headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, has solidified his status as one of history’s most successful investors.Originally a textile manufacturing company founded in 1839, Berkshire transformed under Buffett’s guidance starting in 1965 into a holding company with a portfolio spanning diverse industries.Notable wholly owned businesses include GEICO, Dairy Queen, BNSF Railway, and Duracell, while its significant public holdings include Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola.Berkshire Hathaway is renowned for its shareholder returns, with a compound annual growth rate of 19.8% from 1965 to 2023, far surpassing the S\u0026P 500 over the same period. Despite a market valuation exceeding $1 trillion, Buffett has maintained his philosophy of long-term investment in “evergreen” businesses, avoiding excessive speculation and prioritizing consistent value creation.Related: Warren Buffett's Best Investing TipsEstate Planning LegacyReflecting on mortality, Buffett wrote, “Father time always wins… To date, I’ve been very lucky, but, before long, he will get around to me.” He underscored that dynastic wealth is not his aim; instead, he views philanthropy as a vehicle to promote equality and opportunity for all.Buffett’s latest donation also reinforces his 2006 pledge to give away his wealth. To date, he has donated more than $50 billion, a testament to the power of compounded returns and the responsibility he feels to redistribute his success. By encouraging thoughtful wealth distribution and open family discussions, Buffett provides a blueprint not just for billionaires, but for any family managing their legacy.Buffett’s words resonate as a call to action for families to plan with transparency and foresight. His insistence on a “unanimous decision” clause in his trusts is emblematic of his belief in thoughtful collaboration over unilateral authority, ensuring that his philanthropic impact endures far beyond his lifetime.Don't Miss These Other Stories: Robert Farrington is America’s Millennial Money Expert® and America’s Student Loan Debt Expert™, and the founder of The College Investor, a personal finance site dedicated to helping millennials escape student loan debt to start investing and building wealth for the future.
