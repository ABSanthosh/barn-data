These days, it’s easy to assume that all the good stuff is tucked away in first class or reserved for travelers with elite frequent flyer status. But here’s the secret airlines don’t advertise: there are still perks available in coach—plenty of them. You just have to know what to ask for (and how).Savvy travelers know how to tap into the hidden world of freebies even when flying at the lowest fare. From extra snacks to better seats and even comfort upgrades, these often-overlooked benefits are available to anyone willing to ask. Here are 10 airline freebies you can snag in coach without elite status and how to get them.1. Extra Snacks and DrinksThink you’re limited to one tiny cookie or bag of pretzels? Think again. Flight attendants often have extra snacks and beverages on hand, especially on longer routes or underbooked flights. If you’re polite and wait until after the initial service, you can ask if any extras are available. Many attendants will gladly hand over a second round of chips, cookies, or a can of soda if supplies allow. Just remember: kindness and timing are everything.2. Better Seats (If You Ask Early)Most travelers assume seat assignments are final, but seats can shift right up to boarding. If you’re flying solo and check in early, ask at the gate if there are any aisle or window seats available. Gate agents are often willing to accommodate reasonable requests, especially if you’re courteous. On lightly loaded flights, you may even score an empty seat next to you, giving you more breathing room without paying extra. The key is asking. Most passengers never think to.3. Kids’ Activity KitsFlying with children? Many airlines stock activity kits for young travelers to help them stay entertained. These can include coloring books, crayons, stickers, and small toys. They’re not always automatically handed out, but they’re usually available upon request—especially on long-haul flights. It’s worth asking a flight attendant during boarding or early in the flight. It not only keeps the kids busy but makes the trip more enjoyable for everyone around you.4. Wipes, Toothbrushes, and Basic ToiletriesIf you’re on an overnight or long international flight, airlines often carry basic toiletries. Yes, even for coach passengers. These can include toothbrushes, toothpaste, earplugs, and even moist towelettes. While they’re more common in business or first class, flight attendants usually have a few extras tucked away for those who ask. It’s a great way to freshen up before landing, especially if you’ve got a connection or meeting waiting. Just ask politely. It costs them nothing to offer.5. Blankets and PillowsNot every airline automatically places blankets and pillows at every economy seat, but that doesn’t mean they’re not available. Supplies are often limited, but if you ask early, especially right after boarding, you can usually score one. On red-eye and international flights, there’s a good chance extras are tucked in overhead bins or closets. It’s worth checking, especially if you’re planning to sleep. If the flight is cold, this little comfort can make all the difference.Image source: Unsplash6. Headphones or EarbudsIn-flight entertainment systems are standard on many flights, but what if you forget your headphones? Most airlines still carry basic earbuds, even in coach. While they’re not high-end, they’re free or just a nominal charge, and some flight attendants won’t even mention the charge if you’re polite and ask early. They’re perfect for watching a movie or just tuning out cabin noise. And yes, they’re yours to keep.7. Refills of Hot DrinksAfter your cup of coffee or tea is gone, it’s easy to assume that’s it, but many flight attendants are more than happy to refill your cup. If there’s leftover coffee or hot water on board, there’s no reason you can’t enjoy another round. This is especially appreciated on early morning or red-eye flights when you want to stay alert or warm. Simply walk to the galley and ask kindly—most of the time, they’ll say yes. It’s a perk frequent travelers never forget to request.8. Medical Supplies and First-Aid ItemsIf you get a headache or feel airsick, don’t suffer in silence. Airlines carry basic first-aid supplies, including bandages, pain relievers (like aspirin or acetaminophen), and motion sickness tablets. These aren’t handed out casually, but they are available to passengers in need. Just alert a flight attendant and explain the issue. They’re trained to handle these requests discreetly and quickly—your comfort and health matter, even in coach.9. Cabin Tours (For Kids—or Curious Adults)If you’ve got a young traveler or you’re an aviation enthusiast yourself, some pilots and flight attendants are happy to offer a quick look inside the cockpit once the plane is at the gate. Post-9/11 rules make this more restrictive, but pre- or post-flight cockpit visits are sometimes possible if you ask nicely. This can be an unforgettable moment for kids and a surprisingly cool experience for adults, too. It all comes down to timing and polite inquiry—many airline crews appreciate a passenger’s curiosity.10. Commemorative Wings or CertificatesRemember those plastic pilot wings kids used to get? They still exist! Some airlines give them out to young flyers—or even to adults who ask for a fun souvenir. On milestone flights (like your first flight, birthday, or honeymoon), some airlines also offer commemorative certificates. These little touches don’t cost the airline anything but add a memorable touch to your travel. Let a crew member know it’s a special occasion—they may surprise you with something small and delightful.Coach Doesn’t Have to Mean CutbacksYou don’t need to be in first class or rack up thousands of frequent flyer miles to enjoy perks while flying. With a little politeness, good timing, and a willingness to ask, economy-class passengers can still tap into a surprising range of freebies. Whether you’re looking for extra snacks, a better seat, or just a little more comfort, most airlines are more accommodating than they let on. Next time you fly, don’t just settle. Speak up and make the most of what’s already available.Have you ever scored a surprise freebie while flying coach?
