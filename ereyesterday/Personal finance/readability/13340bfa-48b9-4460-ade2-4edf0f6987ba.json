If you’ve enjoyed my writing on Financial Samurai over the past 16 years, you’re going to love this book out on May 6, 2025. With over 30 years of experience working in finance, writing about finance, studying finance, and becoming a millionaire at age 28 in 2005, I’ve poured everything I know into this book. Millionaire Milestones is packed with practical, modern strategies to help you become a millionaire in your lifetime with the freedom to live life on your terms. I believe almost anyone can become a millionaire, but the data tells a different story—only about 10% of Americans are millionaires, and that percentage drops to 6–7% if you exclude primary home equity. Despite the abundance of financial advice out there, there hasn’t been a practical and powerful guide that simplifies the path to millionaire status. That’s where Millionaire Milestones comes in. I want to make you rich and I want to make your children financially independent from you! What's Inside My New Book This book breaks down the data behind millionaire households and shows you how to build wealth through: Stocks and Bonds Real Estate Alternative Investments Entrepreneurship Your Career There isn’t just one way to become a millionaire. My goal is to help you master multiple strategies so you can not only reach seven figures but also build a foundation to become a multi-millionaire. Not only will my book guide you in building far greater wealth than the average person, but it will also teach you how to spend it wisely to enjoy life responsibly and preserve it for generations to come. With a looming recession and tremendous uncertainty in the economy and stock market, it's now more important than ever to boost your financial acumen. Why Becoming a Millionaire Is Growing In Necessity Thanks to inflation, becoming a millionaire today is almost becoming more of a requirement for financial security. Back in the 1980s, being a millionaire meant you were living a fabulous lifestyle. Today, having $1 million might mean a modest middle-class lifestyle, especially if you have kids and live in a big city. With $1 million in investable assets, you can safely withdraw $30,000–$50,000 annually in retirement. Combined with Social Security, you're doing well, but it’s far from living large. As inflation continues to eat at our purchasing power, aiming for millionaire status grows in importance—and why Millionaire Milestones is here to help you achieve it. As a hard worker who doesn’t make excuses for life’s many challenges, I want you to live the life that you want and deserve. Life As A Millionaire Is Better Than Not Only the rich and the poor say money can't buy happiness. But here’s the truth: money can buy freedom, options, peace of mind, and satisfaction. The feeling of knowing you’ve worked hard and can now live life on your terms is unmatched. And if you’re a parent, there’s no greater joy than being able to provide for your family without constant financial stress. Think about Millionaire Milestones as the modern-day version of the all-time classic book, The Millionaire Next Door. Times have changed, and in my new book, I share the latest strategies on how to build more wealth than most. When you become a millionaire, life changes in meaningful ways: Confidence grows. You gain the courage to pursue your passions and speak your mind. Authenticity matters more than approval. You no longer have to pretend that you are someone you are not or toe the company line to keep a paycheck. Boundaries become easier. You can tell those who’ve wronged you to take a hike—if you feel like it. Family becomes a focus. You gain the courage to settle down and start a family. Time works in your favor. You can retire earlier, maximizing happiness and freedom for longer. Safety improves. You can live in safer neighborhoods and drive reliable cars that protect your loved ones. Parenting becomes more rewarding. You can spend more time with your kids during their crucial early years and provide opportunities you didn’t have. Worry less about rejection. Your kids’ futures don’t rest entirely on getting into top colleges or landing lucrative jobs they don’t like—they’ll have a safety net. Rejections will also sting less for you too, which means you’re more willing to take more risks and potentially gain greater financial reward and satisfaction. Compete more effectively in a rigged system. The world may not be fair, but with more resources, you can help make it more just. Generosity becomes easier. You gain the flexibility to start passion projects and help others for free. You can also contribute more to charity, which always feels better than receiving. Comfort improves. And perhaps my favorite benefit of being a millionaire: you no longer have to endure the back row of Economy class next to the toilets! Such inconveniences build character, but eventually, it gets old and you want to enjoy the nicer things in life a little more. Reaching a $3 million net worth that generated about $80,000 in passive income was my turning point. At age 34, in 2012, I walked away from a multiple six-figure job in investment banking. The money was great, but the freedom? That was priceless. Nothing beats the feeling of being able to do what you want when you want. Here’s the amazing part: once you hit that first million in investable assets, the next million—and the one after that—gets easier and easier. Let’s make it happen! Your One Life to Build Wealth 90% of people are missing out on the financial freedom they deserve. Millionaire Milestones is designed to teach you how to go beyond the average—beyond the people who don’t read personal finance books, listen to podcasts, or seek financial guidance. You’ve only got one life to build wealth for yourself and your family. Why not learn how to make the most of it? With practical advice, proven strategies, and a clear path to financial independence, Millionaire Milestones is your guide to building lasting wealth and creating the life you’ve always wanted.

Advanced Praise For Millionaire Milestones “As the pioneer of the modern-day FIRE movement, Dogen brings a fresh take on wealth-building strategies. Packed with practical advice on investing, entrepreneurship, and financial planning, this book empowers readers to surpass their financial goals and live the life they deserve.” —Jamie Fiore Higgins, Author of Bully Market and ex- MD at Goldman Sachs “Building durable wealth has never been simple or easy. The problem is compounded by the constantly changing financial landscape. What worked yesterday no longer works today. What works today may not be appropriate tomorrow. Fortunately, Sam Dogen’s Millionaire Milestones is an easy-to-read, clear-thinking guide to achieving that seven-figure nirvana. Sam never belabors the obvious nor trods the beaten path. His recommendations are always profoundly insightful, innovative, and fresh. And they are confirmed by his own personal success! If you haven’t been able to achieve the wealth you dream of, I recommend Sam’s book. It will kick-start you to a more financially rewarding life.” —Bill Bengen, Father of the 4% Rule Sam Dogen is one of the most original thinkers in personal finance. What sets Sam apart is extremely actionable insights, helpful benchmarks and doing it all while prioritizing his family!”  —Noah Kagan, CEO of AppSumo and NYT Best-selling author of Million Dollar Weekend  “Millionaire Milestones is the ultimate playbook for anyone ready to take control of their financial future. With clear, actionable strategies for investing, entrepreneurship, and wealth-building, Sam inspires you to think bigger and achieve more. This book isn’t just about money. It’s about creating freedom to live life on your terms.” —Humphrey Yang, Personal Finance YouTuber with 1.5+ Million Subscribers “With surgical precision and refreshing candor, Sam Dogen dismantles the mythology surrounding wealth creation and replaces it with something far more valuable: a realistic roadmap to financial independence. Drawing from his own journey from Wall Street grinder to self-made millionaire, Dogen doesn't just tell you to save and invest — he shows you exactly how to think about money, deploy capital strategically, and avoid the psychological traps that derail even the smartest investors. The result is a masterwork of practical wisdom that transforms the complex into the actionable. For anyone serious about building lasting wealth while maintaining their soul, this book isn't just useful — it's essential.”  — Jimmy Soni, best-selling author of The Founders “I grew up poor and in public housing, with no one to teach me about money or any good role models. Learning about money always intimidated me, but Millionaire Milestones is the first book I've read that makes everything make sense in an approachable way. Sam not only provides both the tactics and the strategies to help you make the most of your money but there's a healthy dose of solid life advice to help you earn and save more. Highly recommended!” —Ed Latimore, Author and Former Heavyweight Boxer “Millionaire Milestones is an indispensable guide to building wealth at any stage of life. What I appreciated most about this book is that it doesn't treat money as an end in and of itself, but rather as a means to a life well lived. Dogen breaks down how to live a rich life in way that's accessible to everyone.”  —Simone Stolzoff, author of The Good Enough Job Sam Dogen achieved millionaire status by age 28, and now he’s sharing the blueprint. In Millionaire Milestones, Dogen revitalizes Napoleon Hill's timeless principles with seven clear, actionable steps. From uncovering your “why” to sharpening your focus and taking bold action, this book lays out everything you need to build the wealth and life you deserve. —Joe Saul-Sehy, creator and co-host Stacking Benjamins “Millionaire Milestones is going to change the way you think about money.
