  "text": "Moving out at 18 is an exciting milestone, but it also comes with new challenges and responsibilities. This guide covers essential steps to prepare you for a smooth transition into independent living, from gaining financial stability to settling into your new home. Phase 1: Get Financially Stable Before thinking about moving out, I strongly recommend you get yourself financially stable first. Here are a few ways you can get income to support yourself before moving out. Traditional employment The easiest way you can start supporting yourself is to find an entry-level job. Many retail, food service or customer service jobs don’t require a college degree and you can pretty much get yourself started right away. These jobs are usually at the front-line where you’ll have to interact with many customers every day, and you can use this as an opportunity to improve your social skills with adults, and also hone some sales skills in the process. You can find these jobs in local malls, grocery stores, or restaurants.Here’s a pro tip: you don’t always need to apply online. Walk into these places, ask to speak with the manager, and hand in your resume. Dress well—first impressions matter! Be ready to interview on the spot, or schedule one for the next day. I’ve got interview tips on my blog, so check that out before you head in! Freelancing and gig economy If you’re looking for flexibility and want to use your skills to earn, freelancing or gig work might be a great fit. Websites like Upwork and Fiverr make it super easy to offer services like writing, graphic design, or even social media management. The great part? You get to set your own hours and rates, and the more work you put in, the higher your income potential could be.This type of work can be a better option if you prefer more independence or want to work from home. It’s also a good way to build up your portfolio, which can help you secure better-paying gigs in the future. The key is to choose something you enjoy and feel confident in, so you can really start seeing the financial benefits without burning out.If you’re not sure where to start, think about your hobbies or talents. Are you good at writing, editing videos, or making digital art? These are in-demand skills that businesses need! Just create a profile, list your services, and start applying for gigs. And don’t worry if you’re starting out small—every project gets you closer to being a pro in the freelance world. Making money online Want to make money online? It’s totally possible and can be super fun if you tap into something you’re passionate about. Have a hobby or interest that you love? Turn it into content creation! You could start a blog or YouTube channel about topics you care about. You don’t need fancy equipment or a huge following right away—just start creating and building your audience.If gaming is your thing, why not try streaming on platforms like Twitch? Lots of people turn their love for gaming into a source of income by connecting with their audience through live streams.And if you’re more of the creative type, there are also platforms like Etsy where you can sell handmade products. Whether it’s jewelry, crafts, or even digital art, you can set up a shop and start earning from your talents. You’ll be your own boss, and you get to choose what you want to do. Local services Sometimes, making money is as simple as helping out your neighbors. Think about offering local services like pet-sitting, dog-walking, or even starting a small cleaning or lawn care business. A lot of people in your community could use these services, and it’s a great way to build connections while making some cash.If you’re good at school subjects like math, science, or languages, tutoring is another option. You can either tutor kids in your neighborhood or advertise online to reach more people. Tutoring is a flexible way to make extra money and can even help you improve your own skills in the process. Seasonal work If you want to pick up work during certain times of the year, seasonal jobs can be a perfect fit. During the holidays, stores are always hiring more staff to help with the shopping rush, and summer brings opportunities for camp counselors, resort staff, and local attractions.These jobs are usually short-term, but they can give you a nice financial boost when you need it most—plus, you’ll gain some work experience that can help you in the future. Keep an eye out for these positions when the seasons change, and be ready to apply early since these roles can fill up quickly. Phase 2: Preparing To Move Out After you have gotten yourself financially stable, it’ll be good for you to spend some time preparing to move out in order to reduce the chances of making bad mistakes when you’re out on your own. In this section, I’ll show you what you need to cover before moving out. Organize your finances Once you’ve decided you’re ready to move, it’s time to get serious about your budget. Start by listing all of your expected expenses—things like rent, groceries, transportation, and entertainment—and figure out how much you’ll need to set aside each month. It’s also a good idea to open separate checking and savings accounts to make keeping track of your spending and savings more manageable. I’ve got some great budgeting templates and recommendations to help you get started.If you’re thinking about building credit, look into getting a secured credit card or becoming an authorized user on someone else’s card, like a parent. This can help you start building good credit, which will be pretty useful down the line when you’re applying for things like a lease or even loans. Setting good habits early is the key to long-term financial success! Master essential life skills Living on your own means handling everything that comes with running a household, so now’s the time to learn those crucial life skills. Start with basic cooking—being able to whip up easy, affordable meals will save you a lot of money (and keep you from ordering takeout too much).Don’t forget laundry! Get used to doing your own laundry regularly so it becomes second nature. It’s also important to have a cleaning routine so your space stays neat and comfortable. Other small skills, like changing a light bulb or fixing a clogged drain, will also come in handy and save you from calling for help over minor issues.Time management is key, too. Balancing work, chores, and your personal life takes some practice, but the more you can stay on top of everything, the easier it will be to enjoy your newfound independence. Communicate with family Moving out can be a big deal for both you and your family, so make sure you’re on the same page before you take the plunge. Sit down and have an open conversation about your plans and what support you might need as you start this new chapter. It’ll help ease any concerns they might have and also give you a chance to set boundaries around your independence.Talk about how often you’ll check in or visit, and ask for advice on anything you’re unsure about. Your family can be a great source of guidance, so don’t be afraid to lean on them as you prepare to make your move. Phase 3: Moving Out At 18 Now that you’re prepped and ready, it’s time to tackle the actual moving process. From finding the right place to settling into your new home, here’s how to make it all happen: Find suitable housing First things first–figure out how much you can afford. A general rule of thumb is to keep your rent below 30% of your income, but you also want to think about all the other expenses you’ll have (like groceries and transportation). Once you’ve got your budget in mind, start looking for places—whether that’s an apartment, a shared house, or student housing if you’re in college.Make sure to consider the neighborhood: is it safe? Are there grocery stores, gyms, and other conveniences nearby? How’s the access to public transportation? These things might seem small now, but they’ll make a huge difference once you’re living on your own. Understand lease agreements Before you sign a lease, take the time to read through it carefully. You want to know exactly what you’re agreeing to. Focus on the important stuff, like how long the lease is for, how much you’ll be paying, and any rules (like whether you can have pets, if there are quiet hours, or what happens if you need to break the lease early).If you don’t understand something, ask! It’s a good idea to have a trusted adult help you go through it so you don’t miss any fine print. The last thing you want is to sign something you’ll regret later. Plan the actual move Start prepping at least two months before your move date. Create a checklist of things you’ll need to do, from packing to budgeting for moving expenses (like a truck rental or moving supplies). You can save money by asking friends or family for help, or by renting a truck and doing it yourself. And when you’re packing, make sure to declutter first—you don’t want to waste time packing stuff you don’t really need.Label your boxes clearly, so when you unpack it’ll be much easier to settle in. Trust me, you’ll thank yourself later when you’re not hunting for your toothpaste on the first night! Set up utilities Once you know your move-in date, you’ll want to start setting up utilities. This includes things like electricity, water, gas, and internet. Shop around for the best deals in your area—you’d be surprised at how much you can save by comparing plans.Make sure you schedule the installation before you move in, so everything’s ready to go when you arrive. And don’t forget to keep track of payment due dates for each service so you don’t end up with any interruptions. Build your support system When you move into a new neighborhood, it can feel a bit lonely at first. That’s why it’s a great idea to introduce yourself to your neighbors. You don’t have to become best friends, but building a little community around you can be super helpful.You can also look for local clubs, gyms, or community centers to meet people who share your interests. And remember, it’s totally okay to ask for help when you need it. Whether it’s a question about your lease or advice on where to get cheap furniture, reaching out can make a big difference. Phase 4: Get Free Stuff Moving out is exciting, but furnishing your new place can get pricey fast. Luckily, you don’t have to buy everything brand new—there are tons of ways to score free or low-cost items: Find free stuff online Platforms like Facebook’s “Buy Nothing” groups and Craigslist’s free section are goldmines for free furniture, appliances, and even electronics. Apps like Freecycle and Olio are also great for finding things people in your community are giving away.Keep an eye on these platforms and be quick to reach out when you see something you need—free stuff goes fast! Ask your network Don’t be shy about reaching out to friends and family to see if they have anything they’re willing to part with. A lot of people have extra furniture, kitchenware, or decor that they’re happy to give away, especially if they’re downsizing or moving.People often appreciate knowing their stuff is going to a good home, and you’ll save a ton by not having to buy everything new. Check out community events Community centers, churches, or colleges (especially during student move-out periods) are great places to find free furniture and household goods. Keep an eye out for local swap meets or Freecycle events where you can exchange items or just grab what you need for free. Visit thrift stores and yard sales While not free, thrift stores and yard sales are great for finding gently-used items at super low prices. Some thrift stores even have free bins. And when you’re at a yard sale, don’t be afraid to negotiate—sellers are often willing to give things away, especially toward the end of the day. Take advantage of welcome kits Some local organizations offer free welcome kits for new residents, which include basic household essentials like toiletries, cleaning supplies, and kitchenware. It’s definitely worth checking with community centers or religious groups to see if they offer anything like this in your area. Phase 5: Settle In and Live Your Rich Life! Once you’ve successfully moved out, you’ll be ready to enjoy your newfound independence and start building the life you want. Living on your own is one of the first steps of adulthood and I commend you for taking the time to read this guide.As you prepare for this new chapter, remember to focus on smart financial decisions to ensure you can live comfortably. Keep in mind that living a “rich” life isn’t solely about money—it’s about creating meaningful experiences and connections. Plan to prioritize your time and energy on activities that truly bring you joy, whether that’s exploring your new neighborhood, pursuing a hobby, or building new friendships.Remember, with proper preparation and a positive attitude, you’ll be well-equipped to handle this exciting transition.
