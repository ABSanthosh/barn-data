  "description": "An anonymous caller feels trapped in a no-win situation with her financially reckless mother. She has the means to bail her out, but it doesn’t feel right. What should she do? Shannon is excited about investing in several companies overseas. But she can only access them using American Depository Receipts. What are they, and how do they work?
