While these taxes fund essential public services, they can also be a significant financial burden. Fortunately, some states offer more favorable property tax rates, providing relief to residents. Based on the latest data, here are the six states with the lowest effective property tax rates in 2025.1. Hawaii – 0.27%Hawaii has the lowest effective property tax rate in the country at just 0.27%. While home prices in Hawaii are among the highest in the U.S., the minimal property tax burden helps ease the overall financial load for homeowners. The state’s policy of using assessed values that are often lower than market values also works in favor of residents. For retirees and investors who can afford the upfront cost of a home, Hawaii offers an enticing blend of natural beauty and ongoing tax savings. Plus, with homestead exemptions available, many residents can lower their tax bills even further.2. Alabama – 0.38%Alabama is another state where property owners enjoy substantial tax savings. With an effective rate of just 0.38%, Alabama consistently ranks among the most affordable states for homeowners. What’s more, Alabama allows the deduction of federal income taxes on state tax returns, offering an additional financial advantage. Lower home prices combined with modest property taxes make Alabama an excellent choice for young families, retirees, and anyone looking for a lower cost of living without giving up Southern hospitality and charm.3. Nevada – 0.49%In Nevada, property taxes are low, with an effective rate of 0.49%. The state also famously has no personal income tax, which makes it doubly attractive for homeowners and entrepreneurs alike. Nevada has implemented tax abatement laws that cap the annual increase in a homeowner’s tax bill, offering residents protection from sudden, steep increases. Whether you’re drawn to the excitement of Las Vegas or the scenic beauty of Reno and Lake Tahoe, Nevada’s low property taxes make it a financially savvy place to settle down.4. Colorado – 0.49%Matching Nevada’s 0.49% rate, Colorado has seen a surge in popularity thanks to its stunning landscapes, booming job market, and relatively low property taxes. Even though the median home prices in cities like Denver and Boulder are higher than the national average, the low property tax rate helps homeowners manage their monthly expenses. Colorado also offers property tax exemptions for seniors and disabled veterans, providing even more opportunities to save. For active retirees and young professionals alike, Colorado presents a balanced mix of outdoor adventure and economic opportunity.Image by Leo Heisenberg5. South Carolina – 0.51%South Carolina combines a low property tax rate of 0.51% with a generally affordable cost of living. Homeowners in South Carolina benefit from generous exemptions, especially for seniors, military veterans, and individuals with disabilities. Beyond the financial perks, South Carolina offers rich culture, historic towns, and beautiful coastline, all of which make it a particularly popular destination for retirees and transplants seeking warmer weather. With both mountains and beaches within driving distance, South Carolina makes low-cost living feel like a true luxury.6. Arizona – 0.52%Arizona rounds out the list with an effective property tax rate of 0.52%. Known for its warm climate, growing cities, and diverse landscapes, Arizona continues to be a hotspot for retirees and families. Cities like Phoenix, Tucson, and Scottsdale provide a variety of living options at reasonable prices, and the state’s tax laws offer additional savings for seniors through property valuation freezes and exemptions. If you’re seeking sunshine, stunning natural parks, and affordable homeownership, Arizona is a solid bet.Choosing the Right Place to Call HomeWhile property taxes are just one piece of the financial puzzle, they play a major role in determining the long-term affordability of a home. States like Hawaii, Alabama, and Nevada prove that it’s possible to enjoy a high quality of life without facing sky-high property tax bills. Whether you’re planning to retire, relocate for work, or simply invest in a second property, understanding property tax rates can save you thousands over the years.Before making a move, it’s important to look beyond the sticker price of a home and consider all the costs involved, including local tax policies.
