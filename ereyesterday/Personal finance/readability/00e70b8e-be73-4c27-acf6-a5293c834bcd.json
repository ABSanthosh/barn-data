Get one wrong, and you’ve wasted a lot of time and may have incurred late fees.We’ve put a simple guide together to help you navigate the forms and their related due dates. The following dates are the tax dues dates in 2025.The main tax deadline for personal taxes is Tuesday, April 15, 2025.We also included the estimated tax deadlines for 2025, since making estimated tax payments can always be annoying. Annual Tax Filing Deadlines For 2025Individuals and Families - Annual personal income tax filings (Form 1040) are due on Tuesday, April 15, 2025. The majority of people file a 1040 for their federal tax returns. Corporations (including S and C Corps) - C corporations (Form 1120) also file on April 15, 2025. S corporations (Form 1120S) and partnerships (Form 1065) file on March 17, 2025. If you already filed your tax return, you can see when to expect your federal income tax refund here. Note: most refunds are in less than 21 days.Estimated Tax Deadlines For 2025Payments for estimated taxes are due on four different quarterly dates throughout the year.1Q — April 15, 20252Q — June 16, 20253Q — September 15, 20254Q — January 15, 2026Federal estimated taxes can be paid at https://www.irs.gov/payments. Estimated state taxes can be paid through most state department of revenue websites. If not, you may need to mail in your payment.Don't forget to file your estimated taxes, if required, so that you can avoid penalties and interest.Estates and TrustsEstates and trusts file Form 1041. This is also due on April 15, 2025.Extended ReturnsExtended returns have different filing dates depending on the type of tax form being filed. You can request an extension, but that must be requested by the tax deadline above.Form 1065 extended return — September 15, 2025Form 1120S extended return — September 15, 2025Form 1120 extended return — October 15, 2025Form 1040 extended return — October 15, 2025Remember, if you owe taxes, you still must pay any tax due by the tax deadline. However, filing an extension allows you extra time to file. Filing Your TaxesWhere and how should you file your taxes? Most tax software will handle annual income tax filings and extensions. Check here for the best tax software.Note that some of the free tax filing software may not offer as much customer service as paid versions. If you want specific questions answered or need guidance from a real person, be sure to check that those services are offered with the software.If your taxes are fairly simple, filing online or through tax software is not difficult and will save your money. If your taxes are on the more complex side or you just don’t want to deal with filing, you’ll need to hire a tax professional, which will be more costly.Tax professionals can be found locally, or you can visit any of the large tax brands such as H\u0026R Block. Both have physical locations that allow you to speak to someone in person and have your questions answered.There are also tax counseling programs for the elderly, and volunteer income tax assistance (VITA) for low income families that need help.
