Many crafts can be turned… Are you looking for the best crafting hobbies that make money? Turning your favorite craft into a money-making hobby can be fun and rewarding. You might already enjoy making things with your hands in your free time. Why not take that hobby and use it to make some extra money? Many crafts can be turned into profitable side jobs or even full-time businesses. From making jewelry and soap to digital products like printables, there are lots of options to choose from. You could sell your handmade items online or at local craft fairs. With some creativity and effort, you might be surprised at how much money your crafting skills can bring in. Best Crafting Hobbies That Make Money Below are the best crafting hobbies that make money. 1. Printables Printables are a fun way to make money from home. You can create and sell digital files that people can print out. Popular printables include: Planners and calendars Gift tags Flashcards Wall art and quotes Coloring pages Budget trackers Party decorations Wedding invitations People buy printables because they save time and effort and give professionally designed, ready-to-use prints that almost always look better than doing it yourself. People buy printables all the time, and I recently bought some coloring pages and flashcards for my daughter, for example. You don’t need fancy software to create printables. Programs like Canva or even Microsoft Word can work well. The key is to make something useful or beautiful that others will want. Once you make a printable, you can sell it over and over. This means you do the work once but can keep earning money from it. Many people sell their printables on sites like Etsy. Recommended reading: How I Make Money Selling Printables On Etsy 2. Dog treat bakery A dog treat bakery can be a fun and profitable hobby. Many pet owners want tasty, healthy treats for their furry friends. You can start this business from your home kitchen with just a few ingredients and tools. I have personally bought many dog treats from a small dog treat bakery, and I know many pet owners who have as well! To begin, try making simple dog biscuits or cookies (here’s a free peanut butter dog treat recipe you can make). Then, you can test your treats on your own pets or those of friends and family. The startup costs for a dog treat bakery are pretty low. You probably already have most of the kitchen tools you need. Your main expenses will be ingredients and packaging. As your business grows, you can add more treat types. Think about making special occasion cakes or holiday-themed treats. You could also create custom orders for pet birthdays or other events. A dog treat bakery can earn you anywhere from $500 to $1000 a month as a side job. If you decide to make it a full-time business, you could make even more.

Print on demand Print-on-demand is a way to make money from crafting without storing any products. You can design things like T-shirts, hats, mugs, blankets, tote bags, pillows, and phone cases. When someone buys your design, a company prints and ships it for you. There is a good chance that you have bought something from a print-on-demand company. I have bought hats, shirts, and much more through companies that are print-on-demand. To start, you’ll need to create designs. Don’t worry if you’re not an artist – even simple text designs can sell well. You can use tools like Adobe Illustrator to make your designs. Next, you’ll upload your designs to a print-on-demand website. These sites connect to online stores like Etsy. When a customer buys your product, the print-on-demand company makes and ships it. Many people make $500 to $1,500 a month with print-on-demand as a side job. This can also be turned into a full-time business from home.

Photography Photography can be a fun way to make money. You can turn your love for taking pictures into cash, and there are many ways to do this. One option is to sell your photos on stock websites. These are places where people buy pictures for their projects. Sites like Shutterstock and Adobe Stock let you upload your photos. When someone buys your picture, you get paid. I buy hundreds of stock photos every year for my business, and I know many other business owners who do as well – they are very nice and helpful to have! There are many other options as well, such as portrait photography, family photography, wedding photography, and more. Recommended reading: 18 Ways To Get Paid To Take Pictures 5. Candlemaking Candlemaking is a fun craft that can turn into a profitable business. You can start by practicing at home and sharing your creations with friends and family, as this helps you get feedback. The candle market is big right now, and I love buying homemade candles. Many people love candles for different reasons. Some use them for decoration. Others enjoy them for relaxation or aromatherapy. Restaurants even use candles to create a cozy atmosphere for customers. You can sell your candles online or at local craft fairs. As you grow, you might even supply to spas or restaurants. 6. Pottery Pottery is a fun hobby that can turn into a money-making venture. You can create beautiful and useful items like plant pots, plates, jewelry dishes, bowls, mugs, and vases. People love handmade pottery for their homes or as gifts. There are many places you can sell your pottery, such as craft fairs and online marketplaces like Etsy. You can also open your own online shop. People pay good money for unique, handmade pottery. You can set your prices based on the time and materials used. As you get better, you can charge more for your work. You might even teach pottery classes to make extra money. Sharing your skills with others can be rewarding and profitable. 7. Handmade jewelry Making jewelry by hand can be a fun way to earn money, and you can create necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and more using beads, wire, or other materials. Many people love wearing unique jewelry pieces, and this gives you a chance to sell your creations to them. Most of the jewelry I have is handmade that I’ve bought from small sellers. You can make simple designs or more complex ones depending on your skills. Etsy is a popular place to sell handmade jewelry online. You can also try local craft fairs or markets to meet customers in person. Some jewelry makers even open their own small shops. 8. Soap making Soap making is a fun craft that can earn you money. You can make all kinds of soaps at home with simple ingredients. Many people love handmade soaps because they’re natural and unique. I have a friend, as well as a family member, who makes and sells soaps, and it looks like such a fun craft business to have. Selling your soaps can be easy. You might start by giving some to friends and family. If they like them, you can sell at craft fairs or online. Etsy and local markets are great places to start selling. Many handmade soaps sell for $5 to $10 each. 9. Knitting patterns Knitting patterns can be a great way to make money from your hobby. You can create and sell your own unique designs for others to use. I have many friends and family members who knit, and they buy knitting patterns all the time. So, I know this is a real way to make money with a craft. Websites like Ravelry and Etsy are popular places to sell knitting patterns. You can set up a shop and list your patterns for knitters to buy and download. When making patterns to sell, think about what other knitters want. Popular items include hats, scarves, baby clothes, and home decor. To get started, practice writing clear instructions, and take good photos of your finished items. 10. Resin art I recently bought a resin art cutting board at a local festival, and it is beautiful! When I bought it, the artist told me that I was her very first customer from her resin art, and she was so happy to start her new business (she had a booth at a local plant festival). I was very happy as well, and we have it displayed in our kitchen because of how beautiful it is. Resin art is a fun way to make money from home. You can create beautiful and unique items that people love to buy. Resin is a liquid plastic that hardens into a clear, glossy finish. You can mix colors and add objects to make all sorts of cool designs. Some popular resin items to sell include jewelry, coasters, keychains, and decorative trays. You can also make larger pieces like tabletops or wall art. You can sell your resin crafts at local markets, craft fairs, or online through sites like Etsy. Many people make good money selling their resin art. 11. Woodworking Do you like working with wood? Woodworking can be a fun hobby that makes money. You can create all kinds of things to sell. Many people love handmade wooden items. You could make furniture like tables, chairs, or shelves. Small home decor pieces are popular too, such as wooden signs, picture frames, cutting boards, serving trays, jewelry boxes, or candleholders. You have lots of ways to sell your woodworking projects. You can sell online such as on Etsy or eBay, as well as at local craft fairs and markets, which are great places to show off your work too. 12. Handmade greeting cards Handmade greeting cards can be a fun and profitable craft hobby. You can create designs for birthdays, holidays, thank-you cards, special occasions, and more. Many people prefer handmade cards over store-bought ones. They appreciate the personal touch and creativity that goes into each card. For me, I love buying handmade greeting cards. I actually just put two in my shopping cart to give to my daughter’s teachers to thank them for the work they do. I love handmade greeting cards because they seem more personal. You can sell your cards online through platforms like Etsy or at local craft fairs. Most handmade cards sell for around $5 to $15 each. 13. Painting or drawing Painting and drawing can be fun hobbies that also make money, and you can sell your original artwork or prints of your pieces. There are many ways to sell your art. You can use online platforms like Etsy, set up your own website, or sell on your own Instagram account. Local art fairs and galleries are great places to show off your work too. People might ask you to make custom pieces just for them. This could be portraits, landscapes, or anything else they want. Custom work tends to pay well because it’s made especially for the buyer. I have bought custom artwork before, and many other people do all the time. You don’t need to be a famous artist to make money from painting or drawing. 14. Stickers Stickers are another fun crafting hobby that can turn into a profitable business, especially on platforms like Etsy. Stickers are widely used by people for planners, journaling, scrapbooking, and even home or office organization. They give a creative and fun way to express yourself while providing something useful to customers. One of the best parts about selling stickers is that they are relatively inexpensive to produce, and there’s a large, enthusiastic market for unique and well-designed options. I buy handmade stickers all the time, probably at least 10 each year. I buy them if I like the design, as a travel souvenir, and more. I know many others who do as well!
