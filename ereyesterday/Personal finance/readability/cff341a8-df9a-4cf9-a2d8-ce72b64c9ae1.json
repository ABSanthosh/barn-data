These common boomer behaviors might seem harmless to them, but they drive younger folks up the wall. Spotting these quirks won’t just make you smile at the generational gap—it can help you navigate relationships with empathy (or patience). Ready to dive into the top eight habits that are both hilarious and maddening? Here’s what you need to know.1. Glorifying “the good old days”Boomers love nostalgia—they start with “Back in my day…” before every story. While remembering the past can be heartwarming, constant comparisons make younger people feel their era is belittled. Millennials say this overuse can alienate and dismiss today’s challenges. Instead of painting the past as flawless, a balanced reflection is more relatable. A little nostalgia goes a long way—just don’t make it a mantra.2. Boomerasking: Pretending to ask, but really postingBehavioral scientists call it boomerasking—where someone asks a question only to pivot back to talking about themselves. It sounds polite, but comes off as insincere and self-centered. Younger people say they notice it as a conversation takeover tactic. Boomers who genuinely want to connect might not realize they’re hijacking talks. The fix? Ask follow-up questions based on answers, not just to segue into your own story.3. Tech resistance and touch-screen terrorWhen it comes to smartphones or touch-screens, some boomers freeze or complain when things go wrong. Yet, needing help with Netflix is also a parenting moment in disguise. Reducing frustrations helps—for both sides. Try offering patience and a calm explanation instead of rolling your eyes. It’s a small gesture that builds understanding, not fuel for frustration.4. Hoarding—including instructions and packagingEmpty boxes, receipts, manuals—they stash everything “just in case.” This hoarding habit runs deep, often rooted in precedents from harder times. Junk drawers fill quickly, but tossing one or two items and achieving balance is possible. A little purging and shared organizing projects can go a long way. Approaching it with humor can turn cleanup into a bonding moment.5. TV noise: News and reruns on repeatBoomers are notorious for keeping TVs on, even in the background, often playing news or reruns endlessly. Many say it’s comforting; others say it’s constant noise pollution. Offering noise-canceling headphones or agreed quiet hours doesn’t have to be confrontational. A small plan can preserve their comfort while keeping your sanity intact.6. Interrupting with “I’ve got this” energyOvereager to help, boomers often chime in before younger folks finish sentences, correcting, lecturing, or “fixing” without being asked. That instinct to assist can come off as dismissive or condescending. Instead of jumping in, they can practice listening—the patient way. Asking “Would you like my advice?” shows respect. It turns a potential clash into needed care.7. Being oblivious in crowdsEver had someone stop abruptly in an aisle or doorway without looking back? Boomers often do—especially with shopping carts in Costco. Reddit users note:“They always stop short ten steps inside… oblivious anyone behind them.”Reckless spatial awareness isn’t deliberate—it just happens. A gentle “Excuse me” and a smile can shift that jarring moment into harmony. It’s easier to ask than to resent.8. Dismissing mental health strugglesGeneration gaps in mental-health awareness remain wide—boomers sometimes respond with “suck it up” to modern anxieties. That dismissal silences young people who need validation. Acknowledgement doesn’t mean full buy-in—it just says, “I hear you.” Brushing off mental-wellness concerns can fracture relationships, so a little empathy helps.Respecting Differences Without Losing Your CoolBoomer behaviors won’t change overnight—but understanding them can ease friction and build connection. A dose of patience, a pinch of boundaries, and a dash of clear communication go a long way. After all, we all carry habits we don’t even notice. Closing the generational gap starts with noticing—and responding thoughtfully.Have you experienced any of these boomer behaviors—funny or frustrating?
