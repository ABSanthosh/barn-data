Whether it’s a new moisturizer, snack, baby item, or even laundry detergent, getting free samples is one of the easiest (and fun) ways to try new things without wasting money…. Want to learn how to get free samples without paying anything? I’ve always loved testing out new products and learning how to get free stuff. Whether it’s a new moisturizer, snack, baby item, or even laundry detergent, getting free samples is one of the easiest (and fun) ways to try new things without wasting money. Over the years, I’ve found some legit places that send out free samples in the mail, and I’m excited to share them with you today. I have personally used some of the companies below myself, so I know this is real! In fact, I recently got a PINCHme box in the mail that was filled with nice products – more on that below. Best Ways To Get Free Samples Below are the best places to get free samples shipped to your home – makeup, home products, baby items, and more! Before we begin, here are some tips and an FYI: For the companies that ask for your phone number, there are reviews that some people get a lot of phone calls from the company after they submit, as well as from third-party offers. So, please be aware in case you do not want to get called a lot. I do recommend creating a separate email address that you use just for signing up for free sample boxes and product testing sites. Why? Because companies that send free samples will send promotional emails, third-party offers, surveys, and follow-up questions after you receive a sample. That’s a part of how they operate. So, if you use your main email, it can quickly become overwhelming with emails. Having a dedicated email helps you stay organized and makes it easier to spot when you’ve been selected for a new sample box. Plus, it keeps your personal inbox clean and clutter-free! Don’t ever give free samples sites your credit card information. Sometimes you may come across scams where they ask for this. Here’s what was inside my free PINCHme box full of free samples. 1. PINCHme PINCHme is one of the most popular free sample sites, and I can confirm it’s real because I earned a box from them myself! My PINCHme box included: A dark spot correcting cream Moisturizer Body lotion Hair mask Hand cream Laundry freshener Two coupons It was such a fun surprise to open! To get your own free sample box in the mail, you need to create a free account, fill out your profile, and complete tasks (like answering a few questions, writing reviews, or downloading an app) to earn coins. Then, once you earn enough coins, you can redeem them for a free sample box. I found that the coins were fairly easy to earn. They send out sample boxes throughout the year, and the more active you are, the more free boxes you can get. And yes – shipping is free! You can sign up for PINCHme by clicking here. 2. Daily Goodie Box Daily Goodie Box is a popular site for free samples. Everything is free – even the shipping. You don’t need to enter any payment information, and you’re never required to purchase anything. They send out boxes filled with things like snacks, beverages, personal care products, and vitamins. All you have to do is sign up and occasionally check to see if you’ve been selected for a box. Now, I did do some digging, and the main way you can get a free sample box is to be active on their Facebook page and interact with their posts – it can increase your chances of being picked. I read a lot of reviews of Daily Goodie Box, and many people said they did this and then were picked for a free box of samples. You can sign up for Daily Goodie Box by clicking here. Note: When you sign up, they do ask you a lot of questions that include third-party offers – offers where they are trying to get you to sign up for other companies so that they can earn a sign-up commission. Personally, I said no or skipped as much as I could. The same is true for the next two companies on this list (Healthy Snack Boxes and TryProducts), as they are all owned by the same company. I just wanted to mention this because there were a lot of questions and offers to skip! 3. Healthy Snack Boxes If you’re looking for free sample boxes full of healthy snacks, then this is the one for you. These boxes sometimes include new gluten-free, sugar-free, or dairy-free snacks for you to try. Shipping is free, and you don’t need to enter a credit card. You just give your honest feedback on the snacks you try. You can sign up for Free Healthy Snack Boxes by clicking here. 4. TryProducts TryProducts is just like the two sites mentioned above – a free sample site where you sign up and you can possibly get a free sample box. The main way you can earn a free sample box is by leaving a comment on their social media posts and being chosen as a winner of a free box. You can sign up for TryProducts by clicking here. Note: Daily Goodie Box, Healthy Snack Boxes, and TryProducts are all owned by the same parent company. From the research I’ve done, the main way you get free boxes is by signing up and then leaving comments on their social media pages (look at the screenshot above to learn more). 5. Sephora Beauty Insider program If you love beauty products, you need to sign up for Sephora’s free Beauty Insider program. Every time you order online, you can choose two free samples at checkout. These can be anything from fragrance to skincare to makeup. You also get a free birthday gift every year, and if you visit a Sephora store, don’t be shy about asking for samples – the staff are usually happy to give you small jars of foundation, moisturizer, or perfume to take home. Here’s what I received in my free Babylist box. This was a huge box of free samples and so much fun to receive as an expecting mom! 6. Baby Registries (Target, Amazon, Walmart, etc.) If you are expecting a baby or you know someone who is, then many baby registries give a free welcome box just for signing up. These free boxes are usually filled with free baby samples, such as free diaper samples, newborn laundry detergent, baby bottles, toys, pacifiers, baby onesies, and more. When I was pregnant, I got the Amazon baby box (you can also purchase the Amazon box if you don’t want to wait to earn yours), Walmart baby box, and the Babylist baby box, and they were all great and free! I simply created a registry through the sites (which is something that I was already doing), and I received the free baby box once someone purchased something off my baby registry. 7. Influenster Influenster is a platform where you can get free full-size products in exchange for writing reviews. These products come in what they call “VoxBoxes,” and they usually include beauty, skincare, food, and household items. To increase your chances of receiving a VoxBox, be active on the app and connect your social media accounts. You don’t need a huge following – honest, detailed reviews are what they’re really looking for. 8. SampleSource SampleSource is a popular free sample company (they have a 4.9 out of 5 star rating on Trustpilot, with over 1,300 reviews!) that sends out sample boxes a few times per year, and they usually go fast. These boxes include a mix of food, cleaning supplies, pet products, and personal care items. You create a free account, fill out your profile, and when samples are available, you’ll be notified. You’ll want to make sure to claim yours quickly because quantities are limited and the boxes are super popular. 9. BzzAgent BzzAgent is one of the best places to get free samples by mail. They work with big brands to send out free products in exchange for honest feedback. They typically send out full-size items, and it’s all completely free. Once you sign up and complete your profile, you’ll be invited to join “campaigns.” If you’re selected, you’ll receive products in the mail and be asked to share your opinion, either through a short review or on social media. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about how to get free sample boxes. Why do companies give out free sample boxes? Companies want people to try their products so they’ll hopefully become loyal customers. Free samples help build brand awareness, get reviews, and generate word-of-mouth advertising. It’s a win-win for both the brand and you. Does Amazon still do free samples? Amazon used to have a free sample program, but it’s been paused for most people. They sometimes mail sample boxes and discounted trial-size products, mainly for Prime members, but it’s not consistent. Are samples free at Sephora? Yes! You can get free samples at Sephora both online and in-store. Online orders come with two free samples, and you can ask for skincare or makeup samples in-store. You also get a free gift during your birthday month if you’re a Beauty Insider. Are there any legit free sample sites? Yes, there are legitimate free sample sites. PINCHme, Daily Goodie Box, SampleSource, and Influenster are all legit and used all the time. You should never be asked to pay for shipping or provide your credit card number for a real freebie. Does Amazon send influencers free stuff? Yes, through programs like the Amazon Vine Program and brand collaborations. If you’re interested in learning how to get free products or even get paid to review items, check out my blog post How To Get Paid For Amazon Reviews. What food companies send free samples?

It’s also a good idea to follow food brands on social media, where they sometimes have giveaways or coupons. How can I get a free makeup samples box? To get free beauty samples, you can sign up for beauty programs like Sephora Beauty Insider or join Influenster. Also, check PINCHme, which usually includes beauty items. You can also email brands directly and ask if they can mail you a sample. What’s the best way to get free samples by mail?
