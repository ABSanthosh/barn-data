Jobs for 11-year-olds can teach them about money and hard work. They can learn new skills and gain experience for the future. I still remember the thrill of earning my first few dollars from little jobs like babysitting when I was young. It really showed me what it meant to be responsible and appreciate the value of money you’ve worked for – lessons that stay with you forever! Recommended reading: 23 Best Business Ideas For Kids To Make Extra Money Can an 11 year old work legally? Kids can have jobs, but there are rules to keep them safe and protect their time. In the U.S., kids under 14 usually aren’t allowed to work regular jobs, but there are some exceptions. They might be able to babysit, deliver newspapers, or even act in a play or movie. The government has rules about how long kids can work, too. For example, on school days, they might only be able to work up to 3 hours, while on weekends or holidays, they could work up to 8 hours. These rules make sure children have time for school, rest, and fun. It’s a good idea to check child labor laws in your area since they might be a little different depending on where you live. Here’s a good place to start – U.S. Department of Labor Child Labor. It’s important to stay safe when making money. Always: Make sure parents/guardians are aware of what the child is doing. Have them work with people you know. Have a trusted adult nearby. Another important point is making sure the child knows they can always turn to their guardian or parent for help without feeling embarrassed or afraid. You want them to feel comfortable and open, knowing they can share anything that comes up along the way. This way, if they feel that anything is odd (such as with someone they are working for), they know they can ask you questions and possibly stop the side hustle. Remember, school comes first! Jobs should not get in the way of school or sleep. Best Jobs for 11 Year Olds Below are the best jobs for 11-year-olds. 1. Babysitter Babysitting can be a great job for 11-year-olds, and they can start by watching younger siblings or cousins under adult supervision. As they gain experience, they might babysit for neighbors or family friends. Many parents look for responsible tweens to watch their kids for short periods. Remember to set clear expectations with parents about duties and pay rates. Most 11-year-old babysitters charge around $5 to $10 per hour. Babysitting can be an ideal first job for your child, especially if they have younger siblings or cousins to practice with under your supervision. When I started babysitting at a young age, it taught me a lot about responsibility, and it felt great to earn my own money. 2. Pet sitter Pet sitting can be a fun job for 11-year-olds who love animals. They can earn money while taking care of dogs, cats, and other pets in the neighborhood. Pet sitters feed animals, give them water, clean up after them, and play with them. This job helps kids learn about responsibility and animal care. It’s a great way to gain experience if they want to work with animals when older. I recommend that kids start by offering their services to family friends or neighbors. They might feel more comfortable letting a child watch their pets since they know them. 3. Dog walker Dog walking can be a fun job for 11-year-olds who love animals, and this job can be started by offering to walk dogs in the local neighborhood. I highly recommend starting with short walks as well as making sure the child is comfortable with the dog breed and activity level. Some dogs can be quite large, and an 11-year-old may not be able to safely walk them, so this is something to keep in mind. I recently read a flyer on a neighborhood bulletin board from a young kid selling dog walking services. They were charging about $5 for a 30-minute walk, and their parent would be joining to lend a hand. It was just a small way for the child to get some experience and learn about earning money, and I thought it was a really fun idea where the parent can make sure the child is safe the entire time! 4. Paper route A paper route can be a great job for 11-year-olds where they deliver newspapers to houses in a nearby neighborhood. This job teaches responsibility and helps the 11-year-old earn some money. People who run a paper route wake up early to get the papers out before people leave for work. It’s a good way to start the day and get some exercise, either by riding a bike or walking to deliver the newspapers. Now, most newspapers are delivered by the hundreds (or thousands) via car by an adult. But, you may be able to contact local newspaper companies in your area to see if they have any options for children to deliver. When I was younger, I had a friend whose family ran a paper delivery route as a way to make some extra money. She would help out with the deliveries and earn a bit for herself too. She wasn’t doing it all alone, but it was more of a family side hustle where everyone pitched in together. 5. Yard work Yard work is a great way for 11-year-olds to earn money, and they can sell services like mowing lawns, raking leaves, and more for neighbors. These tasks are perfect for 11-year-olds and don’t require special skills to learn. Plus, 11-year-olds can learn and start by asking their parents if they need help with yard chores. An 11-year-old might be able to charge $10 to $15 for mowing a small lawn. Raking leaves could earn around $10 to $50 per yard. Watering plants or pulling weeds might pay $5 an hour. Yard work is a great job for active kids who don’t mind getting a little dirty. When I started helping neighbors with easy things like raking leaves and pulling weeds, it was a good way to earn some extra money and build my confidence. Starting small with family or nearby neighbors can give kids a safe way to learn responsibility, stay close to home, and get some fresh air at the same time. 6. Gardener’s helper There are lots of ways an 11-year-old can help with garden work. They might help plant flowers or vegetables. Watering plants is another easy task they can do. Pulling weeds is important to keep gardens healthy too. Some people may need help with spreading mulch. If the child is strong, they could even move small rocks or bags of soil (but, being careful not to lift anything too heavy). Ask your neighbors or family friends if they need help in their gardens. You could make flyers to advertise the child’s services too. 7. Car washer Car washing can be a fun and simple way for an 11-year-old to earn some money. You might suggest they start by washing the family cars to practice before selling the service to neighbors. To get started, they’ll need some basic supplies, like car soap, sponges, and towels. A garden hose is also important. You could help them gather these items and show them how to use each one safely. When it’s time to wash, they can begin by rinsing the car with water, then use soapy water and a sponge to clean the outside, focusing on dirtier areas like the wheels. Afterward, they’ll rinse off the soap and use towels to dry the car. If you have a vacuum handy, they can also clean the interior by vacuuming and wiping down surfaces. Remind them to be careful around cars, as they’re valuable, and to take their time for a quality job. Encourage them to ask you or another adult for help if they’re not sure about anything. 8. Lemonade stand A lemonade stand is a classic way for an 11-year-old to earn money, and it is probably what most people think about when they’re trying to brainstorm ways for a young person to make money. It’s a fun activity that also teaches valuable skills. They can set up the stand on a hot day when people are likely to be thirsty. To get started, they’ll need lemons, sugar, water, and cups, along with a table, chairs, and a sign. Adding decorations can make the stand more inviting and fun for them to set up. You can help them find a good spot, like a busy street corner or near a park. Make sure the location is safe and allowed in your area. Lemonade is usually priced fairly affordably – maybe 50 cents to $1 per cup. Adding variety with flavors like strawberry or peach can make the stand even more appealing. Help them keep track of sales and expenses, so they can learn how much they’re making. It’s a great introduction to the basics of running a small business! A lemonade stand is a classic first job that teaches kids the basics of earning money while having fun. I still remember setting up my own lemonade stands on hot summer days; it was a fun way to spend time with my friends. 9. Neighborhood helper Being a neighborhood helper is a way for an 11-year-old to earn money while staying close to home. They can offer to do small tasks for nearby residents like bringing in mail, gift wrapping, laundry help, washing dishes, decluttering, watering plants, taking out trash cans (and bringing them back in once they’ve been emptied), helping with yard cleanup, and other minor chores. This kind of job allows them to work safely within the neighborhood and build positive relationships with neighbors. To get started, you can help them create flyers to distribute to neighbors, listing the services they offer. I was recently on a neighborhood Facebook group near me, and a parent was advertising a job for their child. They were charging $2 to bring a trash can to the curb and back to the side of the house each week on trash day. The neighborhood that this family was in had strict rules about trash cans only being brought out the morning of trash day, and they were required to be brought in by the evening of the same day. So, this kid thought of a genius way to make some money in their neighborhood as many residents were not always able to do this chore. Plus, it was only $8 to $10 a month, and many people hopped on the offer. This kid was making $8 to $10 per house per month, and I think I read that they had about 30 houses signed up – and this was a job that didn’t take them much time at all! 10. Plant watering service Starting a plant watering service can be a great way for an 11-year-old to earn some extra money. Many people have plants but may struggle to keep them watered regularly, which is where your child can step in to help! They can sell their watering services to neighbors, family friends, or even local businesses. It’s an easy job that doesn’t take much time or effort, and it’s also a great way for them to learn about different types of plants. To help them get started, you could help with spreading the word by creating flyers or posting on social media. A fair price might be around $5 to $10 per visit, depending on how many plants need attention. 11. Pick up after dogs Picking up dog waste in the neighborhood can be an interesting way for an 11-year-old to earn money, as many pet owners are busy and may not have time to keep their yards clean. The job is fairly simple and requires basic supplies, like plastic bags, gloves, and a scoop. Your child can walk around each yard and pick up any waste they find. They can charge by the visit or on a weekly basis, with rates typically ranging from $10 to $20 per yard, depending on the yard size and number of dogs. Remind them to always wash their hands thoroughly after each job, wear closed-toe shoes, and get permission before entering any yard. When I was a kid, I remember my dad actually telling me that this was one of his first jobs when he was a kid! He would clean up dog poop in local backyards near his home. 12. YouTuber Becoming a YouTuber can be an enjoyable way for an 11-year-old to explore their interests and potentially earn money online. Of course, there’s no guarantee that they will make money, but I know that this is a hot career choice for this age group. I recently read that most children want to be YouTubers when they grow up, which is very interesting! So, what better way than trying it out when they’re young and seeing if it works? They can create videos about topics they’re passionate about, like toys, games, or crafts. To get started, they’ll need a camera or phone and some basic video editing skills. You can help them set up a YouTube channel and make sure that they stay safe online (I highly recommend that you watch them at least kind of closely because the online world can be scammy). As the channel grows, they might earn money from ads on their videos, and some well-known kid YouTubers even receive sponsorships from companies. It’s important to remember that building success on YouTube requires time and effort. They’ll need to post videos regularly and interact with viewers. Be sure they always follow YouTube’s guidelines for kids and have your permission for any activities on the platform. Recommended reading: How Much Do YouTubers Make? 13. Shovel snow Snow shoveling can be a great way for an 11-year-old to earn money during the winter, especially if they enjoy being outdoors and don’t mind the cold. They can offer to clear driveways, sidewalks, and porches for neighbors, as snow removal is usually in high demand after a big snowstorm. Many people are happy to pay for help with this task. To get started, they’ll need a sturdy snow shovel and warm, weather-appropriate clothing. You can help them find customers in your neighborhood and suggest charging around a minimum of $10 to $15 per driveway or sidewalk they clear. I remember bundling up and helping neighbors clear their driveways and sidewalks after a snowfall – it was tough but rewarding, especially when I was paid!
