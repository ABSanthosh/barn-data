Over the years, I’ve come across… Want to learn how to get free food with no money? If you’re trying to stretch your grocery budget, save a little money here and there, or you’re truly in a tough spot, there are actually quite a few legitimate ways to eat for free and get free stuff. Over the years, I’ve come across many ways to save money on food, and some of them may surprise you. I’ve received free food by signing up for restaurant apps, taking advantage of grocery store programs, using cashback apps, and more. And yes, I’ve heard from readers who’ve even gotten free meals just by being part of local Facebook groups or volunteering. So if you’re looking to cut back on food costs or if you need help getting meals, my article will walk you through real ways to get free food. 13 Ways To Get Free Food Below is how you can get free food. 1. Sign up for restaurant rewards programs Many restaurants give free food just for signing up for their loyalty or rewards programs. Sometimes you’ll get a free item right away (like fries, a coffee, or dessert), and other times it may come once you earn points. Popular options include: Starbucks Chick-fil-A Panera Bread Dunkin’ Donuts Chipotle Burger King Jersey Mike’s 2. Get free food on your birthday This is a fun one! If your birthday is coming up, there are a ton of restaurants that will give you something for free with no purchase required. You can get free meals, desserts, pastries, drinks, free drinks, free appetizers, and other free food coupons. Some examples include: Firehouse Subs IHOP Raising Cane’s Baskin-Robbins Krispy Kreme Red Robin Buffalo Wild Wings Denny’s Auntie Anne’s Many of these require you to sign up ahead of time, so plan early and make a list. You can even make a “birthday freebie day” each year and treat yourself without spending a dime. Recommended reading: 31 Birthday Freebies You Should Sign Up For 3. Join grocery store loyalty programs Many grocery stores have digital coupons, discounts, freebie offers, and loyalty programs that can help you earn points that you can put toward free groceries. Signing up is usually easy, with just your name, phone number, and email address. And, make sure you download and log into your grocery store’s app regularly as that is where I typically find the best deals. 4. Use apps that give free food or points Apps like Fetch Rewards, Ibotta, and Upside give you points when you scan receipts or shop at certain stores. You can redeem those points for gift cards to grocery stores, food delivery apps, and restaurants. You can sign up for them by clicking below. Fetch Rewards – For grocery store receipts Ibotta – For grocery store receipts (I use both Fetch and Ibotta at the same time for the same receipts – double the points!) Upside – Great for gas station receipts I use the three of these for my shopping on a weekly basis. I’ve used these myself and have received free gift cards to places like Target and Uber Eats. It takes just a few seconds to scan a receipt, and it’s a habit that adds up over time. Recommended reading: 14 Best Apps To Scan Receipts for Money 5. Look for free food events or local giveaways You’d be surprised how many free food opportunities are available in your local area. Community events, grand openings, and rallies may give away snacks or meals. You can find these by searching on Facebook Events, local community pages, or even your town’s event calendar. Public libraries sometimes host free events with snacks too. If you live near a college campus, look for student fairs or club events, as these may include free food and drinks. Another idea is to post in your local Facebook group and simply ask if there are any ways for you to get free food. I have seen people post this in local Facebook groups such as: A mom who was looking for free breast milk or formula for their child, and many mothers commented that they could help her out A person who was looking for regular meals, and commenters let them know that a local community center gives out free food every Friday A parent looking for regular meals for their child over the summer. Commenters let them know that the local elementary school was giving out free breakfast and lunch to anyone under the age of 18 in the area throughout the entire summer. I mention these examples to show that you don’t need to be afraid to ask. People want to help and everyone deserves to be able to eat food. 6. Take advantage of food pantries and community resources Food pantries exist to help people who are in need, and they are there for you if you’re struggling. You don’t always need to be unemployed or have zero income to qualify. Many communities have food shelves, mobile food distribution vans, and school pantry programs. Some even provide toiletries and baby supplies. You can check with your local United Way, churches, or search for Feeding America locations to get started. 7. Apply for government assistance programs (WIC, SNAP, and more) There are also government programs designed to help families and individuals afford food. These include: SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps) WIC (Women, Infants, and Children program) School meal programs (free breakfast and lunch) Each program has different qualifications, but it’s worth looking into. You can apply on your state’s benefits website or through your local Department of Human Services. These programs have helped millions of families and can provide a long-term solution if you’re facing ongoing food insecurity. You can learn about your other options at 17 Ways To Get Free Money From the Government. 8. Try mystery shopping or food testing gigs Some companies will pay you – or reimburse you – to go to a restaurant and give feedback. These are called mystery shopping gigs. You may also find opportunities to test snacks or drinks at home. Two websites to try include: BestMark iSecretShop These gigs usually don’t pay a ton, but the free meals and snacks can definitely help. Always do your research and avoid anything that seems like a scam or asks you to pay upfront. I have done a lot of different restaurant mystery shops over the years, and it used to be one of the main ways that I could afford to go out to eat. The way restaurant mystery shops work is: You sign up for a mystery shop company and then apply for a restaurant to secret shop at. They give you a list of questions and things to look out for. You go to the restaurant and pretend you are a customer. You eat and pay like normal. You fill out a restaurant survey once you get home. Then you get reimbursed for your restaurant meal from the mystery shop company. You can learn more at Want To Make An Extra $100 A Month? Learn How To Become A Mystery Shopper. 9. Get free samples from food brands Food brands sometimes give away free samples when they launch new products. You can find these through sample sites, brand newsletters, or even on social media. Sites to check: PINCHme  Healthy Snack Boxes SampleSource Tip: These samples go fast, so sign up early and check your account often. 10. Trade or barter locally Local buy-nothing or neighborhood groups sometimes have people giving away food they don’t need, like garden extras (such as carrots or even mangos!), pantry items, or bulk buys they can’t finish. Sometimes people will even just have extra food that they are giving away from their dinner – I’ve seen everything. You can join these groups through Facebook or apps like Nextdoor. It’s a great way to connect with your community and share resources. 11. Grow your own food or join a community garden If you have space for a few pots, you can grow herbs, tomatoes, or lettuce at home. Even small efforts like this can save you money and give you something fresh to eat. Some towns also have community gardens where you can volunteer and take home some of the harvest. 12. Dumpster diving Okay, this one isn’t for everyone, but some people have found great success with dumpster diving for free food. Grocery stores and bakeries tend to throw out perfectly good food due to appearance, expiration dates, or overstock. If you try this, be safe. Wear gloves, go with someone else, and avoid anything that’s open, spoiled, or unsafe. And of course, check your local laws. There are entire communities online dedicated to this, and some people even use it as their main source of groceries. 13. Earn free gift cards One of my favorite ways to get free food is by earning free gift cards, and it’s easier than you might think. There are several apps and websites that reward you with gift cards just for doing small tasks like scanning your receipts, answering surveys, playing games, or shopping online. Now, these won’t make you rich, but you may be able to earn a free gift card to places like Target, Walmart, DoorDash, and more. Some of the best ways to get free food gift cards include: Freecash Fetch Rewards Swagbucks Branded Surveys  Ibotta InboxDollars Recommended reading: 9 Ways To Get a Free DoorDash Gift Card 12 Ways To Get a Free Uber Eats Gift Card 8 Ways To Get a Free Subway Gift Card Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about how to get free food. How can I get free food on DoorDash? There are a few ways to get free food on DoorDash such as playing games on your phone, answering surveys to get free gift cards, or referring friends to DoorDash. How to get free food for students? Many college campuses have food pantries, free lunch events, or giveaways. Some students also qualify for SNAP depending on their income and enrollment status. I recommend reaching out to your school and seeing what your options are, as there are probably plenty, and they may have an easy list for you to look at. How do you eat when you have no money for food? If you have no money for food, you may want to start by visiting a food pantry, applying for SNAP, and joining community groups. Please don’t be afraid to reach out for help because there are many programs that exist to support you. Everyone should be able to eat! Is it really possible to get free food without spending money? Yes, it is possible to get free food without spending money. From rewards programs to food pantries, there are many legitimate ways to get meals and groceries for free. How do I find free food near me? To find free food near you, you can search for local food banks, community events, and Facebook groups. Also check apps like Too Good To Go and Olio, which help reduce food waste by giving away leftovers or extras. Can I get free food if I don’t have a job? Yes, there are ways to get free food if you don’t have a job. There are many food assistance programs and pantries that do not require employment proof as they’re designed to help anyone in need. Are food pantries just for low-income families? No, food pantries help anyone who needs help, whether it’s temporary or ongoing. If you’re struggling, reach out to your local food pantry to see how you can get groceries for your household. You can find a food pantry by searching online on a map, calling social services in your area, or simply asking in a “locals only” Facebook group.
