I first… Are you wondering what the best jobs for 13-year-olds are? Many 13-year-olds want to earn money, but finding jobs can be tricky at that age. There are limits on the types of work and hours teens can do. But don’t worry – plenty of options exist for young teens to make some cash. I first started making money around this age, and I absolutely loved it. Being able to make my own money and buy things on my own felt great, and I also learned so much about money management as well as became more confident in life. Recommended reading: 23 Business Ideas For Teens To Make Extra Money Can a 13 year old work legally? Kids can work some jobs, but there are rules to make sure they stay safe and have plenty of time for school and fun. In the U.S., kids under 14 can’t work most jobs, but there are a few things they’re allowed to do, like babysitting, delivering newspapers, or acting in a show or movie. There are also rules about how many hours kids can work. For example, on school days, they may only be able to work up to 3 hours, but on weekends and holidays, they might work as long as 8 hours. These limits help them stay healthy and keep up with school. Check the rules in your area since they can be different from place to place. Here’s a good place to learn more about the rules – U.S. Department of Labor Child Labor. It’s super important to stay safe while working. Always: Make sure parents or guardians know what the 13-year-old is doing. Have them work with people you know and trust. Have a trusted adult close by. It’s important to make sure the teenager knows they can always reach out to their guardian or parent for support without feeling uncomfortable or hesitant. You want them to feel safe and open, knowing they can discuss any concerns that may come up (for example, maybe the person they are working for has said something weird or uncomfortable to them). This way, if something doesn’t feel right – like a situation with a person they’re working for – they’ll know they can ask questions and, if necessary, step away from the job. Best Jobs for 13 Year Olds Below are the best jobs for 13-year-olds. 1. Babysitting Babysitting can be an ideal job for a responsible 13-year-old, allowing them to earn money while helping families in the community. Many parents seek trustworthy sitters, making it a great opportunity. The pay for babysitting is often quite good, typically ranging from $10 to $20 per hour, which can add up quickly, especially on weekends or during school breaks. To help them find babysitting jobs, you might reach out to friends or neighbors who may know families looking for sitters. Before they begin, it’s very helpful for them to learn basic childcare skills and CPR. A babysitting course or first aid class can give them confidence and make parents feel more at ease hiring them. Babysitting can be one of the best ways to build responsibility and earn money. I remember how proud I felt after my first babysitting job, knowing I had made a real difference for a family and earned my own money. I was a young teenager at the time, and I was working around 36 hours a week during the summers as a full-time babysitter making $10 an hour, and it added up really fast! I actually opened up my first bank account (with a parent) due to that job, and it taught me a lot about money. 2. Dog walking Dog walking can be a wonderful job for a 13-year-old who loves animals, allowing them to earn money while spending time with pets. Dog walkers take dogs on walks around the neighborhood, helping keep the dogs healthy and happy while their owners are busy, such as when they are at work or on vacation. They could charge around $5 to $15 per dog per walk, with the potential to earn more as they take on multiple clients. I recently read a flyer on a local board from a young kid offering dog walking for about $5 per 30-minute session, with their parent accompanying them to help out. It seemed like a simple and fun way for the child to learn the basics of earning money and gain some responsibility, which I thought was really nice! 3. Lemonade stand A lemonade stand is a fun way for a 13-year-old to make money. They can set up a small table in the front yard or at a busy spot. They’ll need lemons, sugar, water, cups, and a pitcher to make lemonade. Plus, adding ice is a good idea on hot days to keep the drinks cool. Making a bright sign can help attract people’s attention. They could price the lemonade at 50 cents or $1 per cup. Adding snacks like cookies can also bring in more customers. Running a lemonade stand is a classic way to learn the basics of business in a fun, friendly way. My friends and I had one many summers as kids, and we loved counting our earnings at the end of the day – it made us feel like real entrepreneurs! 4. Pet sitting Pet sitting gigs are great for a 13-year-old who loves animals. They can start by taking care of pets for neighbors or family friends. Pet sitters might need to feed pets, give them water, and play with them. Other tasks can include cleaning litter boxes or taking dogs for walks. Now, I do not typically recommend having the 13-year-old stay alone at someone’s house for this, but the parent/guardian may be able to go with them during the day or evenings to help them take care of the pet or you could have the pet stay in your home. 5. Car washing Car washing is a great job for a 13-year-old. They can start this business in the neighborhood with just a few supplies. Many people are busy and happy to pay someone to wash their cars. They don’t need much to get started, which is nice – they’ll need basic items like soap, sponges, buckets, and towels. A hose can also help if customers don’t have one. They could team up with friends to wash more cars. This makes the job more fun and helps them finish faster. They can also split the money they earn. 6. House cleaning House cleaning can be a great way for a 13-year-old to earn money. They can start by helping family members or neighbors with easy tasks. These tasks might include dusting, vacuuming, or organizing rooms. They could also offer to clean windows, mop floors, or tidy up messy spaces. 7. Tutoring Tutoring can be a great job for a 13-year-old who is good at certain subjects. If they’re strong in math, science, or languages, they might be able to help younger kids with homework. They can start by offering tutoring to friends, family, or neighbors. Many parents look for affordable tutors for their kids. Online tutoring is another option. Some websites allow teens as young as 13 to sign up as tutors, so they can work from home and help more students. 8. Lawn mowing Lawn mowing is a good job for a 13-year-old who likes being outside. They can earn money by cutting grass for neighbors or family friends. Safety is very important, so you’ll want to make sure they know how to use the mower safely. For example, they should wear closed-toe shoes and watch out for rocks or sticks. They can charge about $15 to $30 per lawn, depending on the size. Bigger yards take more time, so they can ask for more money. Summer is the busiest time for lawn care in many areas. They might mow the same yards every week or two because the grass grows so quickly, which means that they can have consistent jobs and customers. 9. Snow shoveling Snow shoveling can be a good way for a 13-year-old to make money in the winter. They can help neighbors clear driveways and sidewalks after it snows. This job works well if you live somewhere with a lot of snow. Many people, like older adults or busy families, are happy to pay for snow removal. They can charge by the job or set an hourly rate. I had many friends when I was growing up who would go in groups of 2 or 3 and knock on neighbors’ doors to see if they could get any customers. Or, sometimes they would have parents go with them to make sure everyone was safe too. 10. Errand running Errand running and doing chores can be a good way for a 13-year-old to make money. They can help neighbors and family friends with tasks they don’t have time for. Some errands they might do include returning library books, picking up dry cleaning, taking out trash cans to the curb, doing laundry, other light housekeeping, and more. 11. Craft selling Selling crafts can be a fun way for a 13-year-old to earn money. They can make all kinds of items to sell, like jewelry, paintings, or knitted scarves. They should think about what they enjoy creating. Maybe they’re great at drawing or love working with clay. They can use their talents to make items that people will want to buy. They can sell crafts online through sites for handmade goods or set up a table at local fairs and markets. You can help them get started and figure out the best places to sell. And, yes, people definitely buy products from kids! Recently, I purchased some lovely bead earrings from a young girl. I watched her make them right in front of me, and I ended up buying a few sets for myself. She priced her handmade earrings at around $10 per set, and I thought it was such a clever and creative small business idea! 12. Yard work Yard work is a good way for a 13-year-old to make money. They can sell services like raking leaves or pulling weeds. Yard work can bring in regular income, especially in spring, summer, and fall. They might even get repeat customers who need help every week or two, which can give them a steady flow of money for saving or spending. 13. Garage sale helper Being a garage sale helper is a great job for a 13-year-old. They can help neighbors or family members set up and run their garage sales. Their tasks might include sorting items, pricing things, and arranging displays. They’ll also help customers find what they’re looking for and handle simple sales. They can work on weekends or during school breaks (so, this is one of the best summer jobs for kids!). Most garage sales happen in spring and summer when the weather is good. 14. Junior camp counselor Being a junior camp counselor could be a great job for a 13-year-old! This role lets them help older counselors with camp activities. They’ll get to play games, do crafts, and join in sports with campers. It’s a fun way to build leadership skills and get work experience. They’ll also make new friends and enjoy the summer outdoors. Some camps hire 13-year-olds, especially if they’ve been campers there before. They might help set up activities or watch over younger kids during free time. I have several friends who were junior camp counselors when they were younger. They went to the camp when they were kids and then applied, when they were old enough to work, at the same camps they attended when they were younger. They all loved it! 15. YouTuber Being a YouTuber can be a fun job for a 13-year-old. They can make videos about things they love, like video games, toys, or their hobbies. To get started, they’ll need a camera or phone and some basic editing skills. They should think about what makes them unique. Maybe they’re great at explaining things or telling jokes. Using their talents can help their videos stand out. Staying safe online is very important. They should ask you for help setting up their channel and managing comments. They might not make money at first, but as their channel grows, they could earn through ads or sponsorships. Some young YouTubers even turn this hobby into a career.

Popular platforms like Twitch and YouTube allow them to show themselves playing games. Viewers can watch, chat, and even donate money if they enjoy the content. At 13, they can create a Twitch account with adult supervision. YouTube also allows teens 13 and older to have their own account. Earning money from streaming is possible but not guaranteed. It’s best to focus on enjoying the experience and connecting with other gamers first. 17. Voice-over artist Voice acting can be a fun job for a 13-year-old. They can use their voice to bring characters to life in cartoons, video games, and more. They can look for online casting calls or local opportunities. At first, they might voice characters for student films or small projects. With more experience, they could work on bigger jobs. It’s a great way to make money while being creative. Plus, they can often work from home, which makes it easy to balance with school. Recommended reading: How To Become A Voice Over Actor 18. Help with technology Helping people with tech can be a great way for a 13-year-old to make money. Many adults and older people need help with their phones, computers, and social media. At 13, they probably already know a lot about technology, and they can use those skills to earn some money. They might show someone how to use a new phone, help set up a social media account, or teach basic computer skills. They can start by offering their help to family and neighbors. Putting up flyers or posting on community boards can also let people know they’re available for tech help. I remember when I was a young teenager and my grandmother needed help with something online. She was definitely not computer savvy and she paid me a little bit of money to help her. Frequently Asked Questions Many 13-year-olds want to work and earn money.
