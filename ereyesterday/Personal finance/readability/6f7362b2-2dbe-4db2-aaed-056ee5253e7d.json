But first – wanted to thank you real quick for all the love and encouragement on our latest business launch I just posted about. We got a lot of great interest from the community so far as well as a handful of signups which is always promising when you put something out into the world – so thanks! :) Also while I’m at it, we raised $2,000 for our Community Fund the other month – woo!! Half of which I’ve already disseminated into the homeless community to help feed them, clothe them, shelter them, paper them!, and much much more. It won’t solve all their problems of course, but it’s a nice reprieve from their daily lives and I know they appreciate every last kind gesture we do. So thanks for helping me turbocharge it! :) To donate more to it, click here: Community Fund And to learn more about my new biz, go here: YouBots.ai ***** Now onto the giveaway! “Inner Entrepreneur” A Proven Path to Profit and Peace This one’s an exciting one to bring to you not only because of the content (all us bloggers are solopreneurs – even if by accident! 🤣) but mainly because it comes from a good blogger friend of mine, who’s as smart as he is NICE: Grant Sabatier. You might recognize him from MillennialMoney.com, or his best selling book, “Financial Freedom“. And he also just launched a real life independent bookstore too if you can believe it!! This guy never sleeps! Haha… (Check out ClintonvilleBooks.com if you’re ever in the Columbus, Ohio area) At any rate, super legit and genuine dude, and here’s what he says about his latest book – WHICH JUST DROPPED TODAY!! ***** “Inner Entrepreneur contains everything I’ve learned over the past 15 years that has really made a difference in my businesses and life. There’s no fluff. No generic business advice. It’s packed full of actionable steps. I’ve held nothing back. While there are many great entrepreneur books, there isn’t one like this – which presents a comprehensive view of how to go from finding a business idea to selling your company, acquiring, building a holding company, and more. Whether you’re curious about entrepreneurship or you’re already a pro, I’m confident you’ll get value from Inner Entrepreneur. The book is built around 4 levels of entrepreneurship and I dive deep into exactly what to do, consider, and the trade-offs required at each level: Level 1: Experimental Entrepreneur Level 2: Solopreneur Level 3: Growth Entrepreneur Level 4: Empire Entrepreneur Whether you’ve read my first book or not, this book is designed to help you build a business that gives you more freedom in your life.” ***** To learn more, go to: Inner Entrepreneur: A Proven Path to Profit and Peace Or download the first chapter (FREE) here: Chapter 1 of Inner Entrepreneur (PDF Download) Want a free copy?! I’ve got TWO free copies of Inner Entrepreneur to give away today :) All you have to do is answer the following question in the comments below (or via email), and you will automatically be entered to win. What’s a dream business you’d love to build? Or a business you’re currently working on? You don’t have to get too specific about it (“dog sitting” works), but feel free to elaborate too if you’re into it. You never know who will see it and could maybe help you out – or better yet, be a first customer! :) If you’re fresh out of ideas and need a little push – peruse our Side Hustle Series and maybe something there will jump out at you. We’ve featured everything from Christmas tree stands to photo booth empires to worm harvesting to trash picker-uppers to even more erotic areas like phone sex operating ;) There’s a million things you can do for money, and this book by Grant can help you narrow it down and take action. I’ll announce the two winners at the end of the week. GOOD LUCK!! And thanks again to Grant for offering these up. You can learn more about his projects here: GrantSabatier.com 🙏🙏 PS: You might also remember Grant if you were a member of the Rockstar Finance forums! He was a top resident there, always popping in and offering (free) advice. Fantastic person. *Links to books are Amazon affiliate links *** Giveaway Over! *** Congrats to Eric S. and MEM for winning!! Books will be in the mail soon! For everyone else – be sure to check it out at your local library so you can still get the good stuff! :) (Visited 348 times, 3 visits today) Get blog posts automatically emailed to you!",
