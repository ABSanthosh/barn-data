Recommended reading: 16 Best Places To Sell Clothes Where To Sell Jewelry: 12 Best Places For Extra Money Where To Sell Used Designer Bags Here are the 8 best places to sell used designer bags. 1. Rebag  Rebag is a popular site that allows people to buy, sell, and trade pre-owned luxury handbags. Their site includes luxury bags from brands like Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, and more.  The site makes the selling process as convenient as possible and even has an online tool that helps you find the value of designer bags. This makes the resale process transparent, so there’s more trust from the buyer to know that they are getting a good deal. Plus, the company is known for having a positive experience for both the seller and buyer in the used designer bag market. Rebag does have fees if you choose to sell on their website. If you sell your bag directly to Rebag for a fixed price, they charge a 15% fee. If you choose consignment, Rebag typically takes a 30%-40% commission.  2. Fashionphile  Fashionphile is another popular luxury resale platform but has a few key differences from Rebag. On Fashionphile, you can find handbags, accessories, watches, and jewelry. You can also send your items directly to them for evaluation (such as at their Neiman Marcus service desks) and even have the option of selling through physical locations or selling online on their website.  This platform has been around since 1999 and has a strong reputation for having a wide variety of authenticated luxury items. Fashionphile also has fees. These include direct sales with a 20% fee or consignment sales with a 30% commission for items under $1,000. For higher-end items, commission can range up to 25%. 3. The RealReal  The RealReal is an online luxury consignment platform that is known for selling authenticated pre-owned luxury items. These items may include fashion, jewelry, watches, handbags, fine art, and even home decor.  The authentication process is strict and they make sure everything is real. They employ a team of experts who inspect every item before it’s listed for sale, and many items even come with a certificate of authenticity.  Sellers can send their items to TheRealReal for consignment by mail (they will give you a prepaid shipping label) or drop the item off at one of their physical in-person stores. The RealReal also has selling fees, including a commission of 30%-50%, depending on the value of the bag. 4. MyGemma  MyGemma is a luxury resale platform that is known for buying and selling used designer handbags, jewelry, and other luxury items. You can expect brands like Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Hermes, and more.  Every item is inspected for authentication before being listed on MyGemma. As a seller, you send your items to MyGemma for evaluation where they’ll then offer you either purchase options or consignment sales.  MyGemma has a consignment model and charges a 20% commission on items sold. 5. Facebook Marketplace Facebook Marketplace is a great option if you want to sell your used designer bags locally, however, you can also decide to ship your handbag to a buyer.  If you want to get rid of your bags ASAP and don’t want to deal with shipping, Facebook Marketplace is a great option. Posting and selling on Facebook Marketplace is easy and convenient. You need to upload pictures and a description of your used designer bag. There are no fees for selling on Facebook (if you meet in person and sell face-to-face there is no fee, but if you use Facebook’s services, then there is a fee), which is a major bonus. People sell on Facebook all the time and have great success! 6. eBay  eBay is a great option to sell used designer bags because you can reach people around the world who are looking for luxury goods (people buy all sorts of things on eBay too, so you can even just have casual browsers find your listing as well) to buy. With eBay, you can choose between an auction-style sale or a fixed-price listing. eBay charges a 10%-12% commission on sales, with payment processing fees also applied. eBay has an Authenticity Guarantee, where a team of authenticators inspects your item before sending it to the buyer. This process helps protect you as the seller. 7. Etsy You may not have realized it, but you can sell used designer bags on Etsy. However, there are some important guidelines to keep in mind. Your items must be authentic and not counterfeit. If your items are fake, you can be banned from Etsy completely. You’ll also need to accurately describe the condition of your used designer bag. Etsy buyers expect transparency from sellers, so be honest about signs of wear, damage, or imperfections.  Make sure to provide important details like the brand, model, dimensions, condition, materials, and any other special information the buyer may want to know. If your handbag is older than 20 years, it could qualify as vintage and fall under Etsy’s vintage item category, which may get you seen by more people if they choose the “vintage” filter when searching through Etsy’s listings.  8. Vestiaire Collective Vestiaire Collective is a global online platform for buying and selling used designer bags as well as high-end fashion including clothing, shoes, accessories, and jewelry. Every item is authenticated and pre-owned by brands like Gucci, Hermes, and more. Sellers can list their items by sending them to Vestiaire Collective, where the employees check for authentication and condition. Then, the seller will have the option of selling directly through the platform’s app or website. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about selling used designer bags. What can I do with old designer bags?  If you’re ready to get rid of your old designer bags, you have many options. You can use specialized luxury resale platforms like TheRealReal, Rebag, or Fashionphile. You can also sell on your own via Facebook Marketplace, eBay, or even Etsy.  Are old designer bags worth anything?  Yes, old designer bags can be worth something, especially if they’re from well-known brands like Gucci or Louis Vuitton. Extra bonus points if the items are in good condition. The value will also depend on factors like rarity, demand, and age. Limited edition or vintage bags can get higher prices. Some of the best websites for used designer bags to check include Rebag, The RealReal, and eBay. Where is the best place to resell a Chanel bag? The best place to resell a Chanel bag includes TheRealReal, Fashionphile, MyGemma, and Rebag. All of these places charge a commission to sell on their site, but you’re also getting the exact audience you want buying your bag. Where is the best place to sell a used Louis Vuitton bag? The best place to sell a used Louis Vuitton bag includes The RealReal and Rebag as these sites are known for selling Louis Vuitton. However, if you’re looking for a higher payout and are comfortable handling the sale, you can choose eBay or Facebook Marketplace as your selling option. Where can I sell my designer handbag for the most money?  eBay offers the highest return for selling your used designer handbag. This is because of eBay’s low fees and access to their international audience. You can also choose to do an auction-style sale or a fixed-price sale. Where to sell used designer bags online? Some of the best places to sell used designer bags online include The RealReal, Rebag, Fashionphile, MyGemma, eBay, and Facebook Marketplace depending on how much money you want to make and how much oversight you want in the process. How do I stay safe when selling used designer handbags online? I highly recommend getting your handbag authenticated and obtaining proof of its authenticity before completing a sale on a site that doesn’t authenticate it. This was actually one of my sister’s first mistakes when she started selling items online. She sold a designer item and shipped it to the buyer. When the buyer received it, they claimed it wasn’t authentic (even though my sister knew it was). The buyer received a full refund, leaving my sister without the money or the item. Best Ways To Sell Used Designer Bags – Summary I hope you enjoyed my article on how to sell used designer bags. As you can see, there are many great places to sell used designer bags depending on how quickly you want to sell the item or how much money you want to make. If you have the time, a bidding-style sale on eBay can earn you a good amount of money, especially if you have vintage pieces that are highly desirable but hard to find. Alternatively, you can clean out your closet and sell designer bags directly to an online marketplace for a hassle-free experience. It all depends on how much time you want to invest.
