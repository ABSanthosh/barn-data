  "text": "By Gage Skidmore from Surprise, AZ, United States of America – Donald Trump, CC BY-SA 2.0, LinkYou’ve probably heard a lot of buzz on the internet about President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA). The bill officially takes effect this month, and it will impact more Americans than many realize. Some of the key provisions will have a direct effect on how much you can gift or leave to loved ones tax-free. You might think you have a sound estate plan in place, but the latest changes with the OBBBA could affect your strategy. Here’s a snapshot of the changes that may impact your estate planning and what you can do to better protect your assets (and avoid any surprises).Forever Richer: Estate \u0026 Gift Tax Exemption JumpsOne major change is that the federal estate and gift tax exemption becomes permanent, and moves to $15 million per person, $30 million per married couple in 2026. This means you can give or leave more to heirs before any taxes kick in. Previously, the exemption was scheduled to drop back to around $7 million in 2026 unless Congress acted. Now the higher threshold stays in place—and it’ll rise with inflation each year. That provides certainty in your estate planning and reduces guesswork about future tax exposure.Don’t Delay Gifting—More Time to Use ItBecause the new law resets the exemption base year to 2026, you now have flexibility in when to make lifetime gifts. That eliminates the scramble many were facing to gift before the 2025 sunset. Nonetheless, some advisors recommend using at least part of your exemption early, since future legislators could still change the rules, even with the law calling itself “permanent.” Transfers to trusts or heirs remain a powerful tool for legacy planning. Bottom line: you can plan calmly, but acting sooner could still pay off.Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) Planning UnlockedThe revamped exemption also applies to the generation-skipping transfer tax (GST), which covers transfers to grandchildren or great-grandchildren. This means you can allocate large gifts across successive generations without triggering a tax. If you’ve been $14M-capped before, that new $15M limit gives more headroom. You’ll want to formally allocate exemptions in trusts to lock in those tax savings. Failing to do so could leave an unused tax sheltering opportunity on the table.Estate \u0026 Gift Planning Strategies ShiftWith a $15M exemption as the baseline, estate planning strategies are shifting from tax-avoidance urgency to legacy optimization. High-net-worth individuals can now focus on dynastic or flexible trusts, charitable giving, and asset protection without rushing. Moderate-wealth families can delay costly restructuring and review wills and trust flex clauses. Everyone benefits from reviewing beneficiary designations and portability terms. Even if you don’t owe taxes, planning ensures your intentions are honored.But State Inheritance Rules Still BiteDon’t forget federal changes won’t affect state-level taxes . States like Massachusetts, Nebraska, and Kentucky impose much lower estate or inheritance taxes. If you live in—or plan to move—you may still face state-level liabilities. That means families in those states may need supplementary strategies, such as ILITs, dynasty trusts, or even residency planning. Proactive coordination with your advisor can save thousands for your heirs.Digital Assets \u0026 Retirement Accounts Need UpdatingThe OBBBA comes with a reminder: estate planning is more than exemptions. Your plan should address digital assets, retirement accounts, healthcare directives, and incapacity decision-making. Federal law won’t touch those, but a failure to update them leaves your family scrambling. Review beneficiary forms, confirm successor trustees, and ensure your digital legacy is accessible. A comprehensive estate plan covers tax, legal, and practical matters.Professional Counsel Is Still EssentialEven with higher exemptions, estate planning is complex, and mistakes happen. Simple wills leave gaps in probate, incapacity, or asset distribution. Trusts must be funded and designed to address changing tax or family dynamics. Privacy, asset protection, and Medicaid eligibility are still concerns, especially with OBBBA’s cuts to Medicaid funding. A professional can tailor strategies like dynasty trusts or trust protectors to your situation. Estate planning remains crucial no matter your portfolio size.What This Means for Your Family LegacyThe new legislation offers historic federal protections, but it also requires thoughtful execution. Estate planning isn’t just about maximizing exemption—it’s about ensuring your wishes guide how assets are used and cared for. Now is the time to review your trust documents, gifting strategies, state exposure, and non-tax issues. An annual check-in with a qualified advisor ensures you and your legacy are prepared, whatever the future holds.Will the new laws change your estate planning strategy—or confirm you’re on the right track?
