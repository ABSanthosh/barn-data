Requirements: Apply for and get the Truist Enjoy Travel credit card Make $1,500 worth of purchases within the first three months of opening the account Here’s a look at the current rewards earning structure: Earn 2x miles per $1 spent on airfare, car rentals, and hotels. Earn 1x miles per $1 spent on all other eligible purchases. Plus, a statement credit up to $85 for TSA PreCheck® or Global Entry® fee is awarded once every four years. You’ll also earn a 10% – 50% Loyalty Travel Bonus based on your Truist deposit relationship when you redeem your rewards for travel through the rewards program.There is more good news as any points you earn also do not expire for as long as the account remains open.FAQsWhat are bank bonuses?Bank bonuses are cash rewards and other perks the bank gives to its customers for meeting specific criteria.In most cases, these involve depositing a certain amount of new money into a new account and holding it there for some time.There are several reasons why a bank does this. These reasons can include anything from attracting new customers to rewarding customers that have been with the bank for a very long time.Either way, taking advantage of these bonuses on offer can see you get extra cash, which is always welcome.What should I look out for?While free money is always something to look forward to, it’s important to take note of the fine print that accompanies any sign-up bonus you’re thinking of taking.Most promotions and bonuses require several direct deposits to be made into the account within so many days of opening the account (has to be a deposit by your employer or an outside agency).The funds usually have to be kept in the deposit account for several months before you become eligible for the bonus.Some offers are available online, while others are exclusively in-branch.Do keep in mind that some accounts also have a fee that has to be paid every fee period, which is mostly set to monthly.The applicable APR rate is another important point to take into consideration, especially the applicable rate once any introductory offers are over.Ultimately, each promotion is subject to its own terms and conditions.This makes it important to make sure you understand the restrictions and obligations surrounding each offer you want to take up.All information should be available through the promotion page on the bank’s website. If you cannot find it, be sure to ask one of the bank’s representatives for a copy.We will now look at the different bonuses on offer, how you can take advantage of them, and what other perks you can look forward to when opening a new Truist consumer account or business account.Is A Truist Bank Bonus For You?Truist is an excellent bank if you’re looking to open a new account while making your money go further by taking advantage of some bonus offer codes.As with most bank bonuses, these are only available to new Truist customers.So, for example, if you’re a current owner of a Truist consumer account, it is best to check with a customer service rep before applying for a new card or account so that you can be sure that you’ll definitely get the bonus.Before opening a new bank account to claim any bonus, be sure to take the time to shop around.Many card issuers are offering bonuses right now, but looking at the bonus requirements and eligibility criteria set by the bank can help you narrow it down to the ones that could really work for you.Take the time to understand the eligibility requirements to avoid disappointment.Some accounts also have a monthly service fee, but in most cases, this can be waived by meeting specific requirements.Many banks around the country have ongoing and seasonal promotions, but you do have to be mindful of their expiration dates as they change frequently.",
