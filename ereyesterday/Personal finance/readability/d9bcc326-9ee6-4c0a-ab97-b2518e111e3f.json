  "text": "Amazon’s well-known Prime Day sale is back this summer, running July 8-11. As I look back on my previous years covering and shopping the deals, I’ve noticed a pattern: There’s a lot of hype leading up to the sale, but I’m left feeling a bit dissatisfied when it’s over.The problem isn’t always the deals themselves, but how I shop. I’ve let temptation and the fear of missing out get the better of me. And I know I’m not the only one.So, I asked a couple of my fellow personal finance writers to join me in sharing our biggest Prime Day blunders. What is your biggest Prime Day regret?Cordless LED table lampAmanda Barroso: “It was cute for about an hour, then it lost its charge. The lamp was not on my list, but I had seen a lot of people in my social media feeds linking to similar products. I wish I returned it but I waited too late and missed the return window. So, now it's sitting in a donate pile waiting to go to my local thrift store.”Unplanned itemsLauren Schwahn: “Last year, I had my eye on a Yoto Mini audio player for my son’s upcoming birthday. I snagged a starter pack bundle for $63.99 (a $16 discount) on Prime Day. But I got caught up in browsing other deals. I added on $8 hair clips and a $17 pajama set that I didn’t really need. Spending an extra $25 wasn’t the worst-case scenario, but I could have put that money to better use elsewhere — especially considering one of the clips broke in my thick hair after maybe three uses.” An expensive soundbarTommy Tindall: “It wasn’t on Prime Day in July, but I spent over $700 on a Sonos soundbar during Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days in October last year. I was in the market for some kind of TV speaker, but it's not like me to spend that much. Amazon dangled a bunch of deals in front of me, I got caught up in the hype of the sale and told myself it was OK to spend hundreds on a random day in October.”What did you learn?It’s important to prepare for returns.Amanda Barroso: “Just because influencers make something look useful or cute on social media doesn't mean it's true or worth your money. I'm still willing to try some things, but I'm always checking to make sure an item is sold and shipped by Amazon to make for easy returns. And I'm keeping the packaging for items like this for a couple of weeks just to be sure.”Sticking to a list is best. Lauren Schwahn: “A discount alone isn’t a good enough reason to buy something. If an item isn’t on my list, it probably doesn’t belong in my cart. And if I’ve never heard of the brand before, it’s probably best to avoid it. I’ve had my fair share of quality issues with impulse buys. This year, I’m going to focus on items that I truly need and ignore the recommended deals that Amazon throws my way.”It’s easy to let excitement cloud your judgment. Tommy Tindall: “I'm just as impressionable and influenced by hype as everyone else. I hated myself for spending that much on one item, and had that thing back in the box not even an hour after I had opened it and set it up. I sent the soundbar back promptly, and decided not to let a made-up sale holiday incite unnecessary overspending again.”How to avoid regrettable choices this Prime Day Buyer’s remorse happens to the best of us. But with a little preparation, you might be spared this year. Here’s what you can learn from our past missteps:Don’t shop just because there’s a sale. It’s hard not to get sucked into Prime Day and competing sales. But there’s no shame in sitting them out if you don’t need anything right now.Make a list. If you are going to check out the sales, come prepared. Plan out what to buy ahead of time, and consider saving the items you want in your shopping cart. This can reduce the temptation to browse on sale day.Set a budget for impulse buys. If you don’t want to give up browsing the deals entirely, set a spending limit just for spontaneous purchases. Pick an amount you’d be comfortable parting with if you’re unable to make a return.Read product pages carefully. Check out item descriptions, specs and reviews to better set expectations. Look for shipping and return policy details, too. Stick to reputable brands, when possible, and vet third party sellers carefully.",
