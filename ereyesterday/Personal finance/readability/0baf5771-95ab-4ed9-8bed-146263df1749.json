  "text": "Presidents Day falls on the third Monday of February, giving many workers a three-day weekend. It's a prime time for travel, especially for those looking to escape winter’s chill. But while the holiday weekend sees a surge in travelers, some days are significantly busier than others.A NerdWallet analysis of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoint data shows that Presidents Day has similar travel trends as other long weekends, like Labor Day. Friday tends to be the busiest day for flying, followed by the Monday holiday.If you want to avoid the worst of the crowds — and maybe even save on airfare — it helps to be strategic about when you fly. NerdWallet calculated the average passenger volumes at TSA checkpoints from 2022 to 2024 over a 15-day period, including Presidents Day and the week before and after. Here’s how those airport travel days rank from most to least crowded.Flying before Presidents DayMost crowded:Friday before. (2.46 million passengers.)Sunday before. (2.29 million.)Thursday before. (2.28 million.)Least crowded:Tuesday before. (1.66 million.)Wednesday before. (1.9 million.)Saturday before. (2.02 million.)Flying on or after Presidents DayMost crowded:Presidents Day (Monday). (2.44 million passengers.)Sunday after. (2.37 million.)Friday after. (2.36 million.)Least crowded:Wednesday after. (1.97 million.)Saturday after. (2 million.)Tuesday after. (2.04 million.)Over the past three years, the Friday leading into Presidents Day weekend has been the single busiest day to fly during this 15-day window. Expect Friday, Feb. 14, 2025, to be exceptionally crowded.And assuming trends continue, expect Presidents Day — Monday, Feb. 17, 2025 — to be quite busy, too.The smarter, cheaper Presidents Day weekend itineraryIf you work a traditional Monday-to-Friday schedule and have Presidents Day off, the obvious plan might be to leave Friday evening and return Monday. But this approach means you’ll face peak crowds and higher prices. Consider adjusting your travel days to save money and time.Fly on the Tuesday or Wednesday before: Extend the long weekend by leaving before the Friday rush.Travel on Saturday: The Saturdays both before and after the holiday tend to be among the quieter travel days. While crowds depart on Friday, you might enjoy a quiet day at work, use the evening to pack, and leave on Saturday. Plus, an early Saturday flight can decrease your odds of a flight delay versus flying out Friday evening. Among the 30 largest airports in the U.S., about 91% of flights arriving before noon were on time, compared to about 80% of flights arriving after 6 p.m., according to a report from the Department of Transportation based on October 2024 data.Extend your trip through Wednesday: Most people return home on Presidents Day Monday, but why not stay longer? The Wednesday after Presidents Day is the least-crowded day to fly during the seven-day period after the holiday. Over the last three years, TSA data shows that airport passenger volume on Presidents Day Monday was 23% higher, on average, than on the following Wednesday. Use points or miles. If you’re sitting on airline miles or travel credit card rewards, don’t let them collect virtual dust. Spending miles is generally a smart move, as they don’t accrue interest if they’re just sitting there. Using those miles on your next flight could help you save significantly on travel costs.How to maximize your rewards",
