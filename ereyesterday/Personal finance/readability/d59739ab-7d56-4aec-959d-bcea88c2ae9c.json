  "text": "Here's our annual list of the best stock brokers and trading platforms for 2025.The investing landscape has changed dramatically over the last few years. We've seen new technology drop commissions and expenses substantially (to $0 for most), new tools helping investors, and a whole lot of competition to stay at the top of the pack.So, with all these changes, who do you (the readers) think is the best online stock broker going into 2025? We have been polling our audience annually and we're excited to share the best investing platforms with you!We break down the top five online stock brokers chosen by readers, along with some notable mentions, especially for certain use cases. We also highlight any bonus offers these companies currently have. If you're not using a top online stock brokerage firm yet, now is the time to make the switch!Here's your picks for the top online stock brokers and trading platforms: Best Online Stock Brokers And Trading Apps Note: The investing offers that appear on this site are from companies from which The College Investor receives compensation. This list is ranked based on our annual survey conducted with methodology below.1. FidelityFidelity took the top pick again this year among all the brokerage and stock trading apps. They have a large amount of commission-free funds, low expenses, and a full range of account types to choose from. Even if you don't invest with a commission-free fund, they are $0 for commissions for stocks, ETFs, and options trades.Furthermore, many people are familiar with Fidelity because (along with Vanguard) they are one of the largest 401k plan administrators. That's why we name Fidelity our Best Online Broker for Retirement.Plus, unlike Vanguard, Fidelity has offices nationwide. While almost everything can be done online, being able to easily go to an office can be helpful every now and then.Fidelity Bonus Offers:  Fidelity is offering various bonus offers for their products, including the Fidelity Youth Account.Open an account at Fidelity \u003e\u003e2. Charles SchwabSchwab has been moving up the rankings for the last few years - reaching second place this year in our list of the best online stock brokers. Last year it was third.What people love about Schwab is their great trading platform (which is commission-free) combined with a solid banking product, which other than Fidelity, most of the others here don't offer. Plus, they finally added an HSA account to their lineup!With their acquisition of TD Ameritrade, Schwab also now has a great trading platform with thinkorswim.Furthermore, they have no purchase minimums for their mutual funds, so you can build an extremely low cost portfolio at Schwab using popular funds like Schwab Total Stock Market Index (SWTSX). And they also moved to $0 account minimums for most products.Open an account at Schwab \u003e\u003e3. RobinhoodRobinhood has always been a controversial online broker: it has bounced in and out of our top brokerage list several times. This is likely driven by a huge surge of traders who took to investing on the platform in the last year. Plus, they’re offering cool features like a retirement contribution match!Robinhood offers truly commission-free trading. Like $0. Nada. Nothing. They were the first to offer this, but now everyone does.It does come with some drawbacks beyond the media. You are limited in your trading, and the mobile app can be annoying to use if you prefer desktop access.However, it's free!Robinhood Bonus Offers: Get a random share of stock when you refer a friend. They also have transfer and retirement match offers.Open an account at Robinhood \u003e\u003e4. VanguardVanguard has been seeing rankings plummet over the last  - and it makes sense for a variety of reasons, from the app usability, to lackluster customer service. However, this year they rose one spot to land at number 4.Vanguard is still consistently the low-price index fund leader - and when you invest directly with Vanguard, you can potentially avoid commissions and fees on your mutual fund purchases. However, Vanguard had several hiccups with its online platform and app (even though the re-designed app is modern and easy to use). They also recently announced they were slashing expense ratios on many of the mutual funds.Vanguard does offer the full range of account types, from IRAs to Solo 401k's, to 529 plans and HSAs. The big drawback to Vanguard is that they aren't as great to use for products outside of their own. Plus, their website and customer service has been struggling to keep pace the last year. Also, if you dive into the details of some of their products (like their Solo 401k), it's not always the most robust available.Vanguard Bonus Offers: Vanguard doesn't run any bonus offers... maybe they're just too good for that they don't need to entice you?Open an account at Vanguard \u003e\u003e5. E*TRADE by Morgan StanleyE*TRADE dropped a spot this year in the rankings. E*TRADE has been working hard to compete with the other companies on this list, dropping to commission-free pricing and improving its interface.However, we would say they still generally lag in terms of usability compared to the companies above, and their customer service is lacking (they even eliminated online chat last year for many features).Open an account at E*TRADE \u003e\u003eHonorable MentionsThese honorable mentions didn't make the top 5, but they are really worth a look if you want someone else to do the work for you when it comes to investing and setting up your portfolio. These are companies that got votes and interest from our audience but not enough to crack the top of the list.SoFiSoFi has ranked number6 on our list for about 3 years now and we continue to see their customers speak highly of them on social media. While we're not fans of SoFi, it's clear that a lot of people are. SoFi allows you to invest as little as $1, has fractional shares, and even offers some crypto trading.The drawback with SoFi is that they don't really do anything better compared to the top brokers, while at the same time they also continue to face FINRA and SEC scrutiny. WebullWebull is still a popular app for online trading. If you’re not familiar, Webull is an investing app very similar to Robinhood, where you can trade stocks, options, ETFs, and limited crypto.Unlike Robinhood, they offer a much more robust set of research features, advanced trading tools, and more.They also offer retirement accounts as well as regular taxable investing.Webull Bonus Offer: One free stock valued from $3 to $300 if they open Webull brokerage account and another valued from $8 to $2,000 if you direct deposit at least $5.Open an account at Webull \u003e\u003ePublic.comPublic is making it's debut appearance on our list of the best brokerage companies. Public is an investing app that focuses on commission-free investing with a social aspect.In the last couple years, Public has launched options trading, a robust savings product with a top interest rate, and fractional share trading.They pride themselves on the fact they do not accept payment for order flow (which is one of the main ways Robinhood makes money).Open an account at Public \u003e\u003eTradestationTradeStation is a an honorable mention this year, and it’s nice to see that their platform improvements have been resonating with customers.TradeStation is most well-known for its active trading features. Their trading tools and ability to integrate with charting and automatic software make it a top choice for active traders.The drawback is that it can feel “advanced”, and the pricing can be difficult to understand for high volume users.TradeStation Bonus Offer: Earn up to $3,500 when you transfer funds into your TradeStation account. Open an account at TradeStation \u003e\u003eInteractive Brokers (IBKR)Interactive Brokers is another platform that consistently makes our list, albeit not as popular as other platforms. They’ve been getting a lot of positive feedback for their trading tools, paper trading platform, and their margin account - with consistently some of the lowest rates on the market.In fact, if you go into any fatFIRE forums, you’ll see IBKR consistently listed as one of the best places to hold a large amount of securities if you want to borrow against them. They also launched IBKR Lite with commission-free trading for US stocks and ETFs, with commissions on other products. Make sure you check out their full commission schedule as it can be a bit complex.Open an account at IBKR \u003e\u003eFinal ThoughtsIt was interesting to see some of the big shifts this year - with Vanguard rising a spot while E*TRADE lost a spot, and Public.com making the list while M1 Finance fell off. We strongly believe the M1's pricing structure change last year really frustrated a lost of consumers.I think many people realize that since almost all pricing is the same, the full-service features, ability to open different account types and reliability are a lot more popular factors to consider than an app-only investing firm.Remember, this was based on an annual survey. We keep this list updated throughout the year with features and pricing, and revisit the rankings annually with a new survey.MethodologyThe College Investor commissioned Pollfish to conduct an online survey of 600 Americans who self-selected that they were familiar with investing and investing tools. The survey was fielded on February 7, 2025.",
