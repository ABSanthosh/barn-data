If you’re anything like me, you probably like finding easy ways to make extra money in your spare time. One thing… HeyPiggy pays you to take surveys at home. Learn what I think of this site in my HeyPiggy Review. Are you looking for an easy way to earn a little extra money from home? If you’re anything like me, you probably like finding easy ways to make extra money in your spare time. One thing I hear from readers all the time is that they want flexible side hustles they can do without a lot of stress or commitment – and online surveys usually come up. Over the years, I’ve tried many paid survey sites myself – some great, some not so great. Today, I want to share my honest experience testing HeyPiggy, a survey site that says you can earn cash or gift cards just for sharing your opinions online. In this HeyPiggy review, I’ll break down exactly how it works, how much money you can realistically expect to make, my real-life pros and cons, and whether or not it’s worth your time. I’ll even show you my own screenshots so you can see what it really looks like on the inside. Please click here to try out HeyPiggy. HeyPiggy Review Below is my HeyPiggy review. Here is a screenshot of some of the surveys available in my HeyPiggy account. What is HeyPiggy? HeyPiggy was started around 1 ½ years ago and has over 1,000,000 users. It is an online survey platform that’s available as both a website and an app (iOS and Android) and is available in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Australia. The idea behind HeyPiggy is pretty straightforward: You answer questions, share your honest thoughts on products and services, and in exchange, you earn a little money. When you join HeyPiggy, you’ll get access to surveys that can pay anywhere from just a few cents to a few dollars each. Some surveys take just a minute or two, while others can take up to 30 minutes or more. Once you reach the payout minimum, you can cash out with PayPal, Venmo, bank transfer, a virtual Visa card, or a big list of gift cards like Amazon, Walmart, Starbucks, DoorDash, and more (there are around 150 gift card options available). I like that they give you a lot of choices. Not every survey site lets you cash out with so many options, especially with such low minimums. Is HeyPiggy legit? Whenever I test a new survey site, the first thing I look at is whether it’s actually legit. I don’t want you wasting your time on scams or sites that never pay out. I can say that HeyPiggy is real – I tested it myself, and I could see actual surveys waiting for me on my dashboard. I liked that they were upfront about the payout for each survey and that you can see exactly how much you’ll make before you start. When you finish a survey (or even if you get kicked out), your earnings show up right away. And when you’re ready to cash out, the site has so many payout options – from PayPal to Venmo to a long list of store gift cards, and you can redeem starting at just $1 for many of the options (such as Amazon or Visa). That’s always a good sign for me because it shows they’re not trying to keep your money locked up. Another thing I look for is what other people are saying. HeyPiggy has pretty good ratings on places like Trustpilot and the app stores, with some people sharing that they were paid within minutes. The HeyPiggy Trustpilot rating is 4.6 out of 5 stars, with around 13,000 reviews. HeyPiggy also has a rating of 4.5 stars out of 5 on Google Play, with over 500,000 downloads. Of course, like any survey site, not everyone has the same experience – but it’s nice to see some positive feedback to back it up. HeyPiggy gift card options How does HeyPiggy work? If you’re brand new to survey sites, here’s how HeyPiggy works: Sign up for free – You can sign up through their website or download the app on your phone by clicking here. It’s free and pretty quick. Complete your profile – This part is important! You’ll answer some questions about yourself – things like your age, education, household info, and so on. This helps HeyPiggy match you with surveys you’re more likely to qualify for. Pick your surveys – Once your profile is filled out, you’ll see a dashboard with surveys that are available to you. Each survey shows how much it pays, how long it should take, and a star rating. I like that they show this upfront – it makes it easier to choose which ones feel worth your time. Take the survey – Click, answer honestly, and finish the survey. Just keep in mind that sometimes you might get screened out partway through. It’s annoying, but it happens with pretty much every survey site. Cash out – Once you’ve reached the minimum payout (which can be as low as $1 to $5), you can choose to get paid with PayPal, Venmo, a virtual Visa card, or gift cards to your favorite stores. I also noticed that HeyPiggy has a little bonus system – sometimes you’ll see special offers or small bonuses if you do certain surveys during a limited time. It’s a nice little incentive if you want to earn a bit more in a day. How much can you make with HeyPiggy? Let’s be honest – nobody’s retiring early by taking surveys online. But it can be an easy way to earn some extra pocket money, especially if you have some free time while watching TV or while waiting around. When I tested HeyPiggy, I saw surveys that paid anywhere from 9 cents for a quick one-minute survey all the way up to $3 for a longer one. Most surveys I found were in the 30 cents to $1.50 range. One tip I found really helpful: I had better luck sticking with the shorter surveys. For example, I found that 35 cents for a 5-minute survey was more realistic and less frustrating because I was less likely to get screened out. The longer surveys often paid more, but the odds of getting kicked out seemed higher, too. So, while you definitely won’t make big money with HeyPiggy, it can add up if you check in regularly and grab a few quick surveys when you have a few minutes to spare. Here’s an example of a survey that I was kicked out of. My personal experience using HeyPiggy I always like to share the real stuff – the good and the not-so-good – so you can decide if it’s worth trying. Here’s what stood out to me while using HeyPiggy: Typos and repeated questions: I did notice some typos on the site and inside the surveys. In one survey, they asked me what my highest level of education was at least five times – I felt like I was on repeat! Inaccurate time estimates: A few surveys said they’d take 15 minutes, but once I started, the actual survey site said 25 minutes. That’s not a huge deal if you have time, but it can be annoying if you’re tracking your hourly rate. Lots of disqualifications: Like some survey sites, I did get kicked out of quite a few surveys. That can sometimes be pretty normal but still a bit annoying. There were quite a few surveys where I was kicked out at the very last question after answering questions for 10+ minutes. Extra bonuses for screenouts: One thing I did like is that HeyPiggy sometimes gives you a tiny bonus (like 5 cents) if you get kicked out of a survey. It’s not much, but it’s better than nothing. Better luck with short surveys: Personally, I had more success sticking with shorter surveys. I felt like I wasted less time and had a higher chance of actually finishing the survey and getting paid. Overall, HeyPiggy is a legit site, but you have to go in with realistic expectations. If you’re hoping for easy money, you might get frustrated. But if you like having a small, flexible way to make a few extra bucks here and there, it can be worth adding to your list. Pros and cons of HeyPiggy Here’s a quick look at what I think are the best parts and what could be better: Pros: Super easy to sign up and get started Free to use, no hidden fees Low payout minimum ($1 to $5) Lots of payout choices like PayPal, Venmo, gift cards, Virtual Visa Small bonus if you get screened out of a survey Works on both desktop and mobile Cons: Survey time estimates can be off by a few minutes (or more) Some survey disqualifications (like most survey sites, but still something to know) Tips for making the most with HeyPiggy If you decide to try HeyPiggy, here are a few tips to help you get the best experience: Be honest – Fill out your profile honestly so you get surveys that actually match you. Stick to shorter surveys – From my experience, the shorter surveys (like under 10 minutes) were better because I didn’t get kicked out as often. Check in often – Surveys come and go quickly. Logging in regularly can help you snag the best ones before they fill up. Cash out quickly – Since the payout minimum is so low, I always recommend cashing out as soon as you reach it. That way, you’re not sitting on money you might forget about. Combine with other sites – HeyPiggy can be a nice extra, but I recommend signing up for other sites too, like Survey Junkie or Branded Surveys, so you have more opportunities and can stack your earnings. Look at the star ratings for the survey – On HeyPiggy, each individual survey has a star rating. I recommend trying the ones that have 5 stars because those are usually the easier ones that are less likely to kick you out. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about HeyPiggy. Is HeyPiggy worth it? So, would I recommend HeyPiggy? If you’re looking for an easy, flexible way to earn a little extra spending money during your downtime, HeyPiggy can be a good option to add to your list. What I like is that the cash-out minimum is low, there are many payout choices, and it works on both your phone and computer. If you’re realistic about what you’ll earn and stick to shorter surveys, HeyPiggy can be a decent little side hustle for a bit of fun money each month. How does HeyPiggy pay you? You can cash out through PayPal cash, Venmo, bank transfer, Virtual Visa card, or gift cards for Amazon, Walmart, DoorDash, Starbucks, Sephora, and more. What’s the minimum payout on HeyPiggy? It depends on the reward you choose – some start as low as $1 to $5. Why do I get kicked out of surveys? Survey disqualifications happen on every survey site. Sometimes you just don’t fit what the survey company is looking for. Keeping your profile updated and trying shorter surveys can help. Can you make real money with HeyPiggy? Yes, but keep your expectations realistic – it’s more of a small side hustle, not a full paycheck. Your earnings potential is most likely going to be around $5 or less per hour. There are occasionally high-paying surveys on HeyPiggy that will allow you to earn more than this, but it’s not the norm. HeyPiggy Review – Summary I hope you enjoyed my HeyPiggy Review. If you enjoy taking surveys during your spare time, it can be an easy way to earn a few extra dollars for things like coffee, snacks, or small treats for yourself. I like how HeyPiggy has a low minimum payout requirement (starting at just $1!), a user-friendly interface, and many available surveys for you to answer. Overall, I had a positive experience.

The longer surveys often paid more, but the odds of getting kicked out seemed higher, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, while you definitely won’t make big money with HeyPiggy, it can add up if you check in regularly and grab a few quick surveys when you have a few minutes to spare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"564\" src=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HeyPiggy-example-of-closed-survey-1024x564.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HeyPiggy-example-of-closed-survey-1024x564.png 1024w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HeyPiggy-example-of-closed-survey-300x165.png 300w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HeyPiggy-example-of-closed-survey-768x423.png 768w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HeyPiggy-example-of-closed-survey-1536x846.png 1536w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HeyPiggy-example-of-closed-survey-2048x1129.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HeyPiggy-example-of-closed-survey.png\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20width=\u0026#39;1024\u0026#39;%20height=\u0026#39;564\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%201024%20564\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-src=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HeyPiggy-example-of-closed-survey-1024x564.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HeyPiggy-example-of-closed-survey-1024x564.png 1024w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HeyPiggy-example-of-closed-survey-300x165.png 300w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HeyPiggy-example-of-closed-survey-768x423.png 768w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HeyPiggy-example-of-closed-survey-1536x846.png 1536w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HeyPiggy-example-of-closed-survey-2048x1129.png 2048w\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cem\u003eHere’s an example of a survey that I was kicked out of.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy personal experience using HeyPiggy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI always like to share the real stuff – the good and the not-so-good – so you can decide if it’s worth trying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s what stood out to me while using HeyPiggy:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTypos and repeated questions:\u003c/strong\u003e I did notice some typos on the site and inside the surveys.

What I like is that the cash-out minimum is low, there are many payout choices, and it works on both your phone and computer.
