On average, homeowners who replace all the shingles on their roof pay around $10,000, according to online home improvement marketplace HomeAdvisor.Your final cost will depend on location, shingle material, job complexity and number of shingles replaced.Roof shingle cost by materialRoof shingle costs vary significantly depending on the material you choose. Asphalt, composite and wood are generally the least expensive, while clay, metal and slate are typically the most costly. Here’s what you can expect to pay based on shingle material, including installation:Shingle materialAverage cost per square footAsphalt$4.25 to $12.25.Clay$12 to $25.Composite$8 to $14.Metal$10 to $35.Slate$12 to $30.Wood$6 to $13.Shingle cost by roof sizeThe larger the area of replacement shingles, the higher the cost. Shingles are usually sold in 100-foot squares or bundles of 20 to 33 square feet. Purchasing shingles in these bulk quantities can help reduce your price per shingle. Here’s a typical range of total shingle costs by roof square footage, including installation:Square footage1,000$2,250 to $8,000.1,500$3,375 to $13,500.2,000$4,500 to $18,000.3,000$6,800 to $24,000.Labor costInstallation labor accounts for approximately 60% of the cost of a new shingle roof. Most professional roofers charge at least $2 per square foot. Several factors can affect your installation cost:Roof pitch. The steeper the pitch of your roof, the more difficult and hazardous it is to work on. This extra risk and difficulty will be reflected in labor costs.Roof style. If your roof has complex shapes or bends, the installation may be more labor-intensive and cost more.Shingle material. Some shingle materials, such as clay, metal and slate, are more difficult to install and can incur higher labor costs.Shingle removal. If old shingles need to be removed and disposed of, that additional labor will typically increase costs by $1,000 to $5,000.Permits and inspection. Permit costs vary significantly depending on your location and typically cost $250 to $500. An official inspection to ensure your roof shingles were installed correctly typically costs around $200. If your contractor does the legwork to get your permit, that will create additional labor time and costs. Permit costs may not be included in your estimates, so make sure to ask your contractor about the expected costs.Flashing, chimneys, vents and reinforcement repairs. If your shingle installer needs to repair other roof components or the underlying roof decking, this will significantly increase labor and material costs from about $150 to nearly $1,000.Roof accessibility. If it’s difficult for contractors to access your roof due to your particular landscape or building height, this will increase your labor costs.Things to consider when choosing roof shinglesInitial roofing expenses can often be offset by other important factors. Here are a few to consider when choosing your shingles:Shingle material lifespanLess expensive shingle materials, such as 3-tab asphalt and wood, typically last 20 to 25 years, while architectural asphalt shingles last approximately 30 years .Metal roofing costs more upfront, but can last between 40 and 80 years, while a slate roof can last 60 to 150 years.ClimateDifferent types of roofing shingle materials perform better or worse in specific weather conditions, so it makes sense to consider your local weather conditions before making a selection. For example:Asphalt shingles may be more easily blown off in windstorms or damaged by hail.Metal can be noisy during rain or hailstorms, or due to expansion and contraction that occurs with extreme temperature fluctuations. Metal provides good protection in extreme heat, heavy snow, strong winds and hail, although some metals may be vulnerable to denting during hailstorms. Wood shingles (such as cedar) are vulnerable to leaking, breakage, cracking, rot, pests and mold. Because of this, a rainy or wet climate could wear them down faster.Clay can crack or break if branches or other debris fall on it, so it may not be the best choice for properties with trees growing close to the home and frequent windy weather.Partial repair vs. roof replacementA roofing professional can tell you whether a sectional repair or a full replacement is a better fit for your roof. If only a small section of your roof is damaged, just replacing the affected shingles in that area may be feasible. However, if your roof is very old or in overall poor condition, it may need to be fully replaced. On average, roof repairs cost only a fraction of the price of a full roof replacement, typically ranging from around $400 to $2,000. Your actual cost for a repair will depend on the size of the area where shingles are being replaced, the materials and the amount of labor involved. To get a more accurate cost estimate, you can schedule a professional roof inspection, which typically costs around $235.Frequently asked questionsDo I need to hire a professional to install roof shingles?If you’re experienced in roofing and have all the proper tools, you may be able to install your own roof shingles. This isn’t a job for beginners, however, and many experts discourage DIY roofing work altogether for the following reasons:You may not be able to achieve a clean aesthetic.If you damage your roof, your homeowner’s insurance will likely not cover it.DIY repairs may void your shingle warranties.Mistakes you make can be costly to repair.Roofing is dangerous work, especially during rough weather or if your roof isn’t structurally sound. You risk injuries from falls and nail guns, as well as accidentally damaging the roof.It’s generally more time-consuming for a DIYer than a professional.Required tools and materials are expensive.A poor DIY job can reduce your home’s value.Do shingle roof costs vary by location?Where you live is a significant factor in the cost of a shingle roof. Residents of California and New York, for example, pay significantly more for their shingle roofs than those who live in Texas, Georgia, Illinois or Michigan.Is a shingle roof covered by a warranty?There are two main types of warranties that may be offered with your roof shingles. Having both a manufacturer's warranty for your shingles and a workmanship warranty for the installation labor gives you the best possible protection.Standard manufacturer warranty This type of non-negotiable warranty is provided by the shingle manufacturer and is also known as a materials warranty. It covers only the cost of defective shingles and the labor required to replace them for a specified time period. It doesn’t cover the tear-off and disposal of the faulty shingles. You may also be able to receive a percentage of the cost to replace defective shingles. During a prorated time period after the full-coverage period. Only factory defects are included in this coverage; damages from improper installation are not covered. You may also be able to purchase extended manufacturer warranty coverage.Workmanship warrantyThis type of warranty is provided by the roofing contractor and is often referred to as a labor warranty. It covers the labor involved in the installation, protecting you against errors and improper installation techniques by the roofer. These warranties, which may have to conform to regional laws in various locations, can differ between contractors and may be negotiable. Some may only be valid for a limited time period, while others may offer lifetime coverage. These warranties not only cover the roof area but also include damages to the home itself and your personal possessions if they occurred due to the improper installation of the roof. Damages due to weather, falling tree limbs, foot traffic and alterations by other people are generally excluded .Can I get financing for a home repair or improvement?Your contractor may offer some financing options (either through a partner or a payment plan), but there are other — and maybe better — financing options available.Home equity loan or HELOCHome equity loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOC) may have lower interest rates than financing with an installer, as well as future opportunities for refinancing and possible tax benefits.With a home equity loan, you receive a lump-sum payment and then pay it back at a fixed interest rate over an agreed period of time, typically five to 30 years. HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. You’ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you're using your home as collateral.Many banks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000 and with fixed annual percentage rates. You receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. Unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral. This means your home isn’t at risk if you miss payments, but you’ll still have to pay late fees and the late payments can negatively impact your credit.Credit cards are an option for lower cost repairs or renovations. That’s because credit cards typically charge higher interest rates than home equity loans, HELOCs and personal loans. When used responsibly, credit cards can come with great benefits, such as 0% introductory APR periods that allow you to avoid interest for a set number of months; rewards so you can earn cash back, travel or points; and sign-up bonuses that can give you some extra cash back or rewards for a larger purchase. If you go this route, you’ll want to make sure you pick one of the best credit cards for home improvements. Which financing option is best for me?The best financing option for you will depend on how much money you need, when you need the money, what project you’re doing and how long you need to pay the money back. If it’s something that’ll add value to your home, a HELOC or home equity loan may be your best option because the value of your house could increase by more than the amount of the loan.On the flip side, if it’s a less expensive repair, a credit card is probably your best option if you want to pay no interest or earn rewards. Personal loans can apply to both small and large repairs or renovations, and they may make sense if you don’t have much equity in your home.Some home improvement contractors offer their own financing options. Before taking this option, shop around and see how their offer compares with other loans.Regardless of what you choose, make sure you compare interest rates, terms and fees with any financing options you’re considering. This will ensure you get the best deal.",
