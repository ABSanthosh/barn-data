People want to upgrade their gear, declutter their houses, don’t exactly like what they bought and find something better, or want to give their gear a second home instead… Do you want to know the best places to sell used outdoor gear? Selling used outdoor gear to make extra money is popular for many reasons. People want to upgrade their gear, declutter their houses, don’t exactly like what they bought and find something better, or want to give their gear a second home instead of simply throwing it away. Outdoor gear is so expensive after all, so it’s nice to be able to sell it and get some of your money back. You may be wondering, do people buy used outdoor gear? The answer is YES! Many people I know, including myself, buy used outdoor gear all the time because we can save money and still get quality items. In this article, you’ll learn: Best places to sell used outdoor gear What kind of outdoor gear you can sell (it’s a lot, such as hiking gear, shoes, camping items, ski equipment, clothing, bikes, fitness items, sporting equipment, and more) My tips for successfully selling used outdoor gear Recommended reading: 27 Best Consignment Stores Near Me And Online Best Places To Sell Used Outdoor Gear Below is a list of the best places to sell used outdoor gear. 1. Geartrade Geartrade is an online outdoor gear exchange platform for buyers and sellers looking for affordable items. There are many benefits to buying and selling on Geartrade, such as: Easy listing process to list outdoor gear quickly Earn money by turning unused or lightly used gear into cash A wide audience of outdoor enthusiasts looking to buy lightly used outdoor gear You can sell all types of outdoor gear on Geartrade, including clothing, shoes, camping and hiking gear, skiing and snowboarding equipment, cycling gear, watersports gear, electronics, and so much more.  They send you a free shipping label and even a box if you need one. You can send them as much as you want. When they get your box, they then see what it’s worth. When the items sell, you will then get your money that you can cash out to Venmo, PayPal, or store credit. I do think it’s important to know that if your gear does not sell within 200 days, then Geartrade will send you an email asking if you want to donate the items or get them back. If you want them back, you will have to pay for shipping costs. And, if you don’t reply to their email within 230 days, then they donate them (but, they do send you reminders before that). 2. Play It Again Sports Play It Again Sports is a lot like Plato’s Closet (a brick-and-mortar shop specializing in buying and selling used items). Play It Again Sports specializes in buying and selling new and used sports and fitness equipment. This place allows people to purchase gear while also allowing people to trade in or sell their own equipment for cash on the spot (so, there’s no having to make an online listing, which is nice!) or store credit. I’ve been to Play It Again Sports a few times, and there’s a huge selection of everything and anything. I recommend visiting often if there’s something you’re looking for, as items constantly shift in and out of the store. There are currently over 290 stores operating in the United States, so it’s likely there’s a store open near you. You can give them a call and see if they accept what you want to sell. 3. eBay EBay has a huge audience, making it a great place to sell used gear online. There are millions of active users online daily, with many of these users specifically looking for outdoor gear at a more affordable price.  Creating a listing on eBay is quick and easy, making the process easy for people to buy and sell on eBay. EBay even has seller protections put in place so you have more confidence in selling on their platform. You can also choose between an auction-style listing or a fixed-price listing too. My sister has personally sold a ton of things on eBay, including used outdoor gear, so it’s definitely legit! 4. Facebook Facebook gives you the option to sell used outdoor gear locally or by shipping. There are no listing fees to create a listing for your outdoor gear, and you get access to millions of Facebook users who shop on Facebook Marketplace. You can chat with buyers directly through Facebook and sell items locally, which has the convenience of getting cash right away and also getting rid of your items quicker. To successfully sell outdoor gear on Facebook Marketplace, take high-quality, well-lit photos of your items and include a detailed description. Include if there are any imperfections or broken pieces. Meet in public, well-lit areas, and always go with your gut. If something doesn’t feel right, leave right away.  You can also try selling your used outdoor gear in Facebook groups, such as hiking and outdoors groups, or even in local groups for your area. I see used outdoor gear for sale all the time in my Facebook groups. 5. Poshmark Poshmark is primarily known for selling clothing items, but you can also sell outdoor equipment on this platform. Poshmark is an incredibly easy-to-use platform, making it very easy to list and buy items. Poshmark provides a prepaid shipping label, making it convenient to get items shipped out quickly.  Here are a few tips to successfully sell items on Poshmark: Take high-quality photos of your items from all angles and show any imperfections Be honest about the condition as this can build trust with buyers Share your items regularly to increase visibility in the Poshmark marketplace 6. Worn Wear at Patagonia Worn Wear at Patagonia is a site that lets you trade in Patagonia items you no longer want and then get store credit to use on new things you may need. This is how Worn Wear works: “Send us your used Patagonia clothing and gear, and we’ll help pass it along to the next person who needs it. If your items are eligible, you can receive up to 25% of the MSRP (manufacturer’s suggested retail price) in credit to use in-store or online at Patagonia or Worn Wear. If your gear isn’t accepted, we can return it to you or recycle it so it stays out of the landfill.” First, gather your Patagonia clothing and items that are still functional and in good condition. Then, send your items to Patagonia by shipping with the $7 shipping label or by dropping off the items at any Patagonia store. Finally, you’ll receive store credit if the item is eligible at Patagonia for trade-in. This is definitely one of the things I love about Patagonia! 7. REI Re/Supply REI Re/Supply Used Gear is a similar process as Worn Wear, allowing people to trade in their used eligible REI items for store credit. First, you gather the gear that you want to trade in at REI. Drop off items at an REI store or ship them for $6 with the shipping label REI provides online. Finally, once your trade-in is complete, you’ll receive store credit for any eligible items REI accepts.  Keep in mind that REI does not accept anything that is not specifically sold at REI, items that are more than 6 years old, items that have been altered or modified, as well as any kind of safety gear.  8. Out\u0026Back Out\u0026Back is a platform that sells new and used outdoor items. To get started selling outdoor gear on Out\u0026Back, you need to create an account and list your gear. Upload photos, provide a description, and set your selling price. Interested buyers will contact you, and this is when you can get payment and ship the item(s). Once the item sells, you’ll receive payment through Out\u0026Back’s platform. 9. ReRouted Rerouted is a platform specializing in buying and selling used outdoor gear. Their platform has an emphasis on sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of outdoor activities. This platform is specifically geared toward outdoor enthusiasts, so you’re going to sell your items on a website that is reaching your exact customer base for used outdoor gear. 10. Local consignment shops Local consignment shops can be a great option to sell used outdoor gear. But do your best to look for consignment shops that specialize in exercise or outdoors, as this will increase the chances of your stuff actually getting sold instead of sitting on the shelves forever. If you live in an area that has a lot of hiking trails, parks, or anything like that, there’s most likely a used outdoors store near you – you just have to do some searching. These are also great places to buy more gear for yourself too at lower prices. Keep in mind that consignment stores do take a percentage of your sales since they are helping you sell the item(s). Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about selling used outdoor gear. What kind of used outdoor gear can I sell? You can sell many different types of used outdoor gear, including tents, sleeping bags, backpacks, hiking boots, rain jackets, bike-packing gear, kayaks, clothing (like pants and shirts), and snowboards. I only listed a few items, but keep in mind you can sell almost anything related to outdoor gear, so the list is endless. How to get rid of camping gear?  You can get rid of camping gear by either selling items online or locally, or by donating the items to a thrift store. Shelters also typically accept donations of tents, sleeping bags, and warm clothing. Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and other outdoor education programs also may accept these donations. Does Backcountry buy used gear?  Backcountry does not buy used gear and only specializes in selling brand-new outdoor items.  Does REI buy used outdoor gear? Yes, REI buys used outdoor gear through their REI Re/Supply (formerly Used Gear) program. There are exceptions, though. REI does not buy back climbing gear, bikes, helmets, harnesses, water filtration systems, or underwear. You can learn more about the REI buyback program here. What percentage does Geartrade take? As of 2025, and when I’m currently writing this, Geartrade takes a percentage of the final sale price based on a tiered structure. For lower-priced items, they take a higher cut, ranging from 70%–85% for items under $50, 50%–70% for items between $50 and $144.99, and 30%–50% for items between $145 and $564.99. For items priced at $565 or more, Geartrade takes 30%, meaning sellers receive 70% of the sale price. How to sell used tents? You have a few options to sell used tents, including: Outdoor gear marketplaces (REI Re/Supply, Worn Wear at Patagonia, and GearTrade) Online marketplaces (Facebook Marketplace) Outdoor consignment stores Before selling any used tents, clean the tent properly, fully set it up, take pictures from different angles, check for damage, and share any damage in the description of the listing.  My brother-in-law recently bought a used tent for a backpacking trip he went on, so people definitely buy these! Where’s the best place to sell used outdoor gear near me? The best places to sell used outdoor gear will vary depending on where you live. I recommend doing a Google search with keywords like “Best place to sell outdoor gear near me,” and a listing of local outdoor gear shops will come up depending on where you live. If you can’t find a local place to sell your used outdoor gear, check out REI Re/Supply, Worn Wear at Patagonia, and Geartrade. Best Places To Sell Used Outdoor Gear – Summary  I hope you enjoyed my article on the best places to sell used outdoor gear. There are many good options for selling used outdoor gear, and the method you choose depends on how quickly you want to get rid of your stuff.  REI Re/Supply and Worn Wear at Patagonia are great options if you frequently shop at both of these places and want store credit. Geartrade is a great option if you’re looking for money instead of store credit. Local used outdoor stores and Facebook Marketplace are great options if you want to get rid of stuff right away.
