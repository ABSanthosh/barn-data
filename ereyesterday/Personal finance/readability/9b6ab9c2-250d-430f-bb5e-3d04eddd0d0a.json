  "description": "Bitcoin is hitting new all-time highs. Is this just another bull cycle, or are we witnessing a fundamental shift in how the world thinks about money? That's the question at the heart of our conversation with Tatiana Koffman, General Partner at Moonwalker Capital and author of \"The Myth of Money.\" Koffman joins us to explain why Bitcoin might be considered \"digital property\" rather than just a currency. She breaks down how Bitcoin derives its value from mathematical scarcity – similar to how gold becomes harder to mine over time, Bitcoin becomes more difficult and expensive to create every four years through events called \"halvings.\" The conversation moves through several key developments in cryptocurrency. We discuss the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs and how traditional financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase (whose CEO Jamie Dimon once openly criticized crypto) are now embracing these products. Koffman shares insights about crypto adoption worldwide, from El Salvador's experiment with Bitcoin as legal tender to Dubai's emergence as a crypto hub. When discussing Africa's cryptocurrency landscape, Koffman explains how Nigeria's unstable banking system has driven crypto adoption, with many young people using decentralized exchanges to participate in global markets. She describes how some Nigerians have built significant wealth starting from nothing, using \"airdrops\" (free tokens given to early adopters) to begin trading. The interview includes a debate about inflation rates and economic data reporting, with Koffman expressing skepticism about official figures, while I push back on claims made without supporting evidence. Koffman also explains different categories of crypto investments, distinguishing between Bitcoin as a potential store of value and what she calls \"meme coins\" – speculative assets she compares to gambling. She provides context about stable coins, particularly USDC and Tether, and their role during the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. For those interested in investing in cryptocurrency, Koffman suggests starting with exposure to Bitcoin through regulated platforms like Coinbase or ETFs, while emphasizing the importance of proper security measures. She explains concepts like \"cold wallets\" and \"seed phrases,\" comparing them to different levels of bank security. Looking ahead, Koffman discusses cryptocurrency's potential role in reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar, particularly in developing economies, while acknowledging the challenges of creating stable alternative currencies.
