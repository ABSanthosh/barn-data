Also, ask for and check references.How to know if you need foundation repairYou might suspect foundation problems after noticing signs, such as cracked walls, water leaks, sticking doors and windows, uneven floors or bowing basement walls. But the only way to truly diagnose the situation is to get a professional inspection.Foundation repair contractors usually offer free inspections, but itâ€™s important to realize they could overemphasize problems due to the financial incentive of getting the business.Another option is to hire a residential structural engineer for an unbiased evaluation. This can be costly reaching $1,200 or more when related to suspected foundation problems, but having an engineerâ€™s written report could help you save in other ways, for example when seeking competitive quotes for contractors to do the actual work.ðŸ¤“Nerdy TipIf you hire a structural engineer to investigate foundation issues, the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) has a directory of member licensing boards by state. This can help you find your state licensing boardâ€™s site, where you can verify an engineer is licensed.What affects the cost to fix foundation problems?Several factors influence how much it will cost to repair your foundation:1. Type and extent of damageFoundation cracks without other damage present could be a DIY project using an epoxy injection kit ($100 to $400).Sinking foundations may need only a few or multiple steel piers ($1,000 to $3,000 per pier).In extreme cases, a house may need to be lifted to replace the entire foundationÂ  ($20,000 to $100,000).2. Foundation type and sizeBasement foundations may require waterproofing. Slab foundations could need slabjacking, which is the leveling of concrete. Crawl spaces may demand extra labor for access. Also, larger homes with bigger foundations can require more complex solutions that drive up costs.3. Soil conditions and stabilityExpansive clay soil and poor drainage can lead to more severe (and expensive) issues. Although it isnâ€™t always necessary, in some cases you might need to pay for a professional soil report to understand your foundation issues. These reports can range from $500 to $3,000. 4. LocationLabor and material costs vary across the U.S., and homes in high-risk areas (earthquakes, floods) may need additional reinforcements, leading to higher costs.5. AccessibilityIf heavy equipment or deep excavation is needed, labor costs increase. Also, removal and replacement of landscaping, porches, decks or other items can add to final costs.Ways to pay for foundation repairsYour contractor may offer some financing options (either through a partner or a payment plan), but there are other â€” and maybe better â€” financing options available.Home equity loan or HELOCHome equity loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOC) may have lower interest rates than financing through a contractorâ€™s lender, as well as possible tax benefits. Both options use your home as collateral.Home equity loan. This may be a good option if you just want to pay for the foundation repair and wonâ€™t need ongoing access to money for additional repairs. With a home equity loan, you receive a lump-sum payment and then pay it back at a fixed interest rate over an agreed period of time, typically five to 30 yearsHome equity line of credit. HELOCs work more like a credit card, so you have ongoing access to money as you need it. You usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit and pay interest only on the HELOC amount you use. Most lenders have an option for interest-only payments during that time, after which youâ€™re required to pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time.Â After living in my home 25-plus years, I began noticing cracks in the plaster, doors not shutting, windows sticking and gutters not draining. In 2024, an inspection revealed my foundation was sinking causing major damage, and I needed numerous steel piers to be placed under my home. The process would also require the removal of my deck (which was already falling apart) and my concrete front porch to access beneath my house. Repairs werenâ€™t covered by homeownerâ€™s insurance, which is often the case for foundation problems. And estimates (which included replacing the deck, porch and gutters) were coming in above $50,000. Because I knew the project would occur in phases, I opted for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) which enabled me to pay for each part as it was completed. Iâ€™m paying extra each month to reduce my balance faster, and I now have a handy line of credit for any future home repairs. Personal loanMany banks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000 and with fixed annual percentage rates. You receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. Unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral. This means your home isnâ€™t at risk if you get behind on payments, but youâ€™ll still have to pay late fees and late payments can negatively impact your credit. Here are NerdWalletâ€™s picks for the best home improvement loans. Credit CardCredit cards may be an option for lower cost foundation repairs. Thatâ€™s because credit cards typically charge higher interest rates than home equity loans, HELOCs and personal loans. When used responsibly, credit cards can come with great benefits, such as 0% introductory APR periods that allow you to avoid interest for a set number of months; rewards so you earn cash back, travel or points; and sign-up bonuses that give you extra cash back or rewards for a larger purchase. If you go this route, youâ€™ll want to make sure you choose one of the best credit cards for home improvements. Final thoughts on foundation repairFoundation problems can be serious and shouldnâ€™t be ignored. Knowing how much foundation repair costs, what factors affect pricing and how to finance the work can help you make informed decisions. If you notice signs of trouble, schedule a professional inspection and act quickly. Addressing issues early can mean the difference between a $1,000 repair and a $20,000-plus overhaul.Frequently asked questionsDoes homeowner insurance cover foundation repairs?In most cases, no. If your foundation damage occurred over time and could have been avoided with home maintenance, your insurance company probably wonâ€™t cover it. However, homeowners insurance may cover foundation damage if the cause is a covered peril, such as a burst pipe or natural disaster (unless the natural disaster requires special insurance, like earthquake or flood). Itâ€™s important to contact your insurer to see if the repair might be covered.Can I stay in a house that needs foundation repairs?If your home has been inspected by a professional and is safe, you can continue living in it while repairs are done. It could be somewhat disruptive if youâ€™re at home when contractors are working, but minor repairs typically only take a few days. More extensive repairs could take several weeks to complete, especially if weather is an issue. Itâ€™s a good idea to ask a contractor about their timeline before hiring them.",

Iâ€™m paying extra each month to reduce my balance faster, and I now have a handy line of credit for any future home repairs. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Profile photo of Shannon Bradley\" src=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/assets/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Shannon-Bradley-2021-Copy-Shannon-Bradley-e1626974162152-160x160.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch3 data-currency=\"Text\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePersonal loan\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMany banks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000 and with fixed annual percentage rates. You receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. Unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral. This means your home isnâ€™t at risk if you get behind on payments, but youâ€™ll still have to pay late fees and late payments can negatively impact your credit.

Thatâ€™s because credit cards typically charge higher interest rates than home equity loans, HELOCs and personal loans. When used responsibly, credit cards can come with great benefits, such as 0% introductory APR periods that allow you to avoid interest for a set number of months; rewards so you earn cash back, travel or points; and sign-up bonuses that give you extra cash back or rewards for a larger purchase.
