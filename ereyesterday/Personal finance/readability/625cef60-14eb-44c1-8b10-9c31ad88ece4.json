An entire septic system typically costs between $3,615 and $12,408, with a national average price of just over $8,000. How much should I pay for a septic tank?If you already have a septic system in place and only need to replace the tank, your costs will depend on a number of factors, beginning with the size of the tank. Here’s what you might expect to pay for just the tank itself, based on tank size.Tank Size Price Range500 gallons (suitable for a one-bedroom house)$500 to $900.750 gallons (suitable for a two-bedroom house) $700 to $1,200.1,000 gallons (suitable for a three- or four-bedroom house) $900 to $1,500.1,200 gallons (suitable for a five- or six-bedroom house) $1,200 to $1,600.1,500 gallons (suitable for a six- or seven-bedroom house)$1,500 to $2,500.Things that affect the cost of a septic tankMaterialsThe material your septic tank is made of affects its price.Material Average Price RangeConcrete $700 to $2,000.Fiberglass $1,200 to $2,000.Plastic $500 to $2,000.LaborLabor costs vary by location and generally constitute 50% to 70% of the total job price. For a typical three- or four-bedroom home, installation generally ranges from $1,500 to $4,000. Excavation to install your septic system will likely add $1,500 to $6,300 to labor costs.System typeAnaerobic vs. aerobic septic system. Anaerobic systems have little or no oxygen in the tank. They are the less expensive option, generally costing between $3,000 and $8,000. Aerobic systems, which inject oxygen into the tank and are used in homes on small lots or with high water tables, are more efficient but cost between $10,000 and $20,000.Alternative systems. If a traditional septic system won’t work on your specific property, you may have to go with an alternative system, such as a mound, drip, chamber, sand filter, evapotranspiration or build wetland setup. Alternative systems tend to be more costly than traditional systems. For example, a mound system can cost as much as $20,000.Surveys and permitsBefore installing a new septic system, you’ll need a land survey from a licensed land surveyor, which usually costs between $330 and $900.Permit laws vary by location, but septic permits may run as much as $450 to $2,300.TestingA percolation test checks how your soil absorbs water and helps determine which type of septic system is best for your property. It typically costs $700 to $2,000.Leach field installationPutting in a leach field (also known as a drain field), which is a type of trench that transports wastewater back to the soil, typically costs between $5,000 and $12,000.What is the life expectancy of a septic tank?On average, septic systems last 15 to 40 years. With proper care and maintenance, however, they may last longer. In addition to required routine maintenance, here are a few tips that will help you keep your septic system working properly for as long as possible:Don’t put items into your sink or toilet that could clog your septic system. These items include feminine hygiene products, baby wipes, diapers, coffee grounds, cigarettes, cat litter and grease.Don’t put items that could damage or “kill” your septic system into your sink or toilet. These items include gasoline, household chemicals, oil, paint, anti-freeze, pesticides or large quantities of household detergents and soaps.Don’t overuse water. When you conserve water, your septic system won’t have to work so hard. Additionally, opt for high-efficiency plumbing appliances, repair household plumbing leaks and stagger the use of appliances to avoid straining your septic system.Don’t use a garbage disposal unless absolutely necessary. Reducing or eliminating garbage disposal use helps reduce the volume of damaging grease, fats and other solids that get into your system.Protect your leach field. Plant trees away from the field, as roots can clog up the field and cause system failure. Additionally, don’t put anything heavier than a lawnmower on your field, and direct excess water from drains, heavy rainfall and irrigation away from the leach field area.What does it cost to maintain a septic tank?Plan to have your septic system professionally inspected and your tank pumped out about every three to five years (or as recommended by your municipality and/or service provider). The professional inspection should let you know when the pumping is necessary. This scheduled routine maintenance should cost between $250 to $500, which might feel like a lot, but it can prevent costly repairs that could run tens of thousands of dollars.Ways to save money on the cost of a septic tankCompare multiple quotes from trusted, reputable contractors before committing to a purchase.Purchase materials on your own instead of through the contractor to avoid price markups.Gather your own soil samples and coordinate testing yourself rather than pay a technician to collect soil samples.If you have the required skills, prepare your land yourself rather than hiring a professional. This work might include backfilling and other prep work.Confirm code compliance and arrange for necessary permits yourself rather than having your contractor do this for you.If practical, arrange to have work done during the off season, when you may be able to get discounts and lower rates.If the need for a new septic tank is due to damage to your system from a specific event, check with your homeowner’s insurance company to see if that damaging event is covered, and if your policy might pay for some or all of your tank replacement costs.Can I get financing for a home repair or improvement?Your contractor may offer some financing options (either through a partner or a payment plan), but there are other — any maybe better — financing options available.Home equity loan or HELOCHome equity loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOC) may have lower interest rates than financing with an installer, as well as future opportunities for refinancing and possible tax benefits.With a home equity loan, you receive a lump-sum payment and then pay it back at a fixed interest rate over an agreed period of time, typically five to 30 years. HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. You’ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you're using your home as collateral.Many banks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000 and with fixed annual percentage rates. You receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. Unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral. This means your home isn’t at risk if you miss payments, but you’ll still have to pay late fees and the late payments can negatively impact your credit.Credit cards are an option for lower cost repairs or renovations. That’s because credit cards typically charge higher interest rates than home equity loans, HELOCs and personal loans. When used responsibly, credit cards can come with great benefits, such as 0% introductory APR periods that allow you to avoid interest for a set number of months; rewards so you can earn cash back, travel or points; and sign-up bonuses that can give you some extra cash back or rewards for a larger purchase. If you go this route, you’ll want to make sure you pick one of the best credit cards for home improvements. Which financing option is best for me?The best financing option for you will depend on how much money you need, when you need the money, what project you’re doing and how long you need to pay the money back. If it’s something that’ll add value to your home, a HELOC or home equity loan may be your best option because the value of your house could increase by more than the amount of the loan.On the flip side, if it’s a less expensive repair, a credit card is probably your best option if you want to pay no interest or earn rewards. Personal loans can apply to both small and large repairs or renovations, and they may make sense if you don’t have much equity in your home.Some home improvement contractors offer their own financing options. Before taking this option, shop around and see how their offer compares with other loans.Regardless of what you choose, make sure you compare interest rates, terms and fees with any financing options you’re considering. This will ensure you get the best deal.",

HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. You’ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you\u0026#39;re using your home as collateral.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMany banks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000 and with fixed annual percentage rates. You receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. Unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral. This means your home isn’t at risk if you miss payments, but you’ll still have to pay late fees and the late payments can negatively impact your credit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCredit cards are an option for lower cost repairs or renovations. That’s because credit cards typically charge higher interest rates than home equity loans, HELOCs and personal loans. When used responsibly, credit cards can come with great benefits, such as 0% introductory APR periods that allow you to avoid interest for a set number of months; rewards so you can earn cash back, travel or points; and sign-up bonuses that can give you some extra cash back or rewards for a larger purchase.
