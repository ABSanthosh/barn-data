  "text": "The Capital One Lounge at Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) provides a modern, pleasant atmosphere to relax or work away from the main terminal, in addition to what I consider to be the best food-and-beverage amenities of any lounge at Dulles. Travelers can expect:A unique selection of small, hot plates at the buffet.A full-service espresso bar, including craft tea and (awesome) baked goods.Complimentary cocktails, wine and beer.Grab-and-go food to take out of the lounge, including sandwiches, salads, fruit, baked goods, coffee and sodas. Two semi-private work areas.A nursing/parents room. Complimentary Wi-Fi.I used my new Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card to access the Capital One Lounge Dulles during an eight-hour layover and was thoroughly impressed with the food, beverages and staff. At 8,000 square feet, the lounge was large enough to accommodate peak traffic periods without feeling overly crowded. It lacks some of the amenities of higher-end lounges, like showers and sleeping spaces. But the option to pack a bag with snacks and drinks before leaving for my connecting flight was among my favorite features of any lounge I’ve visited.Get a card that takes you fartherSign up with NerdWallet to get a full picture of your spending and personalized recommendations for cards that will help you see the world.Where is the Capital One Lounge Dulles?The Capital One Lounge at IAD is located on the ticketing level in the main terminal right after the TSA PreCheck checkpoint. Follow signs towards Gate D, H and Z, go up the escalator, then make a left towards the elevators marked “Capital One Lounge” located adjacent to the Z Gates. If you’re on a connecting flight, take the train to the main terminal, go up the first set of escalators, head towards the TSA PreCheck security checkpoint, then follow the instructions above.Escalator to the Dulles Capital One Lounge adjacent to security in the main terminal.

(Photo by Craig Joseph)Spaces to relax and workThe open-seating areas are completed with modern furniture and decor that is simple and pleasant. The perimeter of the lounge is covered in glass, with plenty of natural sunlight to make the space feel bright and airy.There are also two semi-private lounge areas to relax or get some work done. This is where I spent the majority of my layover.Seating in the Dulles Capital One Lounge. (Photo by Craig Joseph)Seating in the Dulles Capital One Lounge.

There’s also a private nursing room for parents in a comfortable and quiet area. Bathroom in the Dulles Capital One Lounge. (Photo by Craig Joseph)Nursing room in the Capital One Lounge Dulles. (Photo by Craig Joseph)Food and beverage optionsCoffee barThe coffee bar is among my favorite features of the lounge. Guests have access to multiple varieties of drip coffee, a full-service espresso bar and multiple tea options. There are even draft handles for self-service lattes and cold brew. All beverages are available in a mug or a to-go cup. The baked goods at the coffee bar were also very good and included banana date cake, croissants and, my favorite, strawberry pop-tarts. They also have paper bags so you can grab a snack to go, which I did with a second pop-tart.Coffee bar in the Dulles Capital One Lounge.

During my extended stay in the lounge, the staff did an excellent job at keeping the buffet stocked with:Marinated tomato salad.Olive tapenade crostini.Lebanese-inspired deviled eggs.Meatcrafters antipasti.Chef Morris’s mac and cheese.Roasted butternut squash with pepitas.Buttermilk biscuit and pimento cheese.Grilled lamb in a green sauce.Shrimp bao buns.Deserts, including chocolate chip cookies, s’mores bars and coconut parfait.I tried nearly everything the buffet had to offer. My favorites were the tomato salad, antipasti, roasted butternut squash with pumpkin seeds, and mac and cheese. The cookies looked delicious, but I opted for a s’mores bar, which was gooey and decadent. Food options and cocktail in the Dulles Capital One Lounge.

(Photo by Craig Joseph)BarThe bar serves both alcoholic drinks and mocktails. Wine, beer and cocktails are complimentary, or you can purchase a bottle of champagne or small-batch spirits as part of the lounge’s “Rare Bottle Club.”The cocktails were fantastic, second only to the quality of the bartenders, who were laughing and interacting with patrons while generally making the bar area a lively place to hang out. The lounge’s signature cocktail, the “Bee’s Knees,” is a gin drink with lemon and honey that was refreshing without being overly sweet. I’m not normally one for gin, but after seeing it was presented in a bee-shaped cocktail glass, I had to try it. Bar in the Dulles Capital One Lounge.

(Photo by Craig Joseph)Non-alcoholic optionsThere are lots of non-alcoholic beverage options in the lounge, including eight draft handles serving water, sodas, tea and lemonade. Additionally, the coffee bar serves a variety of teas and espresso drinks, and the bar serves mocktails. You can also grab a variety of sparkling or still water from the grab-and-go section.

Whether you only have a few minutes to pop into the lounge before your flight or you want a snack for the plane after devouring all the other food options (hand raised), everyone is encouraged to take food to go, with options including:Chickpea salad wraps.Chicken, turkey, or Italian sandwiches.Steel-cut oatmeal.Mango papaya acai bowl.Strawberry shortcake.Watermelon and pineapple fruit salad.Buffalo humus cup.Local grilled peach salad.Grilled corn salad.Flavored bubbly sparkling waters.I took an acai bowl and pop-tart from the coffee bar for my flight. Both were delicious. Grab-and-go food options in the Dulles Capital One Lounge. (Photo by Craig Joseph)CrowdsThe lounge never seemed overly crowded during my extended visit. There were two rushes of people that led to a crowded bar, but the staff kept up well with keeping the buffet stocked and there was always seating available. If the lounge does hit capacity, visitors will have to join a waitlist before entering.Use the Capital One app to join the waitlistIf you’re a Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card or Capital One Venture X Business cardholder, you can join the waitlist for the Dulles Capital One Lounge (and other Capital One lounges) on the Capital One app. Go to the Rewards \u0026 Benefits tile, then tap the airplane icon.From there, you can select a lounge from the Capital One lounge locations and view the capacity. You’ll receive a text notification when it’s your turn to enter. To minimize waiting time, you might want to join the waitlist before you arrive.If you don’t have the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card or Capital One Venture X Business card, you’ll have to wait in the physical line.How to get into the Capital One LoungeThe lounge is open every day from 5:30 AM to 9:00 PM. You’ll need a same-day boarding pass and can enter the lounge a maximum of three hours max before your flight. If you have a connecting flight, there is no time restriction for entering the lounge before your flight.Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card (including authorized users) and Capital One Venture X Business primary cardholders (excluding authorized users) receive unlimited complimentary access to any Capital One Lounge with up to two guests per visit. Additional guests cost $45 each, and children under two years old can enter for free with a parent or guardian.
