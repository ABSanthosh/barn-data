If you’re like me, you’re always looking for ways to save a little extra cash, especially when shopping on Amazon. Sure, Amazon already has great prices, but what if I told you there are even more ways to cut down your costs? Over the years, I’ve found so many helpful tips and tricks that I couldn’t wait to share them with you. Whether you’re a frequent shopper or just looking to make the most of your Prime membership, these 15 Amazon hacks will help you save money you didn’t even know you could! From using price-tracking tools to earning free gift cards, this list covers everything you need to know to save money. Recommended reading: 7 Ways To Get Paid For Amazon Reviews 15 Best Amazon Hacks To Save Money Below is what you need to know about the best Amazon hacks to save money. 1. Use coupons Amazon often offers promo codes for thousands of products, and sometimes they’re automatically applied at checkout. To find coupons and deals, go to Amazon’s homepage, “Today’s Deals” or search “Amazon coupons” in the search bar. Doing this will show you a list of the best deals on Amazon for the day which can include items like cosmetics, household supplies, electronics, and almost anything else you can think of. Some items are reduced automatically, while others make you clip a coupon on the item’s link to get the savings. When you’re ready to check out, make sure the coupon has been clipped and added to your order summary. Occasionally, the app will have exclusive coupons and discounts, so it’s worth it to have the app if you shop on Amazon a lot. 2. Use price tracking tools Tools, like Capital One Shopping, can help you find the best deals by tracking price drops. This comes in handy for Amazon products since the prices change so often. For example, a lot of people were finding that Amazon Prime Day items were actually more expensive than before Prime Day. Other popular price-match tools are Honey and Camelcamelcamel. To make things more convenient for you (and so you don’t forget to use these price-matching tools), I recommend installing a browser extension on your computer. These extensions make it easy to check any item you’re looking at on Amazon instantly. You can also set up price drop alerts that will notify you when a price drops to your target price.

Amazon gives free shipping on orders that meet certain criteria. For non-Prime members, you need to meet a minimum purchase of $35. Add multiple items to your cart to reach the free shipping threshold. Keep an eye on promotions that give free shipping on lower threshold amounts. If you don’t have anything to buy on Amazon to reach free shipping, maybe think about buying household supplies to increase your total (because you always need them anyway). Thanks to the above tips, I never pay for shipping on Amazon. 4. Choose No-Rush Delivery for free credits Amazon has a special offer for users called “No-Rush Delivery” where they’ll give you free credits. Instead of getting your product in two days or less, you’ll get your items a few days later. You can choose this item during checkout. These credits can be used towards digital content (eBooks, music, movies). The reward credit is usually between $1-$5. 5. Use a cashback credit card Credit cards are a fantastic way to get cash back and make money back from your purchase. I use an Amazon Chase card that gives me 5% cash back on all purchases that I make at Amazon as an Amazon Prime member. Nonmembers get 3% cash back on all purchases made on Amazon. This can add up to hundreds of dollars over the year.  6. Subscribe and Save Amazon’s Subscribe and Save is a handy way to save money on items you regularly buy on Amazon like cleaning supplies (such as paper towels and toilet paper), cosmetics, groceries and food, vitamins, baby items (like diapers), and so much more. This also includes free shipping and a discount. For example, if you buy 5 or more subscribe \u0026 save products, you can save up to 15% on your order. Here’s a screenshot showing proof that my sister earned money by playing games on Freecash! 7. Find ways to get free Amazon gift cards Yes, you can get free Amazon gift cards by filling out surveys. This isn’t a fast way to make extra money, but it’s something you can easily do on your couch or when you’re trying to pass the time. Here’s a list of the best survey sites: American Consumer Opinion Survey Junkie Swagbucks InboxDollars Branded Surveys Prime Opinion Five Surveys You can also earn free Amazon gift cards by playing games on your phone. My sister recently earned $300 in free Amazon gift cards by playing Bingo on the Freecash app. She made this much in just one week!

Become an Amazon Vine reviewer Did you know that you can get hundreds of free products, worth thousands of dollars every year from the Amazon Vine Program? This program is easy to join and gives you access to thousands of items you can use or gift to friends and family. The Vine program lets you request up to 8 items per day, so you can find all sorts of things you need or totally random items for starting a new hobby.  You may be eligible to be an Amazon Vine Voice Reviewer if: You have written consistent reviews of your previous Amazon purchases Your reviews are considered ‘helpful’ to other customers Your reviews are honest and trustworthy Recommended reading: How I Received $4,500 in Free Amazon Products by Writing Reviews 9. Get a free trial of Amazon Prime Student If you’re a student and enrolled in a college or university, you can probably get a free trial or reduced subscription rate on Amazon Prime. Amazon Prime benefits are awesome because you usually get lower prices and free 2-day shipping. This can make your Amazon Prime account as low as free or around $7 a month (after the 6-month trial period), so this is definitely one of the best Amazon hacks to save money on a Prime membership. To qualify for an Amazon Prime Student account, you need to have an active .edu email address to sign up for your Prime membership. Amazon will send a verification email to your school email address. This is how Amazon confirms that you’re a student. You can sign up for an Amazon Prime Student account by clicking here. 10. Shop with credit card points With certain credit cards, you can automatically apply your points to your Amazon purchase. For example, I have an Amazon Chase credit card that makes it really easy to use points when I’m checking out on Amazon. When I’m at the checkout page on Amazon, the payment area includes a section where I can use my Amazon cash-back points on Amazon purchases. 11. Trade in electronics you no longer need Amazon has a trade-in program that helps you turn your old and unwanted electronics into money. To do this, just go to the Amazon Trade-In page and tell Amazon about the device you want to trade in. If the electronic is eligible for a trade-in, Amazon will either give you an Amazon gift card or a 20% off coupon, or sometimes both. You’ll then ship your electronics via UPS for free or drop your old devices off at an approved trade-in location within 45 days. This is a great option for people who like to get the latest tech gadgets or want to declutter. 12. Shop Amazon Outlet Amazon Outlet is a section on Amazon that features Amazon warehouse and overstock items that are on discount. This section features discounted items across all categories including: Electronics Home goods Clothing Cosmetics and more Use the filter and sort items to narrow down your search to make the shopping process less overwhelming. Also, make sure to check customer reviews and check product descriptions to make sure the item is of good quality. 13. Look for free Audible books If you’re a fan of audiobooks, Audible usually has promotions offering free audiobooks and free trials. As of this writing, Audible has a 3-month offer for only .99 cents, then $14.99 each month after.  Audible includes: Premium members get credits that can be used for any titles in their premium selection Access to exclusive member sales and discounts on all additional purchases All members can listen to thousands of included audiobooks, podcasts, originals, and more in the Plus Catalog (as much as you want, no limit) You can find free Audible books by clicking here. 14. Look for Amazon lightning deals Amazon has lightning deals that are time-sensitive and limited in quantity across different categories. On the Deals page, look out for the lightning deal badge next to products. Here you’ll see how long the deal lasts or how much of the item is left. You can also filter deals by category to help you narrow down items. This makes it easier to find items you’re interested in. If an item you’re interested in is 100% claimed, get on the waitlist. If someone doesn’t complete their purchase, you’ll get a notification. You’ll have a short window of time to complete the purchase before the item goes to the next person on the waitlist. Here’s the email my sister received about her baby registry completion discount. 15. Sign up for a registry Creating an Amazon registry is a great idea whether you’re having a wedding, expecting a baby, or celebrating another event. This is also a great way to get a discount on items. After your event date, Amazon gives a one-time discount on items left on your registry. The discount is typically 10-15% off (higher for Prime members) and applies to select items. You can read about this on Amazon’s website here. My sister made a baby registry on Amazon when she was pregnant and this Amazon shopping hack definitely works! She was able to save a good chunk of money on the baby registry items that were not bought at her baby shower. I also know of friends who did something similar after they made their wedding registry! You can create your registry for free on Amazon by clicking here. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about the best Amazon hacks to save money.
