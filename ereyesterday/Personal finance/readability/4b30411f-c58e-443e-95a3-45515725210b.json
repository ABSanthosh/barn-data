  "text": "LOGIN or CREATE AN ACCOUNT TO SAVE ARTICLE TO YOUR LIST Executive Summary It is often said that \"the only thing constant is change\", which pairs well with the common financial advisor philosophy, \"if you‚Äôre not growing, you‚Äôre dying\". The end result of this dynamic is that even when advisory firms are successful and clients are well served, we‚Äôre constantly on the lookout for what we could be doing differently to serve clients better, and have to remain constantly vigilant to threats from the changing landscape (from volatile markets to the rise of AI). And the same holds true for Kitces.com and our Nerd‚Äôs Eye View blog as well. Even as our readership (and listenership, and viewership) has grown over the years, and our reader retention remains incredibly high, we remain ever vigilant about the changing landscape and how we can still improve further, whether it‚Äôs refining how we deliver the articles, podcasts, and videos that we do, exploring alternative content formats or approaches, or figuring out how to best leverage AI ourselves, to better serve all of you, our advicer readers. And so every year, we ask you ‚Äì our readers ‚Äì for feedback about what you want to make this website even better for you, to ensure we stay on the right track in adding value to the advicer community and making financial advisors better and more successful. And especially after the amount of change over the past few years, from expanding our podcasts to YouTube (and creating a new \"Best Advisor Podcasts\" list), to building an AdvisorTech Directory to complement (and provide more information than) our popular AdvisorTech Map, to ¬†the rollout of our Annual IAR Ethics CE Day‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre more eager than ever for your feedback about how we‚Äôre doing, where we can improve, your thoughts about some new ideas we‚Äôre considering, and your feedback about what else we could be doing to help the advicer community. Because we really do take your feedback seriously. Over the years, Nerd‚Äôs Eye View reader¬†feedback has shaped everything¬†from¬†the visual design of the blog (from its original dense small font!), to¬†the¬†ongoing expansion of our Members section from offering CFP to now CPE credits for CPAs and IAR CE for RIAs¬†that can be earned by reading Nerd's Eye View blog articles, the launch of the¬†Financial Advisor Success podcast, our popular \"Master List\" of all the major Financial Advisor conferences and Best Books for Advisors, and now the coming rebuilding of our Members Section by the end of this year (to be followed by a design refresh of our Nerd‚Äôs Eye View blog in 2026!). So regardless of what kind of reader you are: an advisor or someone who works in an advisory firm home office, an individual consumer who reads this blog for your own benefit, a CPA, attorney, or another related professional that works with financial advisors, or you're associated with a vendor who serves advisors... I hope you'll participate in this year's survey. It's only 13 feedback questions,¬†should take no more than a few minutes, and will remain open until the end of next week. Thanks in advance for taking a few minutes to access our Reader Survey below, and share your feedback! üòä Michael Kitces is Head of Planning Strategy at Focus Partners Wealth, which provides an evidence-based approach to private wealth management for near- and current retirees, and Focus Partners Advisor Solutions, a turnkey wealth management services provider supporting thousands of independent financial advisors through the scaling phase of growth. In addition, he is a co-founder of the XY Planning Network, AdvicePay, fpPathfinder, and New Planner Recruiting, the former Practitioner Editor of the Journal of Financial Planning, the host of the Financial Advisor Success podcast, and the publisher of the popular financial planning industry blog Nerd‚Äôs Eye View through his website Kitces.com, dedicated to advancing knowledge in financial planning. In 2010, Michael was recognized with one of the FPA‚Äôs ‚ÄúHeart of Financial Planning‚Äù awards for his dedication and work in advancing the profession. Read all of Michael‚Äôs articles here.

Please try to complete the survey on a laptop/desktop if you're having difficulty. Yes, we realize the irony, and¬†are exploring alternative survey software solutions to address this future.
