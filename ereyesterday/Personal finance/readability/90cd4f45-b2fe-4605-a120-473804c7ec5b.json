  "text": "Executive Summary Since the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the mainstream technological landscape, conversations about which areas of the financial planning industry would be most likely impacted by AI have proliferated. These discussions have ranged from questioning whether everyone would be out of a job in five years to wondering if anything of substance would change at all. However, as the public’s understanding of AI has developed, the common consensus has largely shifted to the understanding that while processes may change, the expertise and human connection offered by specialists like financial advisors will be hard to replace. In fact, AI currently seems most likely to develop into a tool that advisors can use in many parts of practice. Which, in turn, poses the question – where can AI be most effectively used as a way for advisors to leverage their time and creativity? In the 156th episode of Kitces \u0026 Carl, Michael Kitces and client communication expert Carl Richards discuss how they use AI tools such as ChatGPT to expedite their creative and strategic processes – and how to ‘ask’ ChatGPT better questions to get more effective and relevant answers. Perhaps one of the most impressive capabilities of programs like ChatGPT lies in their ability to serve as brainstorming partners. To use them effectively, it can be helpful to assign ChatGPT a role (e.g., “You are my executive producer” or “You are a marketing director”) and define a clear objective. Providing sample documents or links to sources for tone or substance may be helpful. For example, advisors can attach their typical “first prospect meeting” agenda, give ChatGPT the role of business development coach, and ask for feedback and what to do differently. That being said, a common frustration when using ChatGPT or similar programs for brainstorming is that the first responses may not be exactly what is hoped for. Rather than expecting a perfect ‘call and response’, the process can be approached more as an iterative dialogue. Sharing initial thoughts, providing feedback, and curating further – such as asking variations of “I really like [this idea]; can you tell me more about it for an audience of [specific type of client]…?” – can guide ChatGPT toward more tailored results. The advisor and AI can then collaborate further to create a stronger and more relevant offering. Additionally, many AI programs now ‘remember’ what was asked of them across sessions, making it easier to build on previous conversations and reach increasingly insightful responses over time! The key point is that with some patience and guidance, ChatGPT can be a powerful tool for enhancing many aspects of an advisory firm’s operations. Whether it’s used to help with marketing, drafting email responses, summarizing content, reviewing data analyses, or even providing feedback on client surveys, the potential applications are vast. Ultimately, the only true limitation of AI’s potential is ‘just’ a question of imagination!

K\u0026C 35: Kitces \u0026 Carl Ep 35: Favorite Questions To Ask A Prospective Client To Build Trust In The First Meeting 50 Fires Podcast A.I. Chatbots Defeated Doctors at Diagnosing Illness Kitces \u0026 Carl Transcript Michael: Well, hello there, Carl. Carl: Michael Kitces, how are you? Michael: I'm doing well. I'm doing well. I'm excited to dive into today's episode. It's like I've been a little excited waiting for this because it's kind of a there's a reverse reveal moment. Carl: Like a meta episode. Michael: And the reveal was like the topic today is I want to talk a little bit about ChatGPT and AI and where this is showing up in advisory firms. I think we're pretty clear we're a year or two into this thing. We haven't all been vanished off the career map. We still seem to have jobs. It's not imminently replacing us, but we're all trying to figure out how to use it. And kind of the big reveal on that vein was so for those who listen to our last episode around you are you really adding value or just justifying your fees and engagement fallacy, we did that episode because Carl typed into ChatGPT, \"What are four good potential episodes that we could cover on Kitces and Carl?\" And that was one of ChatGPT's four suggestions. And so we did it. And it was a pretty good suggestion, as were the others that I don't think we're going to tell anyone because we really might do them in the other...some other good ones in there. Carl: Right. Right. Michael: But I forget what the full prompt is, Carl, that you had you had typed at the time. But it wasn't a lot more than we publish this podcast called Kitces and Carl for financial advisors. Please look it up on the Internet so you know what it is. ChatGPT, you're our executive producer. Please come up with four topics for us. And it did. I think it's come up with four punchy topics that would be a little edgy. And it did. So it gave us things like, \"Are you really adding value or is it all just fluff that justifying your fees?\" So with that as the fun sort of queue up of well, one way we're using ChatGPT is it's now feeding us show ideas, how are you using ChatGPT and AI? Where is it starting to show up for you? How To Use ChatGPT As A Creative Partner [02:40] Carl: Yeah. And look, maybe we'll just use that example as a way to sort of give advisors practical tools on how to use it. But I just want to start by saying it has changed my life. Like I am, the last four weeks, I am more productive than I can think of any time in my life and enjoying it more. And here's why. And I think I'm so fascinated by how profoundly uncurious most humans still are about using this tool. And I think it's largely because maybe people think, and it's even hard to describe, maybe people think you just said. Now, the reason it's really fascinating to me to use last episode as an example – the reason that worked is because I've been using ChatGPT to help me with a bunch of other projects. I think of it as a really great thinking partner. It helps me clarify my thinking. I don't go in and say, \"Write a book for me.\" I say, \"I'm working on a book about risk. Here's 18 articles I've written about it. Here's the transcripts from 20 behavior radio episodes. Tell me what you see. What lines do you like? Pull out some interesting quotes.\" And then that starts a whole discussion, it'll pull out something. So in this situation where we...and then I want to spend at least 10 minutes of our conversation on very specific applications for advisors because ChatGPT has become – and I don't care if it's Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, whatever tool you want to use. I've just been using... Michael: ChatGPT is the proxy for AI the way that Google is the proxy for search. Carl: Yeah. And it's become...or like Kleenex is the proxy for tissue, just to use an analog example. But ChatGPT is actually what I use. I use the pro account and I also use Claude and I also use Perplexity for different things. And it's the one app, ChatGPT the app, the desktop app and on my phone that I use every day almost the whole day. If I have an email I want to respond to I go into Chat, I copy the email and I say, and I literally just dictate, I just hit the microphone button on the Apple computer and I just dictate, \"Hey, this is an email from Michael. Michael's asking about this. Here's a little bit of background. I really like working with him. We've been doing this, this and this. Here's the email he asked. Can you help me think through... In fact, will you craft an email using my language that says this, this and this?\" So I'm not letting Chat just say, \"Write a response to Michael.\" Michael: So how does it know your language? What do you do? Carl: So I've fed it a bunch. So you can take, excuse me, let's circle back to that. So first, the last episode, which is really interesting to me because Chat gave us a couple of ideas and we're like, \"I don't like that one. How about that one? Could you give us a little bit more there?\" We told it about the audience. We said these are forward-thinking financial advisors and financial planners who are interested in being pushed. They also love getting practical examples and tips, tactics to use, and they want their thinking pushed a bit, we know the audience pretty well. And then I also love telling Chat that it's really good at something, like, \"You're the best executive producer in the world. Give us a couple of ideas.\" I find Chat, it's almost a little bit... Michael: You're very nice to it. Carl: Partially, it's Pascal's wager. Like, if this never happens, I want... Michael: If it turns out that ChatGPT becomes sentient, you want it to remember you well. Carl: I want it to remember me as nice, yeah. I actually think it operates better but I also like walking through the world where I treat everybody nice. So Chat gives us this idea. We have this conversation but guess what wasn't in this idea? Right? This is the unique interplay between creativity and humans and AI, engagement fallacy was not anything that Chat said. Right? And neither was utilization. That came from you and I brainstorming and bouncing ideas back and forth. And so I think now you can start to frame it's just a thinking partner. It's a creative partner. It's a, \"I have a friend, for instance, who oh, okay.\" So that's how we used it for the last episode. Using ChatGPT’s Summarizing Capabilities To Discover What’s (Really) Worth Focusing On [07:16] Michael: So I want to shift a moment in a moment around how we use this advisors because we're not necessarily in the creative creator business that you are, but I actually do want to come back for a moment. You said at the beginning you've been more productive over the past four weeks in using this. So what do you mean? What's productive to you? What do you mean by that? Carl: Yeah. Okay. Let me give you a couple of concrete examples. So my new framing is anytime I get stuck on anything, I go ask Chat. So it could be as stuck as like, \"I don't know how to reply to this email.\" It could be as stuck as we're considering – based on our last conversation last episode, are you really adding value or are you just justifying fees? We're considering removing something from our service offering. What should we think of? We have this thing that we've always done and we're not sure we... Oh, how about this? We talked specifically about experiment design in the last episode around questions you could ask. So you could feed it. The survey questions you're, \"Hey, we're going to ask our clients some questions. Here's our goal. We're trying to decide whether clients value something. We've got these five things that we're wondering about. Here's the questions we were going to send on a survey. You're the best survey data analyst in the planet, Chat. Would you please tell us of these five questions, do you like them? Can you think of any better ones?\" That's a great use case. Michael: Interesting. Carl: Here's another productivity thing. Michael: Here's my survey questions. Can you come up with better versions? Carl: Can you see anything I should do differently? Michael: Because I'm trying to measure this. Carl: Yeah. Do you think I'm going to get what I want? You're a data scientist, Chat. You tell it this things. I had it help me write my outline for a 50 Fires episode. And so I said in my mind, I was like, \"Who would be my dream executive producer?\" It's Ira Glass. So I said you were the executive producer for Ira Glass's \"This American Life\" and Krista Tippett's \"On Being\" and you've helped produce the Rich Roll podcast and the Huberman show. That's who you are. Here's my guest. Here's what I was thinking of asking them. And I just literally am talking. Here's what I was thinking of asking them. I'm really interested in this and this and this. This is why we want them on the show. Here's the 12 normal questions we ask in 50 Fires. Take those 12 questions, take my ideas and do your magic. Help me design a show. So there's and then let me give you one last example. Michael: And so it gets you to an output faster than you literally sitting there with a white pad. Carl: Yeah. Not even. It's not even like I just can't even. Now, I'm literally like I can't imagine my life. Now let me be clear, the first answer is not normally the one I want. Like I'll say, \"Oh, that's interesting. I really like this.\" I was most interested in asking...we just had Kara Swisher on it. I was most interested in asking Kara about what interesting conversations has she had with tech masters of the universe about money. What do you think about that? But here's one. Take this show. Go to YouTube. Does this show up on YouTube? Michael: Yes. Carl: Go to YouTube. Over on the right-hand side of YouTube there's a place for the transcript and it has the timestamped transcripts on most YouTube shows. Literally start at the top and just copy that whole thing. You don't have to clean it up. Don't do anything. Go to Chat, paste. Michael: So I can't just tell Chat like, \"Go to this website and read the transcript.\" Carl: Yeah, so you copy and paste that. You can upload PDFs. So if you have a book you've written or you have client, this is another example. If I had a client education like a flyer or a pamphlet that I handed out like my flagship piece as a PDF, I would completely for sure tomorrow, I would upload that as a PDF and say, \"Hey, you're our marketing and education expert. Here's what we're trying to communicate here. We doing a good job? What do you see that we can improve on? Anything you see we could take out?\" I'd ask it specific questions. But if you go to the show, copy the transcript, paste the transcript into Chat and say, \"Michael and Carl talk forever. Could you give me 2 or 3? Give me the 2 or 3 most valuable points that I need to know from this.\" I did that with a 2.5-hour episode of Huberman. And this is what I said to it. I said, \"Pretend like you are the head of my... You are my chief of staff. And the business depends on me not missing anything from this 2.5-hour episode, anything important. It depends. It depends on me. If you miss it, the business will fail.\" Michael: High stakes. Carl: \"I'm the CEO. I don't have time to listen to the whole 2.5 hours. Tell me what I need to know.\" It was incredible. In 12 minutes I feel like I knew what I needed to know. And it saved me 2.5 hours. Those are some examples. How Financial Advisors Can Actually Use ChatGPT [12:44] Michael: So now translate this for us to the advisor world. What do we do with this? Because, again, you live in a creative realm where I totally get it as creative thinking partner. So what are my advisor use cases? How do you fit this into our advisor world? Carl: Yes. So let's just pick some. Any email you're stuck on, how to reply. That's an easy one. Michael: So I copy, paste the client's email to me in the ChatGPT? Carl: And again, let's just be clear here, take away all the identifying information. Just copy and paste. Michael: Not the email and not the signature line? Carl: Say to it, \"I just got this email from a client. I'm unsure how to respond. I'm thinking of responding.\" I'd literally talk this into it. But if you type, that's great. I just hit the dictate button on my Apple computer and the dictate thing. I don't edit it. I don't even wait until the dictation is done before I hit enter. Michael: Meaning your prompt is just a jumble of real-time talking. You're not finally crafting it. Carl: Yes. This is natural language computing, right? This is where we all hoped we'd get. So I would say I got this email from a client. Let's just pick an example. This client relationship is kind of sensitive. I'm never exactly sure what they mean. But I really like them and I want to make sure I give them what they need. I'd love you to just look at this email real quick. Summarize it for me. Tell me what you see. What do you think they're asking for? Get that back. You're like, oh, okay, that's good. Hey, here's what I think the reply should be. Here's how I would have replied. Tell it. Based on what you suggested and based on what I suggested, we craft a reply for me. Now, I'm not suggesting you copy and paste that reply. Although I'm doing that a lot, because it's now my reply. I've now worked with... Chat just is my editor. But you just copy, paste that as a draft, that will save you anything you're stuck on. Right? You know those emails where you're like ah... Michael: Yeah. Yeah. Carl: That's not just a simple reply, one minute, yes, no. It's going to take a lot of thought. Any of those. That's one example. I think another example is what we already talked about, the show. Any book you want to read. Right? Anything that you need a summary of. Michael: Oh, give me a summary. Carl: Yeah I just did that. For some research I'm doing on a book about risk, I said, \"Make me a list of the 12 most important books about this kind of risk.\" It's a specific kind of risk. It's the kind of risk you feel, related to imposter syndrome, it's the kind of risk you feel when you go to put something in the world. Right? Whether that's a business, a new first meeting, a sketch, a book, a poem, that risk is very intimate and I was trying to figure out what it's called. And I said, \"Do you have any books to suggest?\" It gave me a list of 12 books. I said, \"Hey, that's a lot of books. Out of those, which ones should I have use? Should I just work with you for an hour back and forth summarizing, and which ones should I read?\" And it gave me two to read and said, \"Let's work together on these 10.\" So then I started a new Chat. And I actually I said to it, \"Which one would you start with?\" What’s the most important one to start with? Because the framework will help the others. Michael: Right. Carl: Gave me the one to start with. I went into a new chat and said, \"Okay, will you work with me? Teach me everything I need to know.\" And I was planning on spending like an hour. I was planning on this being like half an hour, 30 to 60 minutes maybe two or three times. Let it bounce around in my head. I do this sometimes. Now I've done it a little bit in the car, audio, because Chat has an audio function. You can give Chat a whole book and say, \"Teach me this book by quizzing me.\" I'm doing a bunch of avalanche training. I'm having Chat tutor and teach me everything I need to know in all the material. I uploaded 250 pages of a PDF. Michael: And you have it quiz you, it's making up quiz questions. Carl: Yes. I'm reading it still because it's really important. But it's creating the flashcards you used in college. Michael: Yeah. Carl: So those are some. And then back, like any marketing proposal, how about this? A first meeting brainstorm. Sit down with Chat and say, \"Here's how we run our first meetings.\" You could download an episode that we've done here. Go download the transcript of an episode that Michael and I did on first meetings. Say, \"Here's how we do first meetings. Here's what those crazy nut cases, Kitces and Carl say about first meetings. Here's where I'm hung up. I don't want anybody to cry in my office. I'm a financial person with a calculator. I don't know. Everybody's telling me I need to be emotionally intelligent.\" You can literally say that and then say, \"Can you just work with me and help me understand how I can make my first meeting better?\" And then you could say, \"Generate an agenda for me with the exact questions in order that you want me to ask.\" And then just look at it. I'm not suggesting that you're going to go walk in the room and do it. Although, I think if you did, you would probably be better than 99% of the advisors out there. But just use it as a template. So I just read, this is in \"The New York Times,\" they did an experiment where they had Chat diagnose. I can't remember the number of patients. So that they knew the patient. They already knew the diagnosis. And they had Chat diagnose. They had doctors with AI diagnose and they had doctors. Chat did a better job than all of them. Then next would be the doctors with AI and then the doctors by themselves. So I'm just suggesting, start thinking of it as a tool. I've told all my kids, \"Please use this all the time. Start just using it as a thinking partner. Crisp, fast, speed things up a bit.\" Hey, tell me what I need to know. Look, you can't listen to all the podcasts you want to anyway. The ones that are really important to, listen to the whole thing. That's what it said to me about books. It was like, \"Look, most of these books we can work together and it's going to take you six hours to read. It will take you an hour with me and you'll know it better.\" But then it said, \"But some of them you're going to really want to notice the cadence and the way the author writes, the way they build the case, and those would be important to read.\" I get fired up about this because I'm telling you the future is already here. It's just unevenly distributed. That's the saying. Right? And your value is not going away. It's only getting better. Your presence, your ability to ask questions, your ability to be there, you're only getting more valuable. And the ability to quickly get through things as a thinking partner, as an editor, as a marketing assistant, has just gone through the roof and it's 20 bucks a month. What else? Sorry for ranting. Using ChatGPT As An Iterative Partner To Get Better Responses [20:28] Michael: So I'm struck by some of what you're saying here. I feel like a lot of the concern I still hear from any advisory firms essentially comes down to various versions of data security, private client privacy. And just, I'm struck, almost none of what you're talking about even gets into that. You're not in the... I've uploaded all my clients' private file, private client information, you construct a financial plan for them, even in your email example, you just copy the body of the email not their email address and their picture plate that has their name and contact information. You give me a summary of a book, which book should I read. I'm working on a marketing proposal. I'm brainstorming my meeting process. These aren't these aren't things that even get into client data-related stuff in the first place. Carl: No, no. Yeah, I know. Yeah, yeah, I agree. I don't I don't think of it that way and I also don't think of it as... This is what I did for a long time because I have a coach that was really trying to get me to use an AI tool, mainly Chat, and I was like, \"I've tried it. It doesn't give me a good answer.\" I think that's what most people do and I think that's a user problem. It's just prompt engineering, like asking the right questions. So once I started doing that... Michael: “I didn’t sign up for this job to be a prompt engineer.” That's part of my challenge with this. I'm sure it would be amazing if you could be the perfect prompt engineer. But just do I have to accept that my future reality's that we're all going to learn to be prompt engineers? Carl: No. I think where I got where I realized was prompt engineering is just a fancy word. To me, it's just talking. So I think even what you just said, \"Hey, I'm not a prompt engineer. I don't know how to do this.\" But I know we have a... For you, I was just reading this great...listening this great podcast about somebody who wrote what they consider their best book, data heavy book, in 30 days. And it's mainly because they used AI to help with all the data because you can upload and it will run, it will build, run, it will build, program. It will think through program and run the regression analysis for you. Michael: Okay. Carl: So I'm simply saying anytime you get stuck like that, right, the first means is a really great example. That's maybe the edge of the creative example that I would use. When you said financial plans is like, man, if I could, if there's a way to have the data, all the confidential stuff removed, maybe mainly just the client's name, I would think it would be unbelievably fascinating to upload 20 financial plans and just say, \"Hey, each of these are going to be different but I'm curious, are we ordering it correctly? Is the is the writing crisp and clear? Is it understandable to a client? How could I make this cleaner? How could I make it simpler? What suggestions would you have on what to eliminate?\" That's another maybe big header is anything that you would think you need an editor or creative partner on, and advisors are really, generally as a group we're not particularly good at that and... Michael: No, marketing is not a gift for most of us. Carl: Or even any form of written communication. So just having an editor in your pocket for 20 bucks a month, it is at least make it a little better. Do you know what I mean? It may not be... Michael: Well, I can envision, but you can get pretty far with that... “This is my ideal client profile, what are ways that I can market to them and how would I reach them?” Carl: Oh my god, that's great. Michael: Interesting marketing tactics, ideas, inspiration, for... Carl: I think this is fascinating. Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI and ChatGPT, when he was asked, \"How are you going to make money?\" he said, \"This is the great thing, we're just gonna ask Chat.\" I would literally go in there and say, \"Here's my ideal client. Here's where I live. Here's how I like to do things. I want to do it locally, or I only want to do it remotely, or I like LinkedIn, or I don't like X, or here they are, what would you do if you were me? Could you give me 20 topics for my podcast that dentists between the age of 35 and 47 would be interested in hearing?\" I'm telling you it will be better than what you would get from a marketing agency, especially if you'll be comfortable saying, \"I don't like that one,\" and then you'll see something you really like and you can grab it and go, \"Hey, I love that phrase. Where'd you come up with that phrase? Could we do something more around that?\" And then any suggestion it gives, I always push it at the end. I always say, \"Hey, these are great. We can just run with these but I want to push you one more time, Chat. You're the best first meeting consultant on the planet. If I really wanted to make this really effective for a client, I want them to be seen, my goal is that they're going to walk to the car scratching their heads feeling like they've been seen for the first time financially…” That's exactly what I would say. Michael: This is literally your prompt? This is literally the problem is how you ask it? Carl: Yeah. Michael: It is interesting to me, the one of the first descriptions I heard of ChatGPT when was first coming out is that it's just an intern that's pretty sharp but absolutely needs to be trained. Right? For anyone who's worked with an intern, you can have a really whip smart intern but just there's so many things they don't know because they maybe never done the job or had a job before that you just have to learn and practice being really clear and explicit and giving a lot of feedback of, \"That really wasn't correct and this would be better and here's why.\" But the more iterations you do with your intern, eventually they really learn your process or your style or what you need to do and then it's great but you have to give a lot of feedback of, \"Yes, this, not that,\" until they get it and that working with ChatGPT is functionally the same thing. Carl: I think that's fair. I think that was especially fair six months ago. I think now it's moved to let's say that intern is your head of marketing. It's that level now, I think, where you can say...or an editor that you would hire or first meeting consultant that doesn't even exist, right, or a podcast executive producer, we all know the feeling of how long it takes to train somebody to be the kind of language you want and you get back these proposals from a company where you're just like, \"That's not at all what I said,\" and you paid 20 grand for it, right, and so I'm just saying you're gonna be investing that time anyway. You could invest it in somebody who never gets sick, doesn't have fancy feelings and... Michael: Remembers every project you've ever worked on for the rest of time. Carl: Yeah, and I'm not, again, does it replace a marketing consulting firm? No way. I know some really good marketing people in our industry that are never going to be replaced. But for day-to-day stuff, yeah, I would just keep it open as a thinking partner. Michael: Very cool. Carl: Yeah. I'm looking forward to email on this. I'm super curious what people say but email us. Where do we email people us? hello@behaviorgap or where else? Michael: [email protected]. Carl: Perfect. That's even better, [email protected]. Email Michael, tell him how much you... Yeah, anyway, we love feedback. Michael: Also, tell us how you're using it. How are you using it that we didn't mention in your advisor world? Share with us. Carl: Cheers, Michael, awesome. Michael: Thank you very much, Carl. Appreciate it. Carl: Yep. Quality? Nerdy? Relevant? We really do use your feedback to shape our future content! Quality? Nerdy? Relevant? We really do use your feedback to shape our future content!",

  "html": "\u003cdiv id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"executive-summary\"\u003eExecutive Summary\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the mainstream technological landscape, conversations about which areas of the financial planning industry would be most likely impacted by AI have proliferated. These discussions have ranged from questioning whether everyone would be out of a job in five years to wondering if anything of substance would change at all. However, as the public’s understanding of AI has developed, the common consensus has largely shifted to the understanding that while processes may change, the expertise and human connection offered by specialists like financial advisors will be hard to replace. In fact, AI currently seems most likely to develop into a tool that advisors can use in many parts of practice. Which, in turn, poses the question – where can AI be most effectively used as a way for advisors to leverage their time and creativity?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 156th episode of \u003cem\u003eKitces \u0026amp; Carl\u003c/em\u003e, Michael Kitces and client communication expert Carl Richards discuss how they use AI tools such as ChatGPT to expedite their creative and strategic processes – and how to ‘ask’ ChatGPT better questions to get more effective and relevant answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps one of the most impressive capabilities of programs like ChatGPT lies in their ability to serve as brainstorming partners. To use them effectively, it can be helpful to assign ChatGPT a role (e.g., “You are my executive producer” or “You are a marketing director”) and define a clear objective. Providing sample documents or links to sources for tone or substance may be helpful. For example, advisors can attach their typical “first prospect meeting” agenda, give ChatGPT the role of business development coach, and ask for feedback and what to do differently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, a common frustration when using ChatGPT or similar programs for brainstorming is that the first responses may not be exactly what is hoped for. Rather than expecting a perfect ‘call and response’, the process can be approached more as an iterative dialogue. Sharing initial thoughts, providing feedback, and curating further – such as asking variations of “I really like [this idea]; can you tell me more about it for an audience of [specific type of client]…?” – can guide ChatGPT toward more tailored results. The advisor and AI can then collaborate further to create a stronger and more relevant offering. Additionally, many AI programs now ‘remember’ what was asked of them across sessions, making it easier to build on previous conversations and reach increasingly insightful responses over time!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key point is that with some patience and guidance, ChatGPT can be a powerful tool for enhancing many aspects of an advisory firm’s operations. Whether it’s used to help with marketing, drafting email responses, summarizing content, reviewing data analyses, or even providing feedback on client surveys, the potential applications are vast. Ultimately, the only true limitation of AI’s potential is ‘just’ a question of imagination!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-200x200.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Kitces\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-800x800.jpg 800w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP.jpg 1022w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-200x200.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-800x800.jpg 800w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP.jpg 1022w\" data-old-src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"michael-kitces\"\u003eMichael Kitces\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeam Kitces\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"\u003eMichael Kitces is Head of Planning Strategy at \u003ca href=\"https://wealth.focuspartners.com/michael-kitces?utm_campaign=ForConsumers\u0026amp;utm_id=Kitces\u0026amp;utm_medium=KitcesReferral\u0026amp;utm_source=Kitces\"\u003eFocus Partners Wealth\u003c/a\u003e, which provides an evidence-based approach to private wealth management for near- and current retirees, and \u003ca href=\"https://advisor.focuspartners.com/kitces/?utm_source=Kitces\u0026amp;utm_medium=KitcesReferral\u0026amp;utm_campaign=ForConsumers\u0026amp;utm_id=Kitces\"\u003eFocus Partners Advisor Solutions\u003c/a\u003e, a turnkey wealth management services provider supporting thousands of independent financial advisors through the scaling phase of growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, he is a co-founder of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.xyplanningnetwork.com/\"\u003eXY Planning Network\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://advicepay.com/\"\u003eAdvicePay\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.fppathfinder.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003efpPathfinder\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://newplannerrecruiting.com/\"\u003eNew Planner Recruiting\u003c/a\u003e, the former Practitioner Editor of the Journal of Financial Planning, the host of the \u003cem\u003eFinancial Advisor Success \u003c/em\u003epodcast, and the publisher of \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/\"\u003ethe popular financial planning industry blog \u003cem\u003eNerd’s Eye View\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e through his website \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/\"\u003eKitces.com\u003c/a\u003e, dedicated to advancing knowledge in financial planning.

I\u0026#39;m doing well. I\u0026#39;m excited to dive into today\u0026#39;s episode. It\u0026#39;s like I\u0026#39;ve been a little excited waiting for this because it\u0026#39;s kind of a there\u0026#39;s a reverse reveal moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Like a meta episode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e And the reveal was like the topic today is I want to talk a little bit about ChatGPT and AI and where this is showing up in advisory firms. I think we\u0026#39;re pretty clear we\u0026#39;re a year or two into this thing. We haven\u0026#39;t all been vanished off the career map. We still seem to have jobs. It\u0026#39;s not imminently replacing us, but we\u0026#39;re all trying to figure out how to use it. And kind of the big reveal on that vein was so for those who listen to our last episode around you are you really adding value or just justifying your fees and engagement fallacy, we did that episode because Carl typed into ChatGPT, \u0026#34;What are four good potential episodes that we could cover on Kitces and Carl?\u0026#34; And that was one of ChatGPT\u0026#39;s four suggestions. And so we did it. And it was a pretty good suggestion, as were the others that I don\u0026#39;t think we\u0026#39;re going to tell anyone because we really might do them in the other...some other good ones in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Right. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e But I forget what the full prompt is, Carl, that you had you had typed at the time. But it wasn\u0026#39;t a lot more than we publish this podcast called Kitces and Carl for financial advisors. Please look it up on the Internet so you know what it is. ChatGPT, you\u0026#39;re our executive producer. Please come up with four topics for us. And it did. I think it\u0026#39;s come up with four punchy topics that would be a little edgy. And it did. So it gave us things like, \u0026#34;Are you really adding value or is it all just fluff that justifying your fees?\u0026#34; So with that as the fun sort of queue up of well, one way we\u0026#39;re using ChatGPT is it\u0026#39;s now feeding us show ideas, how are you using ChatGPT and AI? Where is it starting to show up for you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-nav-title=\"Using ChatGPT As A Creative Partner [02:40]\" id=\"how-to-use-chatgpt-as-a-creative-partner-0240\"\u003eHow To Use ChatGPT As A Creative Partner [02:40]\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. And look, maybe we\u0026#39;ll just use that example as a way to sort of give advisors practical tools on how to use it. But I just want to start by saying it has changed my life. Like I am, the last four weeks, I am more productive than I can think of any time in my life and enjoying it more. And here\u0026#39;s why. And I think I\u0026#39;m so fascinated by how profoundly uncurious most humans still are about using this tool. And I think it\u0026#39;s largely because maybe people think, and it\u0026#39;s even hard to describe, maybe people think you just said. Now, the reason it\u0026#39;s really fascinating to me to use last episode as an example – the reason that worked is because I\u0026#39;ve been using ChatGPT to help me with a bunch of other projects. I think of it as a really great thinking partner. It helps me clarify my thinking. I don\u0026#39;t go in and say, \u0026#34;Write a book for me.\u0026#34; I say, \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m working on a book about risk. Here\u0026#39;s 18 articles I\u0026#39;ve written about it. Here\u0026#39;s the transcripts from 20 behavior radio episodes. Tell me what you see. What lines do you like? Pull out some interesting quotes.\u0026#34; And then that starts a whole discussion, it\u0026#39;ll pull out something. So in this situation where we...and then I want to spend at least 10 minutes of our conversation on very specific applications for advisors because ChatGPT has become – and I don\u0026#39;t care if it\u0026#39;s Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, whatever tool you want to use. I\u0026#39;ve just been using...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e ChatGPT is the proxy for AI the way that Google is the proxy for search.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. And it\u0026#39;s become...or like Kleenex is the proxy for tissue, just to use an analog example. But ChatGPT is actually what I use. I use the pro account and I also use Claude and I also use Perplexity for different things. And it\u0026#39;s the one app, ChatGPT the app, the desktop app and on my phone that I use every day almost the whole day. If I have an email I want to respond to I go into Chat, I copy the email and I say, and I literally just dictate, I just hit the microphone button on the Apple computer and I just dictate, \u0026#34;Hey, this is an email from Michael. Michael\u0026#39;s asking about this. Here\u0026#39;s a little bit of background. I really like working with him. We\u0026#39;ve been doing this, this and this. Here\u0026#39;s the email he asked. Can you help me think through... In fact, will you craft an email using my language that says this, this and this?\u0026#34; So I\u0026#39;m not letting Chat just say, \u0026#34;Write a response to Michael.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e So how does it know your language? What do you do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e So I\u0026#39;ve fed it a bunch. So you can take, excuse me, let\u0026#39;s circle back to that. So first, the last episode, which is really interesting to me because Chat gave us a couple of ideas and we\u0026#39;re like, \u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t like that one. How about that one? Could you give us a little bit more there?\u0026#34; We told it about the audience. We said these are forward-thinking financial advisors and financial planners who are interested in being pushed. They also love getting practical examples and tips, tactics to use, and they want their thinking pushed a bit, we know the audience pretty well. And then I also love telling Chat that it\u0026#39;s really good at something, like, \u0026#34;You\u0026#39;re the best executive producer in the world. Give us a couple of ideas.\u0026#34; I find Chat, it\u0026#39;s almost a little bit...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e You\u0026#39;re very nice to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Partially, it\u0026#39;s Pascal\u0026#39;s wager. Like, if this never happens, I want...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e If it turns out that ChatGPT becomes sentient, you want it to remember you well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e I want it to remember me as nice, yeah. I actually think it operates better but I also like walking through the world where I treat everybody nice. So Chat gives us this idea. We have this conversation but guess what wasn\u0026#39;t in this idea? Right? This is the unique interplay between creativity and humans and AI, engagement fallacy was not anything that Chat said. Right? And neither was utilization. That came from you and I brainstorming and bouncing ideas back and forth. And so I think now you can start to frame it\u0026#39;s just a thinking partner. It\u0026#39;s a creative partner. It\u0026#39;s a, \u0026#34;I have a friend, for instance, who oh, okay.\u0026#34; So that\u0026#39;s how we used it for the last episode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-nav-title=\"Summarizing Capabilities To Focus [07:16]\" id=\"using-chatgpts-summarizing-capabilities-to-discover-whats-really-worth-focusing-on-0716\"\u003eUsing ChatGPT’s Summarizing Capabilities To Discover What’s (Really) Worth Focusing On [07:16]\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e So I want to shift a moment in a moment around how we use this advisors because we\u0026#39;re not necessarily in the creative creator business that you are, but I actually do want to come back for a moment. You said at the beginning you\u0026#39;ve been more productive over the past four weeks in using this. So what do you mean? What\u0026#39;s productive to you? What do you mean by that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. Okay. Let me give you a couple of concrete examples. So my new framing is anytime I get stuck on anything, I go ask Chat. So it could be as stuck as like, \u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t know how to reply to this email.\u0026#34; It could be as stuck as we\u0026#39;re considering – based on our last conversation last episode, are you really adding value or are you just justifying fees? We\u0026#39;re considering removing something from our service offering. What should we think of? We have this thing that we\u0026#39;ve always done and we\u0026#39;re not sure we... Oh, how about this? We talked specifically about experiment design in the last episode around questions you could ask. So you could feed it. The survey questions you\u0026#39;re, \u0026#34;Hey, we\u0026#39;re going to ask our clients some questions. Here\u0026#39;s our goal. We\u0026#39;re trying to decide whether clients value something. We\u0026#39;ve got these five things that we\u0026#39;re wondering about. Here\u0026#39;s the questions we were going to send on a survey. You\u0026#39;re the best survey data analyst in the planet, Chat. Would you please tell us of these five questions, do you like them? Can you think of any better ones?\u0026#34; That\u0026#39;s a great use case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e Interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Here\u0026#39;s another productivity thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e Here\u0026#39;s my survey questions. Can you come up with better versions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Can you see anything I should do differently?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e Because I\u0026#39;m trying to measure this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. Do you think I\u0026#39;m going to get what I want? You\u0026#39;re a data scientist, Chat. You tell it this things. I had it help me write my outline for a 50 Fires episode. And so I said in my mind, I was like, \u0026#34;Who would be my dream executive producer?\u0026#34; It\u0026#39;s Ira Glass. So I said you were the executive producer for Ira Glass\u0026#39;s \u0026#34;This American Life\u0026#34; and Krista Tippett\u0026#39;s \u0026#34;On Being\u0026#34; and you\u0026#39;ve helped produce the Rich Roll podcast and the Huberman show. That\u0026#39;s who you are. Here\u0026#39;s my guest. Here\u0026#39;s what I was thinking of asking them. And I just literally am talking. Here\u0026#39;s what I was thinking of asking them. I\u0026#39;m really interested in this and this and this. This is why we want them on the show. Here\u0026#39;s the 12 normal questions we ask in 50 Fires. Take those 12 questions, take my ideas and do your magic. Help me design a show. So there\u0026#39;s and then let me give you one last example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e And so it gets you to an output faster than you literally sitting there with a white pad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. Not even. It\u0026#39;s not even like I just can\u0026#39;t even. Now, I\u0026#39;m literally like I can\u0026#39;t imagine my life. Now let me be clear, the first answer is not normally the one I want. Like I\u0026#39;ll say, \u0026#34;Oh, that\u0026#39;s interesting. I really like this.\u0026#34; I was most interested in asking...we just had Kara Swisher on it. I was most interested in asking Kara about what interesting conversations has she had with tech masters of the universe about money. What do you think about that? But here\u0026#39;s one. Take this show. Go to YouTube. Does this show up on YouTube?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Go to YouTube. Over on the right-hand side of YouTube there\u0026#39;s a place for the transcript and it has the timestamped transcripts on most YouTube shows. Literally start at the top and just copy that whole thing. You don\u0026#39;t have to clean it up. Don\u0026#39;t do anything. Go to Chat, paste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e So I can\u0026#39;t just tell Chat like, \u0026#34;Go to this website and read the transcript.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so you copy and paste that. You can upload PDFs. So if you have a book you\u0026#39;ve written or you have client, this is another example. If I had a client education like a flyer or a pamphlet that I handed out like my flagship piece as a PDF, I would completely for sure tomorrow, I would upload that as a PDF and say, \u0026#34;Hey, you\u0026#39;re our marketing and education expert. Here\u0026#39;s what we\u0026#39;re trying to communicate here. We doing a good job? What do you see that we can improve on? Anything you see we could take out?\u0026#34; I\u0026#39;d ask it specific questions. But if you go to the show, copy the transcript, paste the transcript into Chat and say, \u0026#34;Michael and Carl talk forever. Could you give me 2 or 3? Give me the 2 or 3 most valuable points that I need to know from this.\u0026#34; I did that with a 2.5-hour episode of Huberman. And this is what I said to it. I said, \u0026#34;Pretend like you are the head of my... You are my chief of staff. And the business depends on me not missing anything from this 2.5-hour episode, anything important. It depends. It depends on me. If you miss it, the business will fail.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e High stakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m the CEO. I don\u0026#39;t have time to listen to the whole 2.5 hours. Tell me what I need to know.\u0026#34; It was incredible. In 12 minutes I feel like I knew what I needed to know. And it saved me 2.5 hours. Those are some examples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-nav-title=\"How Advisors Can Use ChatGPT [12:44]\" id=\"how-financial-advisors-can-actually-use-chatgpt-1244\"\u003eHow Financial Advisors Can Actually Use ChatGPT [12:44]\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e So now translate this for us to the advisor world. What do we do with this? Because, again, you live in a creative realm where I totally get it as creative thinking partner. So what are my advisor use cases? How do you fit this into our advisor world?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes. So let\u0026#39;s just pick some. Any email you\u0026#39;re stuck on, how to reply. That\u0026#39;s an easy one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e So I copy, paste the client\u0026#39;s email to me in the ChatGPT?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e And again, let\u0026#39;s just be clear here, take away all the identifying information. Just copy and paste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e Not the email and not the signature line?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Say to it, \u0026#34;I just got this email from a client. I\u0026#39;m unsure how to respond. I\u0026#39;m thinking of responding.\u0026#34; I\u0026#39;d literally talk this into it. But if you type, that\u0026#39;s great. I just hit the dictate button on my Apple computer and the dictate thing. I don\u0026#39;t edit it. I don\u0026#39;t even wait until the dictation is done before I hit enter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e Meaning your prompt is just a jumble of real-time talking. You\u0026#39;re not finally crafting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes. This is natural language computing, right? This is where we all hoped we\u0026#39;d get. So I would say I got this email from a client. Let\u0026#39;s just pick an example. This client relationship is kind of sensitive. I\u0026#39;m never exactly sure what they mean. But I really like them and I want to make sure I give them what they need. I\u0026#39;d love you to just look at this email real quick. Summarize it for me. Tell me what you see. What do you think they\u0026#39;re asking for? Get that back. You\u0026#39;re like, oh, okay, that\u0026#39;s good. Hey, here\u0026#39;s what I think the reply should be. Here\u0026#39;s how I would have replied. Tell it. Based on what you suggested and based on what I suggested, we craft a reply for me. Now, I\u0026#39;m not suggesting you copy and paste that reply. Although I\u0026#39;m doing that a lot, because it\u0026#39;s now my reply. I\u0026#39;ve now worked with... Chat just is my editor. But you just copy, paste that as a draft, that will save you anything you\u0026#39;re stuck on. Right? You know those emails where you\u0026#39;re like ah...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e That\u0026#39;s not just a simple reply, one minute, yes, no. It\u0026#39;s going to take a lot of thought. Any of those. That\u0026#39;s one example. I think another example is what we already talked about, the show. Any book you want to read. Right? Anything that you need a summary of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e Oh, give me a summary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah I just did that. For some research I\u0026#39;m doing on a book about risk, I said, \u0026#34;Make me a list of the 12 most important books about this kind of risk.\u0026#34; It\u0026#39;s a specific kind of risk. It\u0026#39;s the kind of risk you feel, related to imposter syndrome, it\u0026#39;s the kind of risk you feel when you go to put something in the world. Right? Whether that\u0026#39;s a business, a new first meeting, a sketch, a book, a poem, that risk is very intimate and I was trying to figure out what it\u0026#39;s called. And I said, \u0026#34;Do you have any books to suggest?\u0026#34; It gave me a list of 12 books. I said, \u0026#34;Hey, that\u0026#39;s a lot of books. Out of those, which ones should I have use? Should I just work with you for an hour back and forth summarizing, and which ones should I read?\u0026#34; And it gave me two to read and said, \u0026#34;Let\u0026#39;s work together on these 10.\u0026#34; So then I started a new Chat. And I actually I said to it, \u0026#34;Which one would you start with?\u0026#34; What’s the most important one to start with? Because the framework will help the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Gave me the one to start with. I went into a new chat and said, \u0026#34;Okay, will you work with me? Teach me everything I need to know.\u0026#34; And I was planning on spending like an hour. I was planning on this being like half an hour, 30 to 60 minutes maybe two or three times. Let it bounce around in my head. I do this sometimes. Now I\u0026#39;ve done it a little bit in the car, audio, because Chat has an audio function. You can give Chat a whole book and say, \u0026#34;Teach me this book by quizzing me.\u0026#34; I\u0026#39;m doing a bunch of avalanche training. I\u0026#39;m having Chat tutor and teach me everything I need to know in all the material. I uploaded 250 pages of a PDF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e And you have it quiz you, it\u0026#39;s making up quiz questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes. I\u0026#39;m reading it still because it\u0026#39;s really important. But it\u0026#39;s creating the flashcards you used in college.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e So those are some. And then back, like any marketing proposal, how about this? A first meeting brainstorm. Sit down with Chat and say, \u0026#34;Here\u0026#39;s how we run our first meetings.\u0026#34; You could download an episode that we\u0026#39;ve done here. Go download the transcript of an episode that Michael and I did on first meetings. Say, \u0026#34;Here\u0026#39;s how we do first meetings. Here\u0026#39;s what those crazy nut cases, Kitces and Carl say about first meetings. Here\u0026#39;s where I\u0026#39;m hung up. I don\u0026#39;t want anybody to cry in my office. I\u0026#39;m a financial person with a calculator. I don\u0026#39;t know. Everybody\u0026#39;s telling me I need to be emotionally intelligent.\u0026#34; You can literally say that and then say, \u0026#34;Can you just work with me and help me understand how I can make my first meeting better?\u0026#34; And then you could say, \u0026#34;Generate an agenda for me with the exact questions in order that you want me to ask.\u0026#34; And then just look at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m not suggesting that you\u0026#39;re going to go walk in the room and do it. Although, I think if you did, you would probably be better than 99% of the advisors out there. But just use it as a template. So I just read, this is in \u0026#34;The New York Times,\u0026#34; they did an experiment where they had Chat diagnose. I can\u0026#39;t remember the number of patients. So that they knew the patient. They already knew the diagnosis. And they had Chat diagnose. They had doctors with AI diagnose and they had doctors. Chat did a better job than all of them. Then next would be the doctors with AI and then the doctors by themselves. So I\u0026#39;m just suggesting, start thinking of it as a tool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;ve told all my kids, \u0026#34;Please use this all the time. Start just using it as a thinking partner. Crisp, fast, speed things up a bit.\u0026#34; Hey, tell me what I need to know. Look, you can\u0026#39;t listen to all the podcasts you want to anyway. The ones that are really important to, listen to the whole thing. That\u0026#39;s what it said to me about books. It was like, \u0026#34;Look, most of these books we can work together and it\u0026#39;s going to take you six hours to read. It will take you an hour with me and you\u0026#39;ll know it better.\u0026#34; But then it said, \u0026#34;But some of them you\u0026#39;re going to really want to notice the cadence and the way the author writes, the way they build the case, and those would be important to read.\u0026#34; I get fired up about this because I\u0026#39;m telling you the future is already here. It\u0026#39;s just unevenly distributed. That\u0026#39;s the saying. Right? And your value is not going away. It\u0026#39;s only getting better. Your presence, your ability to ask questions, your ability to be there, you\u0026#39;re only getting more valuable. And the ability to quickly get through things as a thinking partner, as an editor, as a marketing assistant, has just gone through the roof and it\u0026#39;s 20 bucks a month. What else?

I feel like a lot of the concern I still hear from any advisory firms essentially comes down to various versions of data security, private client privacy. And just, I\u0026#39;m struck, almost none of what you\u0026#39;re talking about even gets into that. You\u0026#39;re not in the... I\u0026#39;ve uploaded all my clients\u0026#39; private file, private client information, you construct a financial plan for them, even in your email example, you just copy the body of the email not their email address and their picture plate that has their name and contact information. You give me a summary of a book, which book should I read. I\u0026#39;m working on a marketing proposal. I\u0026#39;m brainstorming my meeting process. These aren\u0026#39;t these aren\u0026#39;t things that even get into client data-related stuff in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e No, no. Yeah, I know. Yeah, yeah, I agree. I don\u0026#39;t I don\u0026#39;t think of it that way and I also don\u0026#39;t think of it as... This is what I did for a long time because I have a coach that was really trying to get me to use an AI tool, mainly Chat, and I was like, \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;ve tried it. It doesn\u0026#39;t give me a good answer.\u0026#34; I think that\u0026#39;s what most people do and I think that\u0026#39;s a user problem. It\u0026#39;s just prompt engineering, like asking the right questions. So once I started doing that...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e “I didn’t sign up for this job to be a prompt engineer.” That\u0026#39;s part of my challenge with this. I\u0026#39;m sure it would be amazing if you could be the perfect prompt engineer. But just do I have to accept that my future reality\u0026#39;s that we\u0026#39;re all going to learn to be prompt engineers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e No. I think where I got where I realized was prompt engineering is just a fancy word. To me, it\u0026#39;s just talking. So I think even what you just said, \u0026#34;Hey, I\u0026#39;m not a prompt engineer. I don\u0026#39;t know how to do this.\u0026#34; But I know we have a... For you, I was just reading this great...listening this great podcast about somebody who wrote what they consider their best book, data heavy book, in 30 days. And it\u0026#39;s mainly because they used AI to help with all the data because you can upload and it will run, it will build, run, it will build, program. It will think through program and run the regression analysis for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e So I\u0026#39;m simply saying anytime you get stuck like that, right, the first means is a really great example. That\u0026#39;s maybe the edge of the creative example that I would use. When you said financial plans is like, man, if I could, if there\u0026#39;s a way to have the data, all the confidential stuff removed, maybe mainly just the client\u0026#39;s name, I would think it would be unbelievably fascinating to upload 20 financial plans and just say, \u0026#34;Hey, each of these are going to be different but I\u0026#39;m curious, are we ordering it correctly? Is the is the writing crisp and clear? Is it understandable to a client? How could I make this cleaner? How could I make it simpler? What suggestions would you have on what to eliminate?\u0026#34; That\u0026#39;s another maybe big header is anything that you would think you need an editor or creative partner on, and advisors are really, generally as a group we\u0026#39;re not particularly good at that and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e No, marketing is not a gift for most of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Or even any form of written communication. So just having an editor in your pocket for 20 bucks a month, it is at least make it a little better. Do you know what I mean? It may not be...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I can envision, but you can get pretty far with that... “This is my ideal client profile, what are ways that I can market to them and how would I reach them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Oh my god, that\u0026#39;s great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e Interesting marketing tactics, ideas, inspiration, for...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e I think this is fascinating. Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI and ChatGPT, when he was asked, \u0026#34;How are you going to make money?\u0026#34; he said, \u0026#34;This is the great thing, we\u0026#39;re just gonna ask Chat.\u0026#34; I would literally go in there and say, \u0026#34;Here\u0026#39;s my ideal client. Here\u0026#39;s where I live. Here\u0026#39;s how I like to do things. I want to do it locally, or I only want to do it remotely, or I like LinkedIn, or I don\u0026#39;t like X, or here they are, what would you do if you were me? Could you give me 20 topics for my podcast that dentists between the age of 35 and 47 would be interested in hearing?\u0026#34; I\u0026#39;m telling you it will be better than what you would get from a marketing agency, especially if you\u0026#39;ll be comfortable saying, \u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t like that one,\u0026#34; and then you\u0026#39;ll see something you really like and you can grab it and go, \u0026#34;Hey, I love that phrase. Where\u0026#39;d you come up with that phrase? Could we do something more around that?\u0026#34; And then any suggestion it gives, I always push it at the end. I always say, \u0026#34;Hey, these are great. We can just run with these but I want to push you one more time, Chat. You\u0026#39;re the best first meeting consultant on the planet. If I really wanted to make this really effective for a client, I want them to be seen, my goal is that they\u0026#39;re going to walk to the car scratching their heads feeling like they\u0026#39;ve been seen for the first time financially…” That\u0026#39;s exactly what I would say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e This is literally your prompt? This is literally the problem is how you ask it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e It is interesting to me, the one of the first descriptions I heard of ChatGPT when was first coming out is that it\u0026#39;s just an intern that\u0026#39;s pretty sharp but absolutely needs to be trained. Right? For anyone who\u0026#39;s worked with an intern, you can have a really whip smart intern but just there\u0026#39;s so many things they don\u0026#39;t know because they maybe never done the job or had a job before that you just have to learn and practice being really clear and explicit and giving a lot of feedback of, \u0026#34;That really wasn\u0026#39;t correct and this would be better and here\u0026#39;s why.\u0026#34; But the more iterations you do with your intern, eventually they really learn your process or your style or what you need to do and then it\u0026#39;s great but you have to give a lot of feedback of, \u0026#34;Yes, this, not that,\u0026#34; until they get it and that working with ChatGPT is functionally the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e I think that\u0026#39;s fair. I think that was especially fair six months ago. I think now it\u0026#39;s moved to let\u0026#39;s say that intern is your head of marketing. It\u0026#39;s that level now, I think, where you can say...or an editor that you would hire or first meeting consultant that doesn\u0026#39;t even exist, right, or a podcast executive producer, we all know the feeling of how long it takes to train somebody to be the kind of language you want and you get back these proposals from a company where you\u0026#39;re just like, \u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s not at all what I said,\u0026#34; and you paid 20 grand for it, right, and so I\u0026#39;m just saying you\u0026#39;re gonna be investing that time anyway. You could invest it in somebody who never gets sick, doesn\u0026#39;t have fancy feelings and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e Remembers every project you\u0026#39;ve ever worked on for the rest of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, and I\u0026#39;m not, again, does it replace a marketing consulting firm? No way. I know some really good marketing people in our industry that are never going to be replaced. But for day-to-day stuff, yeah, I would just keep it open as a thinking partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael:\u003c/strong\u003e Very cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarl:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah.
