Or, maybe… Wondering how to make more money when you’re tired at the end of the day? I get it. I’ve been in your shoes. I have spent countless hours side hustling after a day job so that I could make more money to pay off my debt sooner and stop living paycheck to paycheck. Or, maybe you’re doing it so that you can save for a vacation faster. Whatever your reason, there are many ways to make extra income, even if you’re really tired. At the end of a long day, the last thing most of us want to do is think about making more money. Whether you’ve been working a full-time job, chasing kids around, or just dealing with everyday life, it’s easy to feel like there’s no time or energy left for anything else. But what if you could earn a little extra, without needing a ton of motivation or a strict schedule? That’s what this post is all about. So today, I’m sharing ideas you can try in the evenings, during your downtime, or whenever your energy is running low but you still need to make extra money. Best Ways To Make More Money When You’re Tired at the End of the Day Below are the best ways to make extra money after work, even when you’re exhausted. 1. Pick something you can do from the couch If you’re looking for something to do after work, the last thing you probably want to do is drive somewhere, especially when you have low energy levels. There are actually a lot of ways to make a little money without leaving your couch. One of my favorites is using survey and rewards apps. I’ve used many of these sites, and yes, I’ve earned free gift cards and real cash just from using my phone in my spare time. I am personally signed up for all of the sites below and use them all the time! Freecash – I have personally made $302 in one week by playing games on my phone on Freecash. Survey Junkie – This is a popular site for answering surveys, and they usually have a lot available to answer. User Interviews – This is a focus group company that pays the most. I once made $400 in one hour of my time doing a video survey interview. Swagbucks – With this site, you can make money playing games, signing up for apps, answering surveys, and more. I have earned over 110 free gift cards with this site over the years. Fetch Rewards – You simply take a picture of your grocery store receipt with this app and earn points. Super easy and I use it for all of my grocery receipts! Upside – Get cash back on your gas/fuel purchases. I recently got $44 cash back on just one fill-up at the gas station. No, you’re not going to get rich, but even an extra $50 to $100 a month can help with groceries, bills, or savings. And the best part? You can do it while wearing pajamas. 2. Try a creative hobby that feels like “me time” Sometimes making money can be fun and feel like a break from your day. Do you enjoy drawing, painting, journaling, or decorating your planner? You might like creating digital products like printables or wall art to sell on Etsy. Or maybe you like taking photos or writing, those can turn into income streams, too. I’ve met people who started with a fun hobby and ended up earning hundreds or even thousands of dollars a month. You don’t need to be a professional. Just start, experiment, and see what you like and what works. I recommend watching the free workshop How To Earn Money Selling Printables. You’ll learn printable ideas, how to get started on Etsy, and how to actually make sales. You can learn more at 14 Best Crafting Hobbies That Make Money. 3. Answer questions on JustAnswer If you’re knowledgeable in a certain field, like law, tech support, medical, mechanics, or even pets, then you may be able to get paid to answer questions online through a site called JustAnswer. This is a site where people go to get expert advice, and they’re willing to pay for fast, helpful answers. As an expert, you can sign up, verify your background, and start answering questions right from your couch. You get to choose which questions to respond to and how much time you want to spend on the platform. This is a great option for evenings or weekends when you’re already in relaxation mode but still want to earn a little something. I’ve heard from readers who do this just a few hours a week and earn extra money on the side, all without leaving their homes. Recommended reading: 28 Ways To Get Paid To Text 4. Flip something from around your house If you’ve got a pile of stuff you’ve been wanting to sell, this is your sign. Listing things for sale on Facebook Marketplace, Poshmark, eBay, and other selling apps doesn’t take long, and it can be surprisingly satisfying to clear out your space and earn money at the same time. You can spend one evening gathering things to sell and another writing the listings. After that, it’s just answering messages and shipping things out. Back when I had a day job, selling stuff was actually one of my favorite ways to make extra money. I even had a small reselling/flipping business at one point. I sold mainly clothing, but I occasionally sold other things like car tires (this was just one time, but it made a surprisingly good amount of money!), jewelry, and more. 5. Use passive income ideas that keep earning overnight If you’re too tired to hustle every day, passive income might be the perfect fit. This includes things like: Selling digital downloads Starting a blog and earning with affiliate marketing Creating an online course or membership Investing in dividend-paying stocks Putting your money in a high-yield savings account Writing an ebook – once it’s written and uploaded to Amazon, it can earn money on autopilot Using cash back credit cards or apps – they earn you money automatically when you shop These ideas usually take some upfront work, but once they’re set up, they can keep earning while you sleep. Even just earning $50 a month from something you made once is a big win, and it grows from there. Recommended reading: 18 Passive Income Ideas To Earn $1,000+ Each Month 6. Freelance or sell a service in your free time Finding time and energy to side hustle after you get home from work can be hard sometimes. Which is why I usually recommend finding something that you can do from home. For me, freelancing is a side hustle I did after my 9-5 and I really enjoyed it. It didn’t require a commute nor me having to talk to anyone in person or on the phone. Everything was just from my laptop. If you have a skill like proofreading, social media, writing, virtual assisting, or graphic design, then you may be able to find clients and sell this as a service that you do in the evening. You don’t need to commit to full-time work, which is nice too. 7. Rent something out you’re not using If you’re too tired to pick up a new side hustle, renting out something you already own can be one of the most hands-off ways to make more money. Some ideas include: A spare room, either on Airbnb or to a long-term renter List your car on Turo when you’re not using it Tools, baby gear, or photography equipment An RV or camper on a site like RVshare Your driveway or parking spot (great if you live near a stadium, airport, or city center) Storage space in your basement, garage, or shed with Neighbor Bikes, kayaks, paddleboards, or skis if you live near trails or water Event or party supplies like folding chairs, tables, or decorations You could even start real estate investing, such as by buying a duplex and renting out both sides. I recommend reading 23 Best Real Estate Side Hustles To Make Extra Money to learn more. 10RVShareRVshare is one of the best money-making sites because it helps travelers save money by cutting out the middleman and offering RV rentals directly from RV owners. If you have an RV that is sitting around, then you may be able to make $100 to $300+ a day. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about how to make more money even if you’re super tired after work. How can I make money if I only have 30 minutes a day? There are many ways to make extra money even if you only have 30 minutes a day, such as by answering surveys, playing games on your phone, or flipping items for resale. What’s the easiest way to make money when I’m exhausted? If you’re really tired, then I think the best ways to make money are passive or low-effort ideas, like playing games on your phone, selling printables, or answering surveys. These are things you can do from your couch, which is nice. Do I need to spend money to start a side hustle? No, you do not need to spend money to start a side hustle! Many side hustles cost $0 to start. You can sell things you already own, freelance, answer surveys on your phone, and more and not spend any money to get started. I’ve done over 20 side hustles in my life and most of them cost nothing to start. What if I’m too mentally tired after work? That’s okay. It’s completely normal to be too mentally tired after work. You may want to try to focus on something fun or passive and start with just one small step. You don’t need to do it all at once. How To Make More Money When You’re Tired at the End of the Day – Summary I hope you enjoyed my article on the best ways to make more money when you’re tired at the end of the day. If you’re tired at the end of the day, that doesn’t mean you have to give up on your financial goals. You just need something that fits your life right now. You can start small and test a few things. I recommend that you give yourself permission to take it slow. Even if you only make an extra $5 a day, that’s around $150 a month, and that’s something to celebrate. For me, I worked many, many hours on top of my day job so that I could pay off my student loans as quickly as possible. Since I wanted to pay off my student loans as quickly as possible, some of my main requirements for my side hustles included not having to commute, being able to do the tasks from home, and it not being too mentally draining. I can positively say that this is all doable! I found many side hustles that fit this. And, I think you can too. Good luck! What’s your favorite way to make money when you’re tired after work?
