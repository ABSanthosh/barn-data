You’re at a new stage in life, ready to earn money and gain work experience. There are many options out there for young adults like you, from part-time gigs to full-time careers. At 18, I was working full-time hours and going to school. It was tough, but I learned a lot about managing money, and making money too!

Target usually gives flexible schedules, which is perfect if you’re balancing work with school or other activities. You might work days, evenings, or weekends. I know many people who worked at Target when they were younger, and they all seemed to have good memories of working there and enjoyed the income. 3. Grocery bagger Grocery baggers help customers pack their groceries at checkout. Your main task will be putting items in bags carefully. You’ll need to group similar things together and keep heavy stuff separate from fragile items. This helps protect groceries and makes unpacking easier for customers. Pretty much any grocery store will hire an 18-year-old, and the pay is usually good. 4. Blogger Being a blogger is a fun way to make money as an 18-year-old. You can write about things you love, like games, fashion, or sports. Many teens start blogs to share their thoughts and ideas. You can earn money from your blog in different ways. You might put ads on your site or work with brands to promote their products. Some bloggers also sell their own stuff, like ebooks or courses. The best part is you can blog from anywhere. All you need is a computer and internet. It’s a flexible job that fits around your school or other activities. I started this blog that you are reading right now when I was a young adult, and it’s one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I make a full-time income, have a flexible schedule, and I really love what I do. You can learn more about this at How To Start A Blog FREE Course. In this free course, I show you how to create a blog, from the technical side to earning your first dollar and getting page views. 5. Lifeguard Being a lifeguard at your local pool can be a great job for 18-year-olds. You get to spend time outdoors and help keep people safe while they swim. Most pools require lifeguards to be at least 15 or 16 years old. As an 18-year-old, you’ll easily meet the age requirement for this job. Lifeguards do need to get certified and this usually involves taking a course and passing a test. Many places offer lifeguard training, including the Red Cross. The pay for lifeguards can vary, but it’s usually above minimum wage. Some jobs pay between $15 and $20 per hour. This can be a good way to earn money during summer breaks. 6. Play games on your phone If you want to make money while having fun, then you can play games on your phone and earn cash at the same time. Many apps pay rewards for playing games or watching ads. Here’s a quick list of the top game apps that pay real cash: Freecash KashKick Swagbucks InboxDollars Keep in mind that you won’t get rich from these apps.

You can share your opinions and get rewarded for it.

You can then trade those points for cash or gift cards. The pay for surveys varies. You might earn 50 cents to $5 per survey. So, don’t expect to get rich from surveys. Most people can make around $20 to $100 a month doing them. You can do surveys anytime, anywhere. They’re great for filling spare moments in your day. 8. Pet sitter with Rover Rover is a popular dog walking app that connects pet owners with pet sitters and dog walkers. If you love animals, this could be a fun way to make money at 18. Dog sitters watch pets in their home or visit them at their house. You can offer services like dog walking, feeding, and playtime. The great thing about Rover is that you can choose which jobs you want to take. This makes it easy to fit around school or other activities. 9. Freelance graphic designer Freelance graphic design can include creating logos, flyers, and social media graphics for clients. You don’t need a degree to get started. Many successful designers are self-taught, so you can practice your skills and build a portfolio to show potential clients. Places like Fiverr and Upwork are great for finding graphic design jobs. You can set your own rates and choose projects that interest you. 10. Camp counselor Being a camp counselor is a great summer job for 18-year-olds because you get to work outdoors and have fun with kids.

Each delivery shows how much you’ll earn before you accept it, and you can typically make around $15 to $20 per hour (but you’ll also want to think about how much you’re spending on maintaining your car and gas to calculate the true earnings). You get to keep 100% of your tips too. 17. Cashier at Walgreens Walgreens has many cashier jobs for 18-year-olds. You can find these positions in different states across the U.S. Cashiers at Walgreens handle customer transactions and help with store operations.

Summer is the busiest time for landscaping work. But some companies hire for year-round jobs if you’re willing to do snow removal in winter. 23. UPS package handler UPS hires package handlers starting at age 18. This job can be a great fit for young adults looking for work. Package handlers move and sort packages in UPS warehouses. The work is physical and fast-paced. You might load trucks, unload them, or organize items for delivery. UPS hires for both part-time and full-time positions. Many start as seasonal workers during busy times like the holidays. But there are chances to stay on year-round too. The pay for package handlers is competitive. UPS also provides benefits, even for part-time workers. These can include healthcare, tuition help, and chances to move up in the company. My husband worked at UPS for many years and started when he was 18 years old, mainly for the health insurance. And, so did many other people who worked there. The health insurance at UPS is one of the best I’ve ever seen, and it’s available to part-time workers. Balancing Work and School I worked full-time as an 18-year-old, and I completely understand and know that working while in school can be tough. It takes good planning and focus to do both well. Here are some tips to help you succeed in your job and classes. Setting priorities When balancing work and school, it’s important to focus on what matters most. Education usually takes priority, so make sure your job schedule doesn’t interfere with your classes or study time. Communicate with your employer about your availability, and don’t hesitate to turn down extra shifts if you need that time for school. Setting weekly goals can help keep you on track. For example, you might aim to finish a project or save a certain amount by the end of the week. Prioritizing can make it easier to reach these goals without feeling overwhelmed. And remember, if you start to feel stressed, don’t be afraid to ask for help from teachers, parents, or friends. Time management tips Below are my time management tips: Plan your week – Write down your class schedule, work shifts, and study times. I also made sure that my classes and work schedule worked together seamlessly so that the least amount of time was wasted between classes and commuting. Set daily study times – Set aside time each day for studying or homework. Do homework right after school – Finishing assignments early in the day leaves evenings open for other activities. Of course, this can be hard if you go to work right after school, but in this case, try to do your homework on the same day (after you get off from work) so that it is out of the way. Take short breaks – Regular breaks help recharge your brain, improving focus and productivity. Use reminders and alarms – Set phone reminders for important tasks or deadlines to stay on top of your responsibilities. My phone’s calendar is full of tasks and to-dos so that I don’t forget anything and so that I know what I need to be doing. Limit distractions – Find a quiet place to work, and turn off notifications on your phone to keep your focus. Be realistic with your time – Avoid overcommitting by giving yourself enough time for each task, to make sure that you do quality work without rushing.
