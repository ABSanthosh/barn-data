Free gift cards can be a great way to save money on clothes and accessories. These cards let you shop at Old Navy stores or online without spending cash. You can buy them for yourself or give them as gifts to friends and family. If you’re wondering whether earning free Old Navy gift cards is possible, I can tell you from personal experience that it definitely is. I have personally earned free Old Navy gift cards using the methods below! These ways are easy and you can turn your everyday tasks, like shopping or taking surveys, into real rewards. Best Ways To Get Free Old Navy Gift Cards Here’s a quick list before we begin: Swagbucks Prime Opinion Five Surveys Fetch Rewards Ibotta PrizeRebel Capital One Shopping Old Navy Super Cash Reward Below are the best ways to get a free Old Navy gift card. I’ve received over 100 gift cards from Swagbucks, as you can see in this screenshot. 1. Swagbucks Swagbucks is a fun way to earn free gift cards and cash from home. You can sign up for free and start making money right away. It’s easy to use and you don’t need any special skills. There are lots of ways to earn points on Swagbucks. You can take surveys, watch videos, play games, and even shop online. Each task gives you points called SB. These points add up fast! For example, you can get 40,000 points for playing a game on your phone, which is equal to $400 in free gift cards. Companies like Swagbucks pay you to play games and answer surveys because the companies they are promoting pay them to promote it, and they then pass on some of the income to you to get you to play more. When you have enough points, you can trade them for free Old Navy gift cards or PayPal cash. I have earned over 110 free gift cards on Swagbucks over the years, so I know this is a real way to get free gift cards. Sign up for Swagbucks here (and earn $5 in free bonus points).

It’s easy to use and free to join. When you sign up, you’ll see lots of surveys to pick from. You can do them on your phone or computer whenever you have free time. Each survey asks about things like products you use or TV shows you watch. Your answers help companies make better stuff. You get points for every survey you finish. For example, I can earn 260 points for a 15-minute survey. These points can then be turned into real money or gift cards. You can cash out through PayPal, your bank, or Venmo. There are also many gift card options like Old Navy, Amazon, and Target. Please click here to sign up for Prime Opinion and get up to a $5 free bonus (500 free bonus points).

You can earn $5 for every 5 surveys you finish and it’s pretty simple to use. The surveys ask about different things. You might share your thoughts on products or tell them about your shopping habits. Don’t worry – the questions are usually easy to answer. For example, here are some questions I was asked when I took a survey on Five Surveys: Which of the following streaming services have you heard of? If you could travel to any place in the world, where would you go and what would you do there? What is your zip code? One nice thing about Five Surveys is that you can cash out your earnings quickly. You don’t have to wait forever to get your money. You can choose to get paid through free Old Navy gift cards, PayPal, bank transfer, or Venmo. Please click here to sign up for Five Surveys.

Here’s how it works: You buy stuff at the grocery store like you always do. Then you take a picture of your receipt with your phone. That’s it! You get points for each receipt you scan. I use this app for all of my grocery receipts and I like how easy it is to use – you don’t have to do anything crazy to earn points or even clip coupons. When you have enough points, you can trade them for gift cards. You can get Old Navy gift cards, plus cards for lots of other stores. You can sign up for Fetch Rewards by clicking here. Recommended reading: Fetch Rewards Review 5. Ibotta Ibotta is a cool app that can help you get free Old Navy gift cards. It’s easy to use and can save you money on things you already buy. Here’s how it works. You download the Ibotta app on your phone. Then you look for offers on stuff you want to buy at the grocery store. It’s a lot like the Fetch Rewards app, but you have to choose what you want to buy. It is a little more work than Fetch Rewards, but you are able to earn more points, which is nice. I typically use the same receipt in both apps. After you shop, you take a picture of your receipt. Ibotta checks it and gives you cash back. When you earn $20, you can get it as a gift card. You can sign up for Ibotta by clicking here. 6. PrizeRebel PrizeRebel is a website where you can earn free gift cards, including ones for Old Navy. It’s easy to use and free to join. You just need to sign up for an account to get started. Once you’re logged in, you can do different tasks to earn points. These include taking surveys, watching videos, and signing up for offers. Each task gives you a certain number of points. When you’ve collected enough points, you can trade them for gift cards. Old Navy is one of the many options available and you can get a $10 Old Navy gift card for 1000 points. You can also choose other stores or even get cash through PayPal. PrizeRebel works with big market research companies so this means you’ll have lots of surveys to choose from. The more surveys you do, the more points you can earn. Sign up for PrizeRebel by clicking here. Here’s a screenshot of the free Old Navy gift card I received from Capital One Shopping. 7. Capital One Shopping I have used my Capital One Shopping points on an Old Navy gift card, and it was very easy to do! Capital One Shopping is a free tool that can help you save money when you shop online. It’s easy to use and works with many popular web browsers. When you shop, Capital One Shopping looks for better prices and coupon codes. It does this without you having to do anything extra. The tool just runs in the background while you browse. You can earn rewards points when you buy things from certain stores, and these points can be turned into gift cards for places you like to shop. 8. Old Navy Super Cash program Old Navy Super Cash is a great way to save money on your shopping. It’s a rewards program that gives you coupons to use on future purchases. Here’s how it works: When you shop at Old Navy during certain times, you can earn Super Cash. The amount you get depends on how much you spend. For example, if you spend $25 to $49.99, you might get $10 in Super Cash. If you spend $50 to $74.99, you could earn $20 in Super Cash. You can use your Super Cash during set redemption periods. These are usually a few weeks after you earn it. During this time, you can use your coupons to save money on your next Old Navy purchase. Remember, Super Cash has an expiration date, so you’ll want to make sure to use it before it expires. Super Cash works both in stores and online, so you can save money no matter how you like to shop.
