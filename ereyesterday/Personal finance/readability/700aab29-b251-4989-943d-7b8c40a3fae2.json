But there’s a way to speed up the process if you’re up for it – and it’s what I did so that I could pay off my $40,000 in student loans in just 7 months…. Do you want to pay off your student loans faster? Paying off student loans can feel like a big challenge. But there’s a way to speed up the process if you’re up for it – and it’s what I did so that I could pay off my $40,000 in student loans in just 7 months. And, that is starting a side hustle! Starting a side job can give you extra money to put toward your loans. You can use your free time to make more money and pay off your student debt faster. With some hard work, you can say goodbye to your student debt more quickly than you thought possible. How I paid off my student loans in 7 months with side hustles The reason I’m writing this article is because I personally paid off my student loans very quickly, mainly due to side hustles. And thanks to that, I saw a ton of benefits, like financial freedom and no longer having a big monthly debt hanging over my head. Paying off $40,000 in student loans in just 7 months might sound impossible, but it’s not! Here’s how I did it: First, I made a clear plan. I wrote down my total debt and broke it into smaller goals. This helped me stay focused. Next, I cut my expenses. I got roommates, cooked at home, and avoided unnecessary shopping (I didn’t really have any time to spend money anyways, because I was using pretty much every spare minute on side jobs). Every dollar saved went to my loans. The real game-changer was side hustles. I tried everything (you can see a full list at I’ve Done Over 20 Side Hustles in My Life: Here’s What I Think of Each): Starting a blog Reselling items on eBay and Craigslist Mystery shopping Taking online surveys Focus groups Writing for other websites Taking on roommates Virtual assisting Freelance social media management And more. I put all my extra earnings directly toward my student loan debt. Right as the income came in, I would immediately apply it toward my debt. This way, I wasn’t tempted to spend the money on other things. I also looked for ways to lower my interest rates. By setting up automatic payments, I got a small rate reduction. It wasn’t much, but every bit helped! The key was staying motivated. I reminded myself of the freedom I’d have once the loans were gone. It wasn’t easy, but the feeling of making that final payment was amazing! Remember, you can do this too. Start small, be creative with making extra money, and stay committed to your goal. Before you know it, you’ll be celebrating your own debt-free day! Why you should start a side hustle if you have student loans If you’re serious about paying off your student loans faster, starting a side hustle can be a game-changer. It’s a flexible way to earn extra income, reduce your debt, and even save on interest payments. Plus, the skills you gain can open up new opportunities for your career or personal growth. Extra income to pay off loans A side hustle gives you more money to put toward your student loans. This extra cash can make a big difference in paying down your debt. Here are some popular side hustle ideas: Freelance writing Dog walking Online tutoring Selling items on eBay Virtual assistant work Even a few hours a week can add up. Put all your side hustle earnings toward your loans to see faster progress. Less interest Paying off your loans faster means you’ll pay less interest over time. This can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Let’s look at an example: Say you have a $30,000 loan with 6% interest over 10 years. Your monthly payment would be about $333. If you added an extra $100 per month from a side hustle, you’d pay off the loan 3 years earlier and save over $3,000 in interest! More financial freedom A side hustle can give you more control over your money. You won’t feel as stressed about your monthly loan payments. You might even have some cash left over for savings or fun activities. Having extra income can also help you: Build an emergency fund Start investing for the future Travel or pursue hobbies This added freedom can make it easier to stick to your loan repayment plan. You’ll feel more motivated when you see the progress you’re making. Building skills Side hustles aren’t just about money. They’re also a chance to learn new skills. These skills can help you in your main job or future career moves. You might realize that you have a passion that turns into a full-time business. For example, if you start a blog to make extra cash, you’ll learn about: Writing Web design Social media marketing Search engine optimization (SEO) These skills are valuable in many jobs. They can make you stand out to employers or help you start your own business later on. For me, I started my blog to talk about my personal finance situation and my student loans. I never thought that it would become my full-time career, and it now is! I have learned so much over the years and my life has changed so much ever since I paid off my student loans. Choosing the Right Side Hustle Picking a side job that fits you is key to making extra money for student loans. A good side hustle matches what you like and your free time. 1. Match your interests Look at what you enjoy doing. Are you good with computers? Try an online freelance gig like graphic design, virtual assisting, or freelance writing. Do you love pets? Dog walking could be fun and make money. Think about your skills too. Can you write well? Blogging might work for you. Are you creative? Selling crafts could be a great option. When you pick something you like, you’re more likely to stick with it. This means more money to pay off those loans faster. 2. Think about the time commitment Figure out how much time you can give to a side job. If you’re busy with school, look for quick tasks. For more free time, you may want to try bigger projects. Starting a blog takes work but could pay off later. Tutoring or freelance work might need set hours each week. Managing Time Effectively Juggling a side hustle with your regular job takes skill. You’ll need to plan carefully and set clear goals to make the most of your time. For me, when I decided to pay off my student loans as quickly as possible, I was working a full-time job as an analyst and I started side hustling anywhere from 20-30+ hours a week on top of that. I was BUSY! Balancing work and hustle Start by looking at your weekly schedule. Find pockets of free time you can use for your side gig. Maybe you can wake up an hour earlier or work on weekends. Use a planner or app to keep track of your tasks and deadlines. Try batching similar tasks together. This can help you stay focused and get more done. For example, set aside one evening to answer emails and make phone calls. Take breaks to avoid burnout. Even short 5-minute breaks can help you recharge. Remember to eat well and get enough sleep too. Setting goals When I first started my journey to pay off my student loans, setting clear goals was one of the most important steps I took. I didn’t just hope to pay off my loans – I set concrete, specific goals that gave me something to work toward every single day. I broke my total loan amount into smaller, more manageable chunks, and then I made weekly and monthly goals to keep myself on track. For example, I knew I wanted to pay off $40,000 in less than one year, so I calculated how much extra I needed to earn and save each month to hit that target. Seeing my progress on paper kept me motivated, and each time I hit a smaller goal, it gave me the energy to keep going. I also adjusted my goals along the way – if I had a slower month, I didn’t give up, I just reassessed and kept pushing forward. This made the huge task of paying off my loans feel possible. Here are my tips: Write down what you want to achieve with your side hustle and be specific about how much money you want to make and by when. Break big goals into smaller, weekly targets. Use the SMART method: Make your goals Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This helps you stay on track and see your progress. Keep your goals visible. Put them on your desk or phone wallpaper and review them often to stay motivated. Celebrate small wins along the way – they add up! Adjust your goals as needed. If you’re falling behind, don’t give up. Figure out why and make changes to your plan. Side Hustle Ideas You Can Start Looking to make extra cash?
