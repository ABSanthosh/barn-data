Looking for ways to simplify and improve your daily routine? Life can feel super busy, and I know how overwhelming it can be to juggle everything. Between working, spending time with family, managing everyday tasks, and more, I’ve had to find ways to make my days easier – without feeling like I’m constantly playing catch-up. Simplifying your routine doesn’t just save you time – it can also help you save (and even make) more money. See, when your days are more organized, you’re less likely to waste money on last-minute decisions, impulse buys, or missed opportunities. Whether it’s meal planning to cut grocery costs, automating bills to avoid late fees, or setting a schedule to stay productive, small changes can have a big impact on your life. Recommended reading: 18 Ideas To Simplify Your Life Best Ways To Simplify and Improve Your Daily Routine Below are 15 simple habits that will help you feel more organized, productive, and financially prepared – so you can spend less time stressing and more time enjoying life. 1. Wake up at the same time each day Getting up at the same time every day can make your life easier. It helps your body know when to sleep and when to wake up. This can make you feel more awake and ready for the day. Try to pick a time that works for you, even on weekends. It might be hard at first, but your body will get used to it. You’ll start to feel sleepy at the right time each night. Waking up at the same time can help you sleep better too because you might find it easier to fall asleep at night. This can make you feel more rested when you wake up. 2. Prepare your clothes the night before Picking out your outfit before bed can make your mornings easier because you won’t have to rush around trying to find something to wear when you’re trying to do a million other things. I recommend that you take a few minutes each night to choose your clothes for the next day. I usually set my clothes on my dresser the night before and this makes it easy and quick, especially when I’m trying to get my daughter ready for the day at the same time too. 3. Limit screen time in the morning So many people wake up and scroll on their phone right away. While I know that it can be relaxing for some, it can also just be a time-wasting habit. Starting your day with less screen time can set a positive tone for the rest of your day. You may want to try keeping your phone away from your bed at night as this makes it harder to grab first thing in the morning. If you need to use your phone as an alarm, put it across the room. This forces you to get out of bed to turn it off. Once you’re up, resist the urge to start scrolling. You can set a specific time to start using screens, like after you’ve gotten ready for work. This creates a clear boundary between your morning routine and screen time. 4. Create a meal plan for the week The first thing I do at the beginning of each week is that I make a meal plan for the whole week. Breakfasts and lunches are usually fairly similar each day (this has helped to simplify my routine too!), so I’m really only planning out my dinners and putting thought into that. Making a meal plan for the week can save you time and money because it helps you avoid last-minute food decisions and reduces stress about what to eat. If you’re anything like the average household, then deciding what to eat can be tiring! I like to sit down with my husband and quickly go over what we both want to eat. It only takes a few minutes of brainstorming. You can start by looking at your schedule for the week and think about which nights you’ll have time to cook and which nights you might need quick meals. For us, we really like to do simple slow cooker meals or one pot dishes during the week because the week is so busy with work and my daughter going to school (when she gets home, we just want to play and eat, not spend so much time cooking!). Then, we like to save the meals that take a long time for the weekend. But, you should do whatever is best for you – this is just a part of our routine. For example, a sample weekly meal plan for us may look like: Monday: Chili (I like to have this cook all day long in the slow cooker!) Tuesday: Tacos Wednesday: Pot roast (made in the slow cooker) Thursday: Asian stir fry Friday: Pizza and poppers Saturday: Steak, corn on the cob, salad Sunday: Pasta and a homemade loaf of garlic bread We also like to use leftovers for lunches or remake them into new dishes. For example, extra chicken from Monday can become chicken salad on Tuesday. You can get a free weekly meal plan printable here. 5. Write a to-do list every night Making a to-do list before bed can help you start the next day with a clear plan. This simple habit takes just a few minutes but can make a big difference in your daily routine. Grab a notepad or use your phone (I like to use the notepad on my cell phone as well as my phone calendar) to write down tasks for tomorrow. Include both big and small things you need to do such as work tasks, errands, or even personal goals. By writing things down, you free up mental space. You won’t have to worry about forgetting important tasks, so this can help you sleep better and feel more relaxed. In the morning, you’ll have a ready-made plan to follow. This can help you feel more organized and in control of your day. You can start working on your tasks right away instead of wondering what to do first. This is something that I do every day, and I find that it really helps me to save time! 6. Set specific times for checking emails Checking your emails all day long can eat up a lot of time (and I know this for a fact because I am constantly procrastinating doing anything productive by refreshing my email inbox because I really am obsessed with “inbox zero”). But, it’s like a never-ending task that keeps you from getting other important stuff done. I am extremely guilty of this and it is an area that I really need to work on. So, you can try setting aside certain times to look at your emails instead. You could check them once in the morning, once after lunch, and once before you finish work. This way, you won’t feel the need to look at your inbox every five minutes. You’ll be able to focus on other tasks without worrying about missing something important. 7. Keep a water bottle handy Staying hydrated is super important for your health, but it’s easy to forget to drink enough water during a busy day. That’s why keeping a water bottle with you can be a game-changer. You can just get a reusable water bottle you like (there are a ton on Amazon here, for example). Pick one that’s the right size for you. Fill it up in the morning and carry it around all day. Make drinking water a habit. Try to finish your bottle by lunchtime. Then fill it up again for the afternoon. You’ll be amazed at how much more water you drink. 8. Use a timer for tasks Using a timer for tasks can make your daily routine simpler and more productive. It’s a great way to stay focused and get things done faster. For example, you can pick a task you need to do and set a timer for 25 minutes. Work on that task until the timer goes off. This method is called the Pomodoro Technique. During those 25 minutes, try not to get distracted. Don’t check your phone or social media and just focus on the task at hand. When the timer rings, take a short break. Stretch, grab a snack, or walk around for 5 minutes. Then, set the timer again and start your next task or continue the same one. Using a timer can help you avoid spending too much time on one task. It keeps you moving and makes your day more efficient. You can even try using a timer for household chores too. Set it for 15 minutes and see how much cleaning you can get done. You might be surprised! Here’s a simple timer on Amazon that you can use for this. 9. Prepare a simple breakfast Starting your day with a quick and easy breakfast can save time and energy. Here are some ideas: Try making overnight oats the night before. Just mix oats, milk, and your favorite toppings in a jar, and let it sit in the fridge. Hard-boiled eggs are another great choice. Cook a batch on Sunday to enjoy throughout the week. Pair them with fruit or whole-grain toast for a meal. Smoothies are fast and nutritious. Blend frozen fruits, yogurt, and milk for a tasty drink. Keep healthy grab-and-go items handy. Stock up on granola bars, fruit, or individual yogurt cups for busy mornings. Remember, a simple breakfast doesn’t have to be boring. Rotate your options to keep things interesting and look forward to your morning meal. 10. Make your bed right away One of the first things I like to do each morning is make the bed. I wasn’t always this way (in fact, I used to be “never make my bed”), but it’s something that I feel sets the day and is great for my daily morning routine. It doesn’t take long either, so why not just do it? Starting your day by making your bed can set a positive tone, and I feel that it’s really nice to see, especially since I work from home. Seeing a messy bed all day long when I’m at home for a lot of the day is just simply not enjoyable for me. 11. Limit social media use If you’re feeling brave, you should check your app usage on your cell phone to see how much time you spend on social media each day. You may be surprised, and many people spend over 3-4 hours a day just scrolling on their phone! Social media can eat up a lot of your time if you’re not careful. Try setting a daily time limit for how long you spend on apps like Facebook or Instagram. You might start with 30 minutes a day and see how that feels. One easy way to cut back is to turn off push notifications. This stops your phone from buzzing every time someone likes your post. You’ll be less tempted to check your apps all the time. I have had this turned off for years and I don’t miss it one bit. Another tip is to delete social media apps from your phone. You can still use them on your laptop if you need to, but this makes it harder to scroll mindlessly when you’re bored because you don’t have social media available on all of your devices.

You won’t have to rush around looking for things when you’re trying to leave. For example, this can be your car keys, wallet, a badge for work, sunglasses, an umbrella, gloves, hat, or whatever else you need. By doing this, you’ll save time and stress each day. You’ll know exactly where your important stuff is when you need it. 13. Batch similar tasks together Grouping like tasks can make your day smoother. Instead of jumping between different activities, do similar things at once. For example: Answer all your emails in one go. This helps you focus better and saves time switching between tasks. You can also batch errands. Plan to do all your shopping in one trip instead of going out multiple times. This cuts down on travel time and stress. At work, try to schedule meetings back-to-back. This leaves larger chunks of uninterrupted time for other important tasks. Batching household chores works too. Do all your laundry in one day. Clean the whole house at once instead of tidying up a little each day. Even small tasks can be batched. Pay all your bills at the same time each month. Make several phone calls in a row. By grouping similar tasks, you’ll feel more organized. You’ll also save mental energy and get more done in less time. I batch similar tasks together for pretty much everything, and I find that it helps me to save a lot of time and be more efficient. 14. Set a consistent bedtime Going to bed at the same time every night can help you sleep better. Pick a bedtime that lets you get enough sleep, and aim for 7-9 hours each night. I know that this may be hard for some, but you may also want to stick to your chosen bedtime even on the weekends. This helps your body get into a rhythm. You might feel sleepy at the right time and wake up more easily. 15. Automate bill payments I have automated all of my bill payments. Yes, I still check them to make sure everything looks correct, but I don’t have to manually go in and pay each bill. Setting up automatic bill payments can make your life easier because you won’t have to remember due dates or spend time paying each bill separately. This habit can help you avoid late fees and keep your credit score healthy. Many companies offer auto-pay options and even give you a discount for doing so. Before you start, make sure you have enough money in your account to cover the bills. It’s a good idea to keep a buffer in your checking account just in case. Automating your bill payments can free up time and mental energy. You can use this extra time to focus on other parts of your life or financial goals. It’s an easy change that can make a big difference in your daily routine. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about how to improve your daily routine. How do I simplify my daily schedule? Start by waking up at the same time each day. This helps set a consistent rhythm for your body.

Some daily practices that can help you feel better include getting outside for fresh air every day, even if it’s just for 5 minutes, or getting in a quick workout.
