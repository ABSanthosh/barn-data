In this episode, Tony and I are going to break down the latest features that our favorite email marketing tool just announced that looked to be a game changer for e-commerce. Here’s the latest and greatest in the world of online selling. But before we begin, I wanted to let you know that tickets are now on sale for Seller Summit 2025 over at sellersummit.com. And the prices are now going to go up every two weeks.00:29 until the event starts. The Seller Summit is the conference that I hold every year that specifically targets e-commerce entrepreneurs selling physical products online. Unlike other events that focus on inspirational stories and high-level advice, mine is a curriculum-based conference where you will leave with practical and actionable strategies specifically for an e-commerce business. Every speaker I invite is deep in the trenches of their e-commerce business, entrepreneurs who are importing large quantities of physical goods00:57 and not some high-level guys who are overseeing their companies at 50,000 feet. I personally hate large events, so the seller’s summit is always small and intimate. Every year we cut off ticket sales at around 200 people, so tickets sell out fast, and we’ve sold out every single year for the past eight years. If you are an e-commerce entrepreneur making more than $250,000 or $1 million per year, we also offer an exclusive mastermind experience with other top sellers.01:25 The Seller Summit is going to be held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida from May 6th to May 8th. Right now, this is the cheapest the tickets will ever be. So head on over to sellersummit.com and grab your ticket. Now onto the show.01:44 Welcome back to the My Wife Quitter Job podcast. Last week, Tony and I, had the privilege of attending Klaviyo’s launch event for their new features. And normally we don’t create podcasts about this stuff, but I was blown away by all the new functionality that Klaviyo had to introduce. So I felt compelled that we had to do an episode about this. Yeah, it’s, it’s pretty exciting. I have to say I was, I actually watched it twice. So02:13 because there was so much to digest just watching it one go round. Yeah, I watched it this morning also and I had Chachi BT take the transcript and summarize it so I wouldn’t forget anything. what are these new features and why is it such a big deal? Klaviyo just introduced their CRM. I think it’s called Klaviyo Data Platform.02:38 And it’s basically going to be like the one tool that you absolutely need to practically do everything with your online store. Yeah. And that’s the best way to put it. Yeah. And I think, I think this is a big, like this is a big deal, right? Because one of the things that they hammered pretty hard during all the presentations, but one thing that I was like, as a struggle for me in e-commerce is that03:05 you have all this information coming from all these different places. And it’s very hard to get all the information to match up. And they told a story about one of their customers who hired somebody and paid them a lot of money to build like some sort of custom dashboard so that they could like aggregate the data. And after they got it built, it just didn’t do the job well, right? didn’t work right.03:30 And I thought, and this is something we deal with, you know, with some of my e-commerce clients every single day, right? Is all the data is in different places and it’s hard to get. you know, we’re paying people to do this, right? To compile it and get it in one place. And so this is really exciting, I think, for business owners, especially if you are running a small team and you don’t have lots of people to pass these tasks off to. Yeah. For example, like in my store, I have03:58 these little dashboards for a bunch of different things that Jen wants to see. And the data is there, but it’d be nice to just have everything in one place. And we’re be talking about how they allow you to interact with that data. So first and foremost, unlimited data storage. Klaviyo will have all the data for your store, access to your Shopify database, all your customers and everything. Yeah, and I mean, think the other thing to think about is that already Klaviyo integrates with04:27 so many tools, right? So they already have a lot of these integrations built in, which is nice because I think, I don’t think I’ve ever come across something where I couldn’t integrate it with Klaviyo, like a tool that I wanted to use in Shopify. So the fact that they have all that integration already and then sort of building this out is pretty exciting. So they have data for all of your customers, which pages that they’ve browsed, what they’ve purchased, the frequency that they’ve purchased. And because all that data is there,04:56 That’s where it gets really exciting. I don’t know where you want to start with this. mean, there’s a lot of new features that they announced. I think the one that I’m most excited about is the AI forecast. So remember, they have data for everything, right? So they know what the customer is most likely to buy next. They know the lifetime value. They know how to communicate, how they like to communicate with you, whether it be through email, SMS or push.05:26 And so now with these new AI features that Klaviyo has introduced, they can automatically suggest the best action for a specific customer based on their historical data and automatically create segments for you to send emails or SMS to them. So this is very exciting because one of the things that Klaviyo already has and they’ve had for a while is05:53 AI within segment creation where you say, want a list of people who do X, Y, Z, right? And they build that out for you. But this takes this to like an entirely other level. And the exciting part for me is I’ve worked in that, you know, their AI tools already. And I feel like especially when it comes to building out these segments and lists of people, it does a really good job. Like the data they give you back, the way they tell you to do things is06:21 almost always correct. There’s very few times where I’m like, oh, that wasn’t exactly what I wanted. And if it is, it’s because I put it in wrong, right? I asked for the wrong thing. So I’m very excited to see the level that this will go, basically, as far as what AI is going to do. Because just the fact that they were showing some of the flows or how the customer journey pans out. it’s like, the AI doesn’t just stop at, create me a segment of people who’ve done X, Y, Z. It’s like,06:51 after they receive the first email, then AI is gonna say, send an email only to people who’ve taken these three actions and include this information in the email based on the actions they’ve taken, which, I mean, it’s gonna put me out of a job. I wanna see how, what level this goes because I was thinking, hey, create me a segment of everyone who’s most likely to purchase a personalized apron, like in the next month. Yeah.07:18 and it’ll automatically create a segment. Prior to that, you’d have to know exactly what you’re looking for, right? Bought an before, haven’t bought in six months or whatever. But this one, based on all the data points, right? Let’s say they were looking, they just happen to be browsing on your site for aprons in like two weeks ago, they would automatically be added to this segment. Yeah, so I think that’s really exciting and something that’s going to save people a lot of time.07:46 The other thing that I think it’s going to do is give people better results with their email. So, I mean, we can say right now, hey, let’s create a segment of people that are most likely to do X, Y, Z, right, based on information that we have. So, for example, one of my clients, most of her products are based out in age groups, right? So there’s like five to eight year olds08:15 group because it’s curriculum, right? And then there’s a nine to 12 and a 13 to 16, right? So but, you know, if someone buys something in the middle age group, right, the nine to 12, we don’t know exactly like, is there a kid nine or is there a kid 12? Right. Like, we don’t know that because we don’t don’t ask. And obviously, it’s hard to ask information about people’s kids like that. People get very rightfully How old is your little boy? Yes. Rightfully so. People get.08:43 protective of that information. Knowing that, on average, when you look at the data as a whole, we’ve got millions of customers, right? You look at the data as a whole and you know that people who buy in this age bracket, on average, in two years, buy in the next age bracket. Or they take this and you start being able to have this lots and lots of data when Klaviyo can take that and really give it to you in a very digestible09:12 way as opposed to you. I mean, I just think about like, have you ever like downloaded something on a spreadsheet and it’s like 22,000 lines of information and it’s just like my computer just like farts out on it. It’s like, no, we’re not doing this. So like the thing that’s exciting to me is to be able to get all that data and have Klaviyo be the one that deals with it as opposed to me on a spreadsheet trying to like figure this all out and spending hours and hours. No, exactly. Like09:41 I personally hate creating segments by hand in Clayview. Just the fact that you can have AI create the segment for you based on what you want. Huge game changer. I can’t wait to see how well this works. And I think the fact that it’s going to be able to deliver smarter recommendations. mean, their recommendation tool that you can just insert that in the bottom of emails, or it doesn’t have be at the bottom, you can insert it anywhere. It already does a pretty good job. So to be able to get even more granular with the information, especially if you are in a10:11 a vertical like clothing, right? If there’s a shopper and they only buy pastels, they’re never going to see a pair of camo green leggings, right? Or if you sell, like think about our friend Tiffany, right? She sells shoes, pants, purses, whatever. One of the things that they pointed out, like people who buy this thing are way more likely to buy a purse, right? And they know that because they have10:39 let’s just say 20,000 people who have bought pants and of those 20,000 people, know, 32 % of them also buy a purse. So it’s clearly like there’s a customer type. So instead of you trying to like parse through and go, okay, I wonder what maybe this happens, you know, it’s already going to just be given to you. And not only that, all in an automated form. like, it’s like, Klaviyo is basically going to say, hey, people that buy these pants also buy purses. So send them an email. Oh, click here and it’ll be set up for you basically, which11:09 When I was looking at their slides or their screen grabs of it, I was like, if this works like it looks like it does, this is incredible. I agree. I think that was the single most important feature. But let’s move on because once you know what segments that you want to email to, they actually introduce another feature that I’m really looking forward to, which is their new campaign builder. Yes.11:36 And you have to remember now that Klaviyo does SMS, email, push, and if you just happen to have an app, they do in-app messaging as well. in the past, and I don’t know how many people listening actually use Klaviyo, but if you use a traditional EMS, you usually get like an autoresponder, right? Where you can send a sequence of emails. And within Klaviyo already in the past, you could send autoresponder sequence.12:03 where you could take people off or put people on based on certain criteria or the actions that they’ve created. So for example, like if you had this flow, like an abandoned cart flow, for example, that was three emails. If someone purchased after the first email, you would not send them the abandoned cart email for a second, third. That’s already been there. Now you can do something like that with just regular campaigns. Yes. And I’m just trying to, why don’t you talk about like some of the use cases for that?12:32 That’s what I think is really nice. I think we’ve bugged our friend Joe at Klaviyo for many years. One of the features that Klaviyo never had was the recent unopens. You had to do that all manually, which is actually a bit of a pain. They just recently launched that within their campaigns, pretty normal standard stuff. Now with this campaign, it’s basically like a flow, but it’s a campaign.12:59 you send out an email, let’s just say you’re having a, I don’t know, Mother’s Day sale, Mother’s Day is in a couple months, and you’re gonna send it out a week before Mother’s Day or two weeks before Mother’s Day, whatever your timeline is, but then you wanna resend to unopens. But do you really wanna resend to all your unopens? Probably not, because typically, if you resend to all of your unopens, some of those people just don’t really open a lot of the emails anyway, so immediately that email’s gonna perform a little less than,13:28 you know, you’d like it to. So what you can do is resend it to people who’ve done like specific behaviors, right? So it’s not just unopens. It could be resend to people who didn’t open it, but they visited the site within 30 days. They have already purchased $500 or more from my store. Like you can put all these conditions in it in this basically automated flow. And also, Klaviyo has this little thing called the Action Center.13:58 where it gives you the recommendation of the best practice. So based on all of their data and all the brands and everything else, they’ll tell you like, I might think, well, oh, I should send it to these people. Well, Klavia is gonna say, hey, based on all the data from your store and all the data from stores in your vertical, like all their whole data set that they have and go, this is actually what you should do. This is who you should send it to.14:21 which to me is a game changer because one, it takes the guesswork out of it for us as far as like, we can test it, right? We can see what happens, blah, blah, blah. But also like, just tell me what to do. If you know what works, I’ll do it. I was thinking for me, particularly, we typically run three day sales or three or four day sales and we email multiple times during that period.14:47 So it would be nice instead of sending like three or four separate emails out about that sale, you have it in this nice campaign builder where you can automatically exclude people. Yes. Right. Who’ve purchased or for example, if someone hasn’t responded or opened an email, maybe send them a text instead. Yes. And that was nice too. Like you can set up, if you do use Klaviyo for SMS, you can basically, you know, email these people based on that, text these people based on that.15:16 email these people, right? So it creates this whole chain of events that, which I think the other thing that’s nice about that is consistency of messaging, right? So being able to know that the people that are getting the text have already received an email that says this. So I’m gonna text them and say something different, or I’m gonna piggyback on what they already got. And I think being able to sort of be very cohesive with the messaging is actually really important.15:46 I actually think most brands don’t focus on this enough, but just that consistency with the messaging and the things that you say, especially during a promotion or a launch or anything like that, is actually really valuable. And to be able to have that all like now in a sequence is a really nice feature. I mean, I was just thinking for me, just organizing all the campaigns. Like right now I have campaigns that say first day,16:11 middle of the promotion, last day of the promotion. Yes, I like AM, 2 PM, 6 PM, last day, last. Yes. The problem with me is, and this is my own fault, but I try to name things consistently. Last day of the sale, it should be the date, whatever the sale is, last chance AM, then whatever for PM. Sometimes I change the verbiage just.16:38 because I’m human and I’m not thinking at the time, right? So then it’s like, you know, I changed something. So then when you go in and look for something to clone or recreate, it’s like, wait, that’s not last chance. It’s LC, because for some reason I decided to abbreviate this week. so just the consistency of it, I think is gonna be really nice. Yeah, I mean, I ideally just wanna be able to clone my entire sales sequence and set it and forget it instead of, again, having to draft four five different emails.17:06 I think the nice thing about that little action center that they’ve created is that when they give you a recommendation, you basically just click it and it sets it up for you. It’s like, we think you should send a campaign to people who like pink leggings or whatever it is. You’re like, do too. Click and it basically builds you this template. For people who are not big on using the17:32 the coding and things like that in Klavia, which they do make it pretty easy to just drop and insert things. There’s still some, you know, technical degree there. It’s already embedded in those emails. So all you’re doing is going in and tweaking it. Right. They already have your brand logo. They’ve already got your templates. So basically, when you say, yes, do this, it’s creating everything for you. And there’s very little work that you need to be doing after that step. Yeah. So this next feature.18:02 that they introduced is actually something that I was in the middle of writing for my store, which is a self-service and support hub. So, Klavia is actually now going to do customer service for you. You know that right now, a lot of stores are my friends, they’re using a separate app for customer support. But you know, Klavia already knows all your orders, right? They know who’s buying and all that stuff. They have all the information. They have addresses and whatnot.18:31 So why not manage order tracking and returns management? Why not have like an AI chat bot to answer the most commonly asked questions? Why not have like a live chat if AI can’t answer the question, hand it off to a real human? They’ve added all of that.18:50 I just wanted to take a moment to tell you about a free resource that I offer on my website that you may not be aware of. If you are interested in starting your own online store, I put together a comprehensive six day mini course on how to get started in ecommerce that you should all check out. It contains both video and text based tutorials that go over the entire process of finding products to sell all the way to getting your first sales online. Now this course is free and can be obtained at mywifequitterjob.com slash free.19:19 just sign up right there on the front page via email and I’ll send you the course right away. Once again, that’s mywifequitterjob.com slash free. Now back to the show.19:31 I feel like this could be an entire podcast on its own is that customer support should be a sales channel for your business. Most people view it as a rescue boat. Rescue the lost order, rescue the person who can’t figure out how to place an order on the website, whatever it is. It really should be its own sales channel. think because once someone… Obviously, there’s a lot of people who message support who have like,20:00 literally probably the top one is where’s my order, right? Which can be pretty much answered with AI, probably 95 % of the time. But then there are people, like I would think for your business with the personalization, like people probably have questions about that, right? People wanna know like, what actually can I personalize or how, know, what kind of thread do you use or you know, whatever the questions would be, is it gonna get here in time, things like that.20:27 But what an opportunity to give people a great customer experience there and then upsell them on other things, right? So the next thing you know, they’re not just buying the personalized handkerchief, they’ve also got the matching apron and pillowcase, right? That you just have an opportunity there. And to remove some of the friction as far as like, where’s my order, things like that, where that can all be done through AI, to then allow your customer service person or people to actually do bigger work.20:57 I think is going to be a game changer for companies. Here’s the thing about our customer service. If we can get someone communicating with our customer service rep, it’s almost 90 % of conversion. Yeah. Like we can always sell them something. Yeah. So it’s in your best interest to actually have that conversation with somebody. I still think phone conversations are the best, but chat is like the second best. And this actually, seeing this feature actually reminded me, I had this really elaborate21:26 a Facebook Messenger platform where I was actually semi-automating customer service. But Facebook deprecated that a long time ago and it was on my list to add another live chat, but I actually hadn’t done it before. Hence, I was going to incorporate all these features into the site already. I was really looking forward to writing my own AI-powered chatbot also. I might just use Klaviyo’s now.21:51 Yeah, I mean. it’s already there and they have all the information. It looks really nice. The screenshots that they showed us, it was just really nicely integrated with the site already. It was almost like it was a part of the Shopify store, in fact. Yes. Right. So, yeah. Well, no, but I think the other thing that people probably don’t think about is that it looks really nice. looks like a seamless experience for the customer. But also, like, they go in, they ask, you know, where’s my order?22:20 I actually had this to me yesterday. I used the wrong credit card for something. I used an old credit card that actually had been canceled and I knew the order was gonna get declined. At some point it was a grocery order. So I was like, I need to get in here and fix it. So I got on with an AI chat bot. I got the answer that I needed. Basically it wasn’t the answer I wanted, but basically like we can’t do anything. have to cancel your order and reorder. And I’m like, fine. But got through the whole process. But I think about the fact that like, if it is all integrated in Klaviyo,22:49 and they have all of the customer information and with their AI features, they’re telling you stuff about the customer inside that as you know, as if you, you escalate it to the human, right? Then you have all this information about the customer. If you’re in another customer service platform that is not connected, you can still get that information about the customer, but you’ve got to log into Shopify or Klaviyo. You’ve got to pull the information.23:15 you can see like when you log into, if you pull up someone’s customer profile on Klaviyo, you know what emails they’ve received, what emails they’ve clicked on, what they’ve purchased. And now that’s all going, what it looks like it’s all going to be within that customer service platform. Like what an advantage to when someone actually gets to a human to have all that data. And you’re like, oh, this person always buys like embroidered pillowcases. We should probably show them this new line as we’re talking to them. You know what I mean? Like it’s all just given to the people that are working23:44 which I think is gonna be a great sales channel for companies. Yeah, I mean, right now the way we do it is we have another tool that handles all that, right? Right. But why not just have it in one place? Yeah. And not have to open some other tool in order to get the same information. And then expect your customer service person, which typically in most stores is like a lower paid employee. It’s not a sales person for sure.24:11 But then you’re just handing that person all this data that they can use. They’re not having to go find it or dig it out or understand. It all appears to be in the platform already when they’re talking to them. I mean, this is how I see it being used also. When we get a phone call, she can just pull up this information in Klaviyo. And maybe Klaviyo can say, hey, this person is very likely to order another handkerchief. And then she could just make that suggestion on the fly.24:40 Klaviyo has all the data once again. And as you don’t like humans having to think about things, so this is like a huge. Oh yeah, definitely. The other cool feature that I saw when they were showing the screenshots was it appeared like after you went through customer support, they had like a little survey at the end where it was like, and this was, they were doing a clothing store as their example. And it was like, which of these,25:07 is your favorite color for leggings, right? And then they showed the example and the person put like pink or whatever. And then it was like, they asked another question based on the favorite color. There were like three real simple, like multiple choice questions. But then based on their responses, it created profile properties for that person in Klaviyo and then suggested the emails that they get that like, you know, so one person, you’re sending the same email to 500 people.25:35 But one person’s getting the pink leggings and one person’s getting the black leggings based on the profile. And it’s basically all automated. Yeah. Yeah. You know, one, uh, the other day a student asked me how to get Google analytics set up and get all the granular data. And what I told her was like, I can show you how to set all that up. But to be honest with you, I rarely look at Google analytics at all anymore, ever since they made the shift because it’s26:03 It’s like not intuitive and it’s not easy to use. No, I can’t find anything in there. I hate it. But now with all these new Klaviyo features, and they showed a screenshot of this, but now you can get like a comprehensive customer timeline. One of Google’s restrictions is they couldn’t use real names due to privacy reasons. But on Klaviyo, like let’s say I want to pull you up. I can see every email open, every SMS click, every purchase, every website visit, every return.26:32 every shipment, where the shipment is in transit. It’s just a much nicer way to track things than like a Google Analytics. Well, and I think that’s what they called it, what the unified customer view. Yeah. And basically, and I would assume that you would have to be using Klaviyo SMS to get this fully. Of course. Well, unless it integrates, like I said, Klaviyo integrates with pretty much every other tool since it’s pretty much become the standard.27:00 Yeah. So you could probably get click data if you’re on like Postscript, for example. But I think being able to see and they showed a graph of like a customer timeline and basically, you know, I forget what they call them, like the champions were like the top customers and, you know, then they had like names for each level of customer. But being able to see all that information and like, are they more likely to open a text and email? Like, what are they doing? What are they interacting the best with? And then once again,27:29 making those like take action recommendations based on what people are doing. I think that’s probably my favorite feature is that Klaviyo basically tells you what to do. So instead of you sort of over analyzing and testing, and I think you should still be testing, obviously, but you’re not just like throwing stuff at a wall and seeing what sticks Klaviyo is actually taking the data and giving you really good ideas. Have you ever gone to the dentist and27:55 They go up to you and they say, hey Steve, how was your vacation three months ago? And you’re like, what, what? How did you know I went on a vacation? How’d you remember? Because I obviously told them that Oh yeah, because they put it in your little notes when they’re cleaning your teeth. Yes. Yes. Can you imagine now that if you’re on live chat with somebody and you already have the customer up, right? Right. Because I would imagine that as soon as someone does a live chat, it automatically brings up whatever their profile is. And you have notes on that person. Like our best customers, we have notes. Yes. know what they’re doing.28:24 And you can automatically say stuff like, how’s your kid? know, how’s high school? They just started high school. Yes. That makes a huge difference. Yeah. I think the the level of customer loyalty that you get from that. I it’s funny that you brought up the dentist because my favorite hygienist stopped working to be home with her kids. What a jerk. But like one of the reasons why I like to going is that like she we could like pick up.28:51 where we left off in our conversations, was kind of like, oh, well, how was this? And I know it’s all in their little dashboard, right, of notes. Like, oh, she, like, I think it was when Instacart came out. And so we had this whole conversation about Instacart one time. And the next time she’s like, I’m using Instacart, blah, blah, blah. And I was like, how do you remember that we had a conversation about Instacart? Anyway, made me super loyal to the dentist because it just, it felt good, right? It feels good to.29:17 have people remember you. How are you able to have conversations with your hygienist? Like she’s got the stuff in your mouth, right? It’s always a one-sided conversation. Oh, can stop me from talking. You know that.29:31 The other thing that’s nice is I’ve actually wanted to offload email marketing to someone outside of Jen. And I’m very curious about all the AI features in terms of what subject lines, what type of emails to create and whatnot. You mentioned earlier that it might put you out of a job. Yeah. That’s my best case scenario. Not to put you out of a job. that’s your best case because then you’ll have to hire me.30:00 That’s not your best-case scenario. As I was watching this and thinking through everything, part of me was like, know what? I feel like this is where I don’t hate AI because we’ve had a lot of conversations about AI and people just creating entire websites and YouTube channels and just all AI-generated and even some of the dangers where they’re basically30:26 doing the deep fake stuff, right? Where it’s like, you can’t even tell. So I think AI can, it can be awful, right? It can be used for pretty negative things. And you and I just did a Google search like two weeks ago and Google gave us the wrong, AI gave us the wrong information about Google. Do you remember that? So. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So it’s like, there’s a lot of negative about AI, but I feel like when I watched this, I was like, okay, this is how AI really should be used, right? This is where I think it’s helpful and30:56 pushing forward and using technology to make things better for everybody. Because here’s the thing, it doesn’t just make things better for the company owner or the marketing person. It makes things better for the customer. We all get a million emails every day. If you’re on a bunch of SMS lists, you get tons of texts, marketing texts, things like that. But how awesome is it to get an email that actually makes sense to you? And it’s actually something you care about.31:26 I used this example at seller summit last year when I was doing the email talk. I bought a bunch of paint at Lowe’s and then Lowe’s sent me an ad for paint, an email about paint. And I was like, you should have sent me an ad for paint brushes, right? You should have sent me an ad. You know what I bought. I don’t need to buy more paint. I need to buy painter’s tape and all the things that go along with it. It was like a huge missed opportunity. So I think the better…31:51 AI gets of sending the customers things that they really like. Like, don’t send me an email with a dress that I’ll never buy. But if you know that I’ve looked at something and you’re sending me an email telling me that the price dropped or that it’s back in stock or that they have this color that I actually buy everything else in this color, my journey has gotten so much better when it comes to the whole buying experience. I think the most egregious error that I had a company make was when I bought a pair of shoes and they sent me emails about women’s clothing.32:21 Maybe they know something that I don’t. My personal pet peeve is when you buy something and the next day you get an email from that company with that exact product and it’s now 25 % off. I feel like with all of this AI integration, that can be avoided really easily.32:48 You can exclude people who purchase, I mean you can already do this, but I feel like this is gonna make it even more intuitive and it’s gonna be even easier. Excluding people who’ve already bought, excluding people who’ve bought that exact product in the last 48 hours. Don’t send a sale email to that. All those things where as a human, that can be, you can forget or it can slip or you can forget to add them. There’s like lots of opportunity for error. And I think this actually makes things so much better for everybody, right? The customer.33:18 the store, the marketing person. And I think also, don’t people want emails in their inbox that are relevant? I do. I don’t want a bunch of garbage. So I think it provides a much better experience for the shopper. Yeah. And one thing that I think Klaviyo is really trying to do is prevent people from just blasting their entire list. Yes. And so there’s one seller summit talk, I want to say33:47 a couple years ago, where they talked about how you have different segments of customers that are in different stages of the purchasing journey. So like you have people who will buy from you no matter what they buy in bulk and they buy a lot. Then you have customers that buy often, but they don’t spend that much money. Then of course you have people who bought like buy occasionally and then there’s people who haven’t purchased at all. And it’s important to understand who those people are because you’re going to want to send messages34:16 differently to those people. Like for example, for your best customers, I know it’s ironic that you’re punishing your best customers, but we don’t send out coupons to our best customers because we know they’re going to buy anyway. We reward them in other ways, like with loyalty points or something like that because a coupon is not going to, I mean, they’re to buy no matter what. Whereas someone who hasn’t bought at all, maybe you just want to give them a bigger coupon to get them to buy for the very first time.34:45 I’ve seen that that works, right? If you are talking differently to different types of customers, it really does make a huge difference in your return on investment, basically. I think another thing that was important that they talked about, and fortunately, it doesn’t apply to you or me, but I know what applies to a lot of companies is they also have done a lot with people who operate on a subscription basis, right?35:14 So basically that subscribe and save model, which I think that to me, we talk about this with like the course and stuff of like subscription versus one time and you how does that work? But I think when you have a subscription based business or even a component of your business that’s subscription based, understanding when people fall off is like a game changer for your business.35:40 because you have to figure out like, okay, when do people stop using it, stop subscribing and how do we keep them longer, right? What do we need to do? How do we need to talk to them? What types of people drop off at what point? Is it based on the type of product they’re ordering? You know, there’s all these different factors, right? And from what I saw in the presentation, it feels like there’s a lot of AI tools that Klaviyo is using to help subscription-based companies understand36:08 their customers better and keep them longer. And I wanna say they had an example on the screen and I wanted to say like it was like a 54 % boost in retention for implementing some of these AI strategies of how you talk to people, which could be, that could be game changing for a business, right? To be able to keep people for that much longer. So I think if you do have a subscription-based business, which neither you or I do,36:38 This is actually a very valuable product now for you. I mean, I wish I had a subscription base. I know, me too. Hanky the month club. I don’t think it’s going to work. No, probably not. Then also, if you happen to have an app, we have a mutual friend who has an app. You can actually incorporate all this stuff into an app now as well, whereas you could not do that before.37:07 And then probably my favorite part of the know what this is going to be. Oh, you do? OK. They have an API where you can connect Klaviyo to any website. I’m not on Shopify. Right. So anytime I need to integrate something, I pretty much need an API to do it. And this probably doesn’t apply to a lot of people listening to this. But let’s say you want to integrate. Let’s say you didn’t choose Shopify, for example.37:36 And you’re on GoDaddy for some crazy reason, because they got you on their site and you have a store on there. You could integrate Klaviyo GoDaddy with code, whereas you wouldn’t be able to do that before. Of course, if you’re on GoDaddy, you’re in trouble anyway. Right, there’s bigger problems on that. You got bigger problems. But the point is that you can integrate with any platform, even if there isn’t native support for it. Well, doesn’t that also mean, and I am not a developer, that38:04 people can build apps for Klaviyo too. Like it works both ways. So it Yeah, that’s interesting actually. Because there’s no Klaviyo app store as far as I know. yes, it opens up. So I think, I mean, I always like it when tools open up their API because I feel like it opens the marketplace for things. But I also don’t understand it enough to know like the dangers and the38:33 pros and the cons of anything. So I just know that it makes you happy, so I’m happy. Well, here’s one thing that they talked about that we didn’t actually mention here, is that you can put together sequences to gather information about a customer. So, for example, let’s say you sell body wash in SMS, you can ask them, hey, you know, what’s your favorite scent? What type of skin do you have? And then each time they answer in a sequence, yeah,39:01 you can gather data about that person and store it in their customer profile. I can’t stress enough how much knowing things about your customer makes them happy, makes the customer happier. Let’s just say, let’s talk about shampoo. You sell shampoo, right? You sell shampoo for oily hair and thin hair and curly hair because most shampoo manufacturers have a bottle for every hair type, right? Well, if you have limp39:30 straight hair, right, that always looks greasy, you don’t want a product that’s like for thick, luscious hair, right? Because not only are you not gonna buy it, you’re now ticked off because you don’t have thick, luscious hair. So if you only get like the content that is related to you, or if, you know, I remember one time, like probably 10 years ago, I got an email for like,39:54 plus size fashion, like size 22, like 22X and up, right? Which is like, you’re not familiar with like sizing, like 22X is like you’re getting two seats on an airplane, right? So like, I was like offended. I was like, yeah, I’ve gained like five pounds, but calm down, you know? So it, but immediately like I had a negative reaction to the brand, right? Cause I’m like, my feelings got hurt. So I think if you like being able to like take people through that survey process,40:24 and get more information about them. then, you know, if they feel like they got a big butt and they don’t like it, you’re not gonna send them stuff that makes them look like they have a bigger butt, right? Like whatever it is, you’re not playing on people’s insecurities, you’re playing on the things that they like. And so they just feel much more accepted and they have much more positive view of your brand. Yeah. I mean, all I can say here is I’m really excited about these features because40:52 You know how I don’t like to pay for SaaS apps. Yes. So right now I have different ones that do a whole bunch of different things, right? And it’s piecemeal. got to log into each one. Yes. It’d be nice to just only have to log into one tool for practically everything. And that’s essentially what Klaviyo has done with these new set of features. They’ve created a salesforce.com for e-commerce.41:16 Maybe that’s the best analogy. I’ve only used Salesforce a couple of times. I like I haven’t used it, that’s what it feels like. I used to want it back in the day when I used to work too. Basically, it’s just you have all the data about every customer and you basically make your decisions off of all that. I feel like it’s like Klaviyo using AI for good as opposed for evil As opposed to spamming like Google and YouTube. I feel like at the end of the day,41:46 It’s making the experience better for every single person. It’s making the experience better for your company by giving you more opportunities to generate revenue. It’s making the experience better for your marketing team, giving them the information to make better marketing decisions. And most of all, it’s giving your customers a significantly better experience by tailoring every piece of communication in a personalized way to your customer.42:13 Hope you enjoyed this episode.

In this episode, Tony and I are going to break down the latest features that our favorite email marketing tool just announced that looked to be a game changer for e-commerce. Here’s the latest and greatest in the world of online selling. But before we begin, I wanted to let you know that tickets are now on sale for Seller Summit 2025 over at sellersummit.com.  And the prices are now going to go up every two weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e00:29\u003cbr/\u003e until the event starts. The Seller Summit is the conference that I hold every year that specifically targets e-commerce entrepreneurs selling physical products online. Unlike other events that focus on inspirational stories and high-level advice, mine is a curriculum-based conference where you will leave with practical and actionable strategies specifically for an e-commerce business. Every speaker I invite is deep in the trenches of their e-commerce business, entrepreneurs who are importing large quantities of physical goods\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e00:57\u003cbr/\u003e and not some high-level guys who are overseeing their companies at 50,000 feet. I personally hate large events, so the seller’s summit is always small and intimate. Every year we cut off ticket sales at around 200 people, so tickets sell out fast, and we’ve sold out every single year for the past eight years. If you are an e-commerce entrepreneur making more than $250,000 or $1 million per year, we also offer an exclusive mastermind experience with other top sellers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e01:25\u003cbr/\u003e The Seller Summit is going to be held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida from May 6th to May 8th.

Now onto the show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e01:44\u003cbr/\u003e Welcome back to the My Wife Quitter Job podcast.  Last week,  Tony and I, had the privilege of attending  Klaviyo’s launch event for their new features. And normally we don’t create podcasts about this stuff, but  I was blown away by all the new functionality that Klaviyo had to introduce. So I felt compelled that we had to do an episode about this. Yeah, it’s, it’s pretty exciting. I have to say I was, I actually watched it twice.  So\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e02:13\u003cbr/\u003e because there was so much to digest just watching it one go round. Yeah, I watched it this morning also and I had Chachi BT take the transcript and summarize it so I wouldn’t forget anything.  what are these new features and why is it such a big deal? Klaviyo  just introduced their CRM. I think it’s called  Klaviyo Data Platform.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e02:38\u003cbr/\u003e And it’s basically going to be like the one tool that you absolutely need to practically do everything with your online store. Yeah. And that’s the best way to put it. Yeah.  And I think, I think this is a big,  like this is a big deal, right? Because one of the things that they hammered pretty hard during all the presentations, but one thing that I was like, as a struggle for me in e-commerce is that\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e03:05\u003cbr/\u003e you have all this information coming from all these different places.  And it’s very hard to get all the information to match up. And they told a story about one of their customers who hired somebody and paid them a lot of money to build like some sort of custom dashboard so that they could like aggregate the data. And after they got it built, it just didn’t do the job well, right? didn’t work  right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e03:30\u003cbr/\u003e And I thought, and this is something we deal with, you know, with some of my e-commerce clients every single day, right? Is all the data is in different places and it’s hard to get.  you know, we’re paying people to do this, right? To compile it and get it in one place. And so this is really exciting, I think, for business owners, especially if you are running a small team and you don’t have lots of people to pass these tasks off to. Yeah.  For example, like in my store, I have\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e03:58\u003cbr/\u003e these little dashboards for a bunch of different things that Jen wants to see.  And the data is there,  but it’d be nice to just have everything in one place. And we’re be talking about how they allow you to interact with that data.  So first and foremost,  unlimited data storage.  Klaviyo will have all the data for your store, access to your Shopify database, all your customers and everything. Yeah, and I mean, think the other thing to think about is that already Klaviyo integrates with\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e04:27\u003cbr/\u003e so many tools, right? So they already have a lot of these integrations built in, which is nice because I think, I don’t think I’ve ever come across something where I couldn’t integrate it with Klaviyo, like a tool that I wanted to use in Shopify. So the fact that they have all that integration already  and then  sort of building this out is pretty exciting. So they have data for all of your customers, which pages that they’ve browsed, what they’ve purchased, the frequency that they’ve purchased. And because all that data is there,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e04:56\u003cbr/\u003e That’s where it gets really exciting.  I don’t know where you want to start with this. mean,  there’s a lot of new features that they announced. I think the one that I’m most excited about  is the AI forecast. So remember, they have data for everything,  right? So they know what the customer is most likely to buy next. They know the lifetime value. They know  how to communicate, how they like to communicate with you, whether it be through email, SMS or push.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e05:26\u003cbr/\u003e And so now with these new AI features that Klaviyo has introduced, they can automatically suggest the best action for a specific customer based on their historical data and automatically create segments for you to send emails or SMS to them. So this is very exciting  because one of the things that Klaviyo already has and they’ve had for a while is\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e05:53\u003cbr/\u003e AI within segment creation where you say, want a list of people who do X, Y, Z, right? And they build that out for you. But this takes this to like an entirely other level.  And the exciting part for me is I’ve worked in that, you know, their AI tools already. And I feel like especially when it comes to building out these segments and lists of people, it does a really good job. Like the  data they give you back, the way they tell you to do things is\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e06:21\u003cbr/\u003e almost always correct. There’s very few times where I’m like, oh, that wasn’t exactly what I wanted. And if it is, it’s because I put it in wrong, right? I asked for the wrong thing. So I’m very excited to see the level that this will go, basically, as far as what AI is going to do. Because just the fact that they were showing some of the flows or how the customer journey pans out. it’s like, the AI doesn’t just stop at, create me a segment of people who’ve done X, Y, Z. It’s like,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e06:51\u003cbr/\u003e after they receive the first email, then AI  is gonna say,  send an email only to people who’ve taken these three actions and include this information in the email based on the actions they’ve taken, which,  I mean, it’s gonna put me out of a job. I wanna see how, what level this goes because I was thinking, hey, create me a segment of everyone who’s most likely to purchase a personalized apron, like in the next month. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e07:18\u003cbr/\u003e and it’ll automatically create a segment. Prior to that, you’d have to know exactly  what you’re looking for, right?  Bought an before, haven’t bought in six months or whatever. But this one, based on all the data points, right? Let’s say they were looking, they just happen to be browsing on your site for aprons in like two weeks ago, they would automatically be added to this segment. Yeah, so I think that’s really exciting and something that’s going to save people a lot of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e07:46\u003cbr/\u003e The other thing that I think it’s going to do is give people better results with their email. So,  I mean, we  can say right now, hey, let’s create a segment of people that are most likely to do  X, Y, Z, right, based on information that we have. So, for example,  one of my clients, most of her products are based out in age groups,  right? So there’s like five to eight year olds\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e08:15\u003cbr/\u003e group because it’s curriculum, right? And then there’s a nine to 12 and a 13 to 16, right? So but, you know, if someone buys something in the middle age group, right, the nine to 12, we don’t know exactly like, is there a kid nine or is there a kid 12? Right. Like, we don’t know that because we don’t don’t ask. And obviously, it’s hard to ask information about people’s kids like that. People get very rightfully How old is your little boy? Yes. Rightfully so. People get.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e08:43\u003cbr/\u003e protective of that information.  Knowing that,  on average, when you look at the data as a whole, we’ve got millions of customers, right? You look at the data as a whole and you know that people who buy in this age bracket, on average, in two years, buy in the next age bracket. Or they take this  and you start being able to have this lots and lots of data  when Klaviyo can take that and really give it to you in a very digestible\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e09:12\u003cbr/\u003e way as opposed to you. I mean, I just think about like, have you ever like downloaded something on a spreadsheet and it’s like 22,000 lines of information and it’s just like my computer just like farts out on it. It’s like, no, we’re not doing this. So like the thing that’s exciting to me is to be able to get all that data and have Klaviyo be the one that deals with it as opposed to me on a spreadsheet trying to like figure this all out and spending hours and hours. No, exactly. Like\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e09:41\u003cbr/\u003e I personally hate creating segments by hand in Clayview.  Just the fact that you can have AI create the segment for you based on what you want.  Huge game changer. I can’t wait to see how well this works.  And I think the fact that it’s going to be able to deliver smarter recommendations. mean, their recommendation tool that you can just insert that in the bottom of emails, or it doesn’t have be at the bottom, you can insert it anywhere. It already does a pretty good job. So to be able to get even more granular with the information, especially if you are in a\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e10:11\u003cbr/\u003e a vertical like clothing, right? If  there’s a shopper and they only buy  pastels,  they’re never going to see a pair of camo green leggings, right?  Or if you sell, like think about our friend Tiffany, right? She sells shoes, pants, purses, whatever.  One of the things that they pointed out, like people who buy this thing are way more likely to buy a purse,  right? And they know that because they have\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e10:39\u003cbr/\u003e let’s just say 20,000 people who have bought pants and of those 20,000 people, know, 32 % of them also buy a purse. So it’s clearly like there’s a customer type. So instead of you trying to like parse through and go, okay, I wonder what maybe this happens, you know, it’s already going to just be given to you. And not only that, all in an automated form. like, it’s like, Klaviyo is basically going to say, hey, people that buy these pants also buy purses. So send them an email. Oh, click here and it’ll be set up for you basically, which\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e11:09\u003cbr/\u003e When I was looking at their slides or their screen grabs of it, I was like, if this works like it looks like it does, this is incredible. I agree. I think that was the single most important feature. But  let’s move on because once you know what segments that you want to email to, they actually introduce another feature that I’m really looking forward to,  which  is their new campaign builder. Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e11:36\u003cbr/\u003e And you have to remember now that Klaviyo does SMS, email, push, and if you just happen to have an app, they do in-app messaging as well.  in the past, and I don’t know how many people listening actually use Klaviyo, but if you use a traditional EMS, you usually get like an autoresponder, right? Where you can send a sequence of emails. And within Klaviyo already in the past, you could send autoresponder sequence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e12:03\u003cbr/\u003e where you could take people off or put people on based on certain criteria or the actions that they’ve created. So for example, like if you had this flow, like an abandoned cart flow, for example, that was three emails. If someone purchased after the first email, you would not send them the abandoned cart email for a second, third. That’s already been there. Now you can do something like that with just regular campaigns. Yes. And I’m just trying to,  why don’t you talk about like some of the use cases for that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e12:32\u003cbr/\u003e That’s what I think is really nice. I think we’ve  bugged our friend Joe at Klaviyo for many years.  One of the features that Klaviyo never had was the recent unopens. You had to do that all manually, which is actually a bit of a pain. They just recently launched that within their campaigns, pretty normal standard stuff. Now with this campaign, it’s basically like a flow, but it’s a campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e12:59\u003cbr/\u003e you send out an email, let’s just say you’re having a, I don’t know, Mother’s Day sale, Mother’s Day is in a couple months,  and you’re gonna send it out a week before Mother’s Day or two weeks before Mother’s Day, whatever your timeline is, but then you wanna resend to unopens. But do you really wanna resend to all your unopens? Probably not, because typically, if you resend to all of your unopens,  some of those people just don’t really open a lot of the emails anyway, so  immediately that email’s gonna perform a little less than,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e13:28\u003cbr/\u003e you know, you’d like it to. So what you can do is  resend it to people who’ve done like specific behaviors, right? So it’s not just unopens. It could be resend to people who didn’t open it, but they visited the site within 30 days. They have already purchased $500 or more from my store. Like you can put all these conditions in it in this basically automated flow. And also, Klaviyo has this little thing called the Action Center.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e13:58\u003cbr/\u003e where it gives you the recommendation of the best practice. So based on all of their data and all the brands and everything else, they’ll tell you like, I might think, well, oh, I should send it to these people. Well, Klavia is gonna say, hey, based on all the data from your store and all the data from stores in your vertical, like all  their whole data set that they have and go,  this is actually what you should do. This is who you should send it to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e14:21\u003cbr/\u003e which to me is a game changer because one, it takes the guesswork out of it for us as far as like, we can test it, right? We can see what happens, blah, blah, blah. But also like, just tell me what to do. If you know what works,  I’ll do it. I was thinking for me, particularly, we typically run three day sales  or three or four day sales and we email multiple times during that period.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e14:47\u003cbr/\u003e So it would be nice instead of sending like three or four separate emails out about that sale, you have it in this nice campaign builder where you can automatically exclude people. Yes. Right. Who’ve purchased  or  for example, if someone hasn’t responded or opened an email, maybe send them a text instead. Yes. And that was nice too. Like you can set up, if you do use Klaviyo for SMS, you can basically, you know, email these people based on that, text these people based on that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e15:16\u003cbr/\u003e email these people, right? So it creates this whole chain of events that, which I think the other thing that’s nice about that is consistency of messaging, right? So  being able to know that the people that are getting the text have already received an email that says this. So I’m gonna text them and say  something different, or I’m gonna piggyback on what they already got.  And I think being able to sort of  be very cohesive with the messaging is actually really important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e15:46\u003cbr/\u003e I actually think most brands don’t focus on this enough,  but just that consistency with the messaging and the things that you say, especially during a promotion or a launch or anything like that,  is actually really valuable. And to be able to have that all like now in a sequence is a really nice feature. I mean, I was just thinking for me, just organizing all the campaigns.  Like right now I have campaigns that say first day,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e16:11\u003cbr/\u003e middle of the promotion, last day of the promotion. Yes, I like AM, 2 PM, 6 PM, last day, last. Yes. The problem with me is, and this is my own fault, but I try to name things consistently. Last day of the sale, it should be the date, whatever the sale is, last chance AM, then whatever for PM. Sometimes I change the verbiage just.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e16:38\u003cbr/\u003e because I’m human and I’m not thinking at the time, right? So then it’s like, you know, I changed something. So then when you go in and look for something to clone or recreate, it’s like, wait, that’s not last chance. It’s LC, because for some reason I decided to abbreviate this week.  so just the consistency of it, I think is gonna be really nice. Yeah, I mean, I ideally just wanna be able to clone my entire  sales sequence  and set it and forget it instead of, again, having to draft four five different emails.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e17:06\u003cbr/\u003e I think the nice thing about that little action center that they’ve created is that when they give you a recommendation, you basically just click it and it sets it up for you.  It’s like, we think you should send a campaign to people who like pink leggings or whatever it is.  You’re like, do too. Click and it basically builds you this template.  For people who are not big on  using the\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e17:32\u003cbr/\u003e the coding and things like that in Klavia, which they do make it pretty easy to just drop and insert things. There’s still some,  you know, technical degree there.  It’s already embedded in those emails. So all you’re doing is going in and tweaking it. Right. They already have your brand logo. They’ve already got your templates. So basically, when you say, yes, do this,  it’s creating everything for you. And there’s very  little work that you need to be doing after that step. Yeah. So this next feature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e18:02\u003cbr/\u003e that they introduced is actually something that I was in the middle of writing  for my store,  which is a self-service and support hub. So, Klavia is actually now going to do customer service for you.  You know that right now,  a lot of stores are my friends, they’re using a separate app  for customer support. But you know, Klavia already knows all your orders, right?  They know who’s buying and all that stuff. They have all the information. They have addresses and whatnot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e18:31\u003cbr/\u003e So why not manage order tracking and returns management? Why not have like an AI chat bot to answer the most commonly asked questions? Why not have like a live chat if AI can’t answer the question, hand it off to a real human? They’ve added all of that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e18:50\u003cbr/\u003e I just wanted to take a moment to tell you about a free resource that I offer on my website that you may not be aware of. If you are interested in starting your own online store, I put together a comprehensive six day mini course on how to get started in ecommerce that you should all check out. It contains both video and text based tutorials that go over the entire process of finding products to sell all the way to getting your first sales online. Now this course is free and can be obtained at mywifequitterjob.com slash free.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e19:19\u003cbr/\u003e just sign up right there on the front page via email and I’ll send you the course right away. Once again, that’s mywifequitterjob.com slash free. Now back to the show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e19:31\u003cbr/\u003e I feel like this could be an entire podcast on its own is that customer support should be a sales channel for your business.  Most people view it as a rescue boat. Rescue the lost order, rescue the person who can’t figure out how to place an order on the website, whatever it is. It  really should be its own sales channel. think because once someone… Obviously, there’s a lot of people who message support who have like,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e20:00\u003cbr/\u003e literally probably the top one is where’s my order, right? Which can be pretty much answered with AI, probably 95 % of the time. But then there are people, like I would think for your business with the personalization, like people probably have questions about that, right? People wanna know like, what actually can I personalize or how, know, what kind of thread do you use or you know, whatever the questions would be, is it gonna get here in time, things like that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e20:27\u003cbr/\u003e But what an opportunity to give people a great customer experience there and then upsell them on other things, right? So the next thing you know, they’re not just buying the personalized handkerchief, they’ve also got the matching apron and pillowcase, right? That  you just have an opportunity there. And  to remove some of the friction as far as like, where’s my order, things like that, where that can all be done through AI, to then allow your customer service person or people to actually  do bigger work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e20:57\u003cbr/\u003e I think is going to be a game changer for companies. Here’s the thing about our customer service. If we can get someone communicating with our customer service rep, it’s almost 90 % of conversion. Yeah. Like we can always sell them something. Yeah. So it’s in your best interest to actually have that conversation with somebody. I still think phone conversations are the best, but chat is like the second best. And this actually, seeing this feature actually reminded me, I had this really elaborate\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e21:26\u003cbr/\u003e a Facebook Messenger platform where I was actually semi-automating customer service.  But Facebook deprecated that a long time ago  and it was on my list to add another live chat, but I actually hadn’t done it before. Hence, I was going to incorporate all these features into the site already. I was really looking forward to writing my own AI-powered chatbot also. I might just use Klaviyo’s now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e21:51\u003cbr/\u003e Yeah, I mean. it’s already there and they have all the information. It looks really nice. The screenshots that they showed us, it was just really nicely integrated with the site already.  It was almost like it was a part of the Shopify store, in fact. Yes. Right. So, yeah. Well, no, but I think the other thing that people probably don’t think about is that it looks really nice. looks like a seamless experience for the customer. But also, like, they go in, they ask, you know, where’s my order?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e22:20\u003cbr/\u003e I actually had this to me yesterday. I used the wrong credit card for something. I used an old credit card that actually had been canceled and I knew the order was gonna get declined. At some point it was a grocery order. So I was like, I need to get in here and fix it. So I got on with an AI chat bot. I got the answer that I needed. Basically it wasn’t the answer I wanted, but basically like we can’t do anything. have to cancel your order and reorder. And I’m like, fine. But got through the whole process. But I think about the fact that like, if it is all integrated in Klaviyo,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e22:49\u003cbr/\u003e and they have all of the customer information and with their AI features, they’re telling you stuff about the customer inside that as you know, as if you, you escalate it to the human, right?  Then you have all this information about the customer. If you’re in another customer service platform that is not connected, you can still get that information about the customer, but you’ve got to log into Shopify or Klaviyo. You’ve got to pull the information.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e23:15\u003cbr/\u003e you can see like when you log into, if you pull up someone’s customer profile on Klaviyo, you know what emails they’ve received, what emails they’ve clicked on, what they’ve purchased. And now that’s all going, what it looks like it’s all going to be within that customer service platform. Like what an advantage to when someone actually gets to a human  to have all that data. And you’re like, oh, this person always buys like embroidered pillowcases. We should probably show them this new line as we’re talking to them. You know what I mean? Like it’s all just given to the people that are working\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e23:44\u003cbr/\u003e which I think is gonna be a great sales channel for companies. Yeah, I mean, right now the way we do it is we have another tool that handles all that, right? Right. But why not just have it in one place? Yeah. And not have to open some other tool in order to get the same information. And then expect your customer service person, which typically in most stores is like a lower paid employee.  It’s not a sales person for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e24:11\u003cbr/\u003e But then you’re just handing that person all this data that they can use. They’re not having to go find it or dig it out or understand. It all appears to be in the platform already when they’re talking to them. I mean, this is how I see it being used also.  When we get a phone call, she can just pull up this information in Klaviyo.  And maybe Klaviyo can say, hey, this person is very likely to order another handkerchief.  And then she could just make that suggestion on the fly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e24:40\u003cbr/\u003e Klaviyo has all the data once again. And as  you don’t like  humans having to think about things, so this is like a huge.  Oh yeah, definitely.  The other cool feature that I saw when they were showing the screenshots was it appeared like after you went through customer support, they had like a little survey at the end  where it was like, and this was, they were doing a clothing store as their example. And it was like, which of these,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e25:07\u003cbr/\u003e is your favorite color for leggings, right? And then they showed the example and the person put like pink or whatever. And then it was like, they asked another question based on the favorite color. There were like three real simple, like multiple choice questions. But then based on their responses, it created profile properties for that person in Klaviyo and then suggested the emails that they get that like, you know, so one person, you’re sending the same email to 500 people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e25:35\u003cbr/\u003e But one person’s getting the pink leggings and one person’s getting the black leggings based on the profile. And it’s basically all automated. Yeah. Yeah. You know, one, uh, the other day a student asked me how to get Google analytics set up and get all the granular data. And what I told her was like, I can show you how to set all that up. But to be honest with you, I rarely look at Google analytics at all anymore, ever since they made the shift because it’s\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e26:03\u003cbr/\u003e It’s like not intuitive and it’s not easy to use. No, I can’t find anything in there. I hate it. But now  with all these new Klaviyo features,  and they showed a screenshot of this, but now you can get like a comprehensive customer timeline. One of Google’s restrictions is they couldn’t use real names due to privacy reasons.  But on Klaviyo, like let’s say I want to pull you up. I can see every email open, every SMS click, every purchase, every website visit, every return.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e26:32\u003cbr/\u003e every shipment, where the shipment is in transit. It’s just a much nicer way to track things than like a Google Analytics. Well, and I think  that’s what they called it, what the unified customer view. Yeah. And basically, and I would assume that you would have to be using Klaviyo SMS to get this fully. Of course.  Well,  unless it integrates, like I said, Klaviyo integrates with pretty much every other tool since it’s pretty much become the standard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e27:00\u003cbr/\u003e Yeah. So you could probably get click data if you’re on like Postscript, for example. But I think being able to see and they showed a  graph of like a customer timeline and basically, you know, I forget what they call them, like the champions were like the top customers and, you know, then they had like names for each level of customer. But being able to see all that information and like, are they more likely to open a text and email? Like, what are they doing? What are they interacting the best with?  And then once again,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e27:29\u003cbr/\u003e making those like take action recommendations based on what people are doing.  I think that’s probably my favorite feature is that Klaviyo basically tells you what to do. So instead of you sort of  over analyzing and testing, and I think you should still be testing, obviously, but you’re not just like throwing  stuff at a wall and seeing what sticks Klaviyo is actually taking the data and giving you really good ideas. Have you ever gone to the dentist  and\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e27:55\u003cbr/\u003e They go up to you and they say, hey Steve, how was your vacation three months ago? And you’re like, what, what?  How did you know I went on a vacation? How’d you remember? Because I obviously told them that Oh yeah, because they put it in your little notes when they’re cleaning your teeth. Yes. Yes. Can you imagine now that if you’re on live chat with somebody and you already have the customer up, right? Right. Because I would imagine that as soon as someone does a live chat, it automatically brings up whatever their profile is. And you have notes on that person. Like our best customers, we have notes. Yes. know what they’re doing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e28:24\u003cbr/\u003e And you can automatically say stuff like, how’s your kid? know, how’s high school? They just started high school. Yes. That makes a huge difference. Yeah. I think the the level of customer loyalty that you get from that.  I it’s funny that you brought up the dentist because  my favorite hygienist stopped working to be home with her kids. What a jerk.  But like one of the reasons why I like to going is that like she we could like pick up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e28:51\u003cbr/\u003e where we left off in our conversations, was kind of like, oh, well, how was this? And I know it’s all in their little dashboard, right, of notes. Like, oh, she, like, I think it was when Instacart came out. And so we had this whole conversation about Instacart one time. And the next time she’s like, I’m using Instacart, blah, blah, blah. And I was like, how do you remember that we had a conversation about Instacart? Anyway, made me super loyal to the dentist because it just, it felt good, right? It feels good to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e29:17\u003cbr/\u003e have people remember you. How are you able to have conversations with your hygienist? Like she’s got the stuff in your mouth, right? It’s always a one-sided conversation. Oh, can stop me from talking. You know that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e29:31\u003cbr/\u003e The other thing that’s nice is I’ve actually wanted to offload email marketing to someone outside of Jen. And I’m very curious about all the AI features in terms of what subject lines, what type of emails to create and whatnot. You mentioned earlier that it might put you out of a job. Yeah. That’s my best case scenario. Not to put you out of a job. that’s your best case because then you’ll have to hire me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e30:00\u003cbr/\u003e That’s not your best-case scenario. As I was watching this and thinking through everything, part of me was like, know what? I feel like this is where I don’t hate AI because we’ve had a lot of conversations about AI and people just creating entire websites and YouTube channels and just all AI-generated and even some of the dangers where they’re basically\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e30:26\u003cbr/\u003e doing the deep fake stuff, right? Where it’s like, you can’t even tell. So I think AI can, it can be awful, right? It can  be used for pretty negative things. And you and I just did a Google search like two weeks ago and Google gave us the wrong, AI gave us the wrong information about Google. Do you remember that? So. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So it’s like, there’s a lot of negative about AI, but I feel like when I watched this, I was like, okay, this is how AI really should be used, right? This is where I think it’s helpful  and\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e30:56\u003cbr/\u003e pushing forward and using technology to make things better for everybody. Because here’s the thing,  it doesn’t just make things better for the company owner or the marketing person. It makes things better for the customer.  We  all get a million emails every day.  If you’re on a bunch of SMS lists, you get tons of texts, marketing texts, things like that. But how awesome is it to get an email that actually makes sense to you?  And it’s actually something you care about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e31:26\u003cbr/\u003e I used this example at seller summit last year when I was doing the email talk. I bought a bunch of paint at Lowe’s and then Lowe’s sent me an ad for paint, an email about paint. And I was like,  you should have sent me an ad for paint brushes, right? You should have sent me an ad. You know what I bought. I don’t need to buy more paint. I need to buy painter’s tape and  all the things that go along with it. It was like a huge missed opportunity. So I think the better…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e31:51\u003cbr/\u003e AI gets of sending the customers things that they really like. Like, don’t send me an email with a dress that I’ll never buy. But if you know that I’ve looked at something and you’re sending me an email telling me that the price dropped or that it’s back in stock  or that they have this color that I actually buy everything else in this color, my journey has gotten so much better when it comes to the whole buying experience. I think the most egregious  error that I had a company make was when I bought a pair of shoes and they sent me emails about women’s clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e32:21\u003cbr/\u003e Maybe they know something that I don’t.  My personal pet peeve is when  you buy something and the next day you get an email from that company with that exact product and it’s now 25 % off. I feel like with all of this AI integration, that can be avoided really easily.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e32:48\u003cbr/\u003e You can exclude people who purchase, I mean you can already do this, but I feel like this is gonna make it even more intuitive and it’s gonna be even easier.  Excluding people who’ve already bought, excluding people who’ve bought that exact product in the last 48 hours.  Don’t send a sale email to that. All those things where  as a human, that can be, you can forget or it can slip or you can forget to add them. There’s like lots of opportunity for error.  And I think this actually makes things so much better for everybody, right? The customer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e33:18\u003cbr/\u003e the store, the marketing person.  And I think also,  don’t people want emails in their inbox that are relevant? I do. I don’t want a bunch of garbage.  So I think it provides a much better experience for the shopper. Yeah.  And one thing that I think Klaviyo is really trying to do is prevent people from just blasting their entire list. Yes. And so  there’s one seller summit talk, I want to say\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e33:47\u003cbr/\u003e a couple years ago, where they talked about how you have different segments of customers that are in different stages of the purchasing  journey. So like you have people who will buy from you no matter what they buy in bulk and they buy a lot. Then you have customers that buy often, but they don’t spend that much money. Then of course you have people who bought like buy occasionally and then there’s people who haven’t purchased at all.  And it’s important to understand who those people are because you’re going to want to send messages\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e34:16\u003cbr/\u003e differently to those people. Like for example, for your best customers,  I know it’s ironic that you’re punishing your best customers, but we don’t send out coupons to our best customers because we know they’re going to buy anyway.  We reward them in other ways,  like with loyalty points or something like that because a coupon is not going to, I mean, they’re to buy no matter what.  Whereas someone who hasn’t bought at all, maybe you just want to give them a bigger coupon to get them to buy for the very first time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e34:45\u003cbr/\u003e I’ve seen that that works, right? If you  are talking differently to different types of customers,  it really does make a huge difference in your return on investment, basically.  I think another thing that was important that they talked about, and fortunately, it doesn’t apply to you or me,  but I know what applies to a lot of companies is they also have done a lot with people who operate on a subscription basis,  right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e35:14\u003cbr/\u003e So basically that subscribe and save model,  which  I think that to me, we talk about this with like the course and stuff of like subscription versus one time and you how does that work?  But I think when you have a subscription based business or even a component of your business that’s subscription based, understanding when people fall off  is like a game changer for your business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e35:40\u003cbr/\u003e because you have to figure out like, okay, when do people stop using it, stop subscribing and how do we keep them longer, right? What do we need to do? How do we need to talk to them? What types of people drop off at what point? Is it based on the type of product they’re ordering? You know, there’s all these different factors, right? And  from what I saw in  the presentation, it feels like there’s a lot of AI tools that Klaviyo is using to help subscription-based companies understand\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e36:08\u003cbr/\u003e their customers better and keep them longer.  And I wanna say they had an example on the screen and I wanted to say like it was like a 54 %  boost in  retention for implementing some of these AI strategies of how you talk to people,  which could be, that could be game changing for a business, right? To be able to keep people for that much longer. So I think if you do have a subscription-based business, which neither you or I do,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e36:38\u003cbr/\u003e This is actually a very valuable  product now for you. I mean, I wish I had a subscription base. I know, me too.  Hanky the month club.  I don’t think it’s going to work. No, probably not.  Then  also, if you happen to have an app, we have a mutual friend who has an app. You can actually incorporate all this stuff into an app now as well, whereas you could not do that before.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e37:07\u003cbr/\u003e And then probably my favorite  part of the know what this is going to be. Oh, you do? OK. They have an API  where you can connect Klaviyo to any website. I’m not on Shopify. Right. So anytime I need to integrate something, I pretty much need an API to do it. And  this probably doesn’t apply to a lot of people listening to this. But let’s say you want to integrate. Let’s say you didn’t choose Shopify, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e37:36\u003cbr/\u003e And you’re on GoDaddy for some crazy reason, because they got you on their site and you have a store on there.  You could integrate Klaviyo GoDaddy with code, whereas you wouldn’t be able to do that before.  Of course, if you’re on GoDaddy,  you’re in trouble anyway. Right, there’s bigger problems on that. You got bigger problems. But the point is that you can integrate with any platform, even if there isn’t native support for it. Well, doesn’t that also mean, and I am not a developer,  that\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e38:04\u003cbr/\u003e people can build apps for Klaviyo too. Like it works  both ways. So it Yeah, that’s interesting actually. Because there’s no Klaviyo app store as far as I know. yes,  it opens up. So I think, I mean, I always like it when  tools open up their API because I feel like it opens the marketplace for things.  But I also don’t understand it enough to know like the dangers and the\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e38:33\u003cbr/\u003e pros and the cons of anything. So I just know that it makes you happy, so I’m happy. Well, here’s one thing that they talked about that we didn’t actually mention here, is that you can put together sequences to gather information about a customer. So, for example, let’s say you sell body wash in SMS, you can ask them, hey, you know,  what’s your favorite scent?  What type of skin do you have? And then each time they answer in a sequence, yeah,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e39:01\u003cbr/\u003e you can gather data about that person and store it in their customer profile.  I  can’t stress enough how much knowing things about your customer makes them happy, makes the customer happier. Let’s just say, let’s talk about shampoo. You sell shampoo, right?  You sell shampoo for oily hair and thin hair and curly hair because most shampoo manufacturers have a  bottle for every hair type, right? Well, if you have limp\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e39:30\u003cbr/\u003e straight hair, right, that always looks greasy, you don’t want  a  product that’s like for thick, luscious hair, right? Because not only are you not gonna buy it, you’re now ticked off because you don’t have thick, luscious hair.  So if you only get like the content that is related to you,  or if, you know, I remember one time, like probably 10 years ago, I got an email for like,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e39:54\u003cbr/\u003e plus size fashion, like size 22, like  22X and up, right? Which is like, you’re not familiar with like sizing, like  22X is like you’re getting two seats on an airplane, right?  So like, I was like offended. I was like, yeah, I’ve gained like five pounds, but calm down, you know?  So  it, but immediately like I had a negative reaction to the brand, right? Cause I’m like, my feelings got hurt. So I think if you like being able to like take people through that survey process,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e40:24\u003cbr/\u003e and get more information about them. then, you know,  if  they feel like they got a big butt and they don’t like it, you’re not gonna send them stuff that makes them look like they have a bigger butt, right? Like whatever it is, you’re not playing on people’s insecurities, you’re playing on the things that they like. And so they just feel much more accepted and they have much more positive view of your brand. Yeah. I mean, all I can say here is I’m really excited about these features because\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e40:52\u003cbr/\u003e You know how I don’t like to pay for SaaS apps. Yes. So right now I have different ones that do a whole bunch of different things, right? And it’s piecemeal. got to log into each one. Yes. It’d be nice to just only have to log into one tool  for practically everything. And that’s essentially what Klaviyo has done with these new set of features. They’ve created a salesforce.com for e-commerce.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e41:16\u003cbr/\u003e Maybe that’s the best analogy. I’ve only used Salesforce a couple of times. I like I haven’t used it, that’s what it feels like. I used to want it back in the day when I used to work too. Basically, it’s just you have all the data about every customer and you basically make your decisions off of all that. I feel like it’s like Klaviyo using AI for good as opposed for evil As opposed to spamming like Google and YouTube. I feel like at the end of the day,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e41:46\u003cbr/\u003e It’s making the experience better for every single person. It’s making the experience better for your company by giving you more opportunities to generate revenue. It’s making the experience better for your marketing team, giving them the information to make better marketing decisions. And most of all, it’s giving your customers a significantly better experience by tailoring every piece of communication in a personalized way to your customer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e42:13\u003cbr/\u003e Hope you enjoyed this episode.
