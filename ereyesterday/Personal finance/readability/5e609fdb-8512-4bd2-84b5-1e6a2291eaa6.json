  "text": "Tickets for Lady Gaga’s latest tour — her first since 2022, and her first in arenas since 2018 — are sure to be in high demand. But a Citi credit or debit card could help you score some seats. From 12 p.m. March 31 to 11 a.m. April 2, 2025, eligible Citi cardholders can access the Citi presale event for Lady Gaga’s \"The Mayhem Ball\" tour and have the opportunity to buy tickets before the general public. The presale can be found on the Citi Entertainment website. Opening and closing times listed there are local, meaning they reflect the time zone where the concert is located. For example, the presale for tickets to Gaga’s two Chicago shows opens at 12 p.m. CST. Eligible cards include Citi credit cards with a Visa or Mastercard logo, and Citibank debit cards with a Mastercard logo. Your presale code will be the first six digits of that eligible Citi credit or debit card. Concert tickets must be purchased with a Citi card. For those who don’t have an eligible Citi card, it’s not too late to get one and secure a spot in the presale. Some Citi credit cards can be used instantly upon approval, including the $0-annual-fee Citi Custom Cash® Card.It earns 5% cash back on up to $500 spent in your highest spend category per billing cycle. (After hitting the cap, all purchases earn 1%.) One of those bonus categories is live entertainment, and Lady Gaga tickets definitely qualify. The Citi Custom Cash® Card also has a welcome offer, which can further defray the cost of those tickets: Earn $200 in cash back after you spend $1,500 on purchases in the first 6 months of account opening. This bonus offer will be fulfilled as 20,000 ThankYou® Points, which can be redeemed for $200 cash back.If you’re approved for a Citi card, and Citi verifies your identity, you’ll receive a temporary card number and access to a portion of your total credit limit, which you can use to enter the presale and purchase tickets. The temporary card number will appear on the approval confirmation page. Be sure to write it down or take a screenshot: This is your only chance to do so. The Mayhem Tour begins July 16 in Las Vegas and wraps up Sept. 17 in Chicago.",
