  "text": "New executive order temporarily pauses federal loans and grants, potentially impacting funding for both students and colleges.Department of Education spokesperson confirms that Pell Grants and Direct Student Loans are NOT impacted.Colleges could face financial strain as expected federal funds are delayed, leading to uncertainty in institutional budgets. An executive order issued last night by the Trump administration has placed a temporary freeze on federal financial loans and grants. The order takes effect at 5pm on January 28, 2025, so any grants or loans disbursed before then should proceed normally. While the order aims to review government spending, the move has sparked concerns among students and colleges that this order could impact tuition payments, financial aid packages, and institutional operations.While the order is not clear and there is some discretion among agencies, the order says that payments to individuals should continue, while other payments should be paused pending review.Update At 9:30am PST: A Department of Education spokesperson has confirmed that Title IV federal student aid sent directly on behalf of individuals, including Federal Pell Grants and Direct Student Loans, will not be impacted by this order.Update at 10am PST: The EO also does NOT impact Federal Work Study funds.Update as of 11am PST: An updated memo from the Office of Management and Budget clarifies Pell Grants are not paused.Are Pell Grants Affected?Perhaps the most immediate concern is the impact on federal grants, particularly the Pell Grant program, which provides need-based financial aid to millions of low-income students. Since grants are distributed through colleges, a freeze on federal assistance could disrupt the flow of funding, leaving students without expected aid.Since Pell Grants are grants on behalf of an individual, they will NOT be impacted by any pause.Without these funds, colleges may be unable to distribute financial aid packages as planned, causing some students to reconsider their enrollment options or take on more private loans to cover gaps in funding.Several colleges have confirmed that they are expecting to receive Pell Grant funds this week as scheduled. How Federal Student Loans Could Be ImpactedThe executive order directs federal agencies to pause \"all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance.\" While the administration states that this will not impact direct individual benefits like Social Security or Medicare, student loans may face delays or restrictions.Student loans are borrowed in an individual's name, but they are disbursed first to colleges and universities. They should not be impacted by the order, and that has been confirmed by the Department of Education.However, it's not clear if there will be any impact on subsidized loans versus unsubsidized loans.Colleges Face UncertaintyBeyond students, colleges and universities could experience financial strain if federal grants and loans are delayed. Colleges rely on other grants such as Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG) that may be paused.Many institutions depend on these funds to support their budgets, maintain academic programs, and sustain operational costs. Without federal assistance, some schools may face funding gaps that could lead to reduced services, staff furloughs, or increased tuition costs for students.While the administration has suggested that the freeze is temporary, there are concerns that it could set a precedent for further restrictions on federal education funding. Colleges, particularly those with a high percentage of low-income students, may need to adjust financial aid strategies to compensate for potential delays or reductions in federal support.What's Next?The White House has not provided a clear timeline for when the review will be completed or when funds will be released. Lawmakers have already begun raising concerns about the legality and potential consequences of the freeze, with some warning that it may face legal challenges.For example, Senator Chuck Schumer said in a statement that the order may violate the Impoundment Control Act of 1974.Students and colleges should monitor updates from the Department of Education and financial aid offices for guidance on how to navigate potential disruptions. Editor's Note: The article was updated to reflect the updated guidance from the Department of Education. Don't Miss These Other Stories:",
