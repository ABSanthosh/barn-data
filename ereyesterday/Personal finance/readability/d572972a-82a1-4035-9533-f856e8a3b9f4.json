  "text": "Business banking is a little different from consumer banking. Our master list of the best online banks around is surprisingly short on business checking accounts with no monthly maintenance fees, minimum balance requirements, or monthly transaction limits. Also, most business bank accounts impose transaction limits and demand hefty minimum balances to waive high monthly maintenance fees (also known as monthly service fees). That puts microbusiness owners and solopreneurs at a distinct disadvantage. And it’s a stark contrast to the consumer banking world, where the best free consumer checking accounts cater to individuals and joint account holders who aren’t swimming in cash. But the picture isn’t uniformly bleak. Once you know where to look, you’ll find ample small-business checking options to choose from.

As you narrow down your list of suitable accounts, consider each in turn and how it relates to your business needs. Account Fees Some bank accounts have more fees than others. Rather than let the perfect be the enemy of the good, we look for small business accounts that keep fees to a minimum. We’re especially sensitive to account maintenance fees — our ideal business account doesn’t charge those. Account Minimums Many small business owners, and certainly many microbusiness owners and sole proprietors, can’t afford to keep thousands of dollars in their accounts at all times. All else being equal, we prefer accounts that don’t require large opening deposits or ongoing minimum balances. Account Limits Transaction limits are the bane of small business owners’ existence. At least, they used to be. The best small business accounts waive transaction limits altogether, reckoning that an arbitrary cap on inflows and outflows is bad for, well, business. Account Yield We don’t hold the lack of interest (yield) on business checking accounts against their backers. But we do give extra weight to banks that find a way to pay interest on eligible deposits, especially when prevailing interest rates remain low by historical standards. Account Bonuses and Incentives It’s not uncommon to find small business bank accounts offering generous account opening bonuses with relatively few strings attached. Some upstart banks offer referral bonuses and other financial incentives, such as cash-back rewards, as well. We say: the more, the merrier. Other Features and Capabilities Increasingly, great business bank accounts are hubs for actually getting business done, not simply collecting payments and settling bills. We’re big fans of banks that offer a range of features and capabilities, especially third-party integrations with accounting, payroll, and other software platforms. Bonus points for discounts on these services. Other Account Types Available These small-business checking accounts aren’t always the stars of the show at their respective online banking institutions. Most of these banks offer multiple personal and business deposit accounts. Several make our lists of banks with the best CD rates and the best money market rates, and some offer enticing high-yield savings accounts to boot. So even if you come for the low-cost small-business checking, you could find yourself staying for more. All else being equal, we prefer banks that give you this option. Business Checking FAQs You have questions about small business banking. We have answers. Can You Use a Business Bank Account for Personal Expenses? Technically, yes, but it’s not a good idea. You should keep your business finances separate from your personal finances for two reasons: It makes business and personal budgeting much easier. It keeps your business activities distinct from your personal activities for both tax and legal purposes, reducing your personal financial liability for lawsuits or other claims against your business. The best way to keep business expenses separate from personal expenses is to maintain separate accounts for each. That’s an easy lift with any of the providers on this list. Does a Business Bank Account Build Credit for Your Business? Usually, no. At least, not directly. Banks don’t report deposit account information to credit bureaus on a regular basis. However, if you have a business loan or line of credit with your bank, including a business credit card, you can and will build credit for your business. It’s important to use these products responsibly by making timely payments and keeping credit line utilization low. Otherwise, your business credit score could suffer.   What Are Some Common Restrictions on Small Business Bank Accounts? Most business bank accounts impose transaction limits and demand hefty minimum balances to waive high monthly maintenance fees (also known as monthly service fees). That puts microbusiness owners and solopreneurs at a distinct disadvantage. And it’s a stark contrast to the consumer banking world, where the best free consumer checking accounts cater to individuals and joint account holders who aren’t swimming in cash. Fortunately, friendlier business bank accounts are out there. You’ll find many on this list.  How Many Bank Accounts Can Your Small Business Have? There’s no hard upper limit to the number of bank accounts your business can have.  That said, you shouldn’t open an account just for the sake of opening an account. As your bank accounts multiple, managing them gets more complicated and time-consuming. With many business bank accounts charging maintenance fees and imposing transaction limits, the costs can add up quickly too. So if your business is relatively simple, it probably needs no more than two or three accounts. How to Choose the Best Small Business Checking Account If you’ve read this far, you’ve probably noticed that the best small-business checking accounts have certain things in common: Low minimum balance requirements, if any No monthly service fees or easy ways to waive those fees High transaction limits or none at all Seamless mobile banking experiences Plenty of fringe benefits for growing businesses Rewards, account yields, or other incentives for use FDIC insurance up to the statutory maximum The ideal business checking account for your needs should cover as many of these bases as possible. If you’re not sure where to turn, know that any of the accounts on this would be a fine addition to your enterprise’s financial portfolio.",
