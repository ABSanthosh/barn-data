  "text": "In a news release on July 10, 2025, announcing it had raised $250 million in funding, the company also said it's developing \"Bilt Card 2.0,\" which will include a portfolio of three credit cards, including a no-annual-fee option as well as two higher-tier products with annual fees of $95 and $495 respectively.The company also announced that it would be moving from issuer Wells Fargo to a platform from Cardless, a much newer credit card company. The changes are expected to launch in February 2026. Current cardholders will be moved to the Cardless platform at that time, but it’s unclear how or whether their terms will be impacted. No details were shared regarding the new issuing partner, changes to card features or the transition process, but the company says more information will be announced in early fall 2025.The Bilt card debuted in 2021, standing out as the only card that earned rewards on rent payments without incurring expensive processing fees. Its first issuer was Evolve Bank and Trust, and it later transitioned to Wells Fargo. It’s not uncommon for credit cards from fintechs like Bilt to experience more changes than traditional credit cards might over a relatively short timeframe. Throughout its journey, some of the card's other terms have also been updated.The current incarnation of the Bilt World Elite Mastercard® Credit Card charges no annual fee and earns the following rewards: 5 Bilt Points per $1 spent on Lyft (when you link your accounts).3 points per $1 spent on dining.2 points per $1 spent on travel.1 point per $1 spent on rent (up to 100,000 points per calendar year).1 point per $1 spent on other purchases.(You must use the card 5 times each statement period to earn points. If you do not make at least 5 transactions in a statement period, you’ll earn a flat 250 points when you use the card to pay rent through the Bilt app or website.)",
