Issued by Fifth Third Bank, the Pay with GasBuddy+ charge card advertises savings of up to 33 cents per gallon. It will run on the Mastercard payment network and is the successor to the Pay with GasBuddy fuel card, which will be discontinued later this year. Saving that much per gallon on every fill-up is a great deal — but there are some caveats that make it unlikely you’ll get those savings every single time. Here's what to know.Image courtesy of GasBuddyHow the card worksYou can apply for the Pay with GasBuddy+ card on the GasBuddy website or within the app. No credit check is required. However, you must be at least 18 years old, live in the U.S., and link an eligible bank account. That bank account will be used to pay off your balance on the GasBuddy+ card. Here's how the card's discounts work: GasBuddy+ cardholders get a baseline discount of 3 cents per gallon, but only if you opt-in to autopay your card bill from the bank account you linked when you applied for the card. The discount rises to 5 cents per gallon at select gas stations. If you activate a Deal Alert in the GasBuddy app, you could get up to 25 cents per gallon off. Get a 3-cents-per-gallon discount for every $25 spent on non-fuel purchases inside convenience stores. You must be enrolled in autopay to earn these savings, too.Discounts from Deal Alerts and convenience store shopping stack on top of the 3 or 5 cents/gallon discount, which results in a maximum savings of 33 cents per gallon. Rewards earned on gas and convenience purchases are automatically redeemed at your next fill-up when you pay with a GasBuddy+ card. Unused rewards expire after 12 months. Autopay vs. manual bill payBecause it's a charge card, you won't be able to carry a balance month to month on the Pay with GasBuddy+ card, as you would with a traditional credit card. Instead, you must pay off the balance in full — either with autopay or via manual bill pay. If you choose the latter, you'll get a statement every week and will be responsible for manually paying it within seven days.If, however, you choose autopay, you'll qualify for the aforementioned per-gallon discounts, but you'll also get other benefits: Autopay participants can spend up to $100 per day and $400 per week. If you pay your bill manually, you’ll get only a $50 weekly spending limit. That amount won’t be enough for a full tank of gas for many cars. If you're enrolled in autopay, you may also sign up for a Plus or Premium GasBuddy membership. Both tiers offer additional savings on gas, and Premium members get roadside assistance that includes towing and lockout service. Plus costs $89 a year or $7.99 a month; Premium costs $99 a year or $9.99 a month.",
