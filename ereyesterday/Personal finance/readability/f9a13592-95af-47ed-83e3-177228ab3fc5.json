Tuition-free doesn't mean they are \"free\" overall - you may still have to pay for housing, books, and more, but they would be substantially cheaper than the options on this list.Furthermore, there are options like community college or 2-year college, which is free in over half of the United States. This type of school could allow you to take undergraduate general education classes, and then transfer to another school to complete your 4-year degree. How To Lower The Cost You Pay For CollegeEven if you want to attend one of these extremely expensive colleges, there may be ways to lower the price you pay through financial aid incentives.Most of these college advertise generous financial aid packages. Financial aid may come in the form of scholarships (both need-based and merit-based), grants, work study, fellowships, and student loans. To start, you need to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and potentially the CSS Profile, depending on whether your college requires it (and many expensive private schools do).Once you fill out these forms, your college's financial aid office will make a decision regarding potential aid. When you receive an admissions decision, you'll also receive a financial aid award notification that will tell you how much financial aid you will receive if you accept their offer.Depending on various circumstances, you could potentially appeal your financial aid award and ask for more assistance if you need it. The bottom line is that you may be able to lower the cost you pay for college out of pocket.Final ThoughtsCollege is expensive. And these schools are unusually expensive. The average tuition at a private college is $41,450, and all of these colleges are advertising tuition in excess of $65,000 per year.However, just because a college or university is expensive doesn't mean that you personally will pay that price. With all of the various financial aid options available, you could see a significantly reduced out-of-pocket price. Just check out our list of least expensive colleges for inspiration. So don't let the advertised tuition cost scare you away from applying. If one of these expensive colleges is your dream school, you should apply. Just make sure that you also fill out the FAFSA and see if you can get a generous financial aid package as well. Because while these schools may be prestigious, it's important to make sure that college is worth it and you get a positive ROI on your education. Want to read more?** Schools denoted with an asterisk have not published their 2024 - 2025 tuition price as of publication.
