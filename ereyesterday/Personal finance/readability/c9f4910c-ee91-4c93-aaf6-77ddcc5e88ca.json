  "text": "The Exxon Mobil Smart Card+ credit card is a no-frills \"cents-off-per-gallon\" gas station card that can help holders save money at the pumps. But stacked up against similar gas company cards, the Citi-issued Exxon credit card lacks some benefits and features that would otherwise make it a competitive option. For one, it’s a “closed-loop” card, meaning you can only use it at Exxon and Mobil stations. Plus, its rebates for non-fuel purchases won’t get you very far. You’d be better served by a general rewards credit card that offers value back at gas stations and elsewhere.Here’s what to know about the card. 1. You can use it only within the Exxon brandThe Exxon credit card is a closed-loop card meaning it can only be used at Exxon and Mobil stations, which makes the card limiting for holders. For example, Shell offers the \"open loop\" Shell Fuel Rewards Mastercard — a counterpart to its closed-loop version — allowing cardholders to use it anywhere Mastercard is accepted. 2. It earns discounts on branded gas purchases Cardholders get the following discounts at Exxon and Mobil pumps: Save 10 cents per gallon of regular, midgrade and diesel fuel you purchase. Save 12 cents per gallon of premium fuel you purchase. In addition to those discounts, as of this writing, new cardholders are eligible for the following limited-time introductory offer: Through April 30, 2025, earn 30 cents off every gallon or more of Exxon and Mobil fuel purchases in the first month after account opening, paid as a statement credit.The card’s discounts and introductory offer are comparable to what similar fuel company cards feature. And they can help you save a healthy amount of money on gas. But remember, you’ll have to pump exclusively at Exxon and Mobil stations. 3. It comes with a cash-back rebateBeyond gas discounts, the Exxon credit card earns 5% cash back in statement credit rebates on the first $1,200 of non-fuel purchases at Exxon and Mobil stations, per year. This includes convenience store and car wash purchases, but excludes items like gas, lottery, money orders and gift cards.Given how small of a line item those kinds of purchases likely represent for most household budgets, the yearly rebate cap won’t pose much of an obstacle. But it does mean that the most you can expect to save annually on things like gas-station potato chips, coffee and soda is $60.4. You don’t need the card to get Exxon discountsMembers of Exxon Mobil Rewards+, the company’s free fuel rewards program, can also get you discounts and earn rewards for gas purchases. The program's basic tier earns 3 points per gallon on fuel and 2 points for every $1 you spend in Exxon convenience stores and car washes. The tier above that, premium status, gets you 6 points per gallon of Supreme+ premium fuel you purchase at Exxon. (To achieve and maintain premium status, you must fill up with Supreme+ premium gas at least three times a month, with at least 8 gallons for each fill.) Mobil Rewards+ points are worth a penny each and can be redeemed for gas and convenience store items. Put another way, members of the program’s basic tier are earning a 3-cent discount per gallon of gas purchased and a 2-cent discount per dollar spent at Exxon and Mobil stores. The Exxon credit card offers higher discounts for gas purchases than the company's rewards program, and you’ll get your cents-off-per-gallon discount instantly without having to collect or redeem points. But because anyone can join the Exxon Rewards+ program for free, the value proposition for being a cardholder alone is a little lower.Note that the Exxon credit card does not earn Exxon Mobil Rewards+ points, meaning you must pay with a different card to earn those points. That is, discounts earned with the card can't be combined with points earned through the rewards program. 5. There are better gas cardsCo-branded gas station credit cards typically aren't showstoppers, but even for cards in this class, the Exxon credit card stacks up poorly because of its inflexibility and lack of valuable non-fuel rewards. If you're willing to switch gas brands, you might instead consider the BP credit card, which — among co-branded gas cards — is essentially best in class. Not only does it earn discounts at BP and Amoco stations, but it also rewards holders for popular everyday expenses: 3% cash back at grocery purchases, 3% cash back on dining purchases, and 1% cash back on all other non-fuel purchases. And because you're earning cash back (not points or \"cents off\"), redemption is highly flexible.Alternately, if you don't want to be tied down to just one or two gas station brands, a general rewards credit card will be the best bet of all. The Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express, for instance, earns 3% cash back (in the form of statement credit) at U.S. gas stations on up to $6,000 spent per year; 3% back at U.S. supermarkets on up to $6,000 spent per year; and 3% back on U.S. online retail purchases on up to $6,000 spent per year. It offers 1% back on other purchases. Terms apply; see rates and fees. The $0-annual-fee card also features a rich welcome bonus: Earn a $200 statement credit after you spend $2,000 in purchases on your new Card within the first 6 months. Terms Apply.
