I remember the… Are you looking for the best place to sell old coins? We’ve all looked at an old coin at some point and wondered, ‘Is this worth anything?’ Whether it’s a rare find from pocket change, a unique gift from a relative, or a long-forgotten collection, old coins can sometimes be worth something. I remember the first time I found a few coins that were passed down to me. At first, I had no idea where to start, but I quickly learned that these small pieces of history could actually be worth something. Whether you’re looking to sell vintage treasures passed down to you or have a collection you’re ready to get rid of, these coins may be worth more than you think. This can be a great way to make extra money! Best Places To Sell Old Coins Below are the best places to sell old coins. Recommended reading: Where To Cash Coins Near Me 1. Local coin shops Local coin shops are the most straightforward option for selling old coins. You can start by researching the value of your coins using online guides, price books, or coin grading services. When visiting local coin shops, bring your coins in a neatly organized manner which makes sure they’re shown in the best condition. Bring any important certifications or documents about your coins. The dealer has an appraisal process and may even give you free evaluations. I do recommend that you get quotes from several coin shops to make sure you’re getting a fair price for your coins. Keep in mind, that coin shops need to make a profit, so their offer will be lower than retail value. However, selling your coins at a local coin shop can save you time and hassle of online listings or auctions. 2. Coin shows  Coin shows are a way to sell coins directly to collectors in a marketplace. You can research upcoming coin shows and check exhibitor lists to get an idea if the event attracts buyers interested in your type of coins. Then, organize your collection and bring any relevant documentation to help build buyer confidence. When arriving at coin shows, visit dealer tables and ask if they are interested in purchasing your coins. If selling directly to attendees, you’d need to rent a booth to show your coin collection.  This method of selling old coins is great if you want to get fair prices and engage with people who are enthusiastic about coins. 3. eBay  eBay is a popular option to sell old coins (and to sell any other stuff) since the site reaches people all around the world. You can get started by creating an eBay seller account if you don’t already have one. Then, take high-quality photos of your coins, capturing both sides of the coins and any unique details. The listing description should include any information about the coin’s condition, year, mint mark, and certifications. You can choose to set a price or auction depending on your selling strategy. My sister has sold many items on eBay over the years (as well as other people I know), and it’s a great place to sell items to a worldwide audience. 4. Heritage Auctions Heritage Auctions is a global platform for collectors who buy and sell rare or valuable pieces. To get started, visit the Heritage Auctions website and submit a free appraisal request. You simply just tell them what you want to sell with a quick description of your coins. Then, upload high-quality photos of your coins. Heritage Auctions experts will look at your coin collection and recommend the best auction format, including live auctions, internet-only sales, or private transactions. Once your coins are accepted, Heritage Auctions will handle cataloging, photography, and marketing to attract buyers. They do charge a seller’s commission which is deducted from the final sale price. 5. APMEX APMEX (American Precious Metals Exchange) is a platform for people who want to sell bullion, rare coins, or collectible currency. You can simply just go to the APMEX website and go to their “Sell to Us” page. This page allows you to submit an online quote or to give them a phone call. Once you accept the quote, you’ll receive shipping instructions. Once APMEX receives your coins, they’ll verify the coins and finalize the offer to you. They send payment via check, wire transfer, or direct deposit. 6. JM Bullion JM Bullion has a secure process for people wanting to sell bullion coins. To get started selling on JM Bullion, go to their “Sell to Us” page, where you can also review their current buyback prices. These prices are updated regularly to match current market conditions. The “Sell to Us” page lets you select the type of products you want to sell, how much you’re selling, and your personal information. So, this site makes it super easy to sell your coins!

Frequently Asked Questions Below are the most commonly asked questions about selling old coins for money. Where is the best place to sell my coins? The best place to sell your coins depends on the type, value, and your preferred selling method (some are much easier than others!). Some of the most popular places to sell coins include local coin shops and eBay due to the convenience and quick way to sell a collection of old coins. If you want to get the most profit for your coin collection, visit an online platform that specializes in selling coin collections like Heritage Auctions or APMEX. Who gives the most money for old coins?  The value of old coins depends on several factors, including rarity, condition, historical significance, and market demand. If you want to make the most money, I recommend looking into selling your coins at auction houses like Heritage Auctions. How do I find out what my coins are worth?  To find out what your coins are worth, you can use online resources like coin price guides or online coin valuation tools like Coin Value Checker. You can also get an appraisal from a professional at a local coin shop. All kinds of coins can be worth something, such as nickels, dimes, pennies, silver bullion, palladium coins, half dollars, ancient coins (such as Roman currency), proof sets, and more. One rare coin, for example, is the Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle. How to sell coins without getting ripped off? To sell coins without getting ripped off, it’s important to know and learn as much about the coin as you can before selling anything. So, this means that you should identify your coins, get an appraisal, or use free online coin value sites. You can also check previous auctions to see what similar coins sold for. I also recommend that you take your coins to get multiple appraisals at coin shops or coin dealers. This will give you an idea of what to expect. How much is a 1965 quarter worth? The value of a 1965 quarter depends on its condition, if the coins have special features, or if the coins are rare and uncirculated. 1965 quarters in pristine, uncirculated condition sell for as much as $5,000+, whereas circulated 1965 quarters only go for less than $1.  Where to sell old coins online?  There are many places to sell old coins including eBay, Heritage Auctions, GreatCollections, and APMEX.
