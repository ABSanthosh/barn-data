  "text": "Source: The College Investor The Student Aid Index (SAI) replaced the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) for the FAFSA (which families are filing right now).However, this has led to a lot of confusion. What does SAI mean? What's a good SAI? Will I still get aid? Is the SAI what you're expected to pay for college?Here's what you need to know.What Is The Student Aid Index (SAI)?The Student Aid Index (SAI) is just like it sounds - an index. The number represents a rough estimate of your family's financial need for college. It's very much like the Expected Family Contribution (EFC), but due to the confusing nature of the EFC, lawmakers have decided to make a change. However, the reality is that the change is mostly in name.The goal was really to highlight that the Student Aid Index is NOT necessarily what you're expected to pay for college. Instead, it's just a numerical representation of your family's financial need. The SAI is also used to calculate Pell Grant eligibility, and potentially your ability to receive some state grants. What Is A \"Good\" SAI?When most people ask about a \"good\" SAI, they're wanting to know what SAI number will qualify for the most financial aid.But it's important to remember that it's not the SAI that \"gives\" you aid - the Department of Education forwards your FAFSA and SAI information to your college, who then can award you financial aid. That financial aid award may include Federal grants, university scholarships, student loans, work study, and more.The idea behind the SAI is to better quantify financial need.The lower the SAI number, the more financial need your family has. The lowest possible SAI is -1500. An SAI from -1500 to 0 qualifies for the full Pell Grant.An SAI above 0 may still get a Pell Grant, but it will depend on the cost of attendance of your college. You can see how the formula for Pell Grants works here.As your SAI gets higher, the less financial need your family is demonstrating. Once your SAI is above 20,000, the odds of getting need-based financial aid will be slim, except at the most expensive colleges.You can see the full breakdown in this SAI chart.People Also AskWhat Does An SAI Of -1500 Mean?A negative SAI of -1500 is the lowest possible SAI score. It means that you're eligible for a full Pell Grant, and will likely qualify for other need-based financial aid.What Is A High SAI?The SAI has no upper limit. However, once your SAI exceeds 30,000, it's very unlikely you'll receive any type of need-based financial aid.What Is A Low SAI?The lowest SAI is -1500. However, an SAI from -1500 to 0 is all considered the same and qualified for a full Pell Grant.Related Articles Robert Farrington is America’s Millennial Money Expert® and America’s Student Loan Debt Expert™, and the founder of The College Investor, a personal finance site dedicated to helping millennials escape student loan debt to start investing and building wealth for the future.
