You’re not alone in thinking that Amazon affiliate links don’t pay much money. One of the most common questions I get from bloggers… Do you love sharing Amazon affiliate links, but feel like the commissions are just too low to be worth it? This Levanta Review will show you how you can make more money. You’re not alone in thinking that Amazon affiliate links don’t pay much money. One of the most common questions I get from bloggers is: “How can I make more money from Amazon links?” Amazon Associates is easy to use and widely accepted, but the commission rates are very low. Most product categories pay around 1% to 4%, which means you could be driving hundreds of clicks and still only earn a few dollars. If you’ve ever wondered how to actually earn more from Amazon affiliate links, there’s a new tool that might help. Levanta is a free platform that helps bloggers, influencers, and content creators increase their Amazon affiliate income by working directly with brands that sell on Amazon. With Levanta, commissions are around 20% on average, but can be as high as 100% (you can see an example of this in the screenshot below). The way brands are able to offer such high commission rates, such as 100%, is due to the Brand Referral Bonus they receive from Amazon for driving off-site traffic directly to Amazon for purchase. This offsets their commissions, which in return, allows them to offer VERY competitive rates, some up to 100%. Levanta uses Amazon Attribution to track your links, and best of all, it’s free to use. Whether you’re writing product roundups, sending gift guides to your email list, or sharing favorite finds on social media, Levanta can help you turn those links into more income, without changing your process. Levanta can be a smart way to earn more from the content you’re already creating, especially if you regularly share Amazon links in blog posts, emails, or on social media. Please click here to learn more about Levanta. Levanta Review In this Levanta review, I’m going to walk you through what it is, how it works, who it’s for, and more. What is Levanta? One of the questions I hear most often from bloggers is: “How can I actually make money from Amazon links?” Amazon Associates is one of the most popular affiliate programs out there, but let’s be honest – the commission rates are really, really low. In many cases, you’re earning just a few cents per click, even when you’re sending good traffic. And, the tracking period is low as well, at just 24 hours. That’s where Levanta comes in. Levanta is an affiliate marketing platform that helps content creators earn more from product links across leading marketplaces like Amazon. If you’re already part of Amazon Associates, you know that commissions are usually pretty low, sometimes just 1% to 4% depending on the category. Levanta gives brands a way to pay you higher commissions. That means you could earn more from the exact same traffic. Levanta isn’t a replacement for the Amazon Associates program. While Levanta can work in parallel with the Amazon Associates program, creators may naturally prioritize Levanta links where applicable due to higher commission rates. There are many products (over 830,000!) that you can promote through Levanta, as you can see in this screenshot. Why you might want to use Levanta There are several reasons why Levanta could be helpful for bloggers and influencers: Earn more per click – Many brands on Levanta pay 20%, or even more for specific products. Works with your current setup – You don’t have to stop using Amazon Associates. Connect directly with brands – Levanta acts as a bridge between you and companies that want to get more visibility for their products on Amazon. Built for creators – The platform was designed specifically for people who create online content, so the dashboard and tools are made to be easy to use. Great for seasonal content – Levanta can help you earn more during high-traffic times like Prime Day, Black Friday, and the holidays. You can request free samples from brands – Another benefit of Levanta is that you can request product samples directly from brands after you’ve partnered with them. So, this can be a great way to make sure that the product is a good fit before you promote it, as well as being able to write a genuine review. Creator Connections Integration – Another benefit of Levanta is its integration with Creator Connections. As a creator, you’ll have the ability to unlock extra earnings through Loyalty Bonuses and gain access to vastly improved reporting, all while still working toward your Amazon goals. Consolidate your affiliate efforts, improve your promotional abilities, and earn more – all without any extra work or fees. How Levanta works Here’s a simplified version of how the process works: You sign up for Levanta as a creator (it’s free) by clicking here. Look for products that you want to promote. You’ll apply to become an affiliate by going to the Discovery tab and browsing through the Product Catalogue, or you can search through invites that you receive from brands. Create your affiliate links. Levanta gives you affiliate links to share after you’ve been approved by a brand. Share your links. Add them to blog posts, email newsletters, social media, or anywhere else. Track your performance. Use the Levanta dashboard to see clicks, commissions, and bonus earnings. You get paid 30 days after the end of the month in which the conversion was earned, directly from Levanta. Pros and cons of Levanta Here’s what I think are the pros and cons of Levanta: Pros of using Levanta: Higher commissions from brands (Levanta has commissions that are, on average, 3 to 8x higher than Amazon Associates) The 14-day cookie window is great because you can capture more sales with a 14-day tracking window, compared to Amazon Associates’ 24-hour cookie period. No cost to join as a creator Connects you to brands directly Manage your Amazon Attribution and Associates collaborations in a single dashboard Easy-to-use platform built for creators Cons of using Levanta: Not every product or brand is listed. Best results likely come from higher-ticket items. You don’t get paid for other items in the person’s Amazon cart. Here is an example of the commission you can earn by using Levanta for your Amazon affiliate links. Who Levanta is best for Levanta can work well for a variety of content creators, including: Bloggers and publishers who regularly include Amazon links in posts YouTubers who do product reviews or tutorials Instagram or TikTok influencers who share shopping guides Pinterest users who link to Amazon items Email marketers who send out product roundups If you already use Amazon Associates and want to earn more without completely changing your setup, Levanta might be a helpful addition to your monetization strategy. How to get started with Levanta If you want to try Levanta, here’s how to get started: Go to Levanta and sign up as a creator. Browse available products you want to promote in Levanta. Create affiliate links and start adding them to your blog posts or social media. Check your dashboard for clicks, sales, and brand offers. There’s no cost to join, and you don’t need a huge following to get started. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about Levanta. How much do Amazon affiliates get paid? It varies. Most Amazon Associates earn between 1% and 10% depending on the product category. Levanta helps increase those earnings by letting brands offer custom commissions, sometimes 20% or more. Does Levanta pay commission on the entire Amazon cart? When I first looked into Levanta, one question popped up in my head: “If I use a Levanta link and someone ends up buying other things from Amazon, but not the exact item they clicked on, do I still earn commission on those extra purchases?” The short answer: No, Levanta does not pay commissions on the full cart. The commission from Levanta is strictly tied to the specific product you promoted via their link. So, I do think this is a downside, especially if readers typically click on your Amazon affiliate marketing links but end up buying other items. But, if readers typically click on your link and buy the item you linked to, then this can be a great way to earn a higher commission rate. Do I have to pay money to use Levanta as a creator/blogger? Nope! It’s completely free to sign up and use Levanta. There are no hidden fees or monthly costs as a creator. Levanta only costs money if you are an Amazon seller. Is Levanta part of Amazon Associates? No, Levanta is a separate platform that works alongside Amazon Associates using Amazon Attribution tracking. It’s not owned or run by Amazon. Can I still use my normal Amazon links? Yes! Levanta doesn’t stop you from using your existing Amazon links. Do I need a big audience to join Levanta? Not at all. Creators of all sizes can use Levanta. You don’t need a huge blog or massive social media following. How do I get paid from Levanta? Levanta pays monthly payments through Stripe. You’ll enter your payout info during the setup process, and you can track your earnings in the dashboard. Can I use Levanta links on Pinterest or in emails? Yes. You can share Levanta links the same way you share any affiliate link – in blog posts, emails, YouTube descriptions, Pinterest pins, and more. Of course, you’ll just want to make sure you follow FTC disclosure guidelines. Is Levanta worth it for small bloggers? If you’re already using Amazon Associates, Levanta could be a great way to increase your income with very little extra work. It’s free to try (and there is no monthly fee). Levanta Review – Summary I hope you enjoyed my Levanta Review. I think Levanta looks like a smart way to make more money with your Amazon affiliate links. You don’t need to change your content or jump through a bunch of hoops. If you’re a blogger, influencer, or content creator who regularly promotes Amazon products, Levanta might be worth checking out.

Levanta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much do Amazon affiliates get paid?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt varies. Most Amazon Associates earn between 1% and 10% depending on the product category. Levanta helps increase those earnings by letting brands offer custom commissions, sometimes 20% or more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes Levanta pay commission on the entire Amazon cart?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first looked into Levanta, one question popped up in my head: “If I use a Levanta link and someone ends up buying other things from Amazon, but not the exact item they clicked on, do I still earn commission on those extra purchases?” The short answer: No, Levanta does not pay commissions on the full cart. The commission from Levanta is strictly tied to the specific product you promoted via their link. So, I do think this is a downside, especially if readers typically click on your Amazon affiliate marketing links but end up buying other items. But, if readers typically click on your link and buy the item you linked to, then this can be a great way to earn a higher commission rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay money to use Levanta as a creator/blogger?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNope! It’s completely free to sign up and use Levanta. There are no hidden fees or monthly costs as a creator. Levanta only costs money if you are an Amazon seller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs Levanta part of Amazon Associates?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Levanta is a separate platform that works alongside Amazon Associates using Amazon Attribution tracking. It’s not owned or run by Amazon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I still use my normal Amazon links?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes!

You can share Levanta links the same way you share any affiliate link – in blog posts, emails, YouTube descriptions, Pinterest pins, and more. Of course, you’ll just want to make sure you follow FTC disclosure guidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs Levanta worth it for small bloggers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re already using Amazon Associates, Levanta could be a great way to increase your income with very little extra work.
