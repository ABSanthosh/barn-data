Scammers constantly refine their tactics, using specific phrases designed to trick unsuspecting individuals. This article identifies 12 common phrases that should immediately raise red flags for a scammer alert. However, awareness and other preventative measures can help protect you from falling victim to these deceitful tactics.1. “This is an urgent public service announcement.”When you hear this, your first reaction might be to listen closely and act quickly. Scammers use this phrase to create a sense of urgency, mimicking official alerts. The intentional use of this phrase causes people to bypass rational thinking and act without skepticism. But remember, genuine public services have other ways of getting in touch. Always double-check these alerts by contacting official sources through their verified channels.2. “You have won a free vacation!”It’s exciting to imagine vacations to sandy beaches and sunny skies, especially if it’s free. However, these offers are often too good to be true. Furthermore, they may lead to phishing attempts or hidden costs. This phrase is a classic hook for scams and should automatically put you on high alert. Always ignore such claims and report suspicious numbers to consumer protection agencies.3. “I need to verify your account details.”This is a common tactic among scammers pretending to be representatives from your bank or a service provider. These types of scams have become even more common following a data breach. However, no credible organization would ask for sensitive details outright. Therefore, this phrase should be an immediate scammer alert.When data breaches happen, organizations establish processes and procedures to contain them. If you receive such a request, hang up. Do not share any personal information. Instead, contact the institution directly using a known and secure method.4. “There’s a problem with your payment.”This phrase preys on your fear of financial mishaps. Scammers know that people will do whatever is necessary to avoid additional fees and disruption of service. They use this phrase in the hope of catching you off guard so you provide them with payment information out of panic.Rather than sharing your account information, check the validity of their claims first. Always verify any payment issues by logging into your account independently or calling customer service directly. These measures could prevent you from wasting time and money.5. “Confirm your identity with your password.”If you hear this one, it’s a major red flag! Legitimate companies understand the security risks of sharing personal information. In fact, policies prevent them from asking for your password or security code over the phone.When you hear this phrase, end the call immediately. Then, report the incident to the company being impersonated. It could help prevent others from falling victim to these scams.6. “This is your final warning.”Using threats of legal or financial consequences is a common tactic to intimidate people. However, it is also a scammer alert. Real organizations do not operate this way and will provide ample opportunity for resolution through proper channels. When you get this call, don’t panic. Instead, keep calm, don’t engage, and seek professional advice if needed.7. “You owe taxes and must pay immediately.”This scam becomes especially prevalent around tax season and plays on people’s deep-seated fear of owing money to the government. Taxes induce a sense of anxiety for most citizens, and scammers exploit these feelings for their own gain. Remember, the IRS communicates through mail, not unexpected phone calls. You can always verify any tax claims directly through official IRS channels to protect your finances.8. “We’ve noticed suspicious activity on your account.”By suggesting that your account is at risk, scammers aim to make you act hastily to ‘protect’ your assets. However, impulsive decisions could put you at greater risk. This phrase is a trick to get your personal information or financial details. Never disclose these details if someone contacts you. Instead, reach out to your bank directly using official numbers, not those provided during a suspicious call.9. “I’m calling from tech support.”If you didn’t request assistance, why would tech support call you? The answer shouldn’t surprise you. This is a tactic to gain access to your computer or personal information under the guise of fixing an issue. Some scammers are after information while others seek to sell you useless software. Don’t become an unsuspecting victim. Always verify the legitimacy of the call by contacting the company they claim to be representing.10. “Can you hear me?”This seems like a harmless question, right? Unfortunately, it’s not. It’s a method for scammers to record your voice saying “Yes,” which they can use to authorize fraudulent charges. When you hear this question, it’s best to hang up immediately. Then, check your accounts and statements for any unauthorized activity.11. “Please make a donation.”Charity scams prey on your generosity, often during times of crisis. However, this shouldn’t prevent you from donating to causes and organizations you want to support. To ensure your donation goes to a legitimate cause, donate directly through trusted organizations’ websites instead. Never respond to unsolicited calls or provide payment information when people call you.12. “You must decide right now.”Scammers use high-pressure tactics to force a quick decision. The goal is to get you to commit before you have the chance to think it through or consult others. However, you should never act impulsively when you make important decisions. Instead, take your time, seek advice, and never make hasty financial commitments over the phone.Prevention and AwarenessBy staying informed and cautious, you can protect yourself and your loved ones from falling prey to these common scams. Remember, if something sounds suspicious or too good to be true, it usually is. So if you hear any of these phrases, it should be a red flag and scammer alert. Always take the time to verify the legitimacy of any unsolicited communication. Stay safe and help others stay informed of tactics such as these.Read MoreHow To Tell the Difference Between a Legitimate Debt Collector and ScammersImmediate Steps to Take if You Suspect Fraudulent Charges on Your Credit CardCome back to what you love!
