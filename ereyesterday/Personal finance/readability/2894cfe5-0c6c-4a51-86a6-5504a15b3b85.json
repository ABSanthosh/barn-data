In today’s world, it’s easy to hand over your name, email, phone number, and other details without thinking twice. But sharing too much can lead to big problems like identity theft, stolen credit card information, and scams.  These issues… Have you ever stopped to think about what happens when you share your personal information online? In today’s world, it’s easy to hand over your name, email, phone number, and other details without thinking twice. But sharing too much can lead to big problems like identity theft, stolen credit card information, and scams.  These issues go beyond just money—they can cause stress, frustration, and long-term risks to your privacy. Every year, millions of people fall for scams, and the methods used by hackers are becoming harder to spot. From fake emails to identity theft, these threats can catch even the most cautious among us off guard. I see scams all the time, and sometimes they look quite real where even I am questioning if it’s real or not! Just last week, I was waiting on an email from my insurance agent when I received a very similar-looking and sounding email from a scammer claiming to be my agent. The email topic was even similar to what I was talking to my agent about. I almost fell for the scam because I wasn’t focused and paying attention. A friend of mine once lost their home deposit during a phishing scam. They received an email from someone pretending to be their mortgage lender. Everything looked legitimate, right down to the sender’s name. But it was a trick, and they ended up losing $25,000.  Fortunately, there are tools and strategies that can help protect your personal information and reduce these risks. Let’s look at the dangers of oversharing and the steps you can take to protect your information. The Real Dangers of Sharing Personal Information First, let’s talk about the real dangers of sharing your personal information. 1. Identity theft Identity theft happens when someone steals your personal information and pretends to be you.  Thieves can use your name, Social Security number, or other details to open credit cards, take out loans, or even commit crimes. This can cost you a lot of money and time to fix. Did you know that millions of people deal with identity theft every year? The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says that many victims spend over $1,000 of their own money to solve the problem. And that’s not counting all the hours spent fixing credit reports and arguing with banks.  It’s a huge headache. 2. Stolen credit card information Your credit card information can be stolen in many ways. Hackers might get it through a data breach, a skimming device at a store, or even a fake website. Once they have your card details, they can make purchases in your name. While banks often cover fraudulent charges, it can take weeks to fix everything. Meanwhile, your bills might be late, and you could face fees. Globally, credit card fraud costs billions of dollars every year. And even if you’re reimbursed, the stress and inconvenience are real. You might have to get a new card, update your auto-pay accounts, and monitor your statements closely. 3. Phishing scams Phishing scams can come in the form of fake emails or messages that look like they’re from trusted companies. They’re designed to trick you into sharing personal details, like passwords or account numbers.  These scams are getting harder to detect.  A single click on a fraudulent link can give hackers access to sensitive information. My friend’s story is a sad reminder: even the smallest mistake can lead to big consequences. 4. Phone number scams Your phone number might seem harmless, but scammers can use it to do serious harm. With just your number, they can: Access your online accounts – Many websites use your phone number for account recovery. Scammers can trick mobile carriers into transferring your number to their SIM card (a process called SIM swapping). This lets them hijack your accounts, including email, banking, and social media. Phishing and smishing – Scammers might call or text you pretending to be from a legitimate company. They can use these interactions to steal sensitive information, leading to you losing money or unauthorized access to your accounts. These scams are getting harder to spot because they look so real. To protect yourself, it’s important to limit where you share your phone number and use tools like Surfshark’s Alternative Number, which gives you a virtual number for safer interactions online. Costs Beyond Money The financial problems caused by sharing your information are bad enough, but there are other hidden costs too: 1. Stress and anxiety Imagine finding out someone stole your identity or emptied your bank account. The stress can be A LOT! It can take months of phone calls, emails, and paperwork to sort everything out.  2. Loss of trust Once your information is stolen, it’s hard to trust websites, apps, or even emails. You might hesitate to shop online or sign up for services. This can make everyday tasks more difficult. 3. Ongoing risks Even if you fix the problem, your information might still be out there. Hackers can sell your data, and it could be used again. This means you have to stay alert and keep monitoring your accounts. How to Protect Yourself The best way to avoid these problems is to take steps to protect your information. Here are some simple tips: 1. Have smart online habits – Use strong passwords: Make sure your passwords are long and unique for each account. Don’t reuse old passwords as these can sometimes be found in the dark web. – Turn on two-factor authentication: This adds an extra layer of security. Even if someone steals your password, they can’t get into your account without a second verification step (such as getting a code sent to your cell phone via text message). – Be careful what you share: Think before you share personal details, especially on social media. – Don’t click suspicious links: If an email or message looks fishy, don’t click on it. Go directly to the website instead. – Call the person directly to confirm wire information: Don’t just rely on the email. I ALWAYS call and talk to a real person that I know. You don’t just want to call the person listed in the email, in case the email is fake. Instead, find the person’s phone number that you have been dealing with and call them – it only takes a moment to do and can save you from falling for a scam. – Use the identity theft notification tools to be alerted when your real information or your family information is on the internet (Surfshark has an alert, which you can find here) 2. Use privacy tools Surfshark’s tools make protecting your personal information much easier. Here’s how: – Alternative ID: This tool gives you a new identity to use online. It includes a fake name, email address, and other details, so you don’t have to share your real information. This is great for signing up for websites or newsletters without worrying about spam or data breaches. You can learn more about Surfshark Alternative ID here. – Alternative Number: This is a virtual phone number you can use instead of your real one. It’s perfect for online shopping or any time you need to give out a phone number. You can still receive calls and texts, but your real number stays private. You can even use this number to register for discounts so that your real phone number stays spam-free. An Alternative Number can minimize data sharing, robocalls, SMS phishing, and more. You can learn more about Surfshark Alternative Number here. Surfshark also sells a VPN to encrypt your internet connection, CleanWeb to block ads and trackers, and a data breach monitoring feature.  It’s an all-in-one solution for privacy and security.  What I like about Surfshark is how user-friendly it is. You don’t need to be tech-savvy to use it, and their customer support is always there if you have questions. Please click here to learn more about Surfshark. Why Privacy Saves Money Protecting your information doesn’t just keep you safe—it can also save you money. Here’s how: 1. Avoiding expensive fixes Recovering from identity theft or fraud can be very expensive. You might have to hire a lawyer, pay for credit monitoring, or cover fraudulent charges until your bank reimburses you.  2. No hidden fees When your accounts are compromised, you might miss bill payments because your bank freezes your account. This can lead to late fees or even higher interest rates. Keeping your information safe helps you avoid these costs. 3. Long-term benefits The peace of mind that comes with protecting your information is priceless. You can shop, browse, and sign up for services without worrying about scams or breaches. Plus, by preventing problems now, you’re saving yourself time and money in the future. What You Can Do Right Now To Protect Your Personal Information Your personal information is valuable (and important!), and protecting it is easier than you think. Don’t wait until it’s too late.  I still remember the stress I felt the first time I got a suspicious email claiming to be from my bank, and it’s what pushed me to take protecting my personal information more seriously. By taking control of your personal information, you’re also taking control of your financial future. Stay safe, stay private, and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing your information is secure. Please click here to learn more about Surfshark.
