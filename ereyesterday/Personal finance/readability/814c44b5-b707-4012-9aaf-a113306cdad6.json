If your income doesn’t come with taxes automatically withheld, the IRS expects you to pay throughout the year in the form of estimated quarterly taxes. And if you don’t, you could face penalties, interest charges, or a big surprise come tax season.From freelancers and landlords to retirees and side hustlers, more people than ever are finding themselves in situations where quarterly payments aren’t optional. They’re necessary for staying in good standing with the IRS and avoiding steep financial consequences. Let’s explore ten specific times when quarterly tax payments make sense—or are outright required.1. When You’re Self-Employed or a FreelancerIf you’re self-employed, even part-time, the IRS considers you both the employee and the employer. That means you’re responsible not only for income taxes but also self-employment taxes, which include Social Security and Medicare. Since no taxes are withheld from your earnings, you’re expected to pay estimated taxes every quarter. The general rule? If you expect to owe at least $1,000 in taxes for the year, quarterly payments are likely required.2. When You Have a Profitable Side HustleSelling products on Etsy, driving for Uber, offering tutoring services—whatever the gig, income from side hustles is taxable. Many people assume that if they have a full-time job with taxes already being withheld, they’re covered. But if your side hustle brings in additional profit and you don’t adjust your withholdings or pay quarterly taxes on it, you could end up underpaying. The IRS won’t care that it’s “just a little extra money.” If the numbers add up, they’ll expect a quarterly share.3. When You Earn Investment IncomeDividends, interest, and capital gains can all contribute to your tax liability. If your investments are generating substantial income and you’re not having taxes withheld, like from a traditional brokerage account, you’re on the hook to estimate and pay taxes quarterly. This is especially common for retirees or wealthier individuals with diversified portfolios that produce non-wage income throughout the year.4. When You Collect Rental IncomeRental properties can generate steady monthly cash flow, but that income isn’t taxed as it comes in. Unless you’ve made arrangements to withhold taxes elsewhere, you’ll likely need to pay estimated taxes quarterly. Plus, rental property owners often deduct expenses like repairs or mortgage interest. If you’re unsure how to accurately estimate your taxes after deductions, it’s worth speaking to a tax professional to avoid underpayment.5. When You Sell a Big AssetSold a house, a car, or even cryptocurrency at a profit? That gain is considered taxable income. If the transaction happened early in the year and pushed your income higher than expected, it could trigger the need for a quarterly payment. Even if you only had one big financial event, you may need to report and pay taxes on that gain during the quarter it occurred, not just at year’s end.Image source: Unsplash6. When You’re Retired but Still Receiving Taxable IncomeMany retirees live on a mix of Social Security, pensions, and investment withdrawals. While some income sources may have taxes withheld, others—like traditional IRA withdrawals—may not. If your retirement income pushes you into a tax-owing position and not enough is withheld automatically, quarterly payments may be your best bet to avoid penalties.7. When You’re a High-Income Earner Without WithholdingIf your primary job doesn’t withhold enough taxes or you earn a lot of income from multiple sources, you could end up owing far more than expected. Even salaried employees with high investment or bonus income should double-check their withholdings and consider quarterly payments to balance things out. The IRS expects you to cover at least 90% of your total tax liability by year-end to avoid penalties, and quarterly payments can help you stay on target.8. When You Own an S-Corp or LLCMany small business owners operate as S corporations or limited liability companies (LLCs). These entities often pass income through to the owner’s personal return, making the owner responsible for estimated taxes on their share of profits. Quarterly taxes help manage that burden in real-time rather than facing a huge tax bill at filing.These types of entities also often deal with complex deductions and write-offs, further reinforcing the need to stay organized and current with payments.9. When You Want to Avoid IRS PenaltiesEven if your situation is borderline, paying estimated taxes can offer peace of mind. The IRS imposes penalties for underpayment that can compound over time. If you’re unsure whether you’re required to pay quarterly, a conservative approach is often safest. Better to slightly overpay and get a refund than to underpay and face interest or fines.10. When You Experience a Sudden Income ChangeA surprise bonus, inheritance, or sudden freelance project can change your tax picture quickly. If you experience a windfall early in the year, that extra income could require you to start quarterly payments even if you didn’t need them previously. Waiting until tax time to settle up could mean cutting a much bigger check than expected, plus potential penalties.The Bottom Line on Quarterly TaxesQuarterly tax payments might seem like a hassle, but they’re a proactive step toward responsible financial planning. They help you avoid big surprises, keep you in compliance with the IRS, and give you more control over your money year-round.Remember, if you’re earning income that isn’t subject to withholding or if your withholdings are insufficient, quarterly tax payments aren’t just a recommendation. They’re a necessity.Have you ever had to make quarterly tax payments, and if so, was it easier or harder than you expected? What tips would you give others considering the same move?Read More:Here’s What You Should Do If You’re Self Employed And Want to Retire12 Little-Known Financial Perks of Being a FreelancerRiley is an Arizona native with over nine years of writing experience.
