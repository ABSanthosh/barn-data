Key Features of Block Advisors Business Formation Services Here are a few of the features of Block Advisors’ business formation services that stood out to us the most: Savings Calculator We were impressed with Block Advisors’ S Corp Savings Calculator, which shows you how much you could save on self-employment taxes with an S Corp election. To determine that number, you simply enter your income, salary (if applicable), and estimated Social Security income withheld to see your estimated tax savings. It’s a convenient tool that can help you see the financial benefits of setting your business up as an S Corporation firsthand. Business Structure Quiz In addition to providing a convenient savings calculator, Block Advisors also has a quick quiz to help you zero in on the best structure for your business.  Based on your answers to the short questionnaire, it recommends a business structure for your venture, breaking down its main benefits and key considerations.  You can also compare alternative business structures here and visit Block Advisors’ resource center for more insights. While it isn’t a substitute for legal advice, the quiz is a great starting point for determining the best structure for your business. Resource Center If you’re simply looking to learn more about the different types of business structures, Block Advisors has a wealth of articles in its Small Business Resource Center. There are dozens of guides spanning a range of topics on everything from business formation to small business grants and home office deductions.
