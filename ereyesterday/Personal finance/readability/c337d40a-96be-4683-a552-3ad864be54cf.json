Survey Suggests Many Consumers Underestimate Time, Emotional Value Of Working With A Financial Advisor (Paulo Costa, Marsella Martino, Malena de la Fuente | Advisor Perspectives) Consumers who decide to work with a (human) financial advisor for the first time can have a range of reasons for doing so (e.g., they're on the verge of retirement or recently received a large inheritance and are unsure how to handle it). Nevertheless, while they might expect that a financial advisor can solve their immediate 'pain point', they might not be aware of the full scope of ways that advisors can add value (and the extent to which working with an advisor could reduce their stress and save them time). According to a survey by Vanguard of 12,443 investors who use its services (which include self-directed investing as well as human-provided and digital advice), while only 38% of investors reported considering time savings when signing up to receive financial advice, 76% of advised clients report saving time (a median of two hours per week, or more than 100 hours per year), suggesting there is an unexpected 'bonus' of getting financial advice for many clients. Further, clients working with a human advisor also were more likely to report time savings versus those working with a digital advice solution (78% versus 62%), indicating there is a time-savings premium from working with a human advisor. Separately, 86% of advised clients reported having greater peace of mind when thinking about their finances after working with an advisor (human advisors also performed stronger here compared to digital advice solutions, with 88% of clients working with the former getting emotional value, compared to 69% of the latter). The survey also compared differences between advised and self-directed investors on Vanguard's platform when it comes to financial stress. It found that 50% of advised clients reported low levels of financial stress compared to 32% of self-directed investors, while only 14% of advised clients reported high levels of financial stress, compared to 27% of self-directed investors (and while financial advisors almost certainly can reduce a client's financial stress by addressing their 'pain points' and creating a plan that allows them to achieve their goals, this finding is correlational [rather than causal], and could be affected by other factors, such as the differing levels of wealth between the two groups). Altogether, these findings suggest that while many prospects might approach a (human) advisor with an immediate 'pain point', there is potentially room for advisors to sell their value in areas a prospect might not have considered, whether in time savings (a way for clients to 'buy' time for leisure activities that can boost their happiness) or emotional value (a differentiator not only between self-directed investors and advisory clients, but also between digital- and human-provided advice). Which not only could lead to more prospects becoming clients, but also more long-term client relationships once they realize the full scope of the value human advisors can provide! (Leo Almazora | InvestmentNews) A key trend in financial advice is the graying of the advisor population and its impact on individual firms (with founders deciding whether to pursue an internal succession plan or sell to an external buyer) and the industry as a whole (which could see changes as next-gen advisors build their businesses in their own styles). Perhaps not surprisingly, according to a survey of 3,698 advisors in the broker-dealer channel by J.D. Power, 46% of respondents said they are within 10 years of retirement, with 26% of them already age 65 or older (though many advisors might choose to continue working well past 'traditional' retirement age given the satisfaction working as an advisor can provide). Given the anticipated coming turnover among advisors, the survey asked relatively younger advisors about their priorities and how their firms could better meet their needs. The survey found that only 20% of advisors under age 40 said their firm was conscious of its public brand image (a factor likely important to this group, who could be more likely to gain clients based on their firm's image compared to more established advisors with a larger established client base from which to gain referrals). In addition, while 45% of younger advisors selected social media as a priority for marketing investment, only 32% said such support they get from their firm is \"very valuable\". Another potential innovation for firms to consider is adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered tools, with 35% of overall respondents selecting it as the top priority for increased tech investment by their firm (the survey also found that overall advisor satisfaction with their firm and brand advocacy scores were significantly higher among advisors using AI tools). In sum, these results suggest that next-generation advisors at broker dealers could be looking for greater technology, branding, and social media support from their firms as they begin to take on more leadership roles. Which could be valuable insights for their firms to consider, as dissatisfied advisors could look to start their own firms in order to gain greater freedom on marketing, technology, and branding decisions? RIA M\u0026A Volume Hits Record In First Half Of 2025 (Financial Advisor) The number of RIA Merger and Acquisition (M\u0026A) deals reached a record-high of 272 in 2024, according to RIA M\u0026A consultancy DeVoe \u0026 Company, with many Private Equity (PE)-backed buyers scooping up smaller firms (accounting for 72% of all transactions) and acquirors benefiting from a cooling of interest rates. Nonetheless, entering 2025, questions remained as to whether this brisk pace would continue, particularly as firms faced a volatile equity market during the first half of the year (which could have put deals on the backburner given the need to turn attention inward towards client service during this period). Despite these potential headwinds, the first six months of 2025 saw a record-number of RIA deals for the period, with 148 transactions (up 17% from the previous year), potentially presaging a record number of deals for the full year (set last year with 272). Notably, mid- and large RIAs represented nearly half of all sellers in the second quarter, with the average Assets Under Management (AUM) per seller surpassing $1 billion (nearing the high set in 2021). Drivers for the robust deal volume are familiar, according to DeVoe, including retiring advisors (without an internal succession plan, which can be especially challenging for large firms where the internal purchase price could be tens of millions of dollars) looking for an exit, and continued Private Equity (PE) interest in the industry (with 79% of the deals being driven directly or indirectly by PE firms). More broadly, the ongoing growth of transactions in 2024 and now 2025 is also notable, as rising interest rates in recent years were predicted to decrease purchase activity (which didn't happen), and more recent market volatility was also predicted to decrease purchase activity (which didn't happen either). Instead, buying and selling activity has remained robust and in fact continues to grow, despite market volatility, higher interest rates, and ongoing record-high valuations of independent advisory firms. Which suggests that the underlying drivers – from the challenges of succession planning and internal deal-making (especially at larger firms) to the strength of the independent advisory model with its recurring revenues (that allow deals to continue to be done at these multiples) – remain quite healthy. In the end, RIA M\u0026A activity appears to be continuing at a robust pace, with interest from both buyers looking to continue to scale and sellers interested in growing within a larger firm, alongside traditional succession- and liquidity-related drivers. Though it's notable that when the economics of advisory firms remain strong, internal succession does appear to remain a viable option in the current environment as well for founders who would prefer their firms remain independent after they retire, especially as next-gen advisors now have an increasing range of available financing options to allow them to pursue firm ownership without necessarily putting significant strain on their personal financial situation (but they still have to have the risk tolerance to take on a multi-million-dollar debt to pursue the opportunity!). The New Math Of Roth Conversions Under OBBBA (Melanie Waddell | ThinkAdvisor) The passage of the  \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" (OBBBA) has created a wide range of tax considerations for financial advisors and their clients, from changes to itemized deductions (e.g., a temporary increase in the deductibility of State And Local Taxes [SALT]) to new 'below-the-line' deductions (e.g., for certain charitable contributions, qualified times, and qualified overtime compensation). In addition, tax expert Ed Slott notes that the new law introduces new considerations for advisors and their clients considering (partial) Roth conversions in 2025 or in the coming years. To start, the 'permanent' (i.e., without a scheduled sunset date) extension of the tax brackets enacted under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) could continue to make Roth conversions attractive in the coming years (i.e., if clients think brackets will be adjusted upward in the future), particularly for clients who can 'fill up' the 10% and 12% brackets (though clients whose other income puts them higher brackets might consider filling up those 'buckets' as well). However, the law also includes phase-out ranges for different tax savings opportunities, which could be considered when deciding whether (and how much) to convert. For instance, the new $6,000 deduction for individuals age 65 and older (which lasts from 2025 through 2028) phases out once a household's Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) reaches $75,000 (for single filers) or $150,000 (for joint filers) and is fully phased out at MAGI of $175,000 (single) and $250,000 (joint). Which means that advisors could offer value by analyzing the value (and tradeoffs) of a (partial) Roth conversion for clients with income near these phase-out ranges. Another consideration for making (partial) Roth conversions is the phase-out range associated with the new $40,000 SALT cap (which starts at MAGI of $500,000 for single, head of household, and married filing jointly filers, with those with MAGI above $600,000 being fully phased out and subject to the previous $10,000 limit), as this deduction could be particularly valuable for those in high tax brackets with elevated SALT burdens. Ultimately, the key point is that the new tax law creates new considerations for advisors when analyzing a client's (true) marginal tax rate to consider the value of a Roth conversion. Which can offer clients significant value through strategic (partial) Roth conversions that take into account the client's income in a given year, new deduction phase-out ranges, and other potential tax opportunities (e.g., harvesting capital gains) that could lead to a lower lifetime tax bill! How To Avoid RMD Mistakes Around Roth Conversions (Robert Bloink and William Byrnes | ThinkAdvisor) Clients who have retired but have not yet reached their Required Beginning Date (RBD) for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from their 'traditional' retirement accounts (e.g., IRAs and 401(k)s) are often seen as prime candidates for (partial) Roth conversions, as this can be a period of relatively low income (allowing the client to 'fill up' lower tax brackets through Roth conversions, as these dollars might eventually be taxed at a higher rate if left in accounts subject to RMDs). However, some clients might consider Roth conversions even after their RBD, perhaps because they remain in a relatively low tax bracket (even with the RMD obligation) and/or for legacy purposes (e.g., if they are currently in a lower tax bracket than the expected tax bracket of the future inheritor[s] of the account). Notably, advisors with clients who might benefit from post-RBD RMDs can offer value for their clients by being aware of IRS ordering rules concerning RMDs and Roth conversions. To start, it's important to recognize that a client's RMD cannot be converted to a Roth (despite both RMDs and Roth conversions representing ordinary income) and that any RMDs due for the year must be taken before they can execute a conversion. For instance, a client who takes their RMD in monthly installments to support their income needs could run into trouble if they execute a mid-year Roth conversion before their full RMD is fulfilled. If such a mistimed Roth conversion is identified, the client has until the due date of their Federal income tax return, plus extensions (typically October 15 of the following year), to correct the mistake (otherwise they face a 6% penalty for each year the excess contribution remains in the account). Importantly, a 'converted' RMD is not considered to be a 'missed' RMD (so clients don't have to worry about a potential 25% penalty for missed RMDs), but rather an excess contribution to their Roth IRA, the 'fix' for which is to remove (by the deadline) the contribution as well as the earnings on the excess (known as Net Income Attributable [NIA], which is subject to taxation and is calculated based on the Roth account balance when the excess was contributed and the account balance at the time the excess is withdrawn and are taxable). In sum, financial advisors can add value for their clients not only by calculating the potential benefit of a (partial) Roth conversion in a given year, but also (for those who also have RMD obligations) by ensuring that the RMD and conversion are timed appropriately to avoid the converted amount being considered as an excess contribution to the client's Roth IRA (or, perhaps for new clients who might have already made an RMD/conversion 'mistake', helping them correct the error before the relevant deadline to avoid any tax penalties!). Navigating Income Harvesting Strategies: Harvesting (0%) Capital Gains Vs Partial Roth Conversions (Nerd's Eye View) For many high-income clients, financial advisors recommend deferring income as a strategy to mitigate taxes, especially when the client is in a high tax bracket and expects to be in a lower tax bracket in the future as income levels decline (e.g., after retirement). However, in the opposite circumstance, when current taxable income is lower than anticipated future income (e.g., because the client is building substantial wealth), it can be beneficial instead to harvest income instead, take advantage of the taxpayer's lower tax bracket, and limit the amount of income deferred into the future which would presumably be taxed at a higher rate anyway (as the more income that is deferred to the future, the greater the risk of bumping up the taxpayer into an even higher tax bracket as a result!). But how does the financial advisor choose the best strategy when it comes to avoiding too much tax deferral and harvesting income instead, especially when there are opportunities to harvest both ordinary income (e.g., Roth conversions) and also capital gains (at their own preferential rates and tax bracket thresholds)? Advisors choosing between these methods – and whether to harvest ordinary or capital gains income – can consider the tax rate brackets associated with each income type to assess how to most effectively minimize overall tax liability (both now and in the future), as well as the \"Capital Gains Bump Zone\" – where the marginal tax rate on ordinary income can be driven substantially higher by indirectly driving capital gains (along with income generated from qualified dividends) into higher capital gains brackets as well. Because capital gains may be harvested at 0% for those in the bottom two tax brackets… but only if other ordinary income doesn't 'crowd out' those lower tax brackets first! Accordingly, financial advisors can design optimal income harvesting strategies for their clients by considering when it's better to harvest ordinary income at its brackets, versus capital gains at those brackets, depending on the relative outlook for each in the future. For instance, those in the 0% ordinary income tax bracket can benefit more from harvesting additional ordinary income (versus capital gains) at 0%, as the jump to the next ordinary income tax bracket (once income turns from negative to positive) is significant.  However, for clients in the 10% or 12% ordinary tax bracket (but still in the 0% capital gains tax bracket), it's often better to harvest capital gains income (versus ordinary income) to reduce the impact of future capital gains income taxed at the 15% capital gains rate (and thus minimizing a 15% increase in capital gain taxation from 0%, compared to a 10% increase, from 12% to 22%, in ordinary income tax). In other words, the choice to harvest either ordinary or capital gains income will largely depend on how that additional harvested income will impact future income tax rates (for that particular type of income, given that individual's own income growth trajectory). However, the changes in ordinary and capital gains tax brackets as income itself rises (if only through the impact of deferring that income in the first place) are not the only factors to consider when deciding whether to harvest income, though, as there are other mitigating factors that will impact a taxpayer's overall tax liability. These include the taxation of Social Security benefits, which phases in as income levels rise (such that harvesting income can actually trigger taxation of these benefits); Medicare Part B and Part D Premium Surcharges, which increase with higher income levels; the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT), which increases part of the 15% and the entire 20% capital gains tax brackets by 3.8% and applies not just to capital gains income but also to interest and dividend income as well (except for IRA withdrawals, including those carried out for Roth conversions, which are not subject to NIIT), as well as phase-out ranges associated with certain deductions that were introduced in the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" (OBBBA). Financial advisors can also consider the impact of state income taxes (especially if the client is planning to relocate to a different state in the future), and charitable contributions, as well as the step-up in basis of inherited assets received by beneficiaries, and even the beneficiaries' own tax rates. Ultimately, the key point is that financial advisors whose clients have lower tax rates today might be wary about deferring income at those low rates – often causing higher rates in the future – and instead can soften the impact of higher future tax rates by strategically harvesting ordinary and/or capital gain income today (with their separate tax bracket structures). However, there are several mitigating factors (such as Social Security, Medicare premiums, and the Net Investment Income Tax) that need to be considered when designing a suitable strategy for the client, and because of the unique tax rates (and bracket structures, and strategies) of ordinary income versus capital gains, it's often necessary to navigate from year to year which is actually the 'optimal' strategy to pursue! 6 Ways Advisors Are Redefining Recruitment (Samantha Sferas | ThinkAdvisor) One might assume that a financial advisor who moves to a new firm would primarily do so based on the financial incentives involved (e.g., a better compensation structure and/or a signing bonus). However, Sferas (COO of advisor recruitment firm Terrana Group) suggests that while this might have been the case in the past, other considerations are often top-of-mind for advisors considering a move today. For instance, rather than just annual compensation, advisors are increasingly interested in the potential to take ownership stakes in their new firm to share in profits and to have a seat at the decision-making table (presenting a potential opportunity for founders near retirement without a clear internal successor to identify a seasoned advisor who shares their values and will keep the firm's culture alive). Advisors considering a move are also seeking firms that offer a specialized client service approach, whether in understanding the nuances of a particular type of client (e.g., entrepreneurs or physicians) or being able to 'go deep' on a range of client planning issues (e.g., having in-house tax or estate planning teams). Another factor driving transitioning advisors is to find a home that offers them autonomy (one of the key factors driving advisor wellbeing according to Kitces Research), seeking structure, support, and scale without micromanagement. And in this environment, advisors thinking about a transition are often conducing \"M\u0026A-level\" due diligence on multiple firms to ensure they find one that provides long-term alignment (which has extended the average advisor transition to six months) and an opportunity to shape their own legacies. Altogether, while firm founders looking for a seasoned advisor to join their team might assume that 'money talks' in these transitions, next-gen advisors appear to be looking deeper into what their life would look like at a particular firm and whether the firm would give them flexibility to build their individual practice guided by their own vision (perhaps with mentorship from more senior advisors) and a seat at the table to drive the firm's success into the future. Talent Is The Tipping Point: Why The Right Team Makes Or Breaks RIA Growth (Penny Phillips | Advisor Perspectives) When looking to take their firm to the next level (whether in terms of growth, efficiency, or another metric), firm leaders might look to technology solutions, new processes, or proven systems. However, Phillips suggests that human talent (who can embrace 'chaos', handle adversity well, and adapt to change) is what lies at the heart of progress for firms, with five particularly key roles at the heart of each firm. To start, firms looking to scale typically have a \"leader\" who has a clear vision of how the firm will grow and evolve, is willing to make the hard decisions to move the firm in that direction, and can clearly communicate their vision to ensure the full team understands the \"why\" and prevent operational confusion. Second, such firms typically will have an \"operator\" who takes the \"leader's\" vision and turns it into systematic execution by optimizing processes and coordinating teams, reducing operational and administrative burdens for client-facing advisors. Third the \"rainmaker\" maintains a steady pipeline of qualified prospects (and has this function as their primary responsibility), managing multiple client acquisition tactics (so the firm isn't reliant on one marketing method for growth). Next, high-growth firms often have \"technicians\", dedicated planning professionals who focus exclusively on plan creation, technical analysis, giving client-facing more time to spend meeting with clients (and often leading to better planning outputs given that these specialists can focus on staying up to date on technical developments). Finally, \"care specialists\" are in charge of ongoing relationship management (e.g., client communication, meeting scheduling, and email follow-ups), strengthening client loyalty and retention while allowing advisors to focus on strategic conversations rather than administrative follow-up. In sum, successfully scaling a financial planning firm is a team effort, with clearly defined roles for different employees that allow them to spend time on their strengths while freeing up time for colleagues to focus on what they do best (ultimately leading to better client service and a more efficient business). Using Case Studies To Increase The Chances Of Making The 'Right' Hire (Peter Parlapiano | Journal of Financial Planning) Given the costs of hiring a new employee (from time spent screening resumes and interviewing candidates to onboarding and training new hires), getting a hire 'right' is important for financial advisory firms (particularly smaller firms where a new hire might be responsible for a significant percentage of the firm's overall work). While interviews and personality assessments can be helpful in the process, Parlapiano and his firm have found particular success having candidates complete a case study during the hiring process. For instance, a candidate applying for a paraplanner position might be given a narrative of a client couple, a summary of their financial situation, and a tax projection to analyze and review for potential errors. Notably, the case study can include a written portion (where the candidate writes out a narrative) as well as an in-person portion (where the interviewer adjusts the fact pattern to see how the candidate reacts on their feed). Such case studies serve two purposes: first, for the firm to ascertain a candidate's skills (by having them complete a scenario exercise similar to what they would have to accomplish in the role they're applying for) and to help the candidate better understand what their job role will entail (by getting a taste of the actual work that would be expected of them, some candidates might decide that the position is not a good fit for them!). Overall, candidates at Parlapiano's firm have had a 43% pass rate on the case studies, including 45% for paraplanners, 100% for administrative admins, and 40% for the office manager position (which is lower due to the many different roles the position is responsible for). Amidst this backdrop, the firm has found success since implementing case studies in the hiring process, with the average tenure of employees hired in this time increasing to 3.5 years from 1.3 years before they included case studies. Ultimately, the key point is that it's not necessarily 'enough' to get to know a candidate's credentials and personality in the hiring process, with case studies serving as a way to see how these traits translate to the (simulated) real world. Which could lead to more skilled, effective hires who better understand the specific roles of the position they're pursuing! How To Turn ChatGPT Into A Personal Nutrition Coach (Brett and Kate McKay | The Art Of Manliness) Whether it's a New Year's resolution or a mid-year target, many individuals set a goal to eat in a healthier manner. However, putting that into practice can sometimes be a challenge given time constraints (that can lead to eating less healthy foods on the run) and the need to have the personal willpower to do so. With this in mind, one option is to leverage technology to support healthy eating habits. To start, an AI tool like ChatGPT can serve as a healthy eating 'coach' by creating a dedicated thread for this purpose (so that it can track progress over time and keep this project separate from others). Users can customize their prompt to the AI tool, for instance by noting their goals (e.g., eating a certain number of calories per day), their personal metrics (e.g., current height, weight, and exercise routine), and the tone they'd like the tool to take in their 'coaching' (e.g., encouraging versus strict). A particularly effective pairing can be using ChatGPT alongside a food-tracking app (e.g., MyFitnessPal) that has a database of millions of foods to more easily track nutrition data (e.g., how many calories or grams of fat one has eaten in a given day), as ChatGPT can be used to offer meal prep ideas (e.g., based on ingredients that are already at home) or suggest meals that would fit within daily goals (e.g., prompting the AI tool with \"I have 800 calories remaining for the day, what could I get at X restaurant that would fit in with this goal?\"). And over time, regular check-ins can provide opportunities to make adjustments within the tech tools and also get encouragement for successfully hitting targets. In sum, while an individual might turn to a human nutrition coach for a more complete program, tech tools can serve as helpful aids when it comes to tracking data, coming up with ideas for meals that use available ingredients and meet nutrition targets, and to get daily encouragement to keep working towards one's goals! Adding \"Exercise Snacks\" To Your Day When There Isn't Time For A Full Workout (Janelle Martel | Next Avenue) It's widely accepted that regular exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. However, adhering to a strict exercise routine (perhaps trying to get a 30–45-minute workout in several days a week) can sometimes be tricky for those with busy work, family, and personal lives. Rather than relying on dedicated workout time, another option is to break exercise up into smaller 'snacks', short (i.e., two minutes or less), intense periods of exercise that can be performed during natural breaks that arise throughout the day. For instance, having a few minutes between meetings could be an opportunity to do a couple sets of bodyweight squats, or an extended period of sitting work could be followed by climbing several floors of stairs in the office building (or home office). Such 'snacks' have the benefit not only of ensuring desired strength and flexibility exercises are done during the day (without worrying about running out of time to do them in the evening), but can also reduce the amount of sedentary time spent sitting at work (though, as with any change to exercise routine, it could be worth checking with a doctor to ensure the right fit for one's personal situation). In the end, while full workouts can be satisfying and supportive of a healthy lifestyle, a solid hour isn't necessarily the only way to gain strength, cardiovascular, and/or flexibility benefits that exercise can provide. With this in mind, incorporating movement into one's daily routine (and perhaps as a supplement to longer workouts) can help support an active lifestyle (and perhaps provide some much-needed 'thinking time' away from the computer monitor!). The Benefits Of Good Posture – And How To Improve It (Kate Murphy | The Wall Street Journal) Kids are often admonished by parents and others to sit up straight and avoid slouching. But without these regular reminders, adults can easily fall into bad posture-related habits (which are particularly easy to adopt in a world where smartphones make it easy to be regularly hunched over. Beyond appearance, researchers suggest that there could be a range of benefits to maintaining healthy posture (i.e., having one's head level with earlobes in line with shoulders, shoulders down and back, core engaged, hips and spine neutral, and weight balanced evenly on each foot). These include both physical benefits (e.g., strengthening muscles that can promote flexibility and avoid injuries as one ages) as well as psychological benefits as well in terms of greater confidence and less anxiety (with one study showing that participants had higher self-esteem and less anxiety when showing good posture during stressful situations than those who slouched). For those interested in maintaining (or returning to) better habits related to posture, several practices can offer support. A first step is to get a better idea of one's current typical posture. This can be done by regularly looking at mirrors when passing by (to see one's posture at different angles), or, perhaps, enlist the help of a spouse or friend to take pictures at random times. One way to self-correct posture is to stand against a wall, with one's head, shoulders, and buttocks held against it (a stance that demonstrates what good posture feels like). Alternatively, thinking about how one would stand if they were walking to tell someone off can lead to better posture. Also, dynamic stretching (i.e., elongating and toning the body while in motion) can be an effective way to alleviate postural hindrances. And for those who want to take this practice to the next level (and/or are concerned they have a physical condition that might be leading to poor posture), working with a physical therapist to evaluate and work on improving posture could be helpful. Ultimately, the key point is that having good posture is not just a matter of how one presents themselves to the world but can also affect one's attitude and health as well. Which suggests that regular check-ins (whether when standing, walking, or even sitting in the office) and adopting better posture habits could be a relatively simple (though perhaps challenging) way to improve one's overall wellness.

Nevertheless, while they might expect that a financial advisor can solve their immediate \u0026#39;pain point\u0026#39;, they might not be aware of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/advisors-add-value-proposition-financial-planning-ideal-clients-target-persona-differentiation/\"\u003efull scope of ways that advisors can add value\u003c/a\u003e (and the extent to which working with an advisor could reduce their stress and save them time).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to \u003ca href=\"https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/the_emotional_and_time_value_of_advice.pdf\"\u003ea survey by Vanguard\u003c/a\u003e of 12,443 investors who use its services (which include self-directed investing as well as human-provided and digital advice), while only 38% of investors reported considering time savings when signing up to receive financial advice, 76% of advised clients report saving time (a median of two hours per week, or more than 100 hours per year), suggesting there is an unexpected \u0026#39;bonus\u0026#39; of getting financial advice for many clients. Further, clients working with a human advisor also were more likely to report time savings versus those working with a digital advice solution (78% versus 62%), indicating there is a time-savings premium from working with a human advisor. Separately, 86% of advised clients reported having greater peace of mind when thinking about their finances after working with an advisor (human advisors also performed stronger here compared to digital advice solutions, with 88% of clients working with the former getting emotional value, compared to 69% of the latter).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe survey also compared differences between advised and self-directed investors on Vanguard\u0026#39;s platform when it comes to financial stress. It found that 50% of advised clients reported low levels of financial stress compared to 32% of self-directed investors, while only 14% of advised clients reported high levels of financial stress, compared to 27% of self-directed investors (and while financial advisors almost certainly can reduce a client\u0026#39;s financial stress by addressing their \u0026#39;pain points\u0026#39; and creating a plan that allows them to achieve their goals, this finding is correlational [rather than causal], and could be affected by other factors, such as the differing levels of wealth between the two groups).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAltogether, these findings suggest that while many prospects might approach a (human) advisor with an immediate \u0026#39;pain point\u0026#39;, there is potentially room for advisors to sell their value in areas a prospect might not have considered, whether in time savings (\u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/happy-money-and-the-science-of-spending-how-money-really-can-sometimes-buy-happiness/\"\u003ea way for clients to \u0026#39;buy\u0026#39; time for leisure activities that can boost their happiness\u003c/a\u003e) or emotional value (a differentiator not only between self-directed investors and advisory clients, but also \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/vanguard-report-robo-advisors-human-relationship-value-client-satisfaction-leveraging-technology/\"\u003ebetween digital- and human-provided advice\u003c/a\u003e). Which not only could lead to more prospects becoming clients, but also more long-term client relationships once they realize the full scope of the value human advisors can provide!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Leo Almazora | InvestmentNews)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA key trend in financial advice is the graying of the advisor population and its impact on individual firms (with founders deciding whether to pursue an internal succession plan or sell to an external buyer) and the industry as a whole (which could see changes as next-gen advisors build their businesses in their own styles). Perhaps not surprisingly, according to a \u003ca href=\"https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-financial-advisor-satisfaction-study\"\u003esurvey\u003c/a\u003e of 3,698 advisors in the broker-dealer channel by J.D. Power, 46% of respondents said they are within 10 years of retirement, with 26% of them already age 65 or older (though many advisors might choose to continue working well past \u0026#39;traditional\u0026#39; retirement age given the satisfaction working as an advisor can provide).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the anticipated coming turnover among advisors, the survey asked relatively younger advisors about their priorities and how their firms could better meet their needs. The survey found that only 20% of advisors under age 40 said their firm was conscious of its \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/nicole-gopoian-wirick-prosperity-wealth-strategies-consultant-marketing-brand-dna/\"\u003epublic brand image\u003c/a\u003e (a factor likely important to this group, who could be more likely to gain clients based on their firm\u0026#39;s image compared to more established advisors with a larger established client base from which to gain referrals). In addition, while 45% of younger advisors selected social media as a priority for marketing investment, only 32% said such support they get from their firm is \u0026#34;very valuable\u0026#34;. Another potential innovation for firms to consider is adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered tools, with 35% of overall respondents selecting it as the top priority for increased tech investment by their firm (the survey also found that overall advisor satisfaction with their firm and brand advocacy scores were significantly higher among advisors using AI tools).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn sum, these results suggest that next-generation advisors at broker dealers could be looking for greater technology, branding, and social media support from their firms as they begin to take on more leadership roles. Which could be valuable insights for their firms to consider, as dissatisfied advisors could \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/17-steps-breakaway-broker-advisor-transition-services-grier-rubeling-ria-paperwork-checklists-scripts/\"\u003elook to start their own firms\u003c/a\u003e in order to gain greater freedom on marketing, technology, and branding decisions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-nav-title=\"RIA M\u0026amp;A Volume Hits Record In 2025\" id=\"ria-ma-volume-hits-record-in-first-half-of-2025\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ca id=\"RIA-MA\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fa-mag.com/news/devoe-reports-record-ria-merger-activity--despite-turmoil-83298.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wknd-cat=\"News\"\u003eRIA M\u0026amp;A Volume Hits Record In First Half Of 2025\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Financial Advisor)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe number of RIA Merger and Acquisition (M\u0026amp;A) deals reached a record-high of 272 in 2024, according to RIA M\u0026amp;A consultancy \u003ca href=\"https://www.devoeandcompany.com/\"\u003eDeVoe \u0026amp; Company\u003c/a\u003e, with many Private Equity (PE)-backed buyers scooping up smaller firms (accounting for 72% of all transactions) and acquirors benefiting from a cooling of interest rates. Nonetheless, entering 2025, questions remained as to whether this brisk pace would continue, particularly as firms faced a volatile equity market during the first half of the year (which could have put deals on the backburner given the need to turn attention inward towards client service during this period).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite these potential headwinds, the first six months of 2025 saw a record-number of RIA deals for the period, with 148 transactions (up 17% from the previous year), potentially presaging a record number of deals for the full year (set last year with 272). Notably, mid- and large RIAs represented nearly half of all sellers in the second quarter, with the average Assets Under Management (AUM) per seller surpassing $1 billion (nearing the high set in 2021). Drivers for the robust deal volume are familiar, according to DeVoe, including retiring advisors (without an internal succession plan, which can be especially challenging for large firms where the internal purchase price could be tens of millions of dollars) looking for an exit, and continued Private Equity (PE) interest in the industry (with 79% of the deals being driven directly or indirectly by PE firms).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore broadly, the ongoing growth of transactions in 2024 and now 2025 is also notable, as rising interest rates in recent years were predicted to decrease purchase activity (which didn\u0026#39;t happen), and more recent market volatility was also predicted to decrease purchase activity (which didn\u0026#39;t happen either). Instead, buying and selling activity has remained robust and in fact \u003cem\u003econtinues \u003c/em\u003eto grow, despite market volatility, higher interest rates, and ongoing record-high valuations of independent advisory firms. Which suggests that the underlying drivers – from the challenges of succession planning and internal deal-making (especially at larger firms) to the strength of the independent advisory model with its recurring revenues (that allow deals to continue to be done at these multiples) – remain quite healthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, RIA M\u0026amp;A activity appears to be continuing at a robust pace, with interest from both buyers looking to continue to scale and sellers interested in growing within a larger firm, alongside traditional succession- and liquidity-related drivers.

In addition, tax expert Ed Slott notes that the new law introduces new considerations for advisors and their clients considering (partial) Roth conversions in 2025 or in the coming years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo start, the \u0026#39;permanent\u0026#39; (i.e., without a scheduled sunset date) extension of the tax brackets enacted under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) could continue to make Roth conversions attractive in the coming years (i.e., if clients think brackets will be adjusted upward in the future), particularly for clients who can \u0026#39;fill up\u0026#39; the 10% and 12% brackets (though clients whose other income puts them higher brackets might consider filling up those \u0026#39;buckets\u0026#39; as well).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the law also includes phase-out ranges for different tax savings opportunities, which could be considered when deciding whether (and how much) to convert. For instance, the new $6,000 deduction for individuals age 65 and older (which lasts from 2025 through 2028) phases out once a household\u0026#39;s Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) reaches $75,000 (for single filers) or $150,000 (for joint filers) and is fully phased out at MAGI of $175,000 (single) and $250,000 (joint). Which means that advisors could offer value by analyzing the value (and tradeoffs) of a (partial) Roth conversion for clients with income near these phase-out ranges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother consideration for making (partial) Roth conversions is the phase-out range associated with the new $40,000 SALT cap (which starts at MAGI of $500,000 for single, head of household, and married filing jointly filers, with those with MAGI above $600,000 being fully phased out and subject to the previous $10,000 limit), as this deduction could be particularly valuable for those in high tax brackets with elevated SALT burdens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the key point is that the new tax law creates new considerations for advisors when \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/roth-conversion-analysis-value-calculate-timing-true-marginal-tax-rate-equivalency-principle/\"\u003eanalyzing a client\u0026#39;s (true) marginal tax rate\u003c/a\u003e to consider the value of a Roth conversion.

However, some clients might consider Roth conversions even after their RBD, perhaps because they remain in a relatively low tax bracket (even with the RMD obligation) and/or for legacy purposes (e.g., if they are currently in a lower tax bracket than the expected tax bracket of the future inheritor[s] of the account).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotably, advisors with clients who might benefit from post-RBD RMDs can offer value for their clients by being aware of IRS ordering rules concerning RMDs and Roth conversions. To start, it\u0026#39;s important to recognize that a client\u0026#39;s RMD cannot be converted to a Roth (despite both RMDs and Roth conversions representing ordinary income) and that any RMDs due for the year must be taken before they can execute a conversion. For instance, a client who takes their RMD in monthly installments to support their income needs could run into trouble if they execute a mid-year Roth conversion before their full RMD is fulfilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf such a mistimed Roth conversion is identified, the client has until the due date of their Federal income tax return, plus extensions (typically October 15 of the following year), to correct the mistake (otherwise they face a 6% penalty for each year the excess contribution remains in the account). Importantly, a \u0026#39;converted\u0026#39; RMD is not considered to be a \u0026#39;missed\u0026#39; RMD (so clients don\u0026#39;t have to worry about a potential 25% penalty for missed RMDs), but rather an excess contribution to their Roth IRA, the \u0026#39;fix\u0026#39; for which is to remove (by the deadline) the contribution as well as the earnings on the excess (known as Net Income Attributable [NIA], which is subject to taxation and is calculated based on the Roth account balance when the excess was contributed and the account balance at the time the excess is withdrawn and are taxable).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn sum, financial advisors can add value for their clients not only by calculating the potential benefit of a (partial) Roth conversion in a given year, but also (for those who also have RMD obligations) by ensuring that the RMD and conversion are timed appropriately to avoid the converted amount being considered as an excess contribution to the client\u0026#39;s Roth IRA (or, perhaps for new clients who might have already made an RMD/conversion \u0026#39;mistake\u0026#39;, helping them correct the error before the relevant deadline to avoid any tax penalties!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-nav-title=\"Navigating Income Harvesting Strategies\" id=\"navigating-income-harvesting-strategies-harvesting-0-capital-gains-vs-partial-roth-conversions\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ca id=\"income-harvesting\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/navigating-income-harvesting-strategies-harvesting-0-capital-gains-vs-partial-roth-conversions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wknd-cat=\"Taxes\"\u003eNavigating Income Harvesting Strategies: Harvesting (0%) Capital Gains Vs Partial Roth Conversions\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Nerd\u0026#39;s Eye View)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor many high-income clients, financial advisors recommend deferring income as a strategy to mitigate taxes, especially when the client is in a high tax bracket and expects to be in a lower tax bracket in the future as income levels decline (e.g., after retirement). However, in the opposite circumstance, when current taxable income is lower than anticipated future income (e.g., because the client is building substantial wealth), it can be beneficial instead to harvest \u003cem\u003eincome \u003c/em\u003einstead, take advantage of the taxpayer\u0026#39;s lower tax bracket, and limit the amount of income deferred into the future which would presumably be taxed at a higher rate anyway (as the more income that is deferred to the future, the greater the risk of bumping up the taxpayer into an even higher tax bracket as a result!). But how does the financial advisor choose the best strategy when it comes to avoiding too much tax deferral and harvesting income instead, especially when there are opportunities to harvest both \u003cem\u003eordinary \u003c/em\u003eincome (e.g., Roth conversions) and also capital gains (at their own preferential rates and tax bracket thresholds)?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvisors choosing between these methods – and whether to harvest ordinary or capital gains income – can consider the tax rate brackets associated with each income type to assess how to most effectively minimize overall tax liability (both now and in the future), as well as the \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/long-term-capital-gains-bump-zone-higher-marginal-tax-rate-phase-in-0-rate/\"\u003e\u0026#34;Capital Gains Bump Zone\u0026#34;\u003c/a\u003e – where the marginal tax rate on ordinary income can be driven substantially higher by indirectly driving capital gains (along with income generated from qualified dividends) into higher capital gains brackets as well. Because capital gains may be harvested at 0% for those in the bottom two tax brackets… but only if \u003cem\u003eother \u003c/em\u003eordinary income doesn\u0026#39;t \u0026#39;crowd out\u0026#39; those lower tax brackets first!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccordingly, financial advisors can design optimal income harvesting strategies for their clients by considering when it\u0026#39;s better to harvest ordinary income at its brackets, versus capital gains at \u003cem\u003ethose \u003c/em\u003ebrackets, depending on the relative outlook for each in the future. For instance, those in the 0% ordinary income tax bracket can benefit more from harvesting additional ordinary income (versus capital gains) at 0%, as the jump to the next ordinary income tax bracket (once income turns from negative to positive) is significant.  However, for clients in the 10% or 12% ordinary tax bracket (but still in the 0% capital gains tax bracket), it\u0026#39;s often better to harvest capital gains income (versus ordinary income) to reduce the impact of future capital gains income taxed at the 15% capital gains rate (and thus minimizing a 15% increase in capital gain taxation from 0%, compared to a 10% increase, from 12% to 22%, in ordinary income tax). In other words, the choice to harvest either ordinary or capital gains income will largely depend on how that additional harvested income will impact future income tax rates (for that particular \u003cem\u003etype \u003c/em\u003eof income, given that individual\u0026#39;s own income growth trajectory).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the changes in ordinary and capital gains tax brackets as income itself rises (if only through the impact of deferring that income in the first place) are not the only factors to consider when deciding whether to harvest income, though, as there are \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/roth-conversion-analysis-value-calculate-timing-true-marginal-tax-rate-equivalency-principle/\"\u003eother mitigating factors that will impact a taxpayer\u0026#39;s overall tax liability\u003c/a\u003e. These include the taxation of Social Security benefits, which phases in as income levels rise (such that harvesting income can actually trigger taxation of these benefits); Medicare Part B and Part D Premium Surcharges, which increase with higher income levels; the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT), which increases part of the 15% and the entire 20% capital gains tax brackets by 3.8% and applies not just to capital gains income but also to interest and dividend income as well (except for IRA withdrawals, including those carried out for Roth conversions, which are not subject to NIIT), as well as \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/obbba-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-tax-planning-salt-cap-senior-deduction-qbi-deduction-tax-cut-and-jobs-act-tcja-amt-trump-accounts/\"\u003ephase-out ranges associated with certain deductions that were introduced in the \u0026#34;One Big Beautiful Bill Act\u0026#34; (OBBBA)\u003c/a\u003e. Financial advisors can also consider the impact of state income taxes (especially if the client is \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/state-income-tax-retirees-top-marginal-rates-social-security-pension-income-age-exemptions/\"\u003eplanning to relocate to a different state in the future\u003c/a\u003e), and charitable contributions, as well as the step-up in basis of inherited assets received by beneficiaries, and even the beneficiaries\u0026#39; own tax rates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the key point is that financial advisors whose clients have lower tax rates today might be wary about deferring income at those low rates – often \u003cem\u003ecausing \u003c/em\u003ehigher rates in the future – and instead can soften the impact of higher future tax rates by strategically harvesting ordinary and/or capital gain income today (with their separate tax bracket structures). However, there are several mitigating factors (such as Social Security, Medicare premiums, and the Net Investment Income Tax) that need to be considered when designing a suitable strategy for the client, and because of the unique tax rates (and bracket structures, and strategies) of ordinary income versus capital gains, it\u0026#39;s often necessary to navigate from year to year which is actually the \u0026#39;optimal\u0026#39; strategy to pursue!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-nav-title=\"6 Ways Advisors Are Redefining Recruitment\" id=\"6-ways-advisors-are-redefining-recruitment\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ca id=\"recruitment\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2025/07/14/6-ways-advisors-are-redefining-recruitment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wknd-cat=\"Practice-Management\"\u003e6 Ways Advisors Are Redefining Recruitment\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Samantha Sferas | ThinkAdvisor)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne might assume that a financial advisor who moves to a new firm would primarily do so based on the financial incentives involved (e.g., a better compensation structure and/or a signing bonus).

Advisors considering a move are also seeking firms that offer a specialized client service approach, whether in understanding the nuances of a particular type of client (e.g., entrepreneurs or physicians) or being able to \u0026#39;go deep\u0026#39; on a range of client planning issues (e.g., having in-house tax or estate planning teams). Another factor driving transitioning advisors is to find a home that offers them autonomy (one of the key factors driving advisor wellbeing according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/kitces-report-financial-advisor-wellbeing-perma-framework-designations-compensation-stress-community-social-support/\"\u003eKitces Research\u003c/a\u003e), seeking structure, support, and scale without micromanagement.

However, Phillips suggests that human talent (who can embrace \u0026#39;chaos\u0026#39;, handle adversity well, and adapt to change) is what lies at the heart of progress for firms, with five particularly key roles at the heart of each firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo start, firms looking to scale typically have a \u0026#34;leader\u0026#34; who has a clear vision of how the firm will grow and evolve, is willing to make the hard decisions to move the firm in that direction, and can clearly communicate their vision to ensure the full team understands the \u0026#34;why\u0026#34; and prevent operational confusion. Second, such firms typically will have an \u0026#34;operator\u0026#34; who takes the \u0026#34;leader\u0026#39;s\u0026#34; vision and turns it into systematic execution by optimizing processes and coordinating teams, reducing operational and administrative burdens for client-facing advisors. Third the \u0026#34;rainmaker\u0026#34; maintains a steady pipeline of qualified prospects (and has this function as their primary responsibility), managing multiple client acquisition tactics (so the firm isn\u0026#39;t reliant on one marketing method for growth). Next, high-growth firms often have \u0026#34;technicians\u0026#34;, dedicated planning professionals who focus exclusively on plan creation, technical analysis, giving client-facing more time to spend meeting with clients (and often leading to better planning outputs given that these specialists can focus on staying up to date on technical developments). Finally, \u0026#34;care specialists\u0026#34; are in charge of ongoing relationship management (e.g., client communication, meeting scheduling, and email follow-ups), strengthening client loyalty and retention while allowing advisors to focus on strategic conversations rather than administrative follow-up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn sum, successfully scaling a financial planning firm is a team effort, with clearly defined roles for different employees that allow them to spend time on their strengths while freeing up time for colleagues to focus on what they do best (ultimately leading to better client service and a more efficient business).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-nav-title=\"Case Studies To Make The \u0026#39;Right\u0026#39; Hire\" id=\"using-case-studies-to-increase-the-chances-of-making-the-right-hire\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ca id=\"case-studies\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.financialplanningassociation.org/learning/publications/journal/MAR25-efficient-hiring-case-studies-OPEN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wknd-cat=\"Practice-Management\"\u003eUsing Case Studies To Increase The Chances Of Making The \u0026#39;Right\u0026#39; Hire\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Peter Parlapiano | Journal of Financial Planning)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the costs of \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/hiring-experience-attracting-today-wealth-management-talent-practice-management-employees-firm-competitive-interview-process-lead-advisor/\"\u003ehiring a new employee\u003c/a\u003e (from time spent screening resumes and interviewing candidates to onboarding and training new hires), getting a hire \u0026#39;right\u0026#39; is important for financial advisory firms (particularly smaller firms where a new hire might be responsible for a significant percentage of the firm\u0026#39;s overall work).

A particularly effective pairing can be using ChatGPT alongside a food-tracking app (e.g., \u003ca href=\"https://www.myfitnesspal.com/\"\u003eMyFitnessPal\u003c/a\u003e) that has a database of millions of foods to more easily track nutrition data (e.g., how many calories or grams of fat one has eaten in a given day), as ChatGPT can be used to offer meal prep ideas (e.g., based on ingredients that are already at home) or suggest meals that would fit within daily goals (e.g., prompting the AI tool with \u0026#34;I have 800 calories remaining for the day, what could I get at X restaurant that would fit in with this goal?\u0026#34;). And over time, regular check-ins can provide opportunities to make adjustments within the tech tools and also get encouragement for successfully hitting targets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn sum, while an individual might turn to a human nutrition coach for a more complete program, tech tools can serve as helpful aids when it comes to tracking data, coming up with ideas for meals that use available ingredients and meet nutrition targets, and to get daily encouragement to keep working towards one\u0026#39;s goals!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-nav-title=\"Adding \u0026#39;Exercise Snacks\u0026#39; To Your Day\" id=\"adding-exercise-snacks-to-your-day-when-there-isnt-time-for-a-full-workout\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ca id=\"exercise-snacks\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nextavenue.org/add-some-exercise-snacks-to-your-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wknd-cat=\"Other\"\u003eAdding \u0026#34;Exercise Snacks\u0026#34; To Your Day When There Isn\u0026#39;t Time For A Full Workout\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Janelle Martel | Next Avenue)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s widely accepted that regular exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. However, adhering to a strict exercise routine (perhaps trying to get a 30–45-minute workout in several days a week) can sometimes be tricky for those with busy work, family, and personal lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than relying on dedicated workout time, another option is to \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/standing-desks-walk-and-talks-and-getting-healthier-as-a-financial-planner/\"\u003ebreak exercise up\u003c/a\u003e into smaller \u0026#39;snacks\u0026#39;, short (i.e., two minutes or less), intense periods of exercise that can be performed during natural breaks that arise throughout the day. For instance, having a few minutes between meetings could be an opportunity to do a couple sets of bodyweight squats, or an extended period of sitting work could be followed by climbing several floors of stairs in the office building (or home office). Such \u0026#39;snacks\u0026#39; have the benefit not only of ensuring desired strength and flexibility exercises are done during the day (without worrying about running out of time to do them in the evening), but can also reduce the amount of sedentary time spent sitting at work (though, as with any change to exercise routine, it could be worth checking with a doctor to ensure the right fit for one\u0026#39;s personal situation).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, while full workouts can be satisfying and supportive of a healthy lifestyle, a solid hour isn\u0026#39;t necessarily the only way to gain strength, cardiovascular, and/or flexibility benefits that exercise can provide. With this in mind, incorporating movement into one\u0026#39;s daily routine (and perhaps as a supplement to longer workouts) can help support an active lifestyle (and perhaps provide some much-needed \u0026#39;thinking time\u0026#39; away from the computer monitor!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-nav-title=\"The Benefits Of Good Posture\" id=\"the-benefits-of-good-posture-and-how-to-improve-it\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003ca id=\"posture\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/healthy-good-posture-benefits-5627bee5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wknd-cat=\"Other\"\u003eThe Benefits Of Good Posture – And How To Improve It\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Kate Murphy | The Wall Street Journal)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKids are often admonished by parents and others to sit up straight and avoid slouching. But without these regular reminders, adults can easily fall into bad posture-related habits (which are particularly easy to adopt in a world where smartphones make it easy to be regularly hunched over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond appearance, researchers suggest that there could be a range of benefits to maintaining healthy posture (i.e., having one\u0026#39;s head level with earlobes in line with shoulders, shoulders down and back, core engaged, hips and spine neutral, and weight balanced evenly on each foot). These include both physical benefits (e.g., strengthening muscles that can promote flexibility and avoid injuries as one ages) as well as psychological benefits as well in terms of greater confidence and less anxiety (with one \u003ca href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-37739-001\"\u003estudy\u003c/a\u003e showing that participants had higher self-esteem and less anxiety when showing good posture during stressful situations than those who slouched).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor those interested in maintaining (or returning to) better habits related to posture, several practices can offer support. A first step is to get a better idea of one\u0026#39;s current typical posture. This can be done by regularly looking at mirrors when passing by (to see one\u0026#39;s posture at different angles), or, perhaps, enlist the help of a spouse or friend to take pictures at random times. One way to self-correct posture is to stand against a wall, with one\u0026#39;s head, shoulders, and buttocks held against it (a stance that demonstrates what good posture feels like). Alternatively, thinking about how one would stand if they were walking to tell someone off can lead to better posture. Also, dynamic stretching (i.e., elongating and toning the body while in motion) can be an effective way to alleviate postural hindrances. And for those who want to take this practice to the next level (and/or are concerned they have a physical condition that might be leading to poor posture), working with a physical therapist to evaluate and work on improving posture could be helpful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the key point is that having good posture is not just a matter of how one presents themselves to the world but can also affect one\u0026#39;s attitude and health as well. Which suggests that regular check-ins (whether when standing, walking, or even sitting in the office) and adopting better posture habits could be a relatively simple (though perhaps challenging) way to improve one\u0026#39;s overall wellness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hope you enjoyed the reading!
