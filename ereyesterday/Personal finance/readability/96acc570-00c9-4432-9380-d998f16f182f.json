  "text": "Source: The College InvestorIRA match bonuses and transfer offers have been growing in popularity over the last year.For years, online brokerages and investing apps have made investing affordable and convenient, offering everything from free stock and ETF trades to roundup savings and fractional shares, all of which you can access from a desktop or mobile device. Now, the same platforms are competing hard for your retirement dollars. One of the ways they're doing this is by offering a deposit bonus when you open an IRA account and transfer money from another institution or make new contributions. However, not every brokerage offers these IRA match bonuses, so to help, we've compiled a list of the best ones available right now.  Robinhood Gold IRA Match: 3%Robinhood is a popular online brokerage known for its commission-free stock, ETF, and crypto trades, and fractional share investing. If you're willing to pony up $5 each month for a Robinhood Gold subscription, you can unlock additional features, such as a 5% APY on your savings balance, 3% cash back on purchases, and a 3% IRA match. How Does The IRA Match Work? When you subscribe to Robinhood Gold, you'll be eligible for a 3% match on annual contributions made to a Robinhood IRA account. If you don't want to pay for Gold, you can still get a 1% IRA match. Note that the 3% match applies to new contributions only. IRA transfers and old 401(k) rollovers only earn 1%. Right now, there is no cap on this bonus either!Terms \u0026 Conditions*: This is a lucrative offer; however, there are some conditions to be aware of. For starters, you must be willing to pay $5 per month for a Robinhood Gold subscription, and continue to be a member for a full year after your contribution to keep the 3% match. Also, the money that the match was earned on must be kept in your Robinhood IRA account for a minimum of 5 years, or you could be subject to an Early IRA Match Removal Fee. * For full offer details, visit Robinhood. Webull IRA Match: 3.5%Like Robinhood, Webull is a popular online brokerage offering commission-free stock and ETF trades. Webull offers Roth, Rollover, and Traditional IRAs with no account minimums or account fees. How Does The IRA Match Bonus Work? Until August 15, 2024, Webull is offering a generous IRA match bonus. If you open an IRA with Webull and transfer from an existing Roth IRA, Traditional IRA, Rollover IRA, or 401(k), Webull will add 3.5%. In addition, they'll match any new contributions at 3.5%. Terms \u0026 Conditions*: To qualify, you must have a self-directed Traditional or Roth IRA account with Webull. To receive a bonus match, you must claim the offer from the offer landing page on the Webull website or mobile app. From there, complete one or more qualifying deposits into your IRA account. (A qualifying deposit is a contribution or transfer from an account held by you at an institution other than Webull). The transfer must settle before the offer period expires. You also must maintain your IRA deposit balance from the period beginning immediately after the first Deposit Bonus installment payment until the payment of the final bonus installment. According to Webull's website, bonuses will be paid in installments on the following dates: Deposit Bonus Distribution Dates and AmountsJuly 16, 2025    1/5 of total Deposit Bonus amountJuly 16, 2026    1/5 of total Deposit Bonus amountJuly 16, 2027    1/5 of total Deposit Bonus amountJuly 16, 2028    1/5 of total Deposit Bonus amountJuly 16, 2029    1/5 of total Deposit Bonus amount * For full offer details, visit Webull.Acorns IRA Match: 1% or 3%Acorns is an investing and savings app known for its roundup savings feature that allows you to invest your spare change. You can earn a high APY on your Acorns Checking and Savings accounts, and spend with its Mighty Oak Visa Debit card. Acorns offers access to retirement savings with Roth, Traditional, and SEP IRA accounts via Acorns Later. How does the IRA Match Bonus Work? Acorns lets you choose from three monthly tiers: Acorns Bronze ($3), Silver ($6), and Gold ($12). Silver features include a 1% IRA match on new IRA contributions, and Gold includes a 3% match. Here’s how Acorns Later Match works when you invest in your Acorns Later retirement account:Acorns Gold subscribers get a 3% IRA match on new contributions to their Acorns Later retirement account, so if you contribute $7,000 to your Later account, you can get a $210 match.Acorns Silver subscribers get a 1% IRA match on new contributions to their Acorns Later retirement account, so if you contribute $7,000 to your Later account, you can get a $70 match.Terms \u0026 Conditions*: In order to keep the 1% or 3% percent match, you must keep the funds invested in your Acorns Later account for 4 years. *For full offer details, visit Acorns.  SoFi Invest IRA Match: 1%SoFi is an online financial platform that offers a wide range of banking and investment products, including checking and savings accounts, loans and mortgages, and student loans. You can also save for retirement with SoFi Invest by opening an Active or Automated IRA account. How does the IRA Match Bonus Match Work? Until December 31, 2024, SoFi Invest is offering a 1% match on customer ACH deposits made into an existing or newly opened SoFi IRA account (Automated or Active). Terms \u0026 Conditions*: Deposits must remain in the IRA account for two years after the offer period expires. The match is available to customers who hold an Automated or Active IRA or Roth IRA, providing the accounts are in good standing. The match only applies to ACH deposits made during the offer period. For example, if you made a contribution at the beginning of 2024, prior to the offer period, it would not be eligible for the match.   *For full offer details, visit SoFi.  IRA Match Bonuses: Read The Fine Print On the surface, IRA bonuses seem like a no-brainer. After all, who wouldn't want an extra 3% added to their retirement savings or contributions. However, you really need to read the fine print before you sign up. With all of the brokers we've covered above, there are several conditions you must meet in order to secure the full bonus. For example, Webull pays its bonus in installments over a 5-year period, so if you enroll now you won't receive the full match until July 2029. And if you withdraw funds from your Webull IRA during that period, you likely won't receive the full bonus. You also need to follow the various transfer and contribution rules. For example, Robinhood only offers the 3% match on new contributions, not on transfers or rollovers. And the SoFi bonus only applies to ACH deposits — no other type of transfer will qualify. We've done our best to explain the key terms of each offer, but we may not have captured every detail. So, before you sign up, read the fine print on the brokerage website to ensure you fully understand the offer conditions. What Are The IRA Contribution Limits? The 2024 contribution limits for IRA and Roth IRAs are as follows: Under age 50: $7,000 Age 50 and older: $8,000 Keep in mind that these are combined limits for Traditional and Roth IRAs. So, if you have more than one IRA, you can't exceed the above totals for all accounts. But remember, moving an existing IRA from one provider to another does not impact your contributions.Source: The College InvestorAre IRA Match Bonus Offers Worth It?IRA transfer bonuses can be worth it if you're willing to keep the funds with the brokerage company for the time required to receive the full bonus. This means that you have to be comfortable with keeping your retirement savings with a Robinhood, Acorns, Webull, or SoFi Invest for as much as five years. If not, you're probably better off skipping the offer and continuing to invest where you feel comfortable.",

After all, who wouldn\u0026#39;t want an extra 3% added to their retirement savings or contributions. However, you really need to read the fine print before you sign up. With all of the brokers we\u0026#39;ve covered above, there are several conditions you must meet in order to secure the full bonus. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, Webull pays its bonus in installments over a 5-year period, so if you enroll now you won\u0026#39;t receive the full match until July 2029. And if you withdraw funds from your Webull IRA during that period, you likely won\u0026#39;t receive the full bonus. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou also need to follow the various transfer and contribution rules. For example, Robinhood only offers the 3% match on new contributions, not on transfers or rollovers. And the SoFi bonus only applies to ACH deposits — no other type of transfer will qualify. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#39;ve done our best to explain the key terms of each offer, but we may not have captured every detail. So, before you sign up, read the fine print on the brokerage website to ensure you fully understand the offer conditions. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"t-1721433977951\"\u003eWhat Are The IRA Contribution Limits? \u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-limit-increases-to-23000-for-2024-ira-limit-rises-to-7000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e2024 contribution limits\u003c/a\u003e for IRA and Roth IRAs are as follows: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnder age 50: $7,000 \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAge 50 and older: $8,000 \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeep in mind that these are combined limits for Traditional and Roth IRAs.
