  "text": "If you often drive in challenging conditions, all-wheel drive vs. four-wheel drive may be on your list of vehicle-shopping decisions. Although the terms AWD and 4WD are often used interchangeably, there are important differences that can make one or the other a better option for you.The simple definition of AWD and 4WD systems is that they control the power sent from a vehicle’s engine to all four wheels — including how much power and when — to improve traction. Beyond that, they have little in common when it comes to how they work and the best uses for each.What is AWD?AWD sends engine power to all four wheels at the same time, with most vehicles automatically deciding when to drive all four wheels. There are two types of AWD: full-time and part-time.Full-time AWD sends some amount of power to both vehicle axles at all times. It monitors wheel grip, and if either the front or rear wheels begin to slip, it sends more power to that set of wheels. There isn’t a delay in this shifting of power.Vehicles with part-time AWD send engine power to either the front wheels or rear wheels as the default. If the system detects that the primary wheels are slipping, it will transfer some of the engine power to the other axle. Part-time AWD is the most common and is more fuel efficient, since less energy is used to operate only two wheels.How does AWD work?AWD connects your vehicle’s engine to the front and rear wheels and uses sensors to detect whether wheel slippage is occurring. It then adjusts power to the front or back wheels if needed. Regardless of whether AWD is full-time or part-time, it works differently than 4WD, because the transfer of power from axle to axle is automatic. It doesn’t require any action from the driver. Some AWD vehicles do have a mode that a driver can engage for improved AWD response in extreme weather, but typically AWD operates without driver interaction.Electric vehicles with AWD typically work differently, using two electric motors — one for the front axle and one for the rear axle, so power is delivered to each set of wheels independently.AWD prosImproves traction in rain and snow. Works automatically, so you can focus on driving.More fuel efficient than 4WD.Can increase vehicle resale value.Designed for paved roads but handles some light off-roading.Can drive over mud, sand or other loose surfaces.AWD consVehicles with AWD typically cost more than two-wheel drive models.Not intended for heavy off-roading.What is 4WD?4WD vehicles (also called 4x4s) can send power to all four wheels, but changing from 2WD to 4WD usually doesn’t happen automatically. The driver shifts into 4WD when needed — for example, when needing more traction to climb rough terrain. Some recent 4WD vehicles do have a full-time, automatic mode that decides when to switch from 2WD to 4WD or how to adjust the balance of power. But these systems tend to kick in only at lower speeds.How does 4WD work?4WD locks your vehicle’s front and rear axles together, so all four wheels receive equal power and rotate at the same speed. This enables 4x4s to power through even when multiple wheels lose traction.Usually, drivers have a switch or button to toggle between driving with all four wheels or only two. 2WD should be used when driving on pavement, since using 4WD on surfaces like dry payment can damage the vehicle and tires. Most 4WD systems have low settings for towing or off-roading, and high settings for use in slippery on-road conditions like snow or ice.4WD prosProvides maximum traction for extreme weather conditions.Gives the driver more control.Usually found on vehicles with better towing capacities.Best for heavy off-roading.Good for driving over deep mud, large rocks and steep hills.4WD consVehicles with 4WD typically cost more than two-wheel drive models.Operating in 4WD on dry pavement can damage the vehicle.Less fuel-efficient than AWD.The 4WD system adds weight which can increase stopping distances.What is 2WD?Two-wheel drive systems power only the front or rear wheels, while the other set of wheels just spins. They can be rear-wheel drive (RWD) or more commonly front-wheel drive (FWD). Two-wheel drive vehicles are lighter and more fuel-efficient, because the engine isn’t powering all four wheels at once and the drive system weighs less. They’re well-suited to daily driving and usually cost less than AWD or 4WD models. Because their engine is above the front wheels, FWD vehicles tend to have better traction than RWD on slippery surfaces. RWD is often found on sports cars for better handling at high speeds or on pickup trucks or SUVs for improved traction when towing heavy loads. 2WD is used in the majority of passenger vehicles, but it won’t provide the maximum traction that AWD or 4WD will. Which vehicles have AWD vs 4WD?AWD is commonly available on cars, crossovers and SUVs. Some car manufacturers — such as Subaru, Mazda and Honda — have base models with standard AWD. Most other automakers offer AWD with higher trim levels. 4WD is mostly available on larger SUVs and trucks. Popular vehicles with 4WD either standard or as an option include the Jeep Wrangler, Toyota 4Runner, Ford F-150 and Ram 1500.Is AWD or 4WD the best option for you?Either AWD or 4WD can be your best choice, depending on how you intend to drive your vehicle. If you’ll be driving on rainy pavement or a few inches of snow, with occasional use on muddy backroads or campsite trails, an AWD vehicle would provide the versatility you need with better fuel efficiency.On the other hand, if heavy snow and rugged terrain are common where you live or travel, or you’ll be pulling heavy loads, a 4WD vehicle can provide more traction and control but with higher fuel costs.",
