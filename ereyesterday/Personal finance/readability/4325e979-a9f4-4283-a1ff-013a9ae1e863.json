  "text": "Before I retired from finance in 2012, I struggled with chronic back pain, sciatica, and TMJ. The stress was so overwhelming, I even paid a dentist $700 to drill divots into several teeth just so I could close my jaw more easily. At only 34, my body was breaking down, and I had no choice but to step away. No matter how much I wanted to keep going, my health wouldn’t allow it. Don’t assume you’ll be able to work for decades either. An unexpected health issue or disability could force you to retire early or pivot entirely. Your window to earn the most is likely shorter than you think. Make the most of it while you can. It's Hard To Do Hard Things Recently, I did one of the hardest work-related things I've ever had to do: I spent 12 hours narrating my new book, Millionaire Milestones: Simple Steps to Seven Figures. Perhaps for most people, speaking for 12 hours with the gusto and clarity of a professional actor might come naturally. But for me, it wasn’t because of my health issues. I had to record over four days because talking for three hours a day was the most that my lungs could take. My point of view in the recording studio Battling Asthma Since Childhood When I was in the fourth grade, I developed severe asthma. It was so bad that I had to be hospitalized twice, hooked up to IVs and medication. During one of those hospital stays, I broke out in a thousand red spots that all congealed together overnight. Because of my asthma, running long distances was a struggle—anything more than a mile felt like torture. But out of defiance, I participated in varsity track as a 200-meter sprinter and played varsity tennis. These sports had lots of stops and starts, giving me time to catch my breath and recover. By the time I got to college, my asthma had improved significantly. It only really flared up when I caught a cold. My coughing was always worse than the average person’s, and my recovery time was always slower. For the rest of my life, I was advised to carry two inhalers: one with albuterol to open my lungs during an episode and another, BREO Ellipta, for prevention. My Asthma Was Under Control Until the Pandemic For 40 years, I managed my asthma well. But in late 2020, at age 43, I began experiencing constant shortness of breath. Foolishly, I had tried a vaping cartridge to help calm the nerves, which may or may not have triggered my asthma shortly after. The pandemic was a challenging time for many, but for me, the stress was compounded by becoming a father for the second time. Our daughter was born just four months before the lockdowns began. I kept thinking how I was going to protect my baby, and our toddler whom we pulled from preschool for 18 months, while also ensuring we have enough money to be OK. Experiencing a 32% stock market drawdown in March 2020 with a newborn was stressful! And if you don't have parental leave, steady day job income, or subsidized healthcare, the stress is probably even heavier on Dual Unemployment Parents. Please hear from the experiences of DUPs if you plan to retire with young children. It's not for the faint of heart. You know how we’re supposed to breathe unconsciously? Well, I found myself breathing consciously—through both my mouth and nose—for hours a day because I never felt like I could get enough oxygen. I felt like I was always short of breath, inhaling only 70% of what I should be inhaling. Interestingly, the only time I forgot about my breathing was when I played tennis—probably because I was distracted by the fun of the game. Two Words That Surprised Me About My Health During the pandemic, I visited a pulmonologist at UCSF to check my lungs. He tested my lung capacity and prescribed additional medication, including Montelukast before bed. He warned me it might cause lucid dreams—and he was right! I didn't mind. He also encouraged me to exercise more, explaining that deep breathing and lung activity help maintain respiratory health. Then, during one follow-up visit, my doctor said something that made me do a double take: “Sam, after age 40, asthma often resurfaces. It’s a type of lung disease that you must manage for the rest of your life.” Lung disease? Yikes! I never thought of asthma as a lung disease, but there I was, hearing the cold, hard truth. Important tip: Secure a term life insurance policy before visiting the doctor for anything beyond a basic checkup. Otherwise, any new diagnosis could end up costing you significantly more in premiums. This happened to me after I saw a sleep doctor. The life insurance premium I got quoted went up 12X after! My wife and I finally got matching, affordable 20-year term policies through Policygenius during the pandemic, and it gave us tremendous peace of mind. When a Health Issue Turns Into a Work-Limiting Disability I assume we all have some health issue, with varying degrees of severity. My asthma didn’t prevent me from working in finance for 13 years, but I always noticed how exhausted I felt after speaking on the phone for more than a couple of hours. I constantly needed breaks, not for a smoke, of course, but just to regain stamina. Because I knew about my asthma, I asked Nick, the Executive Producer at Penguin Random House Audio, if we could extend my recording schedule for Millionaire Milestones. A typical 55,000-word book takes about 12 hours to record, usually over two or three sessions. I asked if we could spread it over four days, averaging three hours per session. Thankfully, he agreed. During the first session, I was excited and nervous. I had never been to a professional recording studio before, just my closet, when I recorded the intro and conclusion for my WSJ bestseller, Buy This Not That in 2022. At Fur Studios in the Mission District, I met Mary, the voice coach, and Grace, the sound technician. But there was one problem: I was still recovering from a cold I had caught in early February. I was coughing and breathing heavily. Three hours of recording later, I could barely speak or stand. Every third or fourth sentence, I had to redo because I mispronounced a word, skipped a word, added a word, or the microphone picked up my rumbling stomach. I was starting to see double on my iPad after two hours. By 11:30 AM, my tummy was growling like a car in a NASCAR race! Each day, though, I got a little healthier and more confident. By the last day, I almost felt like a pro, strolling into the studio like a boss and telling the control room, “Let's take five,” when I needed a break. My Disability Prevents Me From Being a Voice Actor Although I successfully completed my 12-hour recording on March 3, 2025, I was wiped out. After grabbing a pastrami sandwich at Wise \u0026 Sons, I went home and crashed for two hours. I had nothing left in the tank. Recording my book was the hardest thing I've done in a long while. Mary, the director, was kind and said I had a nice voice. She also mentioned that editorial had no edits after four days of recording—something that only happened once in her hundreds of book voice coaching sessions. For a moment, I thought, Maybe I could have a side hustle as a voice actor! But after waking up from my nap, reality hit: I simply wouldn’t have the energy to record enough books to make the side hustle worthwhile. Due to my asthma, I could only produce 10–20% of what a healthy voice actor could. If I had dreams of making it in this field as a full-time voice actor, they would be dashed. Probably Won't Be A Professional Podcaster Either This realization extends to the Financial Samurai podcast on Apple or Spotify. I’m confident I could grow it into a large show if I put in the same dedication as I do my writing. But I can’t, mainly because of my breathing issues. Talking for more than 45 minutes makes me winded, which is why my episodes are usually 30 minutes long or less. Plus, I don’t have the stamina to record multiple episodes a week. Instead, after one episode, I feel like I need at least two weeks to recover, which hurts momentum. So, my dreams of becoming a professional podcaster? Out the window. These days, I just create occasional episodes to complement my writing. Ironically, one of the reasons I started the podcast in the first place was to hedge against carpal tunnel and arthritis messing with my hands and keeping me from writing! Oh, the joys of getting old. If you're young, please don't waste your youth. Sitting in the professional podcast booth recording 12 hours of Millionaire Milestones Don’t Expect to Work Forever At The Same Standard Due to Health Issues I’m incredibly proud of making Millionaire Milestones, now available to both readers and listeners. I hope you'll pick up both a hard copy and an audio version. While recording a chapter on why people strive for financial independence, I had to pause. My lungs were tightening, and then my eyes welled up as I thought of my wife and kids—how I had to keep going, despite the struggle to breathe, for them. I could not fail to complete the last mile. We'd like to believe we all operate on a level playing field, where meritocracy determines success. But the truth is, we all have different abilities and disabilities. We should respect and acknowledge these differences. One day, your eyesight may weaken. Your once-unbreakable strength may fade due to illness. Your voice may give out, or your fingers may lose their dexterity. Or perhaps your beautiful mind might be attacked by disease. Whatever the case, don’t expect your ability to work to last forever. Health issues and disabilities catch up with us all eventually. It’s just a matter of when. Forecast When Your Mind And Body Will Fail While you still can, save and invest aggressively. Diversify your income streams. Build up your passive income portfolio. One day, your body will falter, and you’ll need a strong financial foundation to support you. This pre-mortem planning aligns with my belief in the importance of forecasting your misery. Most people start their careers bright-eyed and enthusiastic, but after a decade or more of repetition, boredom inevitably sets in. By anticipating this, you can build a substantial financial cushion ahead of time. So when that boredom turns into misery, you’ll have the freedom to pursue something new. But I hadn't really thought about forecasting your health issues, until I recorded my book. Please don’t take your health for granted—and don’t take the people who bring you joy and comfort for granted either. Nothing lasts forever, and one day, they too will disappear. Grace (audio technician), Mary (voice director), and me after we finished recording It’s Been a Good Run So Far, But Everything Must End At 47, it’s clear that I’m not as strong or healthy as I once was. Most professional athletes realize this by 35. Please don’t take your health or your ability to work for granted. When the time comes that you can no longer perform at your highest level, pivot to something meaningful and enjoyable. I've found professional mentorship to be rewarding, as well as fatherhood. Share as much of your wisdom as possible before the inevitable. Life is impermanent. Make the most of it. Though we may not be as capable when we are older, new opportunities will emerge. We just have to find them. Fight on! Readers, has a health issue or disability ever prevented you from continuing your work or pursuing your dream job? If so, at what age did your health challenges begin to impact your career? What other factors should we consider about the relationship between work and health that haven't been discussed yet? Thanks For Your Support! This post marks the final chapter in support of my book launch. It’s a bittersweet moment after all the years I spent bringing it to life. But it was worth it because the hard things are always the most worthwhile!

If I had dreams of making it in this field as a full-time voice actor, they would be dashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-probably-won-t-be-a-professional-podcaster-either\"\u003eProbably Won\u0026#39;t Be A Professional Podcaster Either\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis realization extends to the Financial Samurai podcast on \u003ca aria-label=\"Apple (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.financialsamurai.com/apple\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noreferrer noopener\"\u003eApple\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca aria-label=\"Spotify (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.financialsamurai.com/spotify\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e. I’m confident I could grow it into a large show if I put in the same dedication as I do my writing. But I can’t, mainly because of my breathing issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTalking for more than 45 minutes makes me winded, which is why my episodes are usually 30 minutes long or less. Plus, I don’t have the stamina to record multiple episodes a week. Instead, after one episode, I feel like I need at least two weeks to recover, which hurts momentum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, my dreams of becoming a professional podcaster? Out the window. These days, I just create occasional episodes to complement my writing. Ironically, one of the reasons I started the podcast in the first place was to hedge against carpal tunnel and arthritis messing with my hands and keeping me from writing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOh, the joys of getting old.
