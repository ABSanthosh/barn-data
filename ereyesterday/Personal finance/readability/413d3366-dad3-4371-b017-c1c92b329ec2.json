  "text": "Source: The College Investor Colleges have a \"type\" of student they are secretly looking for when deciding on admissions.The college admissions process is notoriously competitive. And if the past couple of decades are any indication, getting into college is becoming even harder, overall.College acceptance rates hover at a national average of 68%, though the rate at some of the nation’s top institutions is a shocking 3%.So, what are colleges really looking for as they sift through the thousands of annual applications?  While schools emphasize the importance of an applicant’s academic performance, extracurricular involvement, and personal essay, more covert factors taken into account that are not discussed publicly. Here are seven less obvious yet significant factors that could play a role in your admissions decision. What Colleges Look For In Students 1. Demonstrated InterestSchools look for students who have indicated interest in their school by monitoring things such as campus visits, direct outreach, and online activity. That’s right – admissions offices are collecting more data on prospective students than ever before.This is partly due to necessary adaptations made during and after Covid-19, but it’s also because today’s typical 18-year-old is likely to engage with a prospective college almost entirely online. So, schools had to get creative with how they track student interest, which helps them determine how serious a student is about attending their school if accepted.But why do colleges care about this anyway? Colleges translate a higher level of demonstrated interest to a greater chance of enrollment. Predicting these numbers helps colleges manage their enrollment rates. And showing sustained interest in a school both signals your commitment and makes you a more attractive applicant. The good news? This is likely something you’re already doing; you just didn’t know it was being monitored. Why It Matters: Colleges value demonstrated interest from students, and expressing your interest could benefit your chances of acceptance, in turn.2. Geographic DiversityWhere you’re from could determine your college prospects. Why? Because colleges use geographic diversity as a way to create a more varied and enriching campus environment. In fact, because most institutions are working to broaden their geographic reach, students from underrepresented states, regions, or countries may have an edge in the admissions process.Earlier this year, U.S. News \u0026 World Report wrote about this exact topic. In it, they say, “Colleges want to build a diverse student body, and geographical information can give context about an applicant’s academic curriculum and the cultural diversity they can bring to the school.”In particular, since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling against race-based college admissions, schools have largely turned to geography as the next best reference point of cultural, racial, and socioeconomic identity.Why It Matters: There are several benefits to having a geographically diverse student body, so colleges typically seek students from underrepresented regions.3. Legacy StatusThis is one of those significant yet often unspoken factors in the college admissions process. Legacy status refers to the priority ranking commonly given to the children or grandchildren of alumni, who are more likely to receive admission to that school.Is it still used? Some studies suggest that legacy benefits are waning, while other studies indicate the practice is still in use at many academic institutions. On its own, legacy status isn’t likely enough to base an admissions decision on, but it can influence the overall decision when considered with other factors.Legacy status admissions are a mutually beneficial transaction. The incoming student receives admission into a desirable school, and the school is more likely to receive greater alumni engagement and donations. Though legacy is a controversial factor, schools, especially prestigious ones, believe that it contributes to a sense of continuity and tradition that reinforces a college's community and identity.Why It Matters: Applying as a legacy student is one more way to demonstrate your interest in a school. An admissions office may take this as a signal that you are more likely to enroll, given your pre-existing ties to the campus.4. Institutional PrioritiesEach year, colleges set specific institutional needs and priorities that shape their admissions decisions. Some of these priorities are long-term and address the overall mission of the school; others are short-term and typically make up for some perceived lack at the institution or address donor issues.Institutional priorities are unique to each school and are determined by leadership. If you want a better idea of a school’s priorities, locate their Strategic Plan (see a good example here) and read through it to identify the steps they plan to take toward meeting their mission and values. (FYI – a quick internet search returned the Strategic Plan of my alma mater).Here are a few common institutional priorities:AthletesFirst-generation college studentsStudents from underrepresented backgrounds (race, gender, geography, etc.)Winners of academic scholarships and competitionsStudents interested in new or under-enrolled academic programsFulfilling major donor initiatives Legacies (plus students of faculty and staff)Having a “hook” (more on this below)So, for example, a school might prioritize admissions of students seeking STEM fields to help balance gender ratios in specific programs and departments.Or, a school may have a new initiative that was created by the alumni association or other major donor. For example, Tulane has a relatively new MakerSpace that they spent millions of dollars to build. They would hate to have the space go unused. If you would use this type of space for your education or ideas, you may have a leg up on the competition.Another example is UC San Diego's relatively new Music Center. While they've always had a robust music and arts program, they recently built a state-of-the-art concert hall and music center. They will likely be adding to their music and arts department as a result - and students can take advantage of this during admissions.The bottom line is that students should perform some searches of programs, initiatives, donations, and endowments in areas that they want to study.Why It Matters: Institutional priorities reflect a school’s broader mission and goals. Understanding these priorities will help you position your relevant strengths and experiences in a way that aligns with the school’s current objectives, thereby increasing your chances of admission.5. Special Talents (AKA “Hooks”)Perhaps you’ve heard about someone who had a “hook” that helped them through the admissions process. It refers to a personal trait or special achievement that benefits a student in the admissions process because it meets an institutional priority.Admissions offices commonly see students with a hook in areas like the arts, music, or athletics. Colleges value these exceptional skills or achievements because they complement the school’s reputation and success, enhance campus life, and may even add prestige.Even better if this special hook aligns with the institutional priorities we discussed above.Why It Matters: Colleges are always looking for students who can bring something unique to their campus. Highlighting your special talents, passions, and background in an application can give you a slight edge in the admissions process.6. Ability To Pay In-FullWhile most of us are looking for ways to reduce the cost of college, there is another strategy at play: just pay the full sticker price. Why? It might increase your chances of being admitted, especially to private institutions or those with lower financial aid budgets.Full-pay students (those who don’t receive any institutional financial aid) contribute directly to a school’s revenue, allowing the school to fund more scholarships, programs, and campus improvements. Colleges are constantly seeking new and additional funding, and a full-pay student instantly relieves some of the financial pressure on the institution.Remember, just because a school is a non-profit does not mean they aren't trying to maximize revenue.Why It Matters: Schools sometimes consider a student’s need for financial aid when deciding whether to admit them. Though it’s not the best strategy – and is often faulted for favoring wealthy applicants – being able to pay in-full for four years may help open doors at top-tier institutions.7. Application TimingWhen you apply to a college can influence the admissions decision. Most schools offer an early action or early decision timeframe, and utilizing this opportunity can increase your chances of being accepted. If you think back to the first item listed in this article, you’ll remember that colleges want prospective students to clearly demonstrate their interest in and commitment to the school. Applying early does just that – plus it helps the admissions office proactively manage their offers of admission and anticipated enrollment numbers.Why It Matters: The benefits of applying early include minimizing the stress of decision-making your senior year of high school, finding broader options for financial aid, receiving a decision sooner, and even allowing yourself more time to plan your academic future. Perhaps most importantly, though, demonstrating your interest early on can boost the likelihood you are accepted.When Money Can’t Buy You EverythingThere’s far more to the admissions process than what meets the eye. While academic achievement, extracurricular involvement, and test scores are extremely important, they aren’t the only elements considered in your college admissions decision. By no means am I advocating for these hidden factors. In fact, you may even feel that some of them have ethical drawbacks or deepen existing inequities in the college admissions process. However, you should now have a better idea of the multiple aspects that play a role in the admissions process, and can hopefully best position yourself for your academic future because of this new knowledge.Remember, each of these holds some weight of its own in the decision-making process. So, if you aren’t able to pay your own way through college, get creative with the other options for playing up your strengths and experiences!More Stories:",
