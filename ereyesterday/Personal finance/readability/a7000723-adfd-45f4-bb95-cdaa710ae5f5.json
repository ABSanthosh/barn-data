Learn how to recognize and avoid six common moving scams, plus where to report a fraudulent mover and how to get your money back.1. Weight bumpingHow it worksFirst, you get a non-binding estimate for the cost of your move. Then, on the day of the move, the movers tell you that your belongings weigh more than the company originally thought they did. They may charge you more per pound than the first estimate, sometimes as much as double the amount. If this happens after your belongings are loaded on the truck, the movers can effectively hold your things hostage until you pay the higher price.How to avoid itWhile there‚Äôs no sure-fire way to know that your total move weight has been accurately estimated, using only reputable movers can help. You can also protect yourself from the bait-and-switch aspect of this scam by getting only binding moving estimates (signed by both parties) before you hire a mover. Many of NerdWallet‚Äôs top-rated moving companies offer binding estimates.2. Lowball estimatesHow it worksThe mover provides a very low estimate, then refuses to release the customer‚Äôs belongings unless they pay additional fees or a higher price overall. How to avoid itTo avoid falling victim to this scam, get multiple estimates (preferably binding) from reputable movers, and be cautious of quotes that are much lower than the average price range. Always ask about potential fees and make sure that all communication with the company is in writing.3. Stolen truckloadHow it worksThe move appears to be going according to plan, and all your belongings have been loaded onto the truck without incident. But then, the truck never arrives at its destination, and you can‚Äôt get in contact with customer service. The company may also demand additional fees to release your stuff, or it might ‚Äúlose track‚Äù of individual boxes or items.How to avoid itTo avoid this scam, only hire vetted, reputable movers, and keep a thorough, written inventory of all belongings being moved. You can also take pictures or videos of all of your things as they‚Äôre loaded onto the truck, so you can address any discrepancies quickly after the truck is unloaded.4. No show after depositHow it worksThe customer pays the mover a significant deposit, and then on the day of the move, the mover doesn‚Äôt show up. How to avoid itTo protect yourself from no-shows, be wary of movers who require deposits, especially large ones. Most of our top-rated movers don‚Äôt require an upfront deposit, and those that do charge a low flat rate or a 10-15% fee. 5. Credit card upchargesHow it worksThe mover provides the service but then charges the customer‚Äôs credit card a higher amount than the agreed-upon price. In the hectic frenzy of moving, customers may hand over a credit card at the end of the day, sign on the dotted line and be unaware they‚Äôve been victimized by this scam until they receive their monthly credit card statement.How to avoid itTo avoid being scammed with an unexpected upcharge, use only reputable movers and try to get a binding estimate if possible. Keep an eye on your credit card statement during and after your move, and read the fine print before signing anything. Keep copies of contracts and estimates so you have evidence if you need to open a dispute with your credit card company.6. Thin contractsHow it worksFraudulent movers may offer contracts that leave out important details, allowing them to add extra charges at the end of the move. Some may even ask you to sign a partially or fully blank document. How to avoid itRead all contracts carefully. Make sure they include your moving quote, a detailed list of everything included in the move, and your pickup and delivery dates and times.How to choose a moving companyBefore selecting a mover, do the following:Review the company‚Äôs¬†Better Business Bureau (BBB) rating. You can see their average review with customers and check if any formal complaints have been filed against them.Search the FMCSA Mover database. This tool allows you to see a company‚Äôs location, contact information, registration status with the DOT, safety info and any complaints that have been lodged against it. You‚Äôll also be able to find out if the company you‚Äôre considering is a full-service mover or a moving broker. Moving brokers contract third-party carriers and may have less consistent payment policies.Read online reviews from trusted sites like Google, BBB, Angi and TrustPilot. If you only see very recent, positive reviews, the company may be manipulating reviews.Ask friends and neighbors if they‚Äôve used the mover, or ask the mover for references.Verify that the mover exists by driving by the mover‚Äôs listed address or using online satellite and street map tools to see if the company has a physical location.Document the moving process by getting everything in writing, saving all paperwork and taking inventory photos of everything you‚Äôre moving.¬†Moving company red flagsA mover may not be reputable if it has any of the following issues:ContactThe website doesn‚Äôt display insurance information or an FMCSA registration (including the DOT number or other type of registration).When you call the business phone number, a customer service representative doesn‚Äôt answer with the company name.The email address doesn‚Äôt contain the company name or use a professional domain.They lack any online presence.They claim to have been in business for many years, but all online reviews are very recent.They won‚Äôt provide the exact address of their storage facility.The company keeps changing its name or address.They won‚Äôt answer your questions.They bombard you with unsolicited calls and emails.QuotesThey don‚Äôt provide a careful inspection of your property and belongings, and instead offer a telephone or online quote sight-unseen.The quote you receive is much lower than average or than other estimates.They won‚Äôt provide you with a written quote (binding or non-binding) and want you to hire them with just a handshake.¬†They try to pressure you into hiring them by claiming they have a limited-time discount that needs to be locked in immediately.PaymentThey don‚Äôt accept credit cards.They require cash or a large deposit before the move.They charge for a quote.Moving dayThe driver arrives in a rented truck instead of a professionally labeled moving van.The driver asks you to sign blank documents.ü§ìNerdy TipIf you catch several of these red flags last minute or even on the day of your move, consider canceling and rescheduling with a more reputable company. It may be awkward, but it‚Äôs better than losing more money or even your belongings.How to report a moving scamIf you‚Äôve been scammed by your movers, report the crime to the police first. Here are other helpful places to report:Report to your state moving agency. Each state has its own agency that regulates moving companies, so you‚Äôd need to contact that agency for instructions on filing a complaint.File a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. You can also post a negative review there that will help warn others against using the mover.Frequently asked questionsCan I get my money back if my credit card was upcharged during my move?If unauthorized charges from movers appear on your credit card, contact the financial institution that issued the credit card to report the fraud and dispute the charges. Have all supporting contracts and documentation available.Can I take legal action if my mover scammed me?You can contact a lawyer to explore your options, which may involve taking the mover to small claims court or, if the mover has scammed multiple customers, filing a class action lawsuit.What‚Äôs the difference between binding and non-binding moving contracts?There are three main types of moving contracts:A binding contract means your mover can‚Äôt legally ask you for any more money than the price appearing in the original quote.A non-binding contract means you may have to pay more than the quoted price if your items weigh more than estimated or you need additional services. Under federal law, however, this price difference shouldn‚Äôt exceed 110% of your original quote.A binding-not-to-exceed contract allows movers to charge a bit more than quoted if additional weight or services are involved, but that amount can‚Äôt exceed the amount specified in the contract.",
