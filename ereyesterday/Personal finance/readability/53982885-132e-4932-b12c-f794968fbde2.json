  "text": "Image source: PexelsThere’s a persistent, shiny narrative in the world of personal development and finance: If you want to be rich, act like you already are. Dress well. Speak with confidence. Dine out. Drive a nice car. Show the universe you believe in your abundance, and it will reward you.This mindset, sometimes labeled as “fake it till you make it” or a form of manifestation, is often peddled as empowering advice. The problem? For poor and working-class people, it’s not just impractical. It’s potentially destructive. Telling people with limited resources to mimic the spending habits or outward image of the wealthy isn’t just tone-deaf. It’s dangerous. It ignores the very real constraints of financial hardship, oversimplifies wealth-building, and often leads to debt, burnout, and shame.Here’s a closer look at why this popular idea needs to be questioned and why it might be time to stop telling poor people to “act rich.”Should We Stop Telling Poor People to “Act Rich”?The Advice Sounds Empowering, But It’s Rooted in DenialOn the surface, the “act rich” philosophy sounds like confidence-building. It’s about visualizing a better future and stepping into that version of yourself. But for many people, especially those living paycheck to paycheck, it promotes denial over discipline.Pretending you’re financially better off than you are doesn’t actually change your financial situation. It creates a psychological rift, encouraging you to suppress the reality of your limitations rather than confront them. That can lead to poor choices, like putting luxury items on credit or living beyond your means to maintain a curated image. Real empowerment starts with clarity, not illusion. You can have ambition without lying to yourself.Performing Wealth Doesn’t Create WealthLet’s be clear: there’s a huge difference between cultivating a mindset of abundance and literally spending money you don’t have to look like you do. “Acting rich” often involves material choices—clothing, gadgets, cars—that stretch budgets to the breaking point.For someone without generational wealth or financial cushioning, these choices don’t create momentum. They create liabilities. Leasing a luxury car to feel successful doesn’t build assets. Wearing designer brands while skipping rent payments isn’t strategic. It’s survival masked as status.Poor people are often penalized for looking poor, so there’s social pressure to look wealthier than you are. But performance isn’t the path to prosperity. It’s a distraction from building real security.The Advice Presumes Equal Access, Which Doesn’t ExistTelling someone to “act rich” assumes a level playing field. But we don’t all start from the same place. A wealthy person who makes a bold investment and fails often has a safety net. A poor person who takes the same risk might lose everything.This advice often ignores systemic inequality, generational poverty, and the real psychological toll of financial instability. It’s easy to romanticize confidence and charisma when you’re not worried about eviction, medical bills, or skipping meals to pay utilities.“Acting rich” becomes a privilege, not a strategy. It puts the blame on individuals for failing to behave rich enough instead of questioning why real opportunities for upward mobility are so hard to come by.Image source: UnsplashIt Promotes a Culture of Shame and DebtOne of the most damaging side effects of the “act rich” mindset is the shame it breeds. If you’ve bought into the belief that wealth is just a mindset, then your poverty becomes a personal failure. It’s not a systemic issue. Not a circumstantial challenge. Just proof that you didn’t manifest hard enough.This creates fertile ground for toxic financial behavior: overspending, hiding money troubles, and falling into high-interest debt just to maintain appearances. The cycle is vicious, and it’s not accidental. Credit card companies and luxury brands benefit from people who feel like their worth is tied to what they show off. What’s worse? Many people suffer in silence, afraid to admit that trying to “act rich” has left them poorer than ever.True Wealth Is Built Quietly, Not FlashilySome of the wealthiest people in the world live modestly. They buy used cars, wear plain clothing, and live well below their means. That’s not by accident. It’s by design. Real wealth isn’t always visible. And in most cases, the louder someone looks rich, the less financial flexibility they actually have.Telling poor people to “act rich” flips this logic on its head. It encourages them to make financial choices based on perception, not stability. But wealth isn’t something you perform. It’s something you protect. Living like you’re already rich doesn’t prepare you to be rich. It often delays your ability to ever become it.There’s Power in Acting Financially Literate, Not Financially FlashyThere’s one form of “acting rich” that does serve people of any income bracket, and that’s acting financially educated. Understanding compound interest, debt cycles, passive income, emergency savings, and credit scores will get you further than any designer bag ever could.Financial literacy doesn’t require wealth. It requires intention. And it has a far greater return on investment than mimicking high-status spending habits. Want to build wealth? Learn the habits of people who sustain it, not just those who flaunt it.A Better Approach: Normalize Acting Your WageInstead of telling poor people to act rich, we should normalize the dignity of “acting your wage.” That means living honestly within your means. Making strategic decisions. Owning your financial truth instead of covering it up.Acting your wage isn’t about shame. It’s about control. It allows you to build real stability, reduce stress, and prioritize growth over ego. It’s not glamorous, but it’s powerful. And when you stop trying to impress others, you start making decisions that truly benefit you.Stop Selling Performance as ProgressTelling poor people to “act rich” isn’t aspirational. It’s exploitative. It tells people struggling under capitalism to play pretend instead of demanding structural change. It offers ego boosts instead of equity. Illusion instead of instruction.We don’t need more people faking financial success. We need a culture that values honesty, discipline, and realistic paths to prosperity. One that doesn’t mock frugality or glorify debt. One that values the grind more than the gloss. So, no, we shouldn’t tell poor people to act rich. We should tell them the truth: that wealth isn’t a vibe. It’s a plan.Have you ever felt pressure to look wealthier than you are just to be taken seriously?
