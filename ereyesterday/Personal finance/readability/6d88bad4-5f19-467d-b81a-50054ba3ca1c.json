It allows you to make money without having to work all… Looking for the best passive income ideas for stay-at-home parents? Making money from home as a stay-at-home parent can be tricky. You want to earn extra cash, but you also need to take care of your kids. That’s where passive income comes in handy. It allows you to make money without having to work all the time. So, what is passive income? Passive income is money you earn with little ongoing effort. You set things up, then keep making money over time (there may be some work to keep it going, but you are able to earn money without constantly working). It’s like planting a tree that gives you fruit year after year. Passive income streams can give you more freedom and flexibility as a stay-at-home mom or dad, which I’m sure is always needed! I’m a parent and I am personally always looking for more ways to earn passive income. Best Passive Income Ideas for Stay-at-Home Parents Below are the best passive income ideas for stay-at-home parents. 1. High yield savings accounts One of the easiest passive income ideas for stay-at-home parents is to open a high-yield savings account. These accounts have higher interest rates than regular savings accounts. That means your money grows faster without any extra work from you. Many people keep their cash in low-interest accounts, and this is like leaving free money on the table. By switching to a high-yield account, you can earn more without changing your habits. It’s super easy to open one of these accounts. Most can be set up online in just a few minutes. You don’t need a lot of money to start, either. Even small amounts can add up over time with better interest rates. Some high-yield accounts offer rates of 4% or more. That’s way better than the tiny 0.05% that many regular banks give. Let’s break it down with a real example: Imagine you have $10,000 saved in a high-yield savings account that has an interest rate of 4% per year. Over one year, your $10,000 would earn $400 in interest. Now, compare that to a regular bank that has a 0.05% interest rate. With that same $10,000, you would earn only $5 over the entire year. Only $5! As you can see, a high-yield account can make a huge difference, allowing your money to grow much faster compared to a traditional savings account. I personally use Marcus by Goldman Sachs for my high-yield savings account. You can get 3.90% (at the time of this writing). 2. Start a blog For me, I make a full-time income from my blog, and I think it’s a great way for parents to make money from home. A blog is writing published on a website, like what you’re reading right now. You can start a blog on just about anything, like finance (which is what my blog is about), recipes, family life, health, pets, sports, travel, and more. I started my blog about 10 years ago and I have now earned over $5,000,000 from it – with a lot of it being semi-passive income. I enjoy my days with my toddler daughter and work when she’s sleeping or at her part-time preschool – and that’s it! Starting a blog can be a great way to make money from home semi-passively. No, it’s not entirely passive, but there are ways to make money with your blog while you’re sleeping or on vacation so that you can have more freedom in your day. My favorite way is with affiliate marketing, which is where you promote products you like (like a book on Amazon) in a blog post and earn money from that. I have a free How To Start a Blog Course where I show you how to create a blog, from the technical side all the way to earning your first income and attracting followers. 3. Sell printables Printables are digital files customers download and print themselves. You can create things like planners, gift tags, coloring pages, or wall art. The best part? You only make each design once. After that, you can sell it over and over without extra work. No packing or shipping needed! You don’t need to be an artist to start. Many successful sellers learned as they went along. Free tools like Canva make designing easier, and with practice, you can improve quickly. You can learn more at How I Make Money Selling Printables On Etsy. 4. Print on demand Print-on-demand is a way to make money from home. You can design products like T-shirts, mugs, tote bags, and phone cases without keeping any inventory. Here’s how it works: You create designs and upload them to a print-on-demand website. When someone buys your product, the company prints your design and ships it to the customer. You don’t have to do any of the hard work! No storing products, no packing boxes, and no trips to the post office. It’s a great option if you don’t want to deal with shipping. With some effort, you could make $500 to $1,500 a month from print-on-demand. It’s a fun way to be creative and earn extra cash without leaving your house! You can learn more at How I Make $1,500 Monthly With My Print-On-Demand Business. 10Print-On-Demand Free GuideThis freebie will teach you about print-on-demand as well as give you a list of 17 hot-selling products you can sell via print on demand. 5. Sell stock photos Selling stock photos could be a fun way to earn extra cash from home. You can take pictures of everyday things like families, pets, or nature scenes. Then, you upload these photos to websites that sell them like Shutterstock, Deposit Photos, Getty Images, or Adobe Stock. Many people need stock photos. Bloggers use them in articles. Companies put them on their websites. Even small businesses need pictures for their social media posts. I buy stock images all the time because they make blog posts more engaging and enjoyable to read (you’ll actually see several stock images in this post). 6. Rental real estate Rental real estate can be a great way to make money while you’re at home. You buy a property and rent it out to tenants. Each month, they pay you rent, so this can give you a steady passive income. Over time, the property might go up in value too. This means you could sell it for more than you paid later on. But owning rental property isn’t always easy. You need to find good tenants and keep the place in good shape. Sometimes things break and you have to fix them. If you want less work, you can hire a property manager. They’ll handle most of the day-to-day tasks for you. This makes it more passive, but you’ll earn less money overall because you will have to pay the property manager. Recommended reading: 23 Best Real Estate Side Hustles To Make Extra Money 7. Dividends Dividends are money that companies pay to their shareholders. When you own stocks in a company that pays dividends, you get a share of their profits. Not all companies pay dividends. Older, more stable companies are more likely to do this. Some examples are Johnson \u0026 Johnson, Coca-Cola, and McDonald’s. You can get dividends in cash or more shares of stock. Many companies pay them four times a year, and the amount you get depends on how many shares you own. Dividend stocks can be a good way to earn extra money without doing much work. It’s passive income that can grow over time. As you buy more shares, you could earn more dividends. Here’s how dividends work: If you have 10 shares of Company XYZ and they pay you $5 per share in dividends each year, you’ll earn $50 in total for the year. Most companies pay dividends four times a year, so in this case, the $5 would be split into four payments of $1.25 each quarter. Remember, dividend payments aren’t guaranteed. Companies can change or stop them if they need to. But many try to keep paying dividends to keep their shareholders happy. Recommended reading: What Are Dividends \u0026 How Do They Work? A Beginner’s Guide 8. Write an ebook Writing an ebook can be a good way to earn passive income as a stay-at-home parent. You can share your knowledge on a topic you’re passionate about and make money while doing it. There are many topics you can write an ebook about, such as romance, a hobby that you’re passionate about, travel, how-to guides, parenting advice, and more. Writing an ebook takes time and effort. But once it’s done, you can keep earning money from it for years to come. It’s a great way to turn your knowledge into cash while staying home with your kids. 9. Create an online course Over the years, I’ve made more than $2,000,000 from selling courses that I’ve personally created. Making an online course can be a great way to earn money from home. You can share what you know about any topic you’re good at. It could be cooking, crafting, personal finance, traveling, parenting, and more. Creating a course takes work at first. You’ll need to plan your lessons, make videos or write content, and set up a way for people to buy it. But once it’s done, you can sell it over and over without much extra work.
