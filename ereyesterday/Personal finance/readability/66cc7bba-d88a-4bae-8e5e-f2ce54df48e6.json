Luckily, there are many options out there for teens like you who want… Are you wondering what the best jobs for 16-year-olds are? Getting a job as a 16-year-old can be exciting and a bit scary. You’re ready to earn your own money and gain work experience, but you might not know where to start. Luckily, there are many options out there for teens like you who want to work. When I was 16, I got my first “real” job working at a company, and it was such a big thing for me. Earning my own paycheck for the first time was exciting – I felt a sense of independence and responsibility that was completely new. I also made lifelong friends and I even ended up working there for around 5 years! Recommended reading: 23 Business Ideas For Teens To Make Extra Money Can a 16 year old work legally? Yes, you can work legally at 16 years old in the United States. This is great news if you’re looking to earn some money! At 16, you have more job options than younger teens. You can work in many places, like stores, restaurants, and offices. There are some rules to keep you safe, though. You can’t do jobs that are too dangerous. These include working with certain machines or hazardous materials. Here’s a good place to learn more about the rules – U.S. Department of Labor Child Labor. Best Jobs for 16 Year Olds Below are the best jobs for 16-year-olds. 1. Babysitting Babysitting is a great job for 16-year-olds and many families look for responsible teens to watch their kids. Babysitters take care of children when parents are away. Your duties might include playing games, preparing snacks, and helping with homework. Some jobs may need you to stay overnight. Pay for babysitting varies, but you can expect around $10 to $25 per hour. The exact amount depends on your location and experience (for example, a babysitting job in California will most likely pay more than if you lived in Kansas). Some families may pay more for special skills or certifications too. You can find babysitting jobs through family friends, neighbors, or online platforms like local Facebook groups. To be a successful babysitter, you need to be responsible and good with kids, and having first aid skills or CPR certification can make you stand out. Babysitting is a great job for teens who enjoy spending time with kids. I still remember starting my first real babysitting job when I was a teenager (where I didn’t know the family but I found them on a bulletin board in my local area). I worked around 36 hours a week in the summer for a single mom who was a nurse. She paid me $10 an hour, and this was a long time ago, so the rates have definitely gone up since then. 2. Dog walker Walking dogs can be a fun way for you to earn money at 16. Many pet owners need help exercising their dogs during the day, such as when they are at work. Dog walkers take dogs on walks around the neighborhood. You might walk one dog at a time or multiple dogs together. Pay usually ranges from $10 to $20 per walk per dog. 3. Pet sitter Pet sitting can be a great job for 16-year-olds who love animals. You can earn money by taking care of pets while their owners are away. Pet sitters feed animals, take dogs for walks, or play with cats. Some pet-sitting jobs might involve staying overnight at the owner’s home or the pet may stay in your home (it all just depends on what is agreed upon between you and the pet owner). The pay for pet sitting varies, and you could make $25 to $75 per night usually. A few years back, I needed someone to care for my two dogs while I was away, so I found a great family to help. The teenagers in the family took care of my dogs, playing with them and keeping them company, with their parents around to supervise. My dogs stayed at their house for a week, had a fantastic time, and the teens were able to make some extra money in the process! 4. Lawn mowing Lawn mowing is a great job for 16-year-olds. You can start your own small business or work for a local lawn care company. Many homeowners need help keeping their yards nice, and this creates opportunities for you to earn money during spring and summer. I actually have a few friends who started mowing lawns when they were 16 as a side hustle, and they now have full-time businesses with teams where they run a landscaping company and are quite successful with it! So, there is a lot of room for growth with this job. 5. Lemonade stand A lemonade stand is a classic job for 16-year-olds looking to make some money. And, no, 16 years old isn’t too old for a lemonade stand at all! Running a lemonade stand at this age can still be a fun and valuable experience. At 16, teenagers can bring a bit more creativity and business sense to their lemonade business, making it even more successful. For example, they might experiment with new flavors (like strawberry lemonade or passion fruit lemonade), better signage, or even sell other treats like cookies or snacks (maybe lemon bars?) to make more money. 6. Washing cars Washing cars can be a fun way for 16-year-olds to make money. You can start by selling this service to family, friends, and neighbors. Many people are happy to pay for a clean car, and you can charge different prices based on the size of the vehicle and the type of wash. You can find car wash jobs at local businesses too. Many car washes hire teens to help with washing and drying vehicles. 7. Household chores helper Many busy families need extra help to keep their homes clean. As a chores helper, you could do tasks like washing dishes, doing laundry, or vacuuming. You might also help with organizing closets or cleaning bathrooms. Some families may ask you to help their younger kids with simple chores too. To get started, you can ask family friends if they need help around the house. You can also post flyers in your neighborhood or use social media to find clients. Here’s an example of a job related to this: A parent recently posted on a neighborhood Facebook group that I’m in about a job their child was offering. For $2 a week, the child would bring a neighbor’s trash can to the curb on trash day and then return it to the side of the house later. The neighborhood has strict rules about when trash cans can be out: only on trash day, and they must be brought back in by evening. Many residents couldn’t always manage this chore, so the kid came up with a smart way to earn some money. At just $8 to $10 a month, many neighbors signed up. The child now has about 30 houses signed up, earning $8 to $10 per house each month with minimal time and effort. 8. Tutoring younger kids Tutoring younger kids can be a great job for 16-year-olds. You can help elementary or middle school students with their homework and studies. Many parents look for tutors to help their children after school in subjects like math, reading, or science. To find tutoring jobs, you can ask your teachers if they know families who need help. You can also post flyers at local libraries or community centers. 9. Paper delivery Paper delivery can be a great job for 16-year-olds. Most newspapers today are delivered in bulk by adults using cars. Still, you can reach out to local newspaper companies to see if they have any delivery roles available for you. When I was a kid, I had a friend whose family ran a paper route to make some extra money. She helped with the deliveries and even got to keep a little for herself. It wasn’t a solo job for her; the whole family pitched in to get it done. I went along a few times, and they even paid me for helping out – it was a fun way to make a bit of spending money! 10. Social media assistant Many businesses need help managing their social media accounts. As a social media assistant, you could create posts, respond to comments, and track likes and shares. You might also help come up with fun ideas for new content. 11. Grocery bagger Grocery bagging is a great job for 16-year-olds. Many stores hire teens this age to help customers pack their purchases. As a bagger, you’ll put items in bags or boxes at the checkout. You’ll need to pack things carefully so nothing gets squished or broken. You might also help customers take their groceries to their cars. This job lets you move around and talk to people instead of sitting all day. Some grocery stores that hire 16-year-old baggers are Publix, Kroger, and Winn-Dixie. 12. Retail store worker Working at a retail store can be a great job for 16-year-olds. Many stores hire teens to help customers and keep the shop running smoothly. Retail workers stock shelves, organize displays, or work the cash register. You could greet customers and help them find what they need or even work as a customer service representative. I got my first “real” job at the age of 16 and I worked at a clothing store. I ended up working there for around 5 years and made great friends, and I learned a lot about money! 13. Library assistant Working as a library assistant can be a great job for 16-year-olds. You’ll get to help people find books and use library resources. Your tasks might include shelving books, helping patrons check out items, and keeping the library clean. You may also help with library programs or events. 14. Paid online surveys Want to make some extra cash in your free time? Paid online surveys might be just the thing for you. Many companies want to hear what teens think about their products and services. The survey companies I recommend signing up for include: Freecash Swagbucks Most surveys take 5-30 minutes to finish. You might earn anywhere from 50 cents to $5 per survey. Some rare surveys can pay more. The best part is you can do these surveys from home on your own schedule. It’s an easy way to earn some pocket money while watching TV or during your free time. Now, I do want to say that this will not be a full-time job or even a part-time job. I have taken many surveys over the years and have been able to earn around $100 to $150 in a month, but it’s hard to make much more than that. That being said, I like how you can do them from home and at any time, which is convenient especially when you’re in school. 15. Craft seller on Etsy If you’re creative, then making things to sell can be a fun job for a 16-year-old. You can sell things like jewelry, paintings, or even homemade soap on Etsy. The best part is you can work from home and set your own hours. You need to be 18 to open an Etsy shop on your own. But if you’re 16, you can still sell with a parent’s help. They can open the shop for you and manage the money side of things. 16. Dishwasher in a restaurant Working as a dishwasher in a restaurant can be a great job for 16-year-olds, and many places hire teens for this position. Dishwashers clean dishes, pots, pans, and kitchen tools. You might use a big sink or a dishwashing machine. It’s important to keep everything clean and ready for the cooks. Some restaurants pay $10 to $15 an hour for dishwashers. The exact pay depends on where you live and work. 17. Yard work helper Yard work is a great job for 16-year-olds. You can help neighbors or local homeowners with different outdoor tasks like mowing lawns, raking leaves, and pulling weeds. You might also help with planting flowers or trimming bushes. To get started, ask your neighbors if they need help with their yards. You can also post flyers in your area or use social media to advertise your services. 18. Amusement parks Amusement parks can be fun places for 16-year-olds to work. You might find jobs operating rides, selling tickets, or working in food stands. Many parks hire teens for seasonal work during summer break, so this probably fits well with your school schedule. 19. Lifeguard Being a lifeguard can be a great job for 16-year-olds. You get to spend time at the pool or beach while keeping people safe. Many places hire teens as young as 15 or 16 for lifeguard positions. To become a lifeguard, you’ll need to get certified. This usually involves taking a course and passing a test. You’ll learn important skills like CPR and water rescue techniques. Lifeguard pay is usually higher than minimum wage. Some jobs offer $15 to $16 per hour or more. You might work at a public pool, water park, or private beach club. Many lifeguard jobs are seasonal, perfect for summer break. Some indoor pools offer year-round work too. It’s a chance to gain valuable experience and maybe even save a life. Growing up, I had many friends who were lifeguards during the summer months and it always seemed like such a fun job! 20. Camp counselor Being a camp counselor can be a fun summer job for 16-year-olds. You get to work with kids and enjoy outdoor activities. Many camps look for teens to help lead games, sports, and crafts. As a camp counselor, you might supervise campers during meals and activities. You could also help plan events and keep kids safe. Pay for camp counselors varies. Some jobs offer hourly wages, while others provide a set amount for the whole summer. You might also get free meals and housing if you work at a sleepaway camp. 21. Cashier Cashier jobs are great for 16-year-olds looking to earn money. Many stores and restaurants hire teens for these positions. As a cashier, you’ll handle money and help customers make purchases. You can find cashier jobs at places like grocery stores, fast food restaurants, and retail shops. Some popular chains that hire 16-year-olds include Zaxby’s and Burger King. Your main tasks will be ringing up items, taking payments, and giving change. You’ll also need to provide good customer service and answer questions. Some cashier jobs may involve stocking shelves or helping to keep the store clean. 22. Fast food Fast food jobs are great for 16-year-olds looking to earn money. Many chains hire teens your age for different positions, like cashier, cook, and more. Popular fast food chains that hire 16-year-olds include McDonald’s, Burger King, and Wendy’s. Chick-fil-A is also known to hire teens your age for roles like team member or kitchen staff. 23. YouTuber Being a YouTuber can be a fun job for 16-year-olds. You can make videos about topics you love (such as fashion, travel, cooking, and more) and share them with the world. Now, being a YouTuber does not mean that you’ll make money right away (or ever). You’ll need to be patient and keep making videos regularly. It takes time to grow a channel. As you get more views and subscribers, you might start earning money from ads on your videos.
