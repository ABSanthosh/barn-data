I felt the same way years ago when I was just trying to make an extra $100 a month. But over time, I learned how to build different income streams, and eventually, I started earning $30,000 a month or more. And, it completely changed my life. Many of the ideas below are things you can start on the side as extra income, grow from home, and fit into your own schedule. Some can be more passive, some are active, and some can even turn into businesses. Best Ways To Make $30,000 a Month Here are the best ways to make $30,000 a month. 1. Start a blog Blogging is one of the best decisions I’ve ever made, and yes, it helped me earn $30,000 a month and more for many years. I started Making Sense of Cents over a decade ago while paying off student loans. I didn’t expect it to become a business (I never thought I’d become a full-time blogger), but here we are! You can earn money through affiliate marketing, sponsored content, ads, your own products (like selling courses or even T-shirts), and more. What I love most is that I can create my own schedule (I work whenever I want) and it doesn’t cost a lot of money to start. In the beginning, I wrote about my budget, side hustles, and debt payoff. Over time, as my audience grew, so did my income. And, there are many different blog niches that you can write about, such as: Personal finance Health and wellness Travel Food and cooking Family and parenting Fashion and beauty And so much more. I even have a free course that shows you how to start your own blog. Over 80,000 people have taken it! You can sign up by clicking here. Quick tip: Starting a blog or online business can feel overwhelming — there’s so much to learn, and it’s hard to know where to start. That’s why I’m so excited about BC Stack. For just $49, you get 65 hand-picked courses and tools (worth over $7,400) from experts who’ve actually done what you’re trying to do — build successful online businesses. This isn’t fluff.

Create and sell online courses If people are always asking you how to do something, like budgeting, cooking, painting, or building a business, then you can turn that into a course. I’ve made over $2,000,000 from one online course I created about affiliate marketing. Courses let you help others while earning a semi-passive income. This means that once your course is created, you can sell it over and over again. Course platforms like Teachable make it easy to host and sell your course. Whether you teach people how to knit, plan meals, or start a side hustle, there’s probably an audience for it. Recommended reading: How I’ve Made Over $1,000,000 From My First Course Without a Big Launch 3. Affiliate marketing Affiliate marketing is one of my favorite income streams because it allows me to have a very flexible schedule and can be semi-passive over time. Affiliate marketing is when you earn a commission when someone purchases through your affiliate link, like something on Amazon or when they book a vacation. This can be on your blog, through an email newsletter, or on social media. I’ve personally made millions through affiliate marketing, and it’s something I recommend to bloggers, influencers, and email marketers. You can promote things like courses, financial products, clothing, home decor, apps, cooking gear, and more. Recommended reading: Affiliate Marketing Tips For Bloggers – Free eBook 4. Real estate You don’t need to own a massive real estate portfolio to get started. There are so many ways to earn money through real estate, from renting out a spare room to listing your RV on RVshare or turning your basement or attic into an Airbnb. Some people rent out their pool, driveway, or backyard for parties and events too. Others flip houses or wholesale properties. You can also become a real estate agent or invest in REITs for more income. I know many people who have had great luck with real estate and have tried all of the options above that I mentioned. If it’s something you’re interested in, I definitely recommend learning more at 23 Best Real Estate Side Hustles To Make Extra Money. Here are some books that you may be interested in reading too: The Book on Flipping Houses by J. Scott How to Invest in Real Estate by Brandon Turner and Joshua Dorkin The House Hacking Strategy: How to Use Your Home to Achieve Financial Freedom by Craig Curelop 5. Sell items on Amazon With Amazon FBA, you buy items (or source them through a manufacturer), send them to Amazon, and they handle the rest. You don’t have to pack or ship anything yourself after you send it to Amazon. Amazon takes care of all that. Some people flip clearance items from stores like Walmart and sell them for profit (also known as retail arbitrage), while others create their own product lines or white-label items. Recommended reading: How I Quit My 9-5 And Made $1.4 Million Last Year Selling On Amazon 6. Cleaning business You can run a cleaning business without doing the actual cleaning. As the owner, you find clients, schedule jobs, and hire cleaners to do the work. It’s like being the business manager behind the scenes. Many people don’t know that you can run a local cleaning business completely remotely. You don’t even have to live in the same city. With great customer service, marketing, and systems, some owners earn six figures or more each year. Recommended reading: How To Start a Remote Cleaning Business and Make $100,000+ Each Year 7. YouTube channel You don’t need a million subscribers to make money on YouTube. I personally know several creators who earn at least $30,000 a month from videos with ads, sponsorships, affiliate links, and product sales (like clothing). YouTube is great because your content can keep working for you long after you post it. One video can keep earning money for months or even years. Some popular channel ideas include personal finance, cleaning, minimalism, travel, and cooking. Recommended reading: How Much Do YouTubers Make? 8. Build a digital product empire Digital products can be sold over and over again – things like templates, printables, ebooks, planners, guides, and even stock photo memberships. I know sellers who make thousands a month from a few digital files. Once your product is created, the profit margin is very high, and you don’t need to worry about inventory or shipping. You can sell on your own site or on platforms like Etsy, Gumroad, or Shopify. This is a great way to build passive income over time. 9. Sell subscription boxes Subscription boxes can be a fun and scalable business. You send themed boxes to customers monthly or quarterly. I’ve seen people build subscription box businesses around everything from self-care and snacks to pet toys and books. I recently came across one very popular box that is geared toward crafts for toddlers, and I thought that was a great idea too! To make $30,000 a month with subscription boxes, you’ll want to think of something that people want to get regularly. After all, $30,000 in subscription boxes means that you would need at least 600 customers each month. And, that doesn’t even account for your expenses of what you will put in the box. Recommended reading: How I’ve Made Over $1,000,000 With A Subscription Box Business 10. Manage Facebook ads for small businesses Running ads is a skill that small business owners are willing to pay for. Many don’t have the time to learn it themselves, so they hire someone. You can manage ads for businesses like gyms, salons, realtors, or restaurants. Just a few clients paying $1,000 to $2,000 per month each can add up fast, and you would most likely need at least 15 clients if you want to make $30,000 a month managing ads for businesses. Recommended reading: How To Make $2,000+ a Month Running Facebook Ads For Local Businesses 11. Start a service-based business agency I know many people who’ve started solo as a freelancer and built into full agencies. Some service ideas include: Website design Graphic design Bookkeeping Marketing, such as social media marketing management Facebook ads Virtual assisting You can start by selling your services to bloggers, small businesses, or online entrepreneurs either by reaching out to them through their website or looking for jobs on Upwork or even Fiverr. Then, as your client base grows, you can hire subcontractors and grow the amount of clients you can help. 10Bookkeeper Launch CourseThis free training will teach you what you need to know to become a virtual bookkeeper and make money from home. 12. Start an ecommerce store Starting an online store can be a good way to reach a $30,000-a-month goal, and there are many successful stores that have started with the bare minimum. Some ideas for an e-commerce store include: Baby and toddler items – Swaddles, teethers, lunch boxes, and more Pet items – Cute collars, leashes, toys, and custom pet tags Personalized gifts – Like name puzzles, pet portraits, or milestone baby items Craft supplies – Yarn, paint kits, scrapbooking tools Minimalist jewelry – Dainty rings, necklaces, and earrings And more! There are so many different items that you can specialize in with an e-commerce store. 13. Doctor or surgeon Yes, becoming a doctor or surgeon takes years of training, but certain medical specialties earn $30,000+ a month. I wanted to include several high-paying careers on this list because there are many of these as well. Of course, this isn’t something you can start overnight. It takes years of schooling, training, and a lot of hard work (and long hours). But if you’re already in the medical field or thinking about going that route, it can be worth it. 14. Dentist or orthodontist Dentists and orthodontists can earn high incomes, and if you own your own practice or specialize in certain procedures (like dental implants or cosmetic dentistry), making $30,000 a month (or more) is definitely possible. This job does come with a big upfront investment, like dental school, licensing, and possibly buying into or starting your own practice. 15. Law firm partner Becoming a law firm partner can be a great way to earn a high income, and many partners bring in $30,000 a month or more, especially at larger firms. Now, this path usually takes years of experience, long hours, and a lot of hard work. But if you enjoy the legal field and stick with it, it can lead to a very high-paying and stable career. 16. Home builder or contractor If you’re handy, organized, and enjoy managing projects, becoming a home builder or contractor can be a great way to earn $30,000 a month, especially if you run your own business. Contractors can make a high income by taking on new builds, remodels, or commercial projects. You can start small by managing one or two jobs at a time and then grow into managing a team of subcontractors, multiple crews, or even flipping homes for profit. 17. Franchise owner Owning a franchise can be a great way to make $30,000 a month, and I’ve met people who’ve built very successful businesses this way. With a franchise, you’re buying into a business model that already works, like a popular food chain, fitness studio, or even a secondhand store. You get the branding, systems, and support, which can help you grow faster than starting something from scratch. Of course, you’ll need some upfront investment as franchises do require that, and the amount varies depending on the franchise. With some, you may be able to get started with less than $50,000, and others may require over $500,000 (plus monthly fees). 18. Combine multiple income streams One of the most realistic ways to make $30,000 a month is by combining many different income streams. This is how I got started and it helped me to reach $30,000 a month in income too! I earned money from several side hustles at once, including blogging, affiliate marketing, freelance writing, and VA work. Together, they added up. Here’s what a $30,000-per-month mix might look like for you: $10,000 from real estate investing $5,000 from affiliate income $5,000 from online courses $10,000 from a service business When you mix income streams, you can protect yourself from slow months in any one area. It also helps you figure out what you enjoy most, and then you can pour more time into it and grow that one even more (that is what I did). Bonus tip: Use tools to manage your growing income As you start earning more money each month, it’s important to stay on top of your finances. The more you make, the easier it can be to lose track of your spending, forget about taxes, or miss opportunities to grow your wealth. One tool I’ve been using is Boldin. It’s a smart financial planning tool that automatically organizes all your accounts — banking, investments, debt, and more – in one place. It’s designed to make financial planning easier, and can help you: Get a clear picture of your net worth Estimate your retirement income and expenses Optimize the best age to claim Social Security Model different housing decisions, like downsizing or moving somewhere different See how different investment returns affect your plan Plan for healthcare and long-term care costs Whether you’re wondering when to retire, if you can travel more, or if it’s safe to spend a little extra, Boldin can help you find the answer.
