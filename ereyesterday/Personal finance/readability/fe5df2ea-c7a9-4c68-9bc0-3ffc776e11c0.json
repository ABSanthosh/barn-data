You may not be thinking about these, but we look at them all the time when comparing the best options.Interest Rate (Or Annual Percentage Yield - APY)The interest rate (or APY) is typically the most common thing you're going to look at when shopping for a savings account. You want to find the account that pays the highest amount - right? In most cases, yes, a higher APY is always better. The higher the APY, the more interest you're going to earn on your deposits. However, if an account requires a high balance to earn the highest rate, and you can't meet that deposit level, you may want to consider another account where you can meet the requirements.How Often Rates ChangeAnother factor to consider is how often interest rates change. The simple truth is, most of the banks on our list will move pretty consistently with each other. That could be up or down, depending on the Fed Funds Rate.However, sometimes banks will change their rates because of their own needs, and that's what you want to avoid. We select banks on our list that are consistently at the top of the rate tables, so even if the rates are changing, you can typically find these banks among the best. How Consistent A Bank's Offering IsConsistency is key when it comes to rates. Rates will change, but you want to find a bank that is consistently near the top.What you don't want is a bank that offers an amazing introductory rate, then quickly drops it after 6 months. You will find that, overall, this will hurt your returns because the total annual APY will be lower than you'd get with a bank that is consistent.So, when comparing high yield savings accounts, make sure you're looking for banks that offer consistency, not promotional rates.Minimum Balance RequirementsWhen comparing savings account options, you'll quickly notice that there are banks with no minimum balance requirements, and those with high minimum balance requirements. Sometimes, to earn the highest interest rate on your savings account, you need to meet certain deposit minimums. And sometimes those minimums can be really high - upwards of $100,000! If you can't meet the minimum balance requirements or minimum opening deposit requirements to get the best APY, then you should consider an account where you can meet it. Yes, you might sacrifice a little bit of interest, but in the long run, you'll be better off!Account OptionsFinally, you'll want to look at the different account options available to you. What this means is:Does the bank offer physical branches or are they online only?How can you deposit cash?ATM access?How easy is it to get your money out of the account? Do they offer ACH or checks?How is the customer service? What are the customer service options - phone, chat, email, etc.?Do they have an online app?These features aren't necessarily as important as the interest rate and balance requirements, but depending on your needs, they can make a big difference in how happy you are with your online savings account.How Important Is A \"High-Yield\"?A lot of people don't understand the difference a high rate can make - and as such, they stay at their old bank too long (losing money in the process).The amazing thing about a savings account is that it's truly passive income. Just putting your money in a savings account earns you money - that's amazing. So you want to earn the most money possible.Right now, the FDIC reports that the average interest rate on savings accounts nationwide is just 0.45% APY.If you have $10,000 deposited, that means you'll earn $36 a year in interest.But, if you open an account at the best rate on this list, you'll be earning 5.00% APY right now. That equals $500 per year in interest. That's a big difference of $464 for simply opening an account and moving your money over. Frequently Asked Savings Account QuestionsWhat is a savings account?A savings account is a type of savings vehicle that is offered by banks, credit unions, and financial services firms (like brokerages). Savings accounts are federally insured, meaning your money is safe. These accounts also typically pay interest, more than you would earn keeping your money in other bank accounts, like a checking account. Savings accounts also typically limit how many withdrawals you can make each month, limiting their ability to be used other than for saving.How does an online savings account work?Online savings accounts work just like traditional brick and mortar bank accounts, except that everything is done online or via a mobile app. The benefit of this is that online accounts typically offer higher interest rates to savers - passing on the savings of not having a lot of branches.What makes a savings account a high yield account?The designation of a high yield savings account is for accounts that provide above average interest rates to their customers. In 2024, the top savings accounts provide over 5.00% APY, while the average interest rate is just 0.45% APY.What is the best interest rate on a savings account?The best interest rate on a savings account is over 5.00% APY, but that may be a promotional interest rate.What are the fees charged to have a savings account?The best savings account don't charge any type of monthly fees to use their account. However, some banks may charge monthly maintenance fees, unless specific balance requirements and/or deposit requirements are met.How safe is my money in a savings account?Money in a savings account is FDIC insured up to the FDIC insurance limits (typically $250,000 per person). Some banks may extend higher insurance limits on your account.What is the limit on withdrawing money from a savings account?Most savings accounts impose limits on withdrawals each month. Called Reg D, this is a federal rule that limits savings accounts withdrawals to just 6 per month. Some accounts avoid this by classifying themselves as a cash management account.Can I lose money in a savings account?In general, you cannot lose money in a savings account. As long as your balance is below the FDIC insurance limit, you cannot lose money. The exception is having money beyond the FDIC insurance limit, and the bank fails. In this rare scenario, you could lose money in a savings account.How does a savings account compare to a CD?A savings account is more liquid than a certificate of deposit, but typically provides slightly lower interest rates compared to the shortest duration CDs. With CDs, you must \"lock--up\" your money for a period of time, usually at least 3 months, but upwards of 6 years. In exchange for locking up your money, you get a higher interest rate than you would with a savings account. If you need the liquidity, then a savings account is the preferred savings vehicle.What is the average interest rate on a savings account?According to the FDIC, the average savings account pays just 0.45% APY on a savings account.How do the Fed interest rates affect savings accounts?When the Fed raises or lowers interest rates, banks adjust their savings account interest rates accordingly. In rising rate environments, banks will offer higher interest rates, and in declining rate environments, banks will lower their interest rates offered on savings accounts.What is a promotional APY?A promotional APY is the interest rate you can earn for a specific duration exchange for taking some specific action. For example, many banks offer new customers a promotional APY on their savings account for the first 6 months or one year. Then, after the promotional period, your APY will drop back down to the standard rate offered.Final ThoughtsA high yield savings account can be a great way to save your money. You typically earn higher interest rates, but there are some restrictions above and beyond what you usually find for normal savings accounts. You can compare the differences between a savings account and money market here.Just like any account, make sure you're opening the best savings account for your needs so you can reap the rewards.MethodologyThe College Investor is dedicated to helping you make informed decisions around complex financial topics like finding the best savings account.

You may not be thinking about these, but we look at them all the time when comparing the best options.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInterest Rate (Or Annual Percentage Yield - APY)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe interest rate (or APY) is typically the most common thing you\u0026#39;re going to look at when shopping for a savings account. You want to find the account that pays the highest amount - right? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn most cases, yes, a higher APY is always better. The higher the APY, the more interest you\u0026#39;re going to earn on your deposits. However, if an account requires a high balance to earn the highest rate, and you can\u0026#39;t meet that deposit level, you may want to consider another account where you can meet the requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Often Rates Change\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother factor to consider is how often interest rates change. The simple truth is, most of the banks on our list will move pretty consistently with each other. That could be up or down, depending on the \u003ca href=\"https://thecollegeinvestor.com/32609/federal-funds-rate/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFed Funds Rate\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, sometimes banks will change their rates because of their own needs, and that\u0026#39;s what you want to avoid. We select banks on our list that are consistently at the top of the rate tables, so even if the rates are changing, you can typically find these banks among the best. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Consistent A Bank\u0026#39;s Offering Is\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsistency is key when it comes to rates. Rates will change, but you want to find a bank that is consistently near the top.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat you don\u0026#39;t want is a bank that offers an amazing introductory rate, then quickly drops it after 6 months. You will find that, overall, this will hurt your returns because the total annual APY will be lower than you\u0026#39;d get with a bank that is consistent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, when comparing high yield savings accounts, make sure you\u0026#39;re looking for banks that offer consistency, not promotional rates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMinimum Balance Requirements\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen comparing savings account options, you\u0026#39;ll quickly notice that there are banks with no minimum balance requirements, and those with high minimum balance requirements. Sometimes, to earn the highest interest rate on your savings account, you need to meet certain deposit minimums. And sometimes those minimums can be really high - upwards of $100,000! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you can\u0026#39;t meet the minimum balance requirements or minimum opening deposit requirements to get the best APY, then you should consider an account where you can meet it. Yes, you might sacrifice a little bit of interest, but in the long run, you\u0026#39;ll be better off!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAccount Options\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, you\u0026#39;ll want to look at the different account options available to you.

Savings accounts are federally insured, meaning your money is safe. These accounts also typically pay interest, more than you would earn keeping your money in other bank accounts, like a checking account. Savings accounts also typically limit how many withdrawals you can make each month, limiting their ability to be used other than for saving.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eHow does an online savings account work?\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnline savings accounts work just like traditional brick and mortar bank accounts, except that everything is done online or via a mobile app. The benefit of this is that online accounts typically offer higher interest rates to savers - passing on the savings of not having a lot of branches.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eWhat makes a savings account a high yield account?\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe designation of a high yield savings account is for accounts that provide above average interest rates to their customers. In 2024, the top savings accounts provide over 5.00% APY, while the average interest rate is just \u003cspan data-attr-id=\"241\" data-extra_key=\"7\" data-option-inline=\"1\" data-shortcode=\"thrive_global_fields\" data-shortcode-name=\"[General] FDIC Savings Rate \"\u003e0.45%\u003c/span\u003e APY.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eWhat is the best interest rate on a savings account?\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe best interest rate on a savings account is over 5.00% APY, but that may be a promotional interest rate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eWhat are the fees charged to have a savings account?\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe best savings account don\u0026#39;t charge any type of monthly fees to use their account. However, some banks may charge monthly maintenance fees, unless specific balance requirements and/or deposit requirements are met.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eHow safe is my money in a savings account?\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoney in a savings account is FDIC insured up to the FDIC insurance limits (typically $250,000 per person). Some banks may extend higher insurance limits on your account.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eWhat is the limit on withdrawing money from a savings account?\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost savings accounts impose limits on withdrawals each month. Called Reg D, this is a federal rule that limits savings accounts withdrawals to just 6 per month. Some accounts avoid this by classifying themselves as a cash management account.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eCan I lose money in a savings account?\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn general, you cannot lose money in a savings account. As long as your balance is below the FDIC insurance limit, you cannot lose money. The exception is having money beyond the \u003ca href=\"https://thecollegeinvestor.com/24307/fdic-insurance-deposit-limits/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFDIC insurance limit\u003c/a\u003e, and the bank fails. In this rare scenario, you could lose money in a savings account.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eHow does a savings account compare to a CD?\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eA savings account is more liquid than a certificate of deposit, but typically provides slightly lower interest rates compared to the shortest duration CDs. With CDs, you must \u0026#34;lock--up\u0026#34; your money for a period of time, usually at least 3 months, but upwards of 6 years. In exchange for locking up your money, you get a higher interest rate than you would with a savings account. If you need the liquidity, then a savings account is the preferred savings vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eWhat is the average interest rate on a savings account?\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to the FDIC, the average savings account pays just \u003cspan data-attr-id=\"241\" data-extra_key=\"7\" data-option-inline=\"1\" data-shortcode=\"thrive_global_fields\" data-shortcode-name=\"[General] FDIC Savings Rate \"\u003e0.45%\u003c/span\u003e APY on a savings account.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eHow do the Fed interest rates affect savings accounts?\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the Fed raises or lowers interest rates, banks adjust their savings account interest rates accordingly. In rising rate environments, banks will offer higher interest rates, and in declining rate environments, banks will lower their interest rates offered on savings accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eWhat is a promotional APY?\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eA promotional APY is the interest rate you can earn for a specific duration exchange for taking some specific action. For example, many banks offer new customers a promotional APY on their savings account for the first 6 months or one year. Then, after the promotional period, your APY will drop back down to the standard rate offered.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-tag=\"h2\"\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"tab-con-16\"\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA high yield savings account can be a great way to save your money.
