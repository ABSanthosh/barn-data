It's even easier to make a little extra money on the side - especially with the rise of money-making apps!We have more than enough apps that will help you make extra money either as a side hustle or as a way of making an actual living.According to Pew Research, over almost 20% of Americans are earning money via gig economy jobs and apps.

This adds up quickly to a good chunk if you’re diligent in letting people know about the referral code.Uber has now crossed the 10-year mark since it was launched — it was launched in March 2009.
