    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",

    "description": "Wouldn’t ya know it – I slip down to Antarctica for a few weeks, and Adobe goes and releases some Lightroom updates (thanks for covering them here, Rob). Well, I’m finally back, and it was an absolutely incredible trip—just incredible! I have so much to share and so many photos yet to go through (I caught a nasty cold about halfway through the trip and didn’t get to work on my images the way I would have hoped), but I’m back in the saddle now and hope to share an Adobe Express page next week with images and stories from the trip. There were 12 Pro Instructors in the workshop, including yours truly (the workshop was produced by the great folks at Muench Workshops – absolutely top flight from beginning to end), so I got to see lots of different Lightroom and Photoshop workflows in their presentations to the workshop participants on board. It’s always so interesting to see how different these workflows can be, from ones that rely on no global adjustments whatsoever (the entire workflow is nothing but local adjustments), to workflows where 95% of the image editing is all on in the Tone Curve, so workflows that don’t use Lightroom at all. When you see these different workflows, it gives you an opportunity to consider taking one part from one workflow, one part from another, and add them to (or change them from) the workflow you’re currently using, and that’s a really cool thing. Anyway, I just wanted to touch base and let you know I’m back, and let’s catch up next week. It was a mind-blowing trip, but it’s always great to be back home. Have a great weekend, everybody. 🙂 -Scott The post I’m Back From Antarctica appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",

    "title": "February Update Lightroom Classic, Lightroom, and Camera Raw",
    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/february-update-lightroom-classic-lightroom-and-camera-raw/",
    "description": "Adobe has released an update for Lightroom Classic (14.2), Lightroom desktop (8.2), Lightroom for mobile (10.2), and Camera Raw (17.2). This update includes support for new cameras and new lenses as well as bug fixes and performance improvements. We did also get some new features, which we’ll explore below. Adaptive Profiles Originally released as a public beta in Camera Raw, a more refined version of Adaptive Profiles have now expanded to all of the Lightroom family of apps. For a very detailed explanation of Adaptive Profiles and how they work I highly recommend this article from the Camera Raw team. You can find two new profiles, Adaptive Color and Adaptive B\u0026W under the Profile drop-down menu or in the Profile Browser. All profiles are a starting point for your editing in which they affect color and tone, but don’t move any of the sliders. The difference with the Adaptive Profiles is that they are powered by machine learning and image dependent. Meaning that when you select an Adaptive Profile the AI powered model analyzes the photo (only raw photos at this time) and adjusts color and tone based on that analysis (be sure to read the article I linked previously for the nitty gritty details) to give you a different starting place than any of the pre-existing profiles. Here’s a comparison of this photo with Adobe Color profile as the Before (left) and Adpative Color as the After (right): I think the results of the Adaptive Profile is a much more vibrant, yet natural starting point for editing this photo, and notice that all of the adjusments are still zeroed out. However, the Adaptive Profiles also come with an Amount slider, which when decreased dials down the effect of the profile and when increased amplifyies the effect. These profiles will take some testing to find which photos you feel they work best on, and note that they are not (currently) designed to work in conjunction with the Auto button (it will warn you against this). Originally designed to help with HDR image editing I find they work well on standard dynamic range (SDR) photos that do have a wide range of tones (like the one above). So, give them a try and see what you think. Backup Catalog Management (LrC) We talk a lot about the importance of taking advantage of the automated backing up your LrC catalog here at Lightroom Killer Tips, but until now the managment of the removal of old backup catalog files has had to happen completely outside of LrC (in your file browser). With this update, you’ll find a new tab on the Catalog Settings dialog dedicated to catalog backup. This new Backups tab is also now home to the control for scheduling the backup frequency (previously found on the General tab). My favorite aspect of this new tab is that Adobe finally included the means for choosing the folder where your backup catalog is saved! It will still appear on the dialog that comes up when it prompts you to run the backup, but it makes so much more sense to be able to control that from here before you are prompted to actually run the backup. Thank you, Adobe for doing this! The other new feature may be a revelation to some folks, which is that it now shows you where your backup copies are stored, how big each file is, and gives you the tools to show the folder containing them in your file browser (click the Show button), delete them from the hard drive (click the Delete button), or remove them from this list without deleting from the hard drive (click the Remove button). Prior to this update, I would just periodically (when I remembered) use my file browser to navigate to the folder containing the backup copies and delete all but the most recent 3 or 4 backup copies. I may still do this out of habit, but now you can more easily see how these are filling up your drive and take control right from within LrC. Hold down the CMD key on Mac / Ctrl key on Windows to select multiple catalog files at once. Happy Spring cleaning! Focus Point Selection while Tethered Another new LrC-only feature is the ability to click anywhere in the Live view window (while tethered with a supported camera) to change the focus point. This hasn’t been officially tested on all the cameras that are supported for tethering in general, so your mileage may vary depending on your camera, but I’m sure in time it will expand to support more models. Additionally, LrC gained some performance enhancments while editing that should improve the experience when using the brush tool in masking, moving white balance sliders, and changing the angle when rotating in the Crop tool. Secondary Window in Lightroom Desktop Similar to the Secondary Window in LrC, we now have the abilty to open Secondary Window in Lr as well. This primarily useful for people with two displays, but it can also be used with a single display if you want to have a larger photo grid displayed along with the main window. If you only have a single display (as I do currently), then you need to go to the View menu to control the visibility of the Secondary Window. If you have a dual display setup, then you will see a button in the Toolbar for launching the Secondary Window. Fix Angle (Lr for mobile) If you have Quick Actions enabled in Early Access for Lr on iOS/Android, then you can play around with the new Fix Angle adjustment that quickly fixes crooked angles in photos. Remove Distracting People (Camera Raw) Speaking of Early Access/Technology Previews (different terms with same meaning), you’ll want to update the Camera Raw plugin for Photoshop to ensure all the new features in LrC are rendered correctly when sending a copy with edits to Photoshop, but there have been some new beta features added to […] The post February Update Lightroom Classic, Lightroom, and Camera Raw appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",
