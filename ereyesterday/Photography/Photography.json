    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/how-to-add-generative-expand-to-camera-raw/",
    "description": "You might have already heard from Adobe‚Äôs Photoshop update announcement on Monday, but a Beta version of Generative Expand is now available inside Photoshop‚Äôs Camera Rawr (and coming to Lightroom next, since all the stuff added to ACR also comes to Lightroom, but usually it‚Äôs Lightroom that gets the feature first, then ACR, but let‚Äôs not quibble). Anyway, it‚Äôs pretty incredible, but you WON‚ÄôT SEE THIS FEATURE until you turn this feature on first. Here‚Äôs how: STEP ONE: Launch Photoshop (after, of course, you‚Äôve downloaded the latest update which was released on Monday), and from the bottom of the Settings menu, choose ‚ÄúCamera Raw‚Äô (as shown above). STEP TWO: In the list of Camera Raw preferences that appear on the left side of the window, click on ‚ÄúTechnology Previews‚Äù to bring up the window you see here. Then, turn on the checkbox for ‚ÄúNew AI Features and Settings Panel,‚Äù as shown above. STEP THREE: Once you do that, open an image in Camera Raw and click on the Crop tool. It will now say ‚ÄúCrop \u0026 Expand‚Äù at the top of the panel, and you‚Äôll see some new features below. Turn on the checkbox for ‚ÄúEnable Expand‚Äù (as shown here), and now you‚Äôre ready to rock. In the next two steps, we‚Äôll look at how it works now that you have it turned on. STEP FOUR: with ‚ÄòEnable Expand‚Äô turned on, you can now drag the cropping border outside the edges of the image (instead of just cropping in tighter like normal). So, if you wanted to make this image wide or square (instead of tall), you could drag out the side handles (as shown here). STEP FIVE: once you have the borders where you want them, click the ‚ÄòGenerate Button‚Äô (as shown here), and it generates what it needs to fill in those empty spaces to give you the wide image you see above. You have three variations to choose from, using the Variations arrows to toggle through each to find the one that looks best. If you don‚Äôt like any of them, hit the Generate button again. And that‚Äôs all there is to it. Can‚Äôt wait until this gets added to Lightroom in an update. üôÇ Join Us For ‚ÄúThe Wildlife Photography Conference‚Äù coming in December It‚Äôs just a little over a month from now, and it‚Äôs two days, all online, and everyone‚Äôs invited to spend a few days with us learning, laughing, and making new connections.

    "description": "Well, that was fast. Adobe released a new update to Lightroom Classic today that addresses at least 3 bugs: The bulleted links above will take you to the Adobe forum page where the bug was first reported if you need more info on any of them. Likewise, if you encounter any issues when using Lightroom Classic that same Adobe forum is the place to report those problems. That team is very responsive and the forum has other members who are quite knowledgeable and provide assistance with a lot of common problems people encounter. Photoshop Missing? One issue I encountered after updating Lightroom Classic to 14.0 and Photoshop to 26.0 is that I lost the ability to send copies from LrC to Ps for editing. Photoshop was just no longer listed as an external editor, as if I didn‚Äôt have it installed. Typically this can be fixed by uninstalling and reinstalling Photoshop, so I did that, but it did not restore Ps to the LrC preferences for external editing. So, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling LrC, but that did not work either (that rarely fixes things in my experience, but it is painless so I tried it). As a last resort I reset LrC‚Äôs preferences and that actually did the trick (or maybe it was all of the above). So, if this happens to you, give that a try. However, be warned that a lot of annoying things get reset when you reset the preferences. Here‚Äôs hoping your upgrade experience is going smoothly!

    "description": "Hey gang, it‚Äôs David. It‚Äôs been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can‚Äôt honestly say that I‚Äôve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I‚Äôve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that‚Äôs been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I‚Äôm introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer‚Äôs Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It‚Äôs more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you‚Äôll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer‚Äôs Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That‚Äôs exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I‚Äôll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",
