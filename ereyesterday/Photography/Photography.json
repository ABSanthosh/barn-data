    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",

    "description": "Adobe has released the latest round of updates for Lightroom Classic (LrC) 14.3, Lightroom desktop (Lr) 8.3, Lightroom (Lr) mobile 10.3, and Camera Raw (ACR) 17.3. Head over to your Creative Cloud Application manager app, check for updates, and get your applications up to date. Along with support for new cameras and lenses, there are bug fixes and a few cool features too boot. Let’s see what new tools we have to explore. Select Landscape (LrC, Lr desktop, ACR) What I’m sure will be the most talked about new feature added LrC, Lr desktop, and ACR is a new masking function that uses AI to recognize elements in a landscape for masking and editing. Much in the same way that People masking can recognize and mask teeth, lips, and hair, the new Select Landscape function can help us mask and edit scene elements like sky, mountains, architecture, vegetation, artificial ground, natural ground, and water. Look for the Landscape option when creating a new mask to start the analysis of the image, and then you’ll be presented with checkboxes corresponding to the elements within the image it recognizes. In this photo it recognized sky, architecture, water, and natural ground. Move your cursor over each element to see the corresponding mask that will be created if you check the box. What a huge timesaver this is going to be! Check the box next to each element to create a separate mask for editing that element by ensuring the Create separate mask box is checked or create a mask that combines multiple elements depending on your image and needs. Of course you can further refine these masks by adding or subtracting with other masks. We’ll do a deeper dive on the power of landscape masks in the near future. Manage Recent Catalogs (LrC) If you’ve got old catalogs on your File \u003e Open Recent list in LrC that you don’t want to show up anymore (without deleting the catalog from your system), then check out the new Manage Recent Catalogs dialog where you can select catalogs and choose to remove them from the recent list. With a catalog selected, click Remove from Recent to clear it. Just to be sure you meant to do it, LrC will prompt you to be sure. Click OK to proceed or Cancel if you were only kidding. Checkerboard Transparent Areas (LrC, Lr) In Develop, with GPU enabled), any transparent pixels will appear with the familiar checkerboard pattern we know from Photoshop when cropping or transforming or merging to pano. Anyone Can Upload (Lr ecosystem) If you have shared albums (or synced collections from LrC that are shared) you can now enable an option for logged in users with access to upload photos of their own to the album. This could be really useful for allow family members to add photos from a recent vacation to a shared album or something similar (screenshot from Lr on the web, which is easily accessible to Lr and LrC users at lightroom.adobe.com). Lot’s of cool stuff to kick the tires on this update, and a couple of other things worth noting. The Remove Reflection function in ACR now works on non-raw files (JPG and HEIF). Also, LrC and Lr can properly render changes made in the current tech preview features (remove reflections and remove distracting people) of ACR when imported (but edits still need to happen only in ACR). In LrC, if shooting tethered, you can now turn off focus point selection in the Tethered Capture Settings window. Remember, should you encounter any issues with any of the apps to report them in the Adobe Community Forums.
