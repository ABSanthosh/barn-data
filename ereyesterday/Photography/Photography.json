    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/my-18th-annual-gonzo-holiday-photo-gear-guide-is-here/",
    "description": "Yes, my friends, it’s that time again (well, actually, it’s a little bit late this year, but let’s not dwell on that), because here it is — it’s my “18th Annual Gonzo Holiday Photo Gear Guide.” No one is more surprised than I am about that whole “18th Annual” part. When I wrote the first one, Calvin Coolidge was President, Gunsmoke was a prime-time TV show, and the Spice Girls had just released their epic Hotel California album. It was a wild time, folks. Wild time. Anyway, there is, once again, some really cool, fun, and tasty gear in this year’s guide. So, it’s time to unleash this year’s “gonzoness” upon you. Here are our three gift categories: Just remember, giving one of these gifts by itself isn’t enough. The real magic of the holidays is when you can make others feel inadequate by sharing what you got on Facebook. It’s what separates us from the animals. So, without further ado, I present to you my “18th Annual Gonzo Holiday Photo Gear Guide” and guided path to financial ruin. Important Note: Before you buy anything on this list, if you’re a KelbyOne member, don’t forget to check the Discounts page on the KelbyOne member’s site (it’s under Perks in your Dashboard). A lot of companies have offered special deals just for KelbyOne members, and there’s nothing wrong with saving a buck or two when buying these gifts. STOCKING STUFFERS: These are the perfect gifts for people you don’t really care that much about, but it would be awkward if you didn’t get them anything: Gear Labels from Field Made Co This is a really nice one because it’s easy-to-read, stick-on labels that the photographer on your gift list attaches to their lens caps so, they can easily see at a glance which lens is which in their camera bag (as seen above). This is a can’t-miss stocking stuffer. Price: $29 for a 45 sticker set. Comes in nice packaging. For Canon (link) For Nikon (link) For Sony (link) Note: They have most other lens brands, too. Think Tank Photo Battery Holder 4 I so love mine! It holds four batteries of the most commonly used size for most cameras these days, and it keeps things neat and organized (no more digging around your bag trying to find a fresh battery). I can’t tell you how simple and awesome these are. This gift is a guaranteed hit! Price: $19.75 (link) Vello BL-HS1 Low Profile Bubble Level It’s a very small, super-low-profile bubble level that slides right in their camera’s hot-shoe mount and lets them see at a glance if the camera is level. With this handy little gadget, they’ll finally stop submitting landscape images with crooked horizon lines for the monthly blind critiques episode of The Grid. But I digress. This is such a great gift at such a great price. Price: $11.99 (link) B\u0026H Photo Gift Card What could be better than a gift card to the greatest camera store in the world? Whatever the photographer on your gift list wants, they have it in stock, ready to ship. They’re the magical unicorn of camera stores. Get them a gift card from here, and they’ll follow you anywhere (which may or may not be a good thing). Price: Starting at $25 (link)  A Roll of Gaffer Tape I’ve listed this stocking stuffer many times before because it never goes out of style, and it’s better than just a “roll of tape.” It was developed in Hollywood for use in movies and TV shows because this tape does something very special: when you remove it from a wall, some equipment, your mother-in-law, etc., it doesn’t pull off paint (or skin) or leave a sticky residue. That’s why photographers love it; it’s easy to tear, easy to use, and doesn’t mess up stuff when you’re done. Price: ProTapes Pro Gaffer Tape 2″x 55 Yard Roll: $19.95 (link) My Book, The iPhone Photography Book It’s still my bestselling book for these past few years. I took the principles of taking great photos with a regular DSLR or mirrorless camera and showed you how to apply those same techniques using the camera on your iPhone. I uncover all sorts of great tricks, tips, and settings that’ll help you take images that will have people saying, “You took that with your iPhone? No way!” But oh, yes. Way. Price: $18.99 Paperback (a buck less for the eBook edition. I don’t make the eBook pricing). The Platypod Grip (for iPhone shooters) There are a lot of iPhone holders out there, but I think this one is the best bang for the buck (you can’t believe how expensive good ones like this can be). You can mount it on a regular tripod (the bottom of it fits standard Arca-Swiss type mounts), or you can mount it on the Platypod Base (which is what I do — it’s $9.95), and it’s so easy to use and so well made that this is one mount you’ll actually use. Price: $39.00 (link); Platypod Basic Plate: $9.95 (link) How to Make Money While You Are Sleeping: A Photographer’s Guide to Passive Income and Other Savvy Business Strategies by Rick Sammon Rick has written a string of bestselling books for photographers, and this is one that would make any photographer happy, because who doesn’t want passive income? Rick is a great writer and always shares such helpful information, so this would make an awesome stocking stuffer. Price: Print: $14.95; Kindle: $9.95 (link) Pocket Tripod Pro This is a little engineering miracle — it’s a tripod for your iPhone (or Android phone) that fits in your wallet. It’s about the size and shape of a credit card, but with a twist and two clicks, it transforms into a shooting platform for your phone, and well, it’s just so darn clever and super-handy. It’s also really well made. Price: $35 (link) A Couple of Spare Camera Batteries Even if they have a spare battery, every photographer would still love another one (or two). It’s one of those can’t-go-wrong stocking stuffers. For Canon EOS R5 \u0026 EOS R6 […] The post My “18th Annual Gonzo Holiday Photo Gear Guide” Is Here! appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",

    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/adobe-just-raised-prices-heres-how-to-keep-yours-from-going-up/",
    "description": "Don’t know if you’ve heard the news, but Adobe has made some price changes to their Photography Plan pricing, and I’m here today to help you navigate the new changes (and still keep paying the old price. What? Yup – I’ll show you how).  I put together a quick Q\u0026A to explain the new pricing: Q. Did Adobe increase the price for the photography bundle (the one with Lightroom and Photoshop, which has always been around $9.99 a month)? A. Yes, but the price increase only applies to two groups:  (1) People who pay monthly (but I’ll explain a way around the price increase) (2) New users who are not already on the photography plan (but there’s a way around that, too, as I’ll explain in a moment). Q. But I don’t want to pay more.A. Then switch to an annual plan, paid upfront, and you won’t have to. Q. So, are you saying if I pay for my existing yearly plan upfront (rather than monthly), my price doesn’t go up? A. That’s what I’m saying.  Q. Are you sure?A. That’s straight from Adobe. Here’s a link to their blog post explaining the new pricing and the affected plans.  Q. Did all photography plans increase in price? A. The price of the Photography plan that includes Lr \u0026 Ps with 1TB of cloud storage didn’t change. Q. So, let me get this straight – I pay upfront for the year at the old price ($119.88 here in the US), and I don’t have to pay the higher price?A. That is correct.  Q. What if I’m not subscribed to the Photography Plan? What will my price be next year?A. If you sign up before January 15, 2025, you can lock in the old rate (which works out to $9.99 per month), but again – you have to pay the $119.88 upfront to get that rate.  Q. What if I miss the January 15th deadline? Will I have to pay $14.99 a month? A. Don’t miss that deadline, or it gets worse. For photographers who sign up after January 15th, it’s $19.99 a month, but at least it includes one terabyte of cloud storage space, so there’s that.  Q. So, what would you recommend?A. If I were you, I would pay $119.99 upfront to keep your photography plan the same as it always was—you do that, and really, nothing changes for you. If you’re one of those folks who never subscribed, I would definitely sign up before January 15th. Otherwise, you’ll be paying $19.99 a month if you decide to subscribe later. Q. What about the plan that’s just Lightroom ‘Cloud’ (as I call it) with one terabyte of storage? Does that monthly subscription increase? A. Yes – it goes from $9.99 a month to $11.99 a month unless you switch it to the yearly plan and pay the year upfront; then your price stays the same – no increase.  Well, there ya have it – that’s the price increase (and how to avoid it) in a nutshell. If you have any questions, pop ‘em in the comments.  Have a great holiday season Monday, everybody! -Scott P.S. Here’s a link to a pricing FAQ Adobe put together that’s very helpful.

    "link": "http://strobist.blogspot.com/2024/06/ive-been-working-on-something.html",
    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",
