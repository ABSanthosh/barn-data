    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",

    "description": "Morning, everybody! I get this question on a pretty regular basis, so I thought I’d cover it here today, and that question is… Let’s cover the round-trip experience for a typical thing you might need to jump to Photoshop for (in other words, to do something Lightroom can’t do). Here we go: STEP ONE: Here’s our image in Lightroom, and the problem I want to address is the fact that the jet is too close to the edge of the frame on the right side (compositionally, you want to leave some breathing room – some space for the jet to “move into,” on the right and unfortunately, that extra space is behind the jet on the left, instead of in front of it to the right. Time to head over to Photoshop. STEP TWO: Press Command-E on Mac, or Ctrl-E on a Windows PC, and if you shot in RAW, your image will just appear over in Photoshop (it loans Photoshop a copy of your image). If you shot in JPEG mode, the dialog box you see above will appear, asking you how you want this image to go over to Photoshop. I pretty much always choose the top choice: “Edit a Copy with Lightroom Adjustments.” That way (1) It makes a copy of my image, so my original JPEG is protected; (2) It keeps any changes or edits I made in Lightroom intact as it moves over to Photoshop. Again, you will only see this window if you shoot in JPEG mode on your camera. STEP THREE: Once your image is over in Photoshop, go to the toolbar and click on the Crop tool. Now go up to the Options bar up top, and where it says “Fill” choose “Generative Expand” from the pop-up menu (as seen here) so we can use the Crop Tool to automatically add the extra space we need. STEP FOUR: Take the Crop tool, pull in the left side, and extend the right side out into the gray canvas area that surrounds your image (as seen above). STEP FIVE: Hit the return key, and the Crop Tool’s Generative AI will fill in the missing sky in front of the jet (and the extra space behind the jet will be cropped off, as seen above). STEP SIX: To get your ‘Edited in Photoshop’ image back to Lightroom is actually super simple: just Save the image (Command-S on Mac / Ctrl-S on PC), and close it. That’s it — save and close. STEP SEVEN: Once you do that, your edited image appears back in Lightroom alongside your original (that’s the edited and cropped version on the left and the original one that’s too close to the right edge on the right. Hope you found that helpful. Have a kick butt-Monday, and a very safe, happy, healthy Thanksgiving! -Scott The post How to Take an Image From Lightroom to Photoshop and Back appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",

    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/why-i-dont-convert-my-raw-images-to-dng-2/",
    "description": "A couple of weeks ago, one of the participants at my Las Vegas workshop asked me about this, and when it did, it kind of made me do a double-take because it’s been so long since I’ve been asked this question. Fewer and fewer of my colleagues are still converting to DNG, so it really tossed me for a loop. Today, we’re going to look at why I don’t do it, but I’m also going to share someone else’s reasons as well. I’m going to try and keep this as short and sweet as possible, but it’s important to note up front — I’m not telling you-you shouldn’t be converting your RAW files to the DNG format — I’m just telling you I’m not, and I stopped doing it a while back. Here’s why: Converting to DNG in Lightroom takes time, I don’t get much benefit back from taking that extra time and so for me and my workflow, it just doesn’t make sense. None of the big three camera makers adopted the DNG format. Only a handful of smaller companies did, so it never really caught on like it would have if they had all gotten on board. I don’t share files with other users where I need to keep my RAW edits intact when sharing the original RAW file with another user (see this article), so combining the XMP file and the RAW original into one single file isn’t a benefit to me (I don’t work with XMP files that often to begin with). Plus, if I did convert to DNG for that reason, it takes longer to re-save the entire DNG file over again each time you make a change than it is to just save changes to an XMP text file, which happens very quickly in comparison. It’s that wasting time thing again. Am I concerned that one day I won’t be able to open my existing native RAW files created by the camera companies? Not at all. At the time Adobe created the DNG spec, it was probably a legit concern, but these days a 12-year-old could probably write a RAW converter during study hall, so I don’t sweat it. I know there are still a handful of other pros of using DNG, but there are just as many cons. Maybe more. I’m happy with where I’m at —  working faster, not wasting time on import converting to DNG, and I still sleep well at night. Something to think about, anyway. 🙂 Hope you have a great weekend, and we’ll catch you next week-Scott NOTE: A few years back, one of my readers, Reid J. Thaler, did a really informative write up on why he doesn’t use DNG, and he posted it as a comment here on the blog. Here’s what he wrote: FROM REID J. THALER: I teach Lightroom, and a few years ago, I put together my own David Letterman style of “The Top Ten Reasons Not to Convert Your Images to DNG Files.” Thank you, Reid. You said it better than I could. 🙂 Have a great weekend, everybody!-Scott P.S. Our KelbyOne Black Friday/Cyber Monday “Best deal ever” is kicking off now, and I think it’s the best deal we’ve ever offered on a KelbyOne Pro membership. It includes my full-day Lightroom Live! Seminar, filmed earlier this year in front of a live audience – it’s five in-depth Lightroom classes. We started at 10 am and ran until after 5 pm, so it’s a lot of training. (We did take a break every hour, and we broke for lunch, too). Anyway, you get my full-day seminar and so much more. It’s a pretty insane deal.
